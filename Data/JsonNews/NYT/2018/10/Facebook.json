{"Headline": "The High Court Brought Low", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "OpinionDon\u2019t let Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh have the last word about American justice.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.So what now? Credible accusations of sexual assault, lies told under oath, explicitly partisan attacks on the senators trying to assess his fitness to serve: None of it was enough to give Republican leaders more than momentary pause in their campaign to seize decisive control of the Supreme Court. Depending on your politics, you might pick one starting point or another for the nastiness of the modern battles between the parties over individual court seats. But it was Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who openly established partisan control of the court itself as the stakes in the struggle. He refused to allow Barack Obama to fill a vacancy for almost a year, holding the seat open to draw evangelical voters to the polls and elect a Republican president. That was a clever gambit, though it had the downside of risking the credibility of the American legal system. The bet has now paid off, and the risk has been realized.The president whom Mr. McConnell helped elect turned out to be Donald J. Trump. And while Mr. Trump had plenty of qualified, highly conservative lawyers to pick among, he chose to insist on Judge Kavanaugh. The result was a confirmation process, and now almost certainly a justice, tainted by dishonesty, shamelessness, self-pity, indifference to women\u2019s fears and calculated divisiveness \u2014 the hallmarks, in other words, of Mr. Trump\u2019s politics. Having first sickened the White House and then Congress, the virus of Trumpism is about to spread to the Supreme Court itself.The Court has had a majority of Republican-appointed justices for nearly half a century, of course, and its credibility has endured, despite controversial decisions like Bush v. Gore, which handed the White House to a Republican president. But the elevation of Judge Kavanaugh represents something new. The nation is now facing the possibility of three or four decades with a justice credibly accused of sexual assault, one who may well be the deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, or at least make it so hard for a woman to exercise her constitutional right to make her own medical decisions that the ruling is effectively nullified. Thirty to 40 years with a justice whose honesty was tested and found wanting. A justice so injudicious in his manner that thousands of law professors, and a retired Supreme Court justice, opposed his confirmation. A judge is supposed to set personal feelings aside and approach even the most sensitive and emotional matters with a cool disposition and an open mind; Judge Kavanaugh revealed to the country that he was incapable of that. In saner times, such behavior from a nominee would have sent reasonable Republicans running for the exits. But in the end, only Lisa Murkowski of Alaska had the courage of her convictions. She can go home knowing that she did the right thing.The task of plugging the holes and patching the rents in the court\u2019s legitimacy now falls to the justices themselves, mainly to Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. He must know that every decision of political significance rendered by a 5-to-4 majority that includes a Justice Kavanaugh will, at the very least, appear to be the product of bias and vengeance. If he cares about the integrity of the court as much as he claims to, the chief will do everything in his power to steer the court away from cases, and rulings, that could deepen the nation\u2019s political divide. There\u2019s work the rest of us can do as well. We can, for one thing, find ways in our own workplaces and communities to assure victims of sexual assault that they will be respected if they come forward, even if so many national political figures are dismissive of them.And if we disapprove of the direction of the courts, we can put the lessons Mitch McConnell taught us to work \u2014 and vote. Most Americans are not where this Senate majority is. They do not support President Trump. They do not approve of relentless partisanship and disregard for the integrity of democratic institutions. And they have the power to call their government to account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Campaign Doubles Spending Rate as the 2020 Race Draws Nearer", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s campaign more than doubled its spending over the past three months as the president worked to rev up the Republican base ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections through a series of rallies and online appeals.The increased spending \u2014 much of which was done through an opaque new corporate entity set up by the campaign \u2014 was reflected in filings that the campaign\u2019s committees were set to submit on Monday evening to the Federal Election Commission.The filings showed that the campaign spent a total of $7.7 million from the beginning of July and to end of September \u2014 more than twice the $3.6 million spent in the preceding three months \u2014 according to a preview of the filings provided to The New York Times.The campaign and two joint committees it formed with the Republican National Committee raised a total of more than $18 million in the last quarter, a slight increase over the preceding quarter.The committees ended the quarter with nearly $35.5 million in the bank. That is down significantly from the $54 million they had at the beginning of the quarter, but it will still give Mr. Trump a substantial head start over any of the prospective Democratic rivals expected to start campaigns after the midterms.The increase in spending has paid for an investment in the type of campaign staffing and digital operation that Mr. Trump largely eschewed early in his 2016 campaign, but that his Democratic rivals will have to scramble to build to take him on in 2020.The largest recipient of Trump campaign funds was a company called American Made Media Consultants, which was created by the campaign to purchase digital, radio and television advertising, including online fund-raising solicitations.The company, which is controlled by Trump campaign officials, was set up this year in consultation with its law firm, Jones Day. It is not intended to turn a profit, but rather to save the campaign money by acting as a clearinghouse for spending that would otherwise be done by outside vendors who typically take commissions on such purchases.Monday\u2019s report showed 19 payments to American Made Media Consultants totaling $1.6 million.The setup is also intended to reduce the amount of spending done through the companies of the campaign manager, Brad Parscale. His firms were paid nearly $88 million by the campaign in 2016, when he served as digital director and drew grumbles of self-dealing, though most of that money most likely was passed through to Facebook and other platforms for ads.Mr. Parscale\u2019s company was still paid $564,000 in Monday\u2019s report, which Mr. Parscale said was mostly for salaries and overhead for company staff members who are working on the Trump campaign.The campaign also paid $173,000 to Mintz Levin, a law firm that has helped Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, handle inquiries related to the Russia investigations.And the campaign paid $604,000 to Ace Specialties, a Louisiana company that manufactures much of the Trump campaign\u2019s merchandise, including its distinctive red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats.Advertisement"}

Mr. Leitch is a Cardinals fan but has nothing against the Red Sox.How confused my young son would be by any piece of New England-based popular culture on the Red Sox produced before 2004, which was steeped in misery, torture, pain and suffering. (I\u2019m pretty sure Misery, Torture, Pain and Suffering made up the Red Sox infield for most of the 1970s.) Their joy lasted roughly nine months, until the Red Sox lost the American League East to the Yankees (again) and were swept out of the playoffs by the White Sox. The Red Sox won another World Series in 2007 \u2026 and by 2011, they\u2019d so completely run down general manager Theo Epstein, the man who had built the title winners, that he left town to join the Chicago Cubs (he would help them break their own World Series curse in 2016.)There\u2019s an old George Carlin joke about what doing cocaine makes you feel like: \u201cIt makes you feel like doing more cocaine.\u201d No fan base has exemplified how cheering for sports teams is a constant, fruitless search for a better, ever elusive high than Boston sports fans. Go find your closest friend who cheers for Boston teams. Does that person look happy to you? Compare this with Cubs fans, who still seem to be walking around in a narcotized happy daze two years after their championship. Red Sox fans have had no such grace period.Boston fan anger has been the beating pulse behind some of the ugliest, often dumbest stories in sports, from Deflategate to Spygate to Barstool Sports to anytime Ben Affleck shows up at a game. In a just world, Boston sports fans would be sitting in a corner, drooling in a state of constant euphoria, overdosing on the drug of championships that every other city\u2019s fan base dreams about. But if anything, all these championships have made Boston fans more insular, more protective of their particular fief. When all the conflicts have been won, when you have been the victor of You vs. Yankees, You vs. Goodell, You vs. Lakers, all that is left is You vs. World. It is an opponent, I\u2019ve found, Boston fans have gleefully signed up to battle.That may be true \u2014 though fans in Cleveland, Buffalo and Atlanta might have something to say about this \u2014 but that the historical balance sheet might have been leveled long before now doesn\u2019t seem to occur to most Boston sports fans. They have been given, and given, and given, and they still want more.But that is sort of this moment in America, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve become a country of Boston sports fans. Squint, and Red Sox fans start to look a lot like baby boomers, gifted, over the past two decades, with as glorious and bountiful a harvest as any generation has ever been but unable to overcome past slights enough to concede an inch to time, history or any sort of equality for anyone who is not them. They\u2019ve pulled up the ladder behind them, and they will give up what they see to be rightfully theirs, earned through blood, sweat and Bucky Dent, over their dead bodies \u2014 and beyond that, if possible. They will take and take and take, because you don\u2019t know their struggle, and even though they don\u2019t know yours, trust them: Theirs was worse. Boston fans have all the power, and all the success, and all their glory, and they are madder than ever.

According to a new scientific report, dinosaurs also invented \u2014 or, if you want to get technical, first evolved \u2014 eggs of different colors. Birds did not evolve their egg colors on their own, but inherited the ability from non-avian dinosaurs. \u201cWe can fingerprint the pigments,\u201d Ms. Wiemann said. Darla Zelenitsky, a dinosaur paleontologist at the University of Calgary, said the combination of new technology and the method that Ms. Wiemann and Dr. Norell worked on allowed them to show \u201cthat there was a single evolutionary origin of egg color.\u201dAnd, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s an example of another feature that was really thought to be exclusive among birds.\u201dThe dinosaurs with egg color were species that kept their eggs in exposed nests: animals like Deinonychus and some Troodontids, active predators that may have laid nests in small groups but not in vast nesting grounds like some of the duck-billed dinosaurs.Fossil eggshells from duckbills and other dinosaurs that covered their eggs with mud had no pigment. The eggshells with pigment showed speckled patterns as well, and in modern birds there is some evidence that such patterns help birds distinguish their own eggs, particularly from so-called nest parasites, like the cuckoo, that lay eggs in other birds\u2019 nests.There\u2019s more work to be done to see how far back egg color can be traced among dinosaurs. And the presence of speckling raises the possibility that there may have been nest parasites long before the appearance of birds \u2014 the cuckoo dinosaur.     Advertisement"}

Criminal cases are notoriously difficult to bring, and civil rights laws are filled with loopholes. Many states are changing and expanding their laws, searching for a better solution.Advocates say that while the laws are still lacking, and do not yet cover the country, this is remarkable progress. We compiled a list of notable highlights from the past year.\u201cAll of the H.R. profession has had to engage in some serious introspection,\u201d said Johnny C.

Companies have seen that they, too, need to make changes.Beyond the entertainment industry, low-wage workers are seeing some changes, too. Buoyed by the momentum of the #MeToo movement and building on years of independent organizing, activists have successfully raised the \u201ctipped minimum wage\u201d, the pay that servers and bartenders are paid before tips, in some places, and won safer conditions for hotel and domestic workers. The continued momentum is palpable: Last month, workers across the country protested sexual harassment at McDonald\u2019s by going on strike for a day.Perhaps more than any new policy or law, the past year has been defined by a parade of once-powerful men resigning or being fired for sexual misconduct.

Had you, we asked, ever behaved toward girls or women in ways you now regret?By Monday morning, we had more than 750 responses.Not all of them were from men recounting past experiences of committing or witnessing sexual assault. Some told us that they\u2019d always conducted themselves respectfully: \u201cWe knew VERY well what was appropriate and not appropriate,\u201d one wrote. \u201cForcing women to do anything was not only illegal, it was grotesque.\u201d A number of men told of being too terrified of girls to have done anything of the sort. A number of women said they were frustrated to see that we were once again seeking to view the world from a male perspective.But a remarkable number of stories poured in from men about past misbehavior. The stories covered a wide spectrum of sexual misconduct, some of it deeply disturbing: There were multiple submissions that discussed participating in gang rapes. In others, men looked back and thought differently on activities that might be considered the everyday realm of high school boys: \u201cI would walk up to girls in my school and undo their bras. I thought it was funny but they thought it was horrible,\u201d one wrote. \u201cI felt like I had a right to touch them or undo their bras as a joke and honestly thought it was O.K.\u201d Above all, the submissions were striking for their candor: They were, or at least seemed to be, submitted by men genuinely questioning why they had once conducted themselves in ways of which they now felt ashamed.We had to leave out many compelling submissions, because The Times decided we would not publish these stories anonymously. And so, many of the same men who submitted searching accounts of who they once were declined to attach their names. \u201cAs much as I want to see this conversation move our country forward, I cannot lose my employment. I cannot lose my reputation,\u201d one said. Most of the people willing to be on the record were either of retirement age or close to it.Below are the stories of men who chose to share. Some of them anguished over whether to do so. Those who chose to share often said they felt they could contribute something important.\u201cIt required some agony to say yes, but I have tried to live as honestly as I am able to do,\u201d wrote Arthur J. Slavin. \u201cWe all need to help this discussion go forward.\u201dHow old were you when you had this experience? 15What\u2019s your name?PatrickHerronWhat year did you graduate high school?197015What\u2019s your name?\u00a0PatrickHerronWhat year did you graduate high school?1970\u00a0What\u2019syour name?\u00a0PatrickHerronWhat year did you graduate high school?1970How old were you when you had this experience?15When I look back at being a 15-year-old, in 1966-67, it just felt like an anything-goes kind of environment. I remember being unsupervised, hanging out with neighborhood boys who had cars, which allowed us the freedom to go anywhere after school while our parents worked. Marijuana was just becoming something teens were using. I have often thought about this event, but compared to the culture that prevailed in the 1970s, it seemed almost quaint. I know that sounds horrible. But what stayed with me about this was somehow both the innocence of youth and the giddy power I felt over this girl.She never told her parents about this, but later one of the guys tried to climb in her window when her parents were out, and that became a disciplinary issue. No law enforcement ever became involved. We met again last year at a funeral for a mutual high school friend, and she was very cordial, albeit brief. I did not offer an apology because the circumstances of the interaction were public, with other classmates and family around us. As I drove away it occurred to me how embarrassed I felt meeting her again, and I wondered how she viewed me as an adult now.On one such occasion, I took advantage of the evening darkness and the jumble of bodies to grope the breast of a girl to whom I was attracted and in whose presence I felt intimidated, because of her beauty, intellect, and grace. It was a spontaneous, unpremeditated act \u2014 too public for me to have derived any sexual pleasure from it; too meaningful, because of who she was, for me to have targeted someone else. I think I did it because she seemed otherwise out of reach for me; perhaps such one-sided contact was all the intimacy I could ever hope to enjoy with her. And yet, with so many elbows, knees, hands, and feet flying about, I also recall making an instantaneous calculation: Maybe I can get away with this.I don\u2019t know whether she ever knew who groped her, but she immediately extricated herself from the pile, clearly upset, and promptly left without saying a word. I have never forgotten the look on her face: she seemed at once hurt, disappointed, indignant, and bewildered. Seeing her expression, I was seized with remorse for what I\u2019d done, although I had not the courage to confess and apologize, then or later.  But I was so ashamed that I\u2019ve never done anything of the kind since then. I can imagine that in the early 1970s, my male friends (and perhaps men generally) would have regarded my action as relatively harmless, against the broad spectrum of sexual misconduct. For my own part, I knew that what I was doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t realize how wrong it was until I saw the young woman\u2019s reaction, and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since.Two years later, I was on the receiving end of an unwelcome sexual advance when an older man with whom I worked invited me to his apartment for lunch.  I agreed, innocently enough, but when I saw that he had prepared a meal only for me, I quickly realized that I was to be his lunch.  As his advances became more and more aggressive, I froze \u2014 couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak \u2014 until he unzipped my fly, took my penis in his hand, and pulled it into his mouth. The shock of that sensation in that situation stimulated a fight-or-flight response, and I bolted for the door. I quit my job that afternoon so that I would never again encounter that man. I went home, showered, and tearfully called a close female friend. But on that day I think I may have experienced at least some of the same emotions I saw on the face of the young woman I had groped; I felt violated, unclean, and disappointed that someone with whom I had previously been friendly turned out to value me only as an object of his desire.How old were you when you had this experience?

I appeared for the first time at the front door of her home one evening to pick her up for what was to be our first ever date. \u2018P\u2019 was a shy pretty girl who I had only seen occasionally in the school hallways, and when I asked her out to go to a movie it surprised me as much as it did her.  She was gentle and quiet and not one of the so-called popular girls. I was a \u201cFonzi\u201d type, and I had a car at a time when few of the guys did.When we left her house and walked toward my car she saw that it was not just going to be the two of us; my buddy Raul was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. P got in but I could tell she was disappointed. She hardly knew me and she had never met Raul, so driving away into the darkness had to be intimidating for her.My memory of all the details surrounding that night is faulty but I do remember being huddled up next to her in the back seat while we parked on a darkened street with no street lights. We never got around to the movie or anything else considered standard date protocol. My friend was a quiet guy who stayed in the front seat and said little and made no moves that might have made her feel threatened \u2014 but his presence alone was intimidating enough.I don\u2019t know exactly what I said, but I know I was making direct comments about the sexual possibilities to be conducted there and then, in the back of the car. I wasn\u2019t drinking that night and I was totally in control of what I was saying, but I seem to remember that I kind of felt that I was on a roll.The dialogue coming out of my mouth was just that \u2014 dialogue.  I was doing my best Richard Widmark: speaking a quiet voice of evil designs. I didn\u2019t have intentions that went further than that. But at some point, P\u2019s fear had become palpable, and my friend had had enough. He admonished me, and asked me to stop. P was, by this time, very frightened \u2014 and why not! Sitting in a car with two guys in an unfamiliar neighborhood with nobody around, one of them blabbering away about having sex with her. She was probably wondering if she was going to be raped and how she was going to get home.When we drove her home she opened the door and shot out, running up the walk to her front door. Raul looked at me and said, \u201cLee, you are such an asshole sometimes.\u201dI know, honestly, in my heart of hearts, that I never really intended to carry out any of this. But she didn\u2019t know this, and so the damage was done. I wish I could have apologized to her but circumstances prevented that because I left Denver for 25 years. I dropped out of high school after what happened; the story of that night ended up more or less being a case of the last straw. My history in high school had not been successful and it wasn\u2019t going to get better after the student body got wind of my behavior, so I cleared out my locker and never looked back.I believe I have lived an exemplary life since that era, but during my teenage years, I did some nasty things. They got me into trouble with the law, which resulted in my joining the U.S. Navy just to avoid the slammer. My point is that I believe it is entirely possible for people to mature and be good citizens and to leave behind youthful bad behavior. But to do so requires admitting to wrongdoing. If I were to see her today, I would apologize sincerely with no excuses.One night, I urgently tried to convince her to give me oral sex. She did not want this. I did not coerce her physically, but I urged her to do something she rejected, and I played on our emotional entanglement until she did. This was wrong, harmful to her, and I knew it. I have thought about that night ever since, repelled by my behavior toward a young woman I cared for.I knew it was wrong then, ethically and morally, and I apologized the next day.How old were you when you had this experience? 19-20What\u2019s your name?Fanon FrazierWhat year did you graduate high school?199719-20What\u2019s your name?\u00a0Fanon FrazierWhat year did you graduate high school?1997\u00a0What\u2019s your name?\u00a0Fanon FrazierHow old were you when you had this experience?What year did you graduate high school?1997One night, we visited a young woman\u2019s apartment \u2014 I knew her in passing. We got there, she let us inside. Her girlfriend was there. I either grew aware, or remembered \u2014 I\u2019m not sure which \u2014 that she had a reputation as being \u201cdown,\u201d meaning down for a good time.She was consistently standoffish, but they continued to lead her into the dark pantry. She did not want to go. I stood outside with the victim\u2019s friend; we were silent, eyes down. I was frozen.  Frozen together, I now realize. The girlfriend must have felt I was keeping watch; and though I was not, I was complicit because my party must have also thought the same.It\u2019s difficult to say why I failed to intervene, but not from social ostracism. I was and am definitely ashamed of what was happening around me, but this was not why I froze. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was experiencing, but I knew exactly what was happening and that the atmosphere overwhelmed everything. My party was so nonchalant \u2014 whether because they\u2019d done this before or just heard about it from others, I\u2019m not sure.I don\u2019t actually know what happened to her in the pantry. I\u2019ve always blocked it out until now, relieved she got out before unwanted sex. (That, I do feel sure about \u2014 when they left, no one\u2019s clothes looked disheveled.) If that point were reached, heard or felt where we stood, I cannot say what the girlfriend or I might have done. I never talked about it afterwards. I felt it was something bigger than me that I couldn\u2019t control, and that I didn\u2019t have a place in reprimanding them.Would I be frozen in that situation again? Definitely not \u2014  if it happened today, I would intervene.When I was 21, a woman I worked with asked me to take her daughter to her senior prom. Her daughter had a reputation for being \u201ceasy.\u201d I went to the prom with her daughter and remember trying to put my hand up her skirt in the back of the limo. I don\u2019t even think we were kissing. She protested, and I persisted. She was very uncomfortable and somewhat distraught. I\u2019m sure I was somewhat high or drunk. I felt guilty when I saw her mom at work that next week and felt her mom knew something had happened. I felt I had ruined the prom for this young woman. And I felt sad I had done that. It still haunts me a bit. This reader call-out prompted me to search for this woman on Facebook, with the intent of messaging her and apologizing. I was not able to find her in my initial search, but I will try to search more extensively.I came out as gay two years later, so a lot has changed for me! I do wonder if part of my persisting with this young woman was to prove something to myself? I was not particularly attracted to her \u2014 she was not unattractive at all, but there was definitely no strong sexual chemistry. Then again, I was generally not sexually attracted to women, which is one of the realizations that prompted me to come out two years later. I think \u201cconquering\u201d her sexually was something I expected I needed to do. Especially on prom night, especially in the back of a limo \u2014  isn\u2019t that a scene from many teen movies?  (Except in those it\u2019s usually mutual.)  It did not come out of desire.How old were you when you had this experience?What\u2019s your name?Max MaplesWhat year did you  graduate high school?2005How old were you when you had this experience?What\u2019s your name?MaxMaplesWhat year did you graduate high school?2005What\u2019s your name?MaxMaplesHow old were you when you had this experience?What year did you graduate high school?2005We\u2019d driven out to the tennis courts to play tennis, which I think we did for about 20 minutes. It was the only time we ever played tennis together, and somehow we wound up back in the car and I pressured her for oral sex. I don\u2019t believe she voiced any explicit dissent, but I had to cajole to get what I wanted. I clearly remember saying something to the effect of \u201cPlease, could you do that one thing again.\u201d The whole thing seems very unsexy in my memory.Of course, no man or teenager should behave that way, but I don\u2019t think that event stuck out in my mind until recently, when so many women went public with the trauma they had experienced. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that she may have felt violated or pressured or afraid because of my lack of self-control. (I reached out to my high school girlfriend to make sure she was okay with me telling this story, and interestingly, she didn\u2019t even remember the incident in question. I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t leave a negative mark on her, but I do know girls who have felt assaulted in that same situation.)But my most vivid recollection is of kissing Diane in the back seat of a car on a double date and her just sitting there frozen. She obviously didn\u2019t even want to kiss. I tried again and again. She didn\u2019t say no or stop. She just sat there.To this day, I think of that experience with shame and regret. Those feelings come over me at unexpected times. And I\u2019m nearly 82 years old now. I should have stopped. And I\u2019m sure I should have apologized. I did neither. I\u2019m sorry, Diane.Illustrations created from portraits submitted by the writersAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if the Republicans Win Everything Again?", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTotal victory for the G.O.P. would mean Trump unleashed.Opinion ColumnistThe end of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The loss of health insurance for several million people. New laws that make it harder to vote. More tax cuts for the rich. More damage to the environment. A Republican Party molded even more in the image of President Trump.These are among the plausible consequences if the Republicans sweep the midterm elections and keep control of both the House and Senate. And don\u2019t fool yourself. That outcome, although not the most likely one, remains possible. The last couple of weeks of polling have shown how it could happen.No matter what, Democrats will probably win the popular vote in the House elections, for the first time since 2012. Trump, after all, remains unpopular. But the combination of gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic voters in major cities means that a popular-vote win won\u2019t automatically translate into a House majority.If Republicans do manage to keep both chambers of Congress, it would cause a political shock. So far, much of the speculation has focused on what a Democratic House takeover might mean \u2014 attempts to rein in Trump\u2019s executive actions, subpoenas, investigations, maybe even impeachment. But it\u2019s important to understand that a Republican victory would also change Washington.That\u2019s why I spent a good portion of this past week doing reporting about what two more years of unified Republican rule might look like. The following preview is based on those conversations.For today\u2019s congressional Republicans, the election will be a measure of how worried they need to be about Trump and Russia. As Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution says, the midterms \u201care the last best hope for Republicans in Congress to grow a backbone.\u201d A Democratic takeover may make congressional Republicans less willing to make excuses for Trump. A Republican victory would suggest that the party does not need to be very scared about the politics of Russia.Yes, Mueller \u2014 the special counsel overseeing the investigation \u2014 could change that by issuing an explosive report after the election. But a midterm victory could also give Trump the confidence to shut down the investigation, through firing some combination of Mueller, Rod Rosenstein (who oversees Mueller) and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. In their place, he could install loyalists unconcerned with the quaint notion that no one is above the law. An expanded Senate majority could ease the confirmation of those loyalists.Now imagine if the party nonetheless won the midterms. \u201cThey will have learned a very specific lesson,\u201d Jacob Leibenluft of the liberal Center for American Progress said. \u201cThey can get away with lying about what their actual policy is.\u201dThere is every reason to believe Republicans would then try to cut health care funding more deeply. People in Republican circles told me that they did not anticipate a new attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI would expect them to make some kind of run on health care again,\u201d Ryan Streeter of the conservative American Enterprise Institute said, \u201cbut I would be surprised if they tried for full repeal.\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum called repeal \u201ca political rallying cry\u201d and \u201cnot a legislative agenda.\u201d\u201cWe should always assume that as soon as they have the votes, they will repeal the rest of the A.C.A.,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under Obama. Even if they don\u2019t, Slavitt added, they will probably make other cuts. Medicaid \u2014 which serves the poor, working class, disabled and elderly \u2014 is a likely target.The goal would be as obvious as it is nefarious: Keep Republicans in power, even when they lack the support of most Americans.The list here is clearly speculative, and not comprehensive. A Republican sweep would also ease the confirmation of federal judges, and it might encourage still harsher treatment of immigrants. Beyond any specific piece of legislation, though, a Republican victory would send a message. It would be an endorsement (albeit a flawed one, probably based on a popular-vote loss) of Trump\u2019s vision for America.By now, no one should have any illusions about how Trump will behave if he faces no restraints.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Storm Charges North, Leaving Destruction in Florida", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPANAMA CITY, Fla. \u2014 Hurricane Michael charged through Florida and into Georgia on Wednesday, lashing the Panhandle with rains and heavy winds. Water raced in from the sea, flooding the streets and leaving at least one person dead.The storm whipsawed trees, blew away large chunks of fencing and bent stop signs almost parallel to the ground. Videos posted to social media showed a tapestry of damage near a marina in Mexico Beach: waterlogged homes, flying debris, splintered wood. But it was impossible to gauge the full extent of the carnage because the waters, already topping some buildings whose roofs just peeked through, were still rising.\u201cThis is the worst storm that our Florida Panhandle has seen in a century,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott warned.Just about every update seemed to bring greater grimness: closed bridges, more towering waves, suspended emergency services, admonitions that the time to evacuate had passed. The hurricane center reported a 130-mile-per-hour wind gust near the evacuated Tyndall Air Force Base \u2014 and said that the measuring instrument had then failed.Here\u2019s the latest:\u2022 The storm made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near Mexico Beach, Fla., around midday on Wednesday, with 155 mile-per-hour winds. By 2 a.m. Thursday, the storm was 25 miles east of Macon, Ga., and had lost strength, with maximum winds of 60 m.p.h. At midnight, it was downgraded to a tropical storm.The storm is the worst ever to hit the Florida Panhandle.\u2022 A man died after a tree crashed down on his home in Greensboro, northwest of Tallahassee, the Gadsden County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed on Wednesday.\u2022 Power losses were widespread, with hundreds of thousands of customers across three states without electricity.\u2022 Storm surges flooded much of the coastline of the Florida Panhandle. A water-level station at Apalachicola, Fla., was reporting nearly five feet of inundation above ground level.\u2022 Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Fla., said it had sustained extensive damage. \u201cEvacuated personnel should make plans for an extended time away from the base,\u201d Tyndall said on its Facebook page.The storm took aim at Mexico Beach, an Old Florida beach town spared from overdevelopment and known fondly for a waterfront motel, El Governor, and for a seafood restaurant, Toucan\u2019s on the Beach, with its wooden deck. Whether they survived the storm remained unclear.Patricia Mulligan, who was riding out the storm with her family in a condo, said that nearby homes had been ripped apart.\u201cYou can\u2019t drive a car anywhere, you can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s littered with houses, pieces of houses,\u201d Ms. Mulligan said in a phone interview. She could see remnants of people\u2019s lives strewn outside \u2014 refrigerators, a beanbag chair, a washing machine, a kayak, a dresser.Her daughter, Tessa Talarico, captured video of the storm, showing the winds whipping through the city and the water nearly submerging homes.Ms. Mulligan said her brother\u2019s boat had capsized, and he lost a condo along the beach. Other nearby units were also destroyed. \u201cThey\u2019re not there,\u201d she said.\u201cI went through Hurricane Andrew,\u201d Ms. Mulligan said, recalling the storm that ripped through South Florida in 1992, when she lived in Miami. In an interview with CNN, she said she moved to Mexico Beach about two and a half months ago. \u201cThis is just as bad,\u201d she said.Hurricane Michael hit Panama City, Fla., on Wednesday afternoon, its wind shoving \u2014 and shoving again \u2014 like an incessant bully.It was not what people are used to in Panama City, a place that has not seen a storm this ugly in a long time. Nestled under Alabama on the Florida Panhandle, the area is built on the promise of making vacationers happy on a budget. Unlike the rest of the state, Northwest Florida, with its pine trees, military bases and conservative politics, feels like the South.On Wednesday, it was all danger and worry. The winds approached 150 miles an hour, tripping useless car alarms and felling towering trees. The gusts blew the rain sideways.A pastor named Carlos Thomas, 48, was out in it in his old Dodge pickup, just before the storm reached its crescendo, driving two older members of his church \u2014 the Neals Temple First Born Church of the Living God \u2014 to a shelter.His family had gone to a shelter, too, but he stayed holed up in his little brick house. \u201cI believe from what I\u2019ve seen in the past, we\u2019re going to be O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking God\u2019s going to take us through it.\u201dPeggy Spell spent Wednesday in a hotel lobby, pleased enough to be out of her trailer home a few miles inland. Her husband, Eddie, was with her, and her teenage son Jacob. Her husband stretched out on the floor in a pair of waders, stroking the neck of their small dog, Cocoa. Jacob hoped the power would stay on so he could hook up his Xbox. No such luck.Ms. Spell worried about her other son, 34, who had decided to stay in the trailer near his chain saw and pickup truck, ready to cut people out or drag them to safety.She admired her older son, but she was cursing him for it, too. \u201cI\u2019m totally ticked that we didn\u2019t all leave,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m worried.\u201dPastor Thomas said some of his flock had evacuated, particularly the old and infirm. But it was unclear how many people had decided to stay along the Gulf Coast.A brother and sister, John and Laurie Hamm, had moved their mother, who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to the Hilton Garden Inn, a few miles inland. Her house was near downtown Panama City, right along Watson Bayou. Ms. Hamm herself said that she lives in a townhouse one block from the beach.\u201cWhen they started a couple of days ago and said it was going to be a Category 1, it was, like, \u2018Cat 1, no big deal,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hamm said. \u201cWhen they said Cat 2, it was like, \u2018Oh maybe we\u2019d better pay attention.\u2019 And when they said Cat 3 it was like, \u2018Oh, Lord.\u2019\u201dMr. Hamm had come from Tampa to help move their mother and they had thought about moving west along the coast and out of the storm\u2019s path. But they worried about getting stuck on Interstate 10.And so here was Ms. Hamm, an evacuee, but just a few miles from home.President Trump received a briefing on the hurricane and said that he expected to visit the storm-damaged area on Sunday or Monday.Mr. Trump marveled at the size of the storm as Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, described its impact on the Florida Panhandle. He briefed the president along with Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security.\u201cThis started out very innocently a week ago,\u201d and then \u201cgrew into a monster,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that \u201cI\u2019ll be totally focused on this.\u201dStill, he said that would probably move ahead with a rally in Erie, Pa., on Wednesday night. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do because you have so many people already there,\u201d he said.He also expressed concern for areas in North and South Carolina that are still grappling with flooding from the last storm and remain in danger of receiving more rain.They lined up inside the cafeteria at Lincoln High School in Tallahassee late Wednesday morning, carrying grocery bags filled with snacks, bedding and the occasional pet, to seek shelter from Hurricane Michael.Evelyn Rainey, 69, said she had seen what Florence had done in the Carolinas, and didn\u2019t want to take any chances. \u201cMy husband stayed home because he always wants to protect the house, I guess from looters and stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, we can get more stuff. This is a Category 4.\u201dBetty Clark and Betty Tyler, friends who live in the same neighborhood of trailer homes, shared a table in front of a television as Ms. Tyler\u2019s grandchildren flitted around the room.\u201cI\u2019d rather be safe than foolish,\u201d said Ms. Tyler, 73, who moved into the shelter on Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning, she was \u201cready to go home.\u201dMs. Clark, 60, waited until Wednesday morning to travel to the shelter, bringing only her medication for the breast cancer she has been battling.\u201cI wanted to come here so that if I got sick, somebody would be able to help,\u201d she said.Near the center of the room, Marco Sanchez and Lesley Padilla rested on three inflatable mattresses they bought Tuesday night at Walmart, after concluding that their trailer home might be unsafe for four young children.\u201cWe left all our possessions but brought the most important ones: our papers and our children\u2019s papers,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said.Their two-month-old daughter, Meghan Sanchez, dozed in a baby carrier as her siblings \u2014 Alberto Padilla, 11; Eli Jimenez, 7; and Isabella Jimenez, 3 \u2014 played games on tablets.\u201cThe important thing is we\u2019re all safe here,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cUntil the storm has passed.\u201dSome 322 counties in the South \u2014 about 10 percent of all counties nationwide \u2014 were in states of emergency on Wednesday as Hurricane Michael threatened to ravage parts of the region and strain resources.Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia has declared an emergency for 92 of the state\u2019s 159 counties, and Michael is expected to pass over at least some areas as a hurricane, not a diminished tropical storm.\u201cThe time to prepare is ending, and those in the storm\u2019s path should be prepared to shelter-in-place,\u201d the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency said on Twitter on Wednesday.Michael is also expected to race over the Carolinas \u2014 including communities still recovering from Hurricane Florence \u2014 as a tropical storm before moving offshore on Friday.\u201cMake no mistake: Hurricane Michael is a dreadful storm, and it poses serious risks to North Carolina,\u201d said the state\u2019s governor, Roy Cooper.Richard Fausset reported from Panama City; Patricia Mazzei from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

{"Headline": "Fixing the Climate Requires More Than Technology", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor transformations can happen in a generation. But not without government help.Drs. Oreskes and Conway are historians of science and the authors of \u201cThe Collapse of Western Civilization \u2014 A View from the Future.\u201d Last week\u2019s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was bad news from top to bottom. Dangerous planetary warming is underway, it\u2019s happening faster than scientists predicted, and time is running out to stop it.What does this mean for us? Right now, government is widely seen as inefficient and ineffective, and our needs are thought to be best addressed by the private sector, through entrepreneurship, venture capital and Silicon Valley-style \u201cdisruption.\u201d But unless we acknowledge the need for a substantial government role, we are going to be stuck, because change driven solely by the marketplace is unlikely to suffice.Some might object that our current challenge is vastly different from those met by past technological changes, because we\u2019re not just talking about a thing, like a radio or cellphone, but about changing our entire energy system. But these earlier transformations involved systems, too. Just as energy technology isn\u2019t one thing, neither were the railroads, radio, electricity or the internet. Those systems all involved many parts, including federal, state and local policies to support them (the land grants that made the railroads possible, for instance, or role of the Federal Trade Commission in licensing radio and television stations).What makes large-scale technological change challenging is the integration of all of those parts. Electricity wasn\u2019t just a matter of turbines, or even turbines, power lines and transformers. Financing and regulation were also required. After electricity was introduced to the urban marketplace, the biggest obstacle to its expanded use was profitability. The private sector was able to make money bringing electricity to densely populated cities like New York, St. Louis and Chicago, but it took federal intervention, under the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, to bring it to rural communities across America. And even then, uptake was not immediate. Rural electrification boosters insisted that hard-working farmers urgently needed electricity, but initial demand was less than expected. The Tennessee Valley Authority wanted to cut rates to drive up demand. But private utilities opposed this, worrying that low rates would threaten their financing, and the T.V.A. settled on an appliance subsidy to drive increased household consumption. Demand had to be built.The internet was created by scientists funded by the federal government\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Al Gore didn\u2019t build it, but he did sponsor the 1991 legislation that made it public, which laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, Silicon Valley, smartphones and our information-driven society.Demand for new technologies is rarely entirely spontaneous. If people have been living without something, it\u2019s not always obvious to them why they now need it. They are likely to resist being told that they must spend money or endure inconvenience to change. In most cases, demand has to be developed and nurtured. A case for change has to be made, supported by public policy. The fact that many of these technological revolutions took hold in a generation\u2019s time is partly because young people were quicker to adopt these new technologies than their elders. Some think that if we focus on technology, we can somehow avoid the messiness of politics and partisanship. But we won\u2019t get the energy technologies we need and the systems to make them work in the time we need them if we don\u2019t have the government policies to make them a reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Eastern Germany So Far Right?", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 30 years after reunification, the former Communist region is now home to right-wing extremism.Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.A few weeks ago, a young man was stabbed to death at a city festival in Chemnitz, a city in eastern Germany; afterward two asylum seekers were arrested in connection with the attack. Large demonstrations broke out around the city, dominated at times by hundreds of right-wing extremists. Some raised their hands in the Hitler salute; journalists and counterdemonstrators were verbally and physically attacked; a mob threw stones at the owner of a Jewish restaurant. Similar demonstrations broke out in K\u00f6then, a town of 30,000 inhabitants in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. And on Monday, the police arrested seven men accused of planning attacks on politicians and foreigners on Wednesday.These events are not random. While violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists are down from 2016, they are still far more frequent in the five eastern German states than in the west, according to the annual report of Germany\u2019s interior secret service. And then, there are the polls. The eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony will both hold elections next September. For both states, pollsters predict record results for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party. East Germany was, of course, a Communist country; today it is a hotbed of far-right sympathy and outright hatred. What happened?The question angers Wolfgang Thierse, a Social Democrat and former president of the German Parliament, who was raised in the East. In the 1970s, he worked briefly for the Ministry of Culture in the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, but he was let go after refusing to support the expulsion of Wolf Biermann, a popular singer and critic of the Communist government. There is no such thing as \u201cthe East,\u201d Mr. Thierse told me. Eastern Germany, he says, is not one place, but a mix \u2014 areas of prosperity, creativity and economic innovation next door to areas of economic squalor and despair.Mr. Thierse\u2019s assessment is reflected in the government\u2019s annual \u201cReport on the State of the German Union,\u201d which was presented last week. While pensions and wages are rising and unemployment is down, the average income in the former East lags the former West by around 15 percent. The eastern economy sports some champion businesses, but has altogether fewer large companies, and lesser international investment. The eastern states have an older demographic, and a harder time finding qualified workers.The economic differences are just one piece in the puzzle of why the East seems so far to the right. Other explanations focus on the legacy of the political culture of the German Democratic Republic. Many across Germany felt like Chancellor Angela Merkel imposed her decision to accept a large number of refugees on the country \u2014 but eastern Germans, having lived under an authoritarian regime, reacted more strongly to decisions they feel they did not have a say in. Second, there are fewer migrants living in the east; people there lack the opportunity for everyday interactions with them, and thus harbor irrational fears of outsiders. Some also claim that eastern Germans, not having learned what democracy is like, are more easily frustrated with its tedious processes and often less-than-perfect results.Johannes Staemmler stresses a different point. Mr. Staemmler, born in the eastern city of Dresden in 1982, co-founded Third Generation East, a network of young professionals of eastern German descent. Today, he\u2019s a scientist and counselor working for a think tank in Potsdam, outside Berlin. He points out that many who joined the far-right protests in Chemnitz or vote for the Alternative for Germany are too young to have more than the faintest memories of the G.D.R. But they do remember the radical changes of the 1990s: privatization, the rapid death of East German industries and ensuing job losses.Mr. Thierse and Mr. Staemmler, both born in the East, are heard and respected by Germans on both sides of the geographic divide. Overall, however, the debate about what\u2019s happening in the east is dominated by western voices. Even 28 years after Germany\u2019s reunification, most prominent journalists are westerners, as are most prominent policymakers and business leaders.So when Germany discusses why the east is so far right, condescension almost inevitably sneaks in: For the sake of the argument, eastern Germany is unbuckled from the rest of the country, and the historical border is redrawn. In this new, old divide, eastern Germans are reduced to being subjects of analysis and policy proposals \u2014 never participants in the conversation. The east and west are still like unequal siblings. The strong one loves his smaller and uglier brother and accepts that his deviant behavior comes from trauma, but he still looks down on him. This subjugation of eastern Germans to mostly western German psychoanalysis is a political drama in itself. It seems like even in their most violent, most determined actions, eastern Germans can never be agents.\u201cYes, eastern Germans are on the couch,\u201d said Mr. Staemmler when I offered this interpretation. To him, however, the current public analysis is not necessarily disenfranchising. He says it could also become a moment of political empowerment. Suddenly people who haven\u2019t voted in decades are going to the ballot box. They may not vote for the party the rest of the country would like them to vote for. But at least they are politicized, and have the nation\u2019s attention. \u201cYou could also look at it this way: Whoever is on the couch has the chance to talk.\u201dWhichever way, it really is the moment to talk. It may mean talking to someone who is yelling at you, as Mr. Staemmler puts it. But it still is better to try it anyway, instead of letting eastern Germans sink back into scornful silence.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Mr. Littlejohn\u2019s Facebook recording of the incident had been viewed 4 million times by Friday evening.The video was shared to Facebook on Wednesday.\u201cI was just sexually assaulted by a child,\u201d Ms. Klein is heard saying on the video as she said she was on the phone with the police. The boy, who is about 9, and another child burst into tears outside the store as bystanders confronted Ms. Klein about the incident.The public shaming of people who behave boorishly or spout racist views has become a feature of modern life in New York City, where nearly every person has a cellphone and residents are not shy about confronting one another, often in colorful language.Ms. Klein, 53, returned to the store on Friday afternoon to buy cigarettes and to face her neighbors, who heckled her as she gave her version of events to journalists. Then, prompted by a reporter, Ms. Klein went inside the store and watched a playback of the bodega\u2019s security camera footage from Wednesday evening.Onlookers crammed inside the bodega\u2019s doorway to watch the screening, their phone cameras pointed toward Ms. Klein. Playing on a ceiling-mounted flat-screen television, the video showed the child turning to someone behind him and his backpack brushing Ms. Klein\u2019s backside as she leaned over the counter.Speaking into a television reporter\u2019s camera afterward, Ms. Klein made an apology. \u201cYoung man,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know your name but I\u2019m sorry.\u201dStill, Ms. Klein denied she acted out of bigotry toward the boy or that she harbored racist feelings.

{"Headline": "U.S. Begins First Cyberoperation Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States Cyber Command is targeting individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work, according to officials briefed on the operation.The campaign, which includes missions undertaken in recent days, is the first known overseas cyberoperation to protect American elections, including the November midterms.Defense officials would not say how many individuals they were targeting, and they would not describe the methods that Cyber Command has used to send the direct messages to the operatives behind the influence campaigns. It is not clear if the information was delivered in an email, a chat or some other electronic intervention.Senior defense officials said they were not directly threatening the operatives. Still, former officials said anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government\u2019s actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions. Even the unstated threat of sanctions could help deter some Russians from participating in covert disinformation campaigns, said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security.\u201cThis would be a way to generate leverage that can change behavior,\u201d she said.The Cyber Command operations appear relatively measured, especially in comparison with the increasingly elaborate and sophisticated efforts by Russia to use disinformation to sow dissent in the United States.But the American campaign undertaken in response to Russia\u2019s information offensive is limited in large part to keep Moscow from escalating in response by taking down the power grid or conducting some other reprisal that could trigger a bigger clash between great powers. Compared with traditional armed conflict, the rules of cyberwarfare are not well defined.Cyber Command was founded in 2009 to defend military networks but has also developed offensive capabilities. The command shares a headquarters and leadership with the National Security Agency, which collects electronic and signals intelligence. A joint Cyber Command-N.S.A. team has been working on the effort to identify and deter foreign influence campaigns.American officials also said the campaign is one aspect of a broader effort, which includes purges by social media companies of fake accounts that spread propaganda, to fight Russian intrusion in democratic elections. Cyber Command has also sent teams to Europe to shore up the defenses of American allies and partners so they can combat Russian intrusions on their own government networks, according to defense officials.American intelligence officials have concluded that Russia is unlikely to try to hack into voting machines or directly manipulate voting results this year. On Friday, the director of national intelligence said that state and local governments have reported attempted intrusions into their networks, but that foreign governments have not penetrated voting systems.But Russian efforts to sway public opinion by spreading false information have continued, and officials said those efforts are becoming more refined, targeting specific groups of Americans. Almost all of the Russian disinformation efforts, according to current and former officials, are aimed at sowing dissent, polarizing the political parties and setting the stage for the 2020 presidential election.The defense officials would not identify their targets. But other officials said some of the targets were involved in previous Russian efforts to spread disinformation in the United States and Europe, including the 2016 presidential election. The new American campaign, according to these officials, is aimed at both oligarch-funded hacking groups and Russian intelligence operatives who are part of Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign. It is not clear whether Cyber Command\u2019s effort is also aimed at halting Russian operatives charged with hacking political entities.Others said the American government must be ready to go further \u2014 cutting off the Russians\u2019 ability to spread propaganda.\u201cIt is very important to identify the source and essentially be able to neutralize that source,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former Obama administration official. \u201cThese are networks that operate. The more we can identify the key nodes in those networks and remove them by taking them offline is really how we will get at this problem in a systemic way and not play Whac-a-Mole.\u201dGen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, hinted at the new cyberoperations this month as he noted that American adversaries are \u201clooking to really take us on below that level of armed conflict\u201d by sowing distrust in society and \u201cattempt to disrupt our elections.\u201d\u201cThis is what great power competition looks like today, and it\u2019s what we will look at as we look to the future,\u201d he said during a panel discussion in Washington.Cyber Command has a relatively short history of overseas operations against adversaries, but it did conduct missions aimed at curtailing the ability of the Islamic State to spread propaganda and recruit online. Those operations, which included efforts to freeze computers, yielded mixed results.Assessing the effectiveness of American cyberoperations at this point is difficult. The director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, is expected to complete a review after the November midterm elections.But some American officials said they believed the initial operations had at least partly diminished the effectiveness of Moscow\u2019s election manipulation effort.Outside experts believe that a major reason Russian social media trolls are less effective is aggressive work by technology companies. Twitter and Facebook purges of Russian-created or -controlled accounts have reduced the effectiveness of Moscow\u2019s propaganda, said Ben Nimmo, an expert on Russia\u2019s online misinformation efforts at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab.Some American officials have said they were frustrated by what they viewed as President Trump\u2019s timidity at taking on the Russians involved in election meddling. Mr. Trump has frequently wavered about whether he believes the Russians interfered in the 2016 elections to help his bid for the presidency.But officials said broad agreement existed throughout the rest of the government that the Russian interference campaign was ongoing and required a more muscular response to deter further meddling.With the new campaign, American officials said, they are trying to hamper Russia from meddling in the 2018 vote and deter future efforts. Cyber Command\u2019s new operations reflect a push by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to expand the Pentagon\u2019s role countering Russian hackers threatening America and its allies. In the White House, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, has also been pushing to speed up approval for election defense operations.In the final months of the Obama administration, as details of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election were uncovered, officials privately pushed Cyber Command and the National Security Agency to create options to respond.Cyber Command and the N.S.A. were hesitant to offer options, a former official said, out of concern that if they tried to directly deter Moscow\u2019s activities, Russian operatives would learn too much about America\u2019s espionage techniques, among the government\u2019s most closely held secrets.Since taking the helm of Cyber Command and the N.S.A. in May, General Nakasone has said he has the authority to act against adversaries threatening American elections. Inside both the command and the agency, he has pushed to develop new options to deter interference.American officials say the Russian effort to destabilize the American elections is closely tied to Moscow\u2019s work in Europe.The criminal complaint unsealed on Friday showed that Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, the St. Petersburg accountant involved in the disinformation campaign in the United States, was also active in Europe, including in Ukraine, considered the focus of Moscow\u2019s efforts to weaken its neighbors and the West.Cyber Command has also sent teams to Ukraine, Macedonia and Montenegro to build up defenses against Russian hackers intent on penetrating government networks on its doorstep in Eastern Europe.The United States is helping Montenegro remove Russian cyberoperatives from nonclassified government systems, a senior Montenegrin official said. Painstaking work, the effort could take months to find and close all the access points Russian hackers have created. Russians have not penetrated the government\u2019s classified systems, the official said.European leaders have been asking the United States to take a bigger role in helping block Russian meddling and cyberactivity.Lithuania is working with the United States on military cyberdefense training as well as research and development on cyberdefenses, President Dalia Grybauskaite said an interview. But Ms. Grybauskaite has also pushed for expanded cooperation, including a rotating presence of military experts at Lithuania\u2019s cyberdefense center.\u201cWhat we see is a steadily growing pressure on cyber, the information front, propaganda and, recently, fake news,\u201d Ms. Grybauskaite said. \u201cTheir efforts and instruments are becoming more sophisticated every day.\u201dHelene Cooper and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Investigation We Deserve", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the bureau is only allowed to interview four witnesses, we\u2019ll never learn the truth about Judge Kavanaugh.Mr. Litman is a former United States attorney and deputy assistant attorney general.Thanks to the White House and Senate Republicans, not only is the F.B.I. limited to a weeklong investigation \u2014 a constraint the former F.B.I. director James Comey called \u201cidiotic\u201d in these pages \u2014 but, far more important, the bureau is seriously limited in terms of who it is allowed to interview.Such constraints are very unusual, if not unprecedented for such an investigation. And they sharply reduce the prospects that the bureau will generate the sort of information that the Judiciary Committee has requested and the country deserves to have.I oversaw the vetting of many dozens of judicial candidates when I was a deputy assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice. I also was regularly involved in background investigations by the F.B.I. when I was a United States attorney.A number of candidates ran into some controversy, generally on issues of finances, criminal history or personal misconduct. The standard procedure in such instances was for the White House to \u201crequest\u201d (i.e., order) a follow-up background investigation.Generally, but not always, the White House would determine the subject matter focus for the investigation. Sometimes it would set a quick turnaround. But never in my experience would the White House tell the F.B.I. who to interview or not interview. That ties agents\u2019 hands before they even start their work.The fact that witnesses do not know the universe of others that the bureau will be talking to serves as a kind of truth serum: They are deterred from lying by the prospect that they could be contradicted by another unknown witness.For example: In his opening statement on Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh referred to some of the entries in his high school yearbook. \u201cMy friends and I have cringed when we read about it and talked to each other\u201d in recent days, he testified.When the Senate Judiciary Committee reopened the investigation, it acted for the greater good, recognizing that confirming Judge Kavanaugh under the cloud of allegations would be damaging to the Supreme Court, Congress and the country. Following that triumph of fairness, it is now imperative that the F.B.I.\u2019s supplementary investigation be legitimate and thorough, and be perceived as such. That simply cannot happen if the bureau is limited to a short list of witnesses preselected by the White House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Jamal Khashoggi Killing, Trump Administration Sends Mixed Signals", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House sent the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, to Istanbul to help the Turkish government with its investigation into the killing, according to an official. But in Riyadh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a wide-ranging meeting with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is suspected of playing a role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident.Mr. Mnuchin, who canceled his attendance at this week\u2019s Saudi investment conference in the wake of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, traded views with Prince Mohammed on economic ties and counterterrorism initiatives, as well as on the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, according to a Treasury Department spokesman.\u201cI am not satisfied with what I have heard,\u201d President Trump said to reporters before flying to a rally in Texas.But Mr. Trump reiterated the value of the $110 billion arms deal he announced with Saudi Arabia, as well as other American business ties with the kingdom. \u201cI do not want to lose the investment being made in our country,\u201d he said.The meeting between Mr. Mnuchin and Prince Mohammed was unplanned and came at the request of the Saudis, according to a person familiar with the situation. But it added to the portrait of a White House eager to move on from the killing of Mr. Khashoggi to a more routine relationship with its key Arab ally.Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has been the key contact with Prince Mohammed, likened the doubts about the truthfulness of Saudi officials to the run-of-the-mill perfidy that the White House deals with in Washington.\u201cEvery day we deal with people who are trying to deceive us in different ways,\u201d Mr. Kushner said during a CNN forum in Manhattan. \u201cBut our job is to see through it, but also to stay focused on what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201dThe administration has shifted its tone repeatedly on the Saudi response to the killing. But Mr. Trump has stopped short of pointing a finger at Prince Mohammed and has steadfastly defended the 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, whom the White House has cultivated and views as a critical partner in its efforts to isolate Iran.Mr. Mnuchin was the first senior American official to meet face to face with Prince Mohammed since the Saudi government confirmed on Friday that Mr. Khashoggi was killed. It had earlier insisted that he left the consulate and disappeared afterward.The Saudi Foreign Ministry lost no time in publicizing the session, posting a photograph on Twitter of Mr. Mnuchin sitting across from Prince Mohammed in an opulent reception room, listening while his host made a point.Prince Mohammed stressed \u201cthe importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom\u2019s #Vision2030,\u201d the tweet said, referring to the prince\u2019s ambitious program to modernize his kingdom.A Treasury Department spokesman said the meeting was focused on combating terrorist financing and corralling Iran\u2019s influences in the region and that the two men discussed the Khashoggi investigation.In an interview on Sunday in Jerusalem, Mr. Mnuchin said that Saudi Arabia needed to do more to demonstrate that Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing was unintentional. But he defended his decision to travel to Riyadh and meet with Saudi officials, saying his trip was aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment, as the United States tries to ratchet up pressure on Iran.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who over the weekend said he believed Prince Mohammed was culpable in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, criticized Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s decision to meet with the royal.\u201cIf their talks were about financial matters, I certainly think they should not have gone forward,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf they were about counterterrorism issues, it\u2019s hard to believe how fruitful those could be.\u201dThe meeting occurred hours after Mr. Kushner said the White House was still engaged in \u201cfact-finding\u201d into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death but that it had its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d as the investigations into his killing continued.The grounds for skepticism only seemed to deepen on Monday. The revelation that the Saudis deployed a body double added to the multiplying doubts about the Saudi explanation of how Mr. Khashoggi, 59, died.It suggested there was a premeditated plan to make Mr. Khashoggi disappear, through death or abduction, and to cover it up \u2014 possibly contradicting the Saudi insistence that his killing was the accidental result of an altercation.Mr. Trump, in an interview with USA Today, called it \u201ca plot gone awry.\u201dMr. Kushner, a key adviser on the Mideast peace process, has developed a strong relationship with the Saudi crown prince.He has talked to Prince Mohammed several times in the last week, and has come under criticism amid reports that he has advised Mr. Trump to wait before jumping to conclusions about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\u201cI think that, again, the president is focused on what\u2019s good for America, what are strategic interests,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cWhere do we share interests with other countries \u2014 let\u2019s work toward those.\u201dHe made the remarks in his first televised interview since the 2016 election, conducted by the political activist Van Jones, at the \u201cCitizen by CNN\u201d forum in Manhattan.Mr. Kushner said that the president was mindful of getting answers, but he noted that the Saudis have been a strategic ally of the United States.When Mr. Jones noted that even Mr. Trump had said that there had been \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201clies\u201d from the Saudis in relation to the Khashoggi case, Mr. Kushner offered a more muted response.\u201cWe\u2019re getting facts in from multiple places,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce those facts come in, the secretary of state will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe.\u201dWhen Mr. Kushner was asked what advice he personally had given the crown prince, he replied, \u201cTo be transparent.\u201d He added, \u201cThe world is watching.\u201dDismissing criticism of his ties to the crown prince, Mr. Kushner said he did not pay attention to his critics. At another point, he said he heeded criticism only if it was from someone he respected.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

{"Headline": "In a Deep Blue or Red State? You Can Still Influence Politics ", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrganize your own precinct. Your own neighborhood. Whether you are conservative, moderate or liberal.Mr. Hersh is an associate professor at Tufts. For those of us who have been rolling our eyes rather than rolling up our sleeves, let\u2019s consider the forthcoming Election Day not as a culminating national moment to watch on TV but as a personal fresh start. It\u2019s a new opportunity to take our own civic roles more seriously, to look up from our smartphones as we stand in line to vote and to see ourselves and our neighbors as a source of political power.There are three reasons to do this.Take my deep-blue state of Massachusetts. If Democrats were better organized, say back in 2010, they could have preserved a 60-vote majority in the Senate for an additional year by defeating Scott Brown, who barely won in an upset.Or take Alabama, which this year sent Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate. It seemed like a fluke, right? Not quite. In 2008, two white conservative Democrats in Alabama won close races for the United States House. In 2010, almost a third of Alabamians saw close state legislative races.If national politics feels so hopeless or threatening that you can\u2019t see the value in organizing your own precinct, remember that the next election and the ones that follow will be important, too.Organizing your own precinct is useful not just for state and federal elections but for local politics, too. That\u2019s the second reason to do it. Core issues to liberals, like racial equality and environmental protection, and core issues to conservatives, like economic development and religious expression, are hashed out locally. On the environment, for instance, liberals even in deep blue cities and towns could push for much more. Or not. Whoever has power in precincts gets to decide.What does it mean to organize your precinct? Track down a list of voters. You can get it from a local election office or from a political organization. If you can, work within an existing organization: a local party committee or an activist group. If the local organizations in your area are lethargic and ineffectual, then find one or two people to join you and, boom, you are a precinct committee, self-appointed to connect to voters in your neighborhood.Meet your neighbors. Could you learn a few hundred names by 2020? You probably could. Ask them what they care about. Focus on them. Be an empathetic listener.Who gives you the authority to do this? The precinct committee, of course. You are one of its founding members.How much time will this take? Just about the same amount you currently spend futzing around online.Along the way, you might learn about a neighbor who could use some help from a social service agency but doesn\u2019t know how to get it.

We help one another by getting power to advance public policy that serves the common interest. We also help by actually learning about one another\u2019s personal needs. In organizing your precinct, you escape the shallow diversions of social media and embrace the deep pleasures of putting yourself in a position to help.Recently, I was recruiting a retired social worker to join me in calling and listening to neighbors. As I made my pitch, he interrupted me, \u201cWait a minute, if you start talking about this \u2018empathetic canvassing\u2019 strategy in public, the other side might learn about it and try to copy it. And then what\u2019s the point?\u201d I smiled. What a thing it would be if Democrats and Republicans competed with one another over who could be more caring neighbors. In the meantime, whichever side does it better will hold the keys to sustained political power.Eitan Hersh, an associate professor at Tufts University, is writing a book on political engagement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMany Americans travel to Latin America to help in orphanages, but their presence often only compounds the misery of unnecessarily institutionalizing children. First of two articlesThose stories touch us because we know that children belong with their families, whenever possible.The sad truth, though, is that border separations aren\u2019t the only way that Americans are helping to take children in poor countries away from their parents. Well-meaning Americans (and Europeans and Australians) do exactly that when they volunteer at and support orphanages.Millions of people volunteer abroad every year \u2014 students, taking-a-break students, church members. Often they go to provide care and affection to children in orphanages.\u201cThere is an association with volunteering \u2014 that orphanages are a place I can help the most. It\u2019s what comes to mind,\u201d said Jessi Warner, chief operating officer of Projects Abroad, a company that links travelers to volunteer work.What could caring people support that actually helps vulnerable children in poor countries? The same strategies that wealthy countries use: family reunification and foster care.When a family abandons a child, or Costa Rica\u2019s child protection agency removes a child because of neglect or abuse, Casa Viva makes sure the children are well cared for while they wait for reunification \u2014 or if that\u2019s not possible, adoption. It recruits foster families in local churches, and trains and supports them. It supervises weekly visits between children and their original families, when appropriate. This year, Mr. Aspegren said, Casa Viva will work with more than 200 children in foster families.\u201cPeople who get into orphanage work think they\u2019re doing the best for kids,\u201d Mr. Aspegren said. \u201cThey give them a home and food. But kids need love and connection more than they need that.\u201dLatin Americans prize themselves on valuing family. \u201cWhen a child loses his parents, it\u2019s common to be with grandparents or an aunt, and this happens spontaneously,\u201d Ms. Luna said. Nothing in the culture suggests that children belong in institutions, she said, yet foster care as a public policy is not established in many countries.You\u2019ve probably heard the horror stories about children abused by foster families, even in wealthy countries. These failures, though real, are the story of a small percentage of children, because successes don\u2019t make it into the news. A much more widespread problem is that children in foster care don\u2019t get the services they need, and many wind up dropping out of school, pregnant, or incarcerated. (The outcomes would be far worse and tragedy more common if those children came from orphanages.) Foster care is neglected and underfunded. It needs more services and better monitoring. Despite foster care\u2019s troubles, however, no one in America is clamoring to bring back orphanages. In poor countries, however, the picture is the opposite.If poverty creates orphans, the solution should be less poverty, not more orphanages. But because of Western donations and volunteering, orphanages cost governments nothing.And foster care is harder to brag about, Ms. Luna said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier,\u201d she explained, \u201cto take a picture in front of a painted orphanage, with the name of the donor.\u201dThe Aspegrens started their missionary work running orphanages in the Dominican Republic. \u201cWe went to give children family,\u201d said Philip. \u201cWe were surprised to see that all the children had family already. They were called orphans by name, but 95 percent had extended family regularly visiting the campus. The volunteers would play with the 70 kids living on our campus. The children would be saying, \u2018Who\u2019s next and what are they going to bring me?\u2019 I knew I had a problem.\u201dMarcela Torres, now the national coordinator for holistic care at Casa Viva, first heard about the organization in her church in 2014. \u201cWe had never heard of foster care, or knew that an organization in Costa Rica did this,\u201d she said. She and her sister, both in their 20s, lived at home with their parents. \u201cIt had been a long time since we had a child in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we believed that the best place for a child separated from his family of origin was with another family.\u201dThe Torres family underwent background checks and interviews, and attended six weekend workshops at Casa Viva. Two months after they signed up, they went to Casa Viva to pick up two brothers, ages 9 and 3.The family spent the first few days making the children feel safe, and trying to understand their needs. The boys were underweight and stunted. They were both severely impaired visually. The older boy missed his mother and cried. He didn\u2019t tolerate hugs or physical contact. The younger one didn\u2019t express much emotion at all.The Torres family took care of the boys\u2019 health problems, and got both of them glasses. \u201cThey were used to doing everything for themselves,\u201d Ms. Torres said. \u201cThere was no adult they could count on.\u201d They were determined to show the boys a different way to live as a family \u2014 with adults caring for children.Once a month, they took the boys to Casa Viva to see their mother, who was getting help from the government child protection agency. After six months, the boys went home. The older boy hugged his foster family. The Torres family never saw them again.There are about 200 families like the Torres, who have fostered a dozen children. They get a stipend for each child, equivalent to about one-sixth of a professional\u2019s salary. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to help, and not so much that it becomes a motivation,\u201d Mr. Aspegren said. The biggest hurdle to recruiting, he said, was a belief in families that they would grow too attached to the child. Although Casa Viva can accompany foster parents through this loss, Mr. Aspegren said that an attachment is necessary. \u201cConnection is what kids need,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a painful process for families. If it\u2019s not, we\u2019re concerned they\u2019re not doing what they need to do.\u201dCasa Viva has formal relationships with 35 churches, and has placed about 640 children in foster families. About 60 percent of those went back to their biological family or another relative. About 35 percent were adopted. \u201cThere\u2019s a small group we haven\u2019t been able to serve,\u201d Mr. Aspegren said, speaking about children who ended up in an institution.\u201cIt is still discouraging to come across people who are moving to Latin America or other parts of the world to build orphanages,\u201d he said. \u201cBut 10 years ago, when I would talk about doing family-based care, I would get very, very negative comments from people very committed to the orphanage model. Today the tide has shifted.\u201dNext week, I\u2019ll look at what volunteers and donors can do to help vulnerable children.Reporting for this article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Divide and Preserve: Reclassifying Tigers to Help Save Them From Extinction", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "Are there many subspecies of tiger, or only two? A correct accounting is the only way to preserve what is left of the animal\u2019s genetic diversity, some scientists say.Supported byFewer than 4,000 tigers remain in the wild. New research aims to give conservationists an improved understanding of their genetics in order to help save them. \u201cThe results presented in this paper are important because they contradict the currently accepted international conservation classifications for tigers,\u201d said Uma Ramakrishnan, a molecular ecologist at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India, who was not involved in the study.\u201cIf you think that all tigers are genetically homogeneous, you might say if you lose the Amur tiger, you still have the Bengal tiger \u2014 and that\u2019s O.K. because they\u2019re very similar,\u201d Dr. Luo said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not O.K., because now we know that tigers are not all alike.\u201dDr. Luo hopes that their new findings put to rest a decade-long debate over whether tigers constitute six, five or two subspecies. In 2004, she and her colleagues first presented research that tigers constitute six living subspecies, based on partial genomic analyses. But other researchers soon challenged the findings.\u201cWhile genomic methods have been applied extensively to humans and model organisms, their use to study endangered species remains under-exploited,\u201d Dr. Ramakrishnan said.The analysis also offered a window into the evolutionary history of tigers. Fossil evidence indicates that the predator evolved roughly two million years ago in Asia. The new study revealed that tiger subspecies last shared a common ancestor relatively recently, about 110,000 years ago, likely in modern-day Southeast Asia and southern China. As the climate changed, tigers expanded west to India, north to China and Siberia and south to Indonesia and Malaysia.In the tens of thousands of years since, tigers have evolved into subspecies with distinct genomic signatures. For example, the researchers found that Sumatran tigers \u2014 which live on a single island in Indonesia, and were the first to diverge from the other subspecies \u2014 possess genes associated with smaller body sizes relative to most tigers on the mainland. This lines up with morphological observations and ecological expectations, Dr. Luo said.\u201cIn India and Siberia, tigers prey on large ungulates, but in Sumatra, they rely more on wild boar and smaller deer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense that smaller prey would exert selection pressure for smaller tigers.\u201dUllas Karanth, the Asia director of science for the Wildlife Conservation Society, praised the new study for advancing the scientific understanding of tiger genetics, but he cast doubt on the feasibility of saving all six subspecies. \u201cThe numbers in all but the Indian and Russian subspecies are just too small,\u201d he said.Tiger populations with a reasonable prospect of survival currently occupy only about 10 percent of their potential habitat, and the pressures are only mounting, Dr. Karanth said. Rather than focus on genetics, efforts to maintain and recover tigers should give priority to the locations where conservations seems most realistic and promising, he said.The study authors argue, however, that saving tigers from extinction also entails saving their genetic diversity.\u201cTo preserve such genomic signatures is to preserve evolutionary uniqueness that tigers have accumulated over thousands of years,\u201d Dr. Luo said. \u201cWe need to respect this uniqueness by maximizing our efforts for all tiger subspecies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beto O\u2019Rourke Attacks Ted Cruz as \u2018Dishonest\u2019 in Debate in Senate Race", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who has fallen behind Senator Ted Cruz in the polls in their hotly contested Senate race, turned sharply aggressive in their second debate on Tuesday night as he attacked Mr. Cruz\u2019s honesty and character while the two clashed over abortion, climate change and other red-versus-blue divides.Using phrases like \u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201call talk and no action,\u201d and questioning whether the senator had delivered any results for Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke took his most personal shot at his opponent when Mr. Cruz expressed skepticism about climate change and argued that Mr. O\u2019Rourke supported higher taxes on oil. The congressman invoked an attack line that Donald J. Trump had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race.\u201cSenator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest, and it\u2019s why the president called him Lyin\u2019 Ted, and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2014 because it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied.In their first debate last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz\u2019s recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent \u201cthe only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.\u201d He added that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke had his way, there would be \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus\u201d aimed at ousting the president.Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.\u201cListen,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cif you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy\u2019s success.\u201cHave you noticed in this debate he doesn\u2019t talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBecause he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.\u201dOnly once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated \u2014 but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, \u201cThere is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.\u201d When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me, Jason,\u201d and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.\u201cThe personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I\u2019ve tried not to engage in,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O\u2019Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.On Wednesday morning, President Trump weighed in on the debate, declaring his support for Mr. Cruz and calling Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201ca flake\u2019\u2019 who was \u201cnot in the same league with Ted Cruz.\u2019\u2019The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were \u201cunder attack\u201d more than \u201cany other time in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian\u2019s interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to \u201cstand up\u201d to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on \u201cpolitical bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google\u201d and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.\u201cThe #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.\u201d As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O\u2019Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour \u201con national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.\u201dThe network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O\u2019Rourke campaign agreed to the change.It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night\u2019s debate was the final one.Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party\u2019s nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign\u2019s missteps.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.\u201cHe\u2019s probably running the best campaign that\u2019s been run in Texas in my lifetime,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in Texas in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m on his Facebook. At one time yesterday he had 13,000 people watching him drive in the car.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.On Tuesday night, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O\u2019Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pass, I don\u2019t know how to get you through,\u201d the attendant told Mr. O\u2019Rourke. His wife, Amy O\u2019Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.\u201cThis is how you know it\u2019s real,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O\u2019Rourke in.\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201dHe rolled up the window.\u201cWe passed the first hurdle,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Casting Blame for the Pipe Bombs Sent to Trump Critics", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders discuss how both the right and the left are pointing fingers at the other.To the Editor:President Trump appeared at his political rally the day that pipe bombs were sent to some of his critics. Obviously, he had been encouraged to act presidential and reassure the country that our leader was sensitive, aware and taking a responsible position for all our benefit.So he proceeded to openly mock his pretense of a more presidential stance at the rally. He was actually reassuring his base that he remains the vulgarian who consistently incites our worst instincts. This is so sad for all of us at such a hazardous time in our country.To the Editor:Second, these outrages might encourage slightly higher Democratic voter turnout in November. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the adults in the room reminded us that ballots are better than bombs? To the Editor:Conversely, when someone mails pipe bombs to leading Democrats, large swaths of the right-wing media rise up denying all responsibility for any role they may have had, and their comments sections are saying either that the targets deserve these bombs for criticizing the government or that the Democrats mailed the bombs.I\u2019m not scared about the bombs themselves; they were poorly made and executed, and the person who sent them is no criminal mastermind. But it\u2019s more troubling how many prominent voices on the right deny all responsibility for instigating violence against the left (#LockHerUp) and instead claim this was a false-flag operation. All this is further proof that these people should be nowhere near the power we allow them to have.To the Editor:Charles M. Blow\u2019s insistence that President Trump\u2019s rhetoric could be the cause for the recent pipe bombings was disturbing. Not only would I not attribute that kind of influence to Mr. Trump, but I would also suggest that the rhetoric that Mr. Blow uses in his criticism is as toxic as he paints Mr. Trump\u2019s. Just last year, we saw a similar show of violence with political motives and, unfortunately, Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican, was hospitalized as a result. Certain sources on the right pointed to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s influence. Choosing to blame Democrats or Mr. Sanders was just as absurd as choosing to blame Mr. Trump for the pipe bombs.It is in these moments that, regardless of party, race or religion, Americans can band together and collectively stand against actions that fail to represent the American standard. Choosing to politicize violence will lead to the unraveling of a society faster than any political ideology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Vinton, Revolutionary Animator With Claymation, Dies at 70", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill Vinton, who used his and a partner\u2019s revolutionary stop-motion animation process, Claymation, to win an Academy Award with an early cartoon and to create memorable commercial characters like the California Raisins, died on Thursday in Portland, Ore. He was 70.Mr. Vinton had been honing his Claymation filmmaking technique for more than a decade when the California Raisin Advisory Board asked him to help with its new advertising campaign. He and his studio turned the raisins into a grooving group of singers in high-top sneakers who march out of a box singing \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine\u201d \u2014 a hit for Marvin Gaye that was sung in the commercial by Buddy Miles \u2014 and showing off dance moves like those of the Four Tops.The commercial \u201ccaught on like wildfire, and within a week it was kind of abuzz in the popular culture,\u201d Mr. Vinton said in speech in 2011 at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in Denver.He made many more spots for the campaign, including one with Ray Charles and another with Michael Jackson, who had called Mr. Vinton to ask if he could be turned into a performing raisin.Stop-motion is a time-consuming filmmaking process in which animators advance the movements of models minutely with each frame. When done correctly, the technique creates the illusion of seamless movement by characters in three dimensions \u2014 in contrast to two-dimensional hand-drawn cel animation.Another Vinton project, the Domino\u2019s Pizza Noid, came to life in the mid-1980s, around the time that Mr. Vinton taught raisins to sing and dance. The ad agency working for Domino\u2019s conceived the Noid as a small, malicious gremlinlike character in a rabbit suit whose various attempts to thwart pizza delivery are foiled by calls to Domino\u2019s. Ordering from Domino\u2019s, the message was, let customers \u201cavoid the Noid.\u201dWilliam Gale Vinton was born on Nov. 17, 1947, in McMinnville, Ore., southwest of Portland. His father, Gale, was a car dealer, and his mother, Saima (Pekkola) Vinton, was a banker and bookkeeper.As a youngster, Will found creative outlets in projects like designing go-karts and boogie boards. By the time he was at the University of California, Berkeley, he was studying architecture, stirred in particular by the intricate, flowing style of the Modernist Spanish architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed.\u201cIf I really wanted to be inspired by designs like Gaud\u00ed\u2019s, I had to throw away the T square and straight edge and grab some Plasticine clay,\u201d Mr. Vinton said in his 2011 speech. \u201cI started modeling and designing by way of sculpting.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before he was in his house in Portland working with Mr. Gardiner, a sculptor, on the clay models and stop-motion animation that became \u201cClosed Mondays\u201d (1974), a short cartoon about a drunken man who staggers into an empty art gallery, where he is stunned to see paintings and sculptures come to life.\u201cThe clay and the cameras were in the basement,\u201d his sister Mary Vinton Folberg said in a telephone interview, describing the sound of the stop-motion process as \u201cclick, stop, click, stop, click, stop.\u201d\u201cIt took about 18 months to shoot,\u201d she said of \u201cClosed Mondays,\u201d \u201cand it was only eight minutes long.\u201dThe film won Mr. Vinton and Mr. Gardiner the Oscar for best short animated film. At the award ceremony Mr. Vinton had a full beard, being some years away from sporting the sculptured handlebar mustache that would become his facial signature.Mr. Vinton followed \u201cClosed Mondays\u201d with short animated films like \u201cMartin the Cobbler\u201d (1977), based on a Tolstoy short story; \u201cRip Van Winkle\u201d (1978); \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d (1979); and \u201cDinosaur\u201d (1980), before producing and directing \u201cThe Adventures of Mark Twain\u201d (1985), a full-length animated feature.Writing in The Daily News of New York, the columnist Jay Maeder called the Twain film \u201cthoroughly delightful\u201d as well as a \u201cdarkly brilliant journey through the sad, tortured mind of Samuel Langhorne Clemens as the old lion rode out his profoundly American legend.\u201dFor that film, Mr. Vinton adapted \u201cTom Sawyer Abroad,\u201d an 1894 novel by Twain in which Tom, Huck Finn and the slave Jim fly on an airship around Africa.\u201cWe made Twain the inventor of the ship, preparing to meet Halley\u2019s comet,\u201d Mr. Vinton said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times.With its unusual visual impact, Claymation found itself in great demand. In addition to the California Raisins and the Noid, it was used in a segment of the Disney movie \u201cReturn to Oz\u201d (1985) and in the video for the 1985 John Fogerty song \u201cVanz Kant Danz.\u201dIt was also used in the \u201cSpeed Demon\u201d sequence of the Michael Jackson film \u201cMoonwalker\u201d (1988) and in a 1987 episode of the television series \u201cMoonlighting,\u201d in which the clay figure of Maddie (played by Cybill Shepherd) turns David (Bruce Willis) into a toad.By the 1990s, Mr. Vinton had started to shift from Claymation. In one project he used computer animation in commercials for the candy M & Ms, giving distinct personalities to each colored piece.\u201cOur pitch was to make the characters as dimensional as you can, to let the audience know who each of the characters are \u2014 yellow, red and green \u2014 not that they\u2019re just 3D,\u201d he said in the 2011 speech.For characters in \u201cThe PJs,\u201d an animated sitcom created by Eddie Murphy and others about an African-American couple living in a housing project, Mr. Vinton used foam latex, or what he called Foamation, which was lighter and easier to manipulate than clay. The series debuted in 1999 and lasted three seasons.In 2003, after years of financial difficulties at his company, Will Vinton Studios, Mr. Vinton was forced out by the majority shareholder, Phil Knight, the chairman of Nike. Will Vinton Studios eventually became known as Laika, and Mr. Knight\u2019s son Travis, who had worked under Mr. Vinton as an animator, became the chief executive in 2009.Mr. Vinton, who lost ownership of most of his work including the Claymation trademark, sued the elder Mr. Knight, claiming that his dismissal was unfair. A Laika spokeswoman said there had been a financial settlement after the lawsuit was dismissed.In addition to his sister Mary, Mr. Vinton is survived by his wife, Gillian (Frances) Vinton; his sons, Jesse and Billy; his daughter, Alexandra Vinton; and another sister, Alice Vinton. Three previous marriages ended in divorce.After leaving his studio, Mr. Vinton taught at the Art Institute of Portland and worked on independent projects, including a stage musical, \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d based on \u201cThe Frog Prince,\u201d and a live-action comedy short, \u201cThe Martial Artist\u201d (2008).But in an interview with The Portland Tribune this year, he remained loyal to Claymation.\u201cIf I were doing a Claymation show today,\u201d he said, \u201cI would use computer animation in probably 50 percent of it, on tough shots. Close-ups and signature shots would be done in clay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Has a Native American Ancestor. Does That Make Her Native American?", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe senator\u2019s genetic analysis was sound, scientists said. But whether Ms. Warren may claim a cultural kinship with Native Americans is a very different question. In a rare political riposte, Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday released an analysis of her DNA indicating that she has a Native American ancestor, likely between six and 10 generations back in her family history.President Trump has mocked Ms. Warren\u2019s claims of Native American ancestry, often calling her Pocahontas. The new analysis appeared to be scientifically rigorous, researchers said, but it cannot give someone a cultural identity as Native American. The study did not appear in a peer-reviewed journal and had not gotten rigorous scrutiny from other scientists. But Deborah Bolnick, a geneticist at the University of Connecticut who studies Native Americans and was not involved in the analysis, said the Stanford team used well-established methods. \u201cIt\u2019s well done,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with what you might expect if someone had a single ancestor a few generations back.\u201dDr. Bolnick cautioned that membership in a Native American tribe is not something inscribed in DNA. \u201cWhat determines tribal belonging is very much based on a person\u2019s social connections and lived experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are things not defined by the DNA in our bodies.\u201d\u201cUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong,\u201d said Chuck Hoskin Jr., the tribe\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201dIn an interview, Dr. Bustamante said that he didn\u2019t know much about the political controversy before being asked to examine Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA. \u201cI got a phone call out of the blue,\u201d he said.Dr. Bustamante is an adviser to Ancestry.com and has served as an adviser to 23andMe, both consumer testing companies. He said he has not donated money to Ms. Warren.He and his colleagues have developed statistical tools used to look at the DNA of individuals to determine their ancestry. In 2012, for example, they examined the genome of Otzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old hunter who died and was buried under ice in the Alps. (They discovered, to their surprise, that he had strong genetic links to the island of Sardinia.)Ms. Warren had her DNA sequenced at a laboratory with a method known as genotyping, in which researchers examined a small fraction of her DNA.The human genome contains over 3 billion base pairs, the genetic letters that spell out genes. Dr. Bustamante was able to study 764,958 bases of Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA.Dr. Bustamante and his colleagues compared Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA to that of 148 individuals from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.His team found many segments of DNA typical of Europeans and was able to assign 95 percent of Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA to European ancestors.Only five short pieces of DNA stood out as exceptions. Those five contained variants typically found in Native Americans. The biggest of these pieces is 4.7 million bases long.The short length of these segments means that Ms. Warren\u2019s Native American forebear was not a recent ancestor. Instead, the size suggests the ancestor lived six to ten generations ago.Dr. Bustamante cautioned that genes can\u2019t give a perfect picture of ancestry that far back. As more generations pass, it\u2019s more likely that an ancestor\u2019s DNA will disappear entirely from a lineage.\u201cWe can see nearly definitive evidence of at least one Native American ancestor,\u201d Dr. Bustamante said. \u201cBut there could have been more.\u201dIn this respect, Ms. Warren is not exceptional. In 2014, researchers at 23andMe looked at the DNA of people who said they were of European ancestry. The researchers estimated that in as many as five million European-Americans, at least 1 percent of the genome is Native American.Since Dr. Bustamante used a different method to assess Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA, however, it is not possible to compare her ancestry directly to that of 23andMe customers. Dr. Bustamante could not say from Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA which tribe her ancestor belonged to. He was able only to compare Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA to that of indigenous people in Peru and Mexico, as well as First Nations people in Canada. He did not study any Native Americans in the United States, with whom Ms. Warren would presumably be most closely related.Native American tribes have felt exploited and deceived about how their DNA has been studied in the past. The long-running distrust means that relatively little is known of their DNA. Krystal Tsosie, an indigenous geneticist and bioethicist at Vanderbilt University, said another concern among Native Americans is that people might use results from consumer genetic tests to claim that they belong to particular tribes, regardless of a tribe\u2019s own rules for membership.\u201cThere are all these questions about how this can potentially harm our sovereign status,\u201d she said.Without data on Native Americans in the United States, Dr. Bustamante and his colleagues were careful to limit their conclusions. Ms. Warren has an ancestor who descends from the first people who traveled from Asia into the Americas, and from whom Native Americans descended, he said.Ms. Tsosie said she hopes Ms. Warren\u2019s report would put a spotlight on the complicated issues surrounding Native American identity today. Still, she worried that some people might argue that being Native American is nothing more than a result from a DNA test.\u201cI\u2019m really grateful that Elizabeth Warren decided to consult a leader in the field,\u201d Ms. Tsosie said. \u201cBut I\u2019m concerned that these issues will be weaponized.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stumbling Toward Armageddon", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNewly declassified documents show why the Americans and the Soviets came so close to war in 1973.Mr. Radchenko is a professor of international relations at Cardiff University. A nuclear standoff. One leader is drunk. The other is delirious. The underlings scramble to avoid the worst. This is not an end-of-the-world Hollywood thriller, or an episode in President Trump\u2019s erratic diplomacy. It is a story of how the United States and the Soviet Union found themselves on a collision course in the Middle East.The Yom Kippur War, fought over several weeks in October 1973, was a tumultuous conflict between Israel and a coalition of Arab states, led by Egypt and Syria. The war ended with a decisive victory for Israel, but even 45 years later, questions about the roles played by the two Cold War superpowers remain.On the morning of Oct. 6, 1973, taking advantage of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria began a coordinated assault on Israel in a bid to retake the territories lost in the Arab-Israeli War six years earlier. Bolstered by a Soviet airlift, the Egyptians and the Syrians made early gains before Israel reclaimed the initiative on the battlefield. Ignoring a United Nations Security Council call for a cease-fire, the Israelis pressed on.When Mr. Brezhnev\u2019s message arrived, Mr. Nixon was reported to be indisposed; Mr. Kissinger and the White House chief of staff, Alexander Haig, decided not to wake him up. Instead, Mr. Kissinger called together a meeting of principals to consider America\u2019s response. They moved the nuclear alert level to Defcon 3, the highest since the Cuban missile crisis. The letter was sent. But the tougher measures were quietly torpedoed. Someone in the Soviet leadership realized that the general secretary was going off the rails.Mr. Andropov knew what Mr. Kissinger did not: Mr. Brezhnev had developed an addiction to sleeping pills that, combined with alcohol, was undermining his ability to think straight. Mr. Andropov learned of the addiction weeks before the war in the Middle East but refused to intervene. Mr. Brezhnev\u2019s erratic behavior during the war convinced Mr. Andropov of the dangers of inaction. Some of the details remain murky but Mr. Andropov and possibly other senior leaders evidently played a quiet role in keeping their country\u2019s leader from sleepwalking into a world war.Mr. Brezhnev soon recovered his mental faculties. The American escalation to Defcon 3 had a sobering effect on him. The last thing he wanted was a nuclear war with the United States courtesy of an unreliable, trigger-happy Middle Eastern client. Before too long, however, the Soviet Union was embroiled in conflicts in Africa and in 1979 invaded Afghanistan. It is doubtful that Mr. Brezhnev, his health worsening by the day, even realized the gravity of the situation. When he died, in November 1982, the Soviet empire was impossibly overextended and internationally isolated. All of that happened on Mr. Brezhnev\u2019s watch, or, rather, while he slumbered.Forty-five years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union managed to avoid a war. Some of that was thanks to intervention by Mr. Andropov and others, but at least some, undoubtedly, was pure luck for the Soviets. If there is a lesson today\u2019s leaders should heed, it is that in the end, luck always runs out.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistWhen Donald Trump goes on the road, things get peculiar.Elections are coming and the president is all over the place, holding rallies and talking about his priorities. Like immigration and taxes and reminding people that he won the 2016 election.\u201cRemember \u2014 we won Florida,\u201d he told an audience. \u2026 \u201cIn Tennessee, I remember a great Congressman Duncan. \u2026 He said, sir, they\u2019re coming from the hills, the valleys, people that haven\u2019t voted for a long time because they didn\u2019t want to vote for the people that were running for office. And they\u2019ve got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos. \u2026\u201dTo be clear, the congressman is from Tennessee. Trump was in Erie, Pa., when he told the story. And yeah, he did win Florida.We know that the president has a tendency toward incoherence. But it really is useful to listen to one of his rally speeches to be reminded of how very, very deep that goes.For instance, in Ohio he was paying tribute to famous native sons \u2014 William McKinley, Ulysses Grant, the Wright brothers and astronaut Neil Armstrong. That reminded him of the new Ryan Gosling movie about Armstrong. Trump hates the fact that it doesn\u2019t show the American flag being planted on the moon. Here\u2019s what he said about it:\u201cHe\u2019s the man that planted the flag \u2014 think of that \u2014 on the face of the moon. Who\u2019s that? Who are they a relative of \u2014 oh, that\u2019s nice. They weren\u2019t worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them. He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong. Right? Right, fellas?\u201dWell, that last part is sort of useful. Every morning for the next two years I want you to stop at some point during the day and say: \u201cBoom. Wrong. Right? Right, fellas?\u201d It might be very calming.But to be fair, that was not during midterm campaigns. It\u2019s tough going from city to city, day after day, trying to rally some excitement for the local congressional candidates. Trump has been super dedicated. And only a deep cynic would believe it\u2019s just because he enjoys standing in front of a huge crowd and making the whole thing about him.Take that rally in Erie. Trump was supposed to be introducing Mike Kelly, a Republican House member, when he launched into a story: \u201cA congressman came up to me the other day. Said, \u2018Sir, I\u2019ve been winning for many years and I\u2019m a proud congressman. I\u2019ve won many races, 10 to be exact. I\u2019ve only lost three.\u2019\u201c\u2018I said, \u2018You lost three?\u2019\u201d Trump continued as many of his eager listeners waited for him to get to the point. \u201cI\u2019ve only ran one time. One. It was for the presidency. And we won the presidency, right?\u201d Some might have regarded that as a rather cruel put-down of some poor guy who was just trying to get a little attention. But Trump explained that he \u201chad to do it because he was bragging about his political career.\u201dOnly one guy gets to pat himself on the back that vigorously, and this weekend he\u2019ll be appearing in Elko, Nev.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t Mike Kelly, by the way,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cSomebody else.\u201dFinally, we did get back to Kelly, who took the stage and talked about the greatness of Donald Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re the best! You are the best!\u201d he cried.At every rally, Trump constantly brings up Nancy Pelosi, who the Republicans now portray as a combination of Cruella de Vil and the Wicked Witch of the West. Chuck Schumer gets some mentions, but in a totally supporting role.The other names that come up constantly are \u2026 interesting. Hillary Clinton is no surprise, though it\u2019s a little startling that Trump is still yelling about the emails \u201cand you can never forget about Benghazi.\u201d Elizabeth Warren gets more mentions than Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or other possible 2020 opponents. And Maxine Waters, the African-American representative from California, comes up all the time, frequently described as \u201clow I.Q.\u201d and \u201canother beauty.\u201dWhat do all these people have in common?

{"Headline": "The Meritocracy Against Itself", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow Ivy League resentments took over the Kavanaugh debate.Opinion ColumnistThere is only one feeling as grim as the one that she described, and it\u2019s the feeling of being yanked back into a particular kind of college experience \u2014 the elite kind, the hyper-meritocratic kind, the Ivy League kind, the kind that inspires people to write insufferable columns like this one in which sociological observation becomes an excuse to remind your readers that you went to college \u201cin New Haven\u201d or \u201cnear Boston\u201d or wherever Princeton is.But here we are, with Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s college drinking and his social place at Yale suddenly the terrain of discussion and debate while we await the F.B.I.\u2019s reporting. And of course, like any other Ivy-educated journalist, I think I have something to contribute to this awful, privilege-mongering discussion.In particular, the portrait of meritocratic social life that\u2019s being drawn, usually by other elite-educated journalists to explain who Kavanaugh was in college \u2014 the prep school jock, drinking with his buddies and starting bar fights while his less-privileged classmates looked on askance \u2014 is at once terribly familiar and significantly incomplete.Many \u2026 that year describe the social life on campus as extremely tribal and isolating, with the elites and legacies hanging with each other, dominating and creating ripples of inarticulate fear, while the outsiders \u2014 the nerds and the scholarship kids and the people of color \u2014 circled the outskirts seeking friendly alliances.But now hit pause for a moment, because if you read this and then go look me up on Wikipedia (actually, please don\u2019t) you\u2019ll see that I also attended something that could be reasonably described as a prep school \u2014 so who am I, exactly, to declare that there was some huge distance between myself and the Kavanaugh types, or any other preppy clique?And with that question you\u2019ve struck to the heart of the whole meritocratic game, which depends on a reproduction of privilege that pretends to be something else, something fair and open and all about hard work and just deserts. In this game the people whose privilege is particularly obvious, the boarding schoolers and New York toffs and Bethesda country clubbers, play a crucially important role. It\u2019s not just that their parents pay full freight and keep the economics of tuition viable for everyone. It\u2019s that the eliter-than-elite kids themselves help create a provisional inside-the-Ivy hierarchy that lets all the other privileged kids, the ones who are merely upper-upper middle class, feel the spur of resentment and ambition that keeps us running, keeps us competing, keeps us sharp and awful in all the ways that meritocracy requires.Also, note the parenthetical disclosure in the story, where Miller explains how she got in touch with Kavanaugh\u2019s freshman roommate Kit Winter and a friend of his, Itamar Kubovy, who visited their unhappy dorm room: \u201cEditor\u2019s note: Winter, Kubovy, and I went to high school together in New Haven, and Winter\u2019s family and mine were friends.\u201d That \u201chigh school\u201d was Hopkins, currently ranked as the second-best private high school in Connecticut (fullest-possible disclosure: mine is ranked No. 14). So the story Miller is telling is about how a jock from the No. 5 private high school in Maryland was a jerk to his roommate who went to the No. 2 private high school in Connecticut, and who years later communicated the story to a reporter who also went to that same No. 2 private high school, who then wrote it up as a tale of social stratification for our times.But people also need to recognize that the \u201cprofile\u201d we\u2019re being given of Kavanaugh \u2014 a creature of privilege who drank a lot in college and sometimes struck other people as a jerk \u2014 isn\u2019t the narrow profile of a rapist, and isn\u2019t even the somewhat more expansive profile of a particular kind of arrogant preppy. It\u2019s a profile that fits many of the same people attacking him today \u2014 and so part of what we\u2019re watching is one group of meritocrats returning to their undergraduate resentments and trying to pin on Georgetown Prep graduates the vices that define our entire depressing class.If I had known Brett Kavanaugh casually freshman year of college, I probably would have disliked him. But across four years at Harvard I watched the freshman-fall patterns of the preppiest students get imitated, adopted and reproduced by, well, most of us.

{"Headline": "The Problems With Britain\u2019s New Digital Tax", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UK\u2019s finance minister has taken the plunge with a new plan for taxing technology giants \u2014 but it is flawed.Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Monday unveiled a 2 percent tax on the revenue that big search engines, social-media platforms and online marketplaces earn in the country.The digital-services tax appears to target Amazon, Facebook and the Alphabet business Google. All of those companies have been criticized for shifting revenue and costs between jurisdictions, allowing them to minimize profit where tax would otherwise be burdensome. Operating in the virtual world \u2014 and with the resources available to three of the six largest public companies on the planet \u2014 makes that easier than for traditional businesses that have a physical presence.The European Union is considering a similar tax at 3 percent. That is billed as a stopgap, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working on a revamp of cross-border tax rules that would allow the value added to a virtual business by a country\u2019s citizens \u2014 be it via their data or online purchases \u2014 to be identified and taxed in that jurisdiction. But that\u2019s a long shot.Meanwhile, there are problems with Mr. Hammond\u2019s measure.First, the tax may not be aggressive enough. Take Facebook as an example: It generated over 2.2 billion British pounds, or about $2.9 billion, of British digital ad revenue in 2017, according to the market research company eMarketer. A 2 percent slice of that would have earned the government some \u00a345 million. Facebook\u2019s British subsidiary had a bill for cash corporate taxes of just \u00a316 million in the same year.That looks like a step in the right direction. But Facebook\u2019s consolidated pretax profit margin topped 50 percent last year. Assume the same for the United Kingdom under a new global regime with a 20 percent tax on profit, and the company could have been on the hook for well over \u00a3200 million. So it might be better for companies to take a chances with Mr. Hammond\u2019s levy.Another difficulty is that the biggest companies caught by such a tax are based in the United States. Rightly or not, that smacks of protectionism, sour grapes or both. And Washington has little incentive to negotiate, especially if it might lose some of its own tax revenue.Mr. Hammond is also risking a backlash just as Britain heads for Brexit. It\u2019s bold to try to provoke wider change \u2014 but in this case, it might not work.Advertisement"}

Societies no longer need demagogues; they need pedagogues \u2014 people that can tell a country, \u2018Where is it that we want to go, how is it that we want to make it happen, and what is it that everybody has to put in the basket to achieve those goals?\u2019 \u201dColombians have something to teach the rest of us about the need to preserve a vital political center. Long before cocaine wars and guerrilla insurgencies nearly destroyed Colombia in the 1980s and \u201990s, some 200,000 people perished in a civil war in the 1940s through the \u201960s because the country\u2019s liberals and conservatives couldn\u2019t settle their ideological differences peacefully.Politics played as blood sport degrades personal manners and ruins civic institutions. That\u2019s where we are in the United States today. Left unchecked, it blows up countries. Colombians know, because it has taken them three generations to work their way out of the wreckage, and they\u2019re far from done.Colombia\u2019s effort to steer clear of both should be an inspiration. The refugee crisis has put immense pressure on its vulnerable economy. But Duque has refused to scapegoat the migrants or turn his back on them. \u201cWe will never close our borders,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we want to build this fraternity and because we know that this is a bigger challenge.\u201dWhat a difference between Duque\u2019s approach and the \u201cbuild the wall and imprison the kids\u201d crowd currently in power in Washington, Budapest, Rome and other right-wing redoubts. What a difference, too, with the simplistic humanitarianism of Angela Merkel, whose \u201clet them in\u201d approach to the Syrian refugee crisis accounts for much of the anti-immigrant backlash and was never paired with a serious attempt to end the crisis at its Syrian source. Instead, Duque is calling forthrightly for maximum pressure on Caracas, with a clear view toward ending Maduro\u2019s rule. He disavows military solutions \u201cbecause that is what the dictator wants.\u201d But he\u2019s fairly explicit in calling on Venezuelans to take matters in their own hands, and even more so in applying crushing sanctions on the regime.\u201cMartin Luther King used to say that silence can turn you into an accomplice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe stage where we are right now is the stage where we can no longer be indifferent. The whole international community must react.\u201dThose of us who are skeptics of peace deals with terrorists would say: \u201cTold you so.\u201d Duque is committed to keeping but amending the accords. But he complains about the way in which the word \u201cpeace\u201d was manipulated by his predecessor into a partisan wedge issue by treating opponents of the agreement as \u201cenemies of peace.\u201dIn the age of Trump, it\u2019s easy to forget that elitism and demagoguery can also mix with noxious results. Anyone tagged a \u201cwarmonger\u201d simply because they thought the Iran deal was badly negotiated knows the feeling.We are now at a moment when populist demagogues of right or left have won or made major gains in nearly every important recent election: in Pakistan and Mexico; Italy and Sweden; the U.K. and the U.S. It might yet happen again this month in Brazil.To debate the overarching causes is somewhat useless. Unhappy families, to borrow Tolstoy\u2019s line, are unhappy in their own way. Then again, happy families are alike, and so are countries. Reclaiming the extreme center is the way it\u2019s done, and Colombia has lessons worth learning.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Blockchain Could Break Big Tech\u2019s Hold on A.I.", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pairing artificial intelligence and the blockchain might be what you would expect from a scammer looking to make a quick buck in 2018.The two concepts, after all, are two of the most buzzed about and least understood ideas in the tech universe.Despite how easy the combination is to mock, the idea of applying the blockchain to artificial intelligence is attracting a growing roster of serious entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, many of them with impressive academic credentials.Professor Song, Dr. Goertzel and other entrepreneurs say they believe the blockchain could encourage a broader distribution of the data and algorithms that will determine the future development of artificial intelligence.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have machine learning capabilities that are more under the user\u2019s control, rather than relying on these big companies to get access to these capabilities,\u201d Professor Song said in an interview.The start-ups working toward this goal are applying blockchains in a number of ways. At the most basic level, just as the blockchain allows money to be moved around without any bank or central authority in the middle, artificial intelligence experts are hoping that a blockchain can allow artificial intelligence networks to access large stores of data without any big company in control of the data or the algorithms.Several start-ups are setting up blockchain-based marketplaces, where people can buy and sell data.Unlike Google and Facebook, which store the data they get from users, the marketplaces built on Ocean Protocol will not have the data themselves; they will just be places for people with data to meet, ensuring that no central player can access or exploit the data.The goal, Mr. McConaghy said, is to \u201cdecentralize access to data before it\u2019s too late.\u201dOcean is working with several automakers to collect data from cars to help create the artificial intelligence of autonomous cars. All the automakers are expected to share data so none of them have a monopoly over it.Another start-up, Revel, will pay people to collect the data that companies are looking for, like pictures of taxis or recordings of a particular language. Users can also let their phones and computers be used to process and categorize the images and sounds \u2014 all in exchange for digital tokens. Over a thousand people already have put their computers to work.These sorts of marketplaces are only the outer layer of the blockchain-based systems that are being built to handle artificial intelligence data.One of the biggest concerns that people have about the data being collected by Google and Facebook is the access it gives these companies to the most private details of our lives.Professor Song is working on a blockchain, known as Oasis, that will use advanced techniques to secure the data being bought and sold, so that no one \u2014 not even the company using the data \u2014 will get a copy of it.In the Oasis network, all data moving through the system will be locked into encrypted bundles. Researchers will be able to run the data through their machine learning algorithms \u2014 and prove that the calculations were done correctly \u2014 without ever actually seeing the underlying data.One project building on top of Oasis, known as Kara, will allow medical researchers looking at the behavior of specific diseases to train their machine learning models with data from actual patients, without the data ever being exposed.Oasis has already raised $45 million from several big-name venture capital firms, but they have competition from another start-up created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called Enigma.Enigma got started before Oasis and is working with partners like Ocean Protocol to ensure that people contributing data to marketplaces can set the exact terms under which their data can be used.\u201cIt lets you have a network of A.I.s that nobody owns,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said.Hanson Robotics is planning to use SingularityNET to feed information into its humanoid robot, Sophia. Unlike Amazon\u2019s Alexa service, which answers questions using services approved by Amazon, Dr. Goertzel wants Sophia to reach out to other artificial intelligence providers if she can\u2019t find the right answer.\u201cWe are now using SingularityNET to upgrade Sophia\u2019s intelligence,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said. \u201cIn principle, it is much more flexible because we don\u2019t have a centrally controlled market.\u201dAs with most blockchain applications, a lot of technical work still must be done before these new systems can take off \u2014 and it is not clear that all of the roadblocks are surmountable. Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, is investing in the area, but he says he believes it will take some time before these systems can prove themselves. He is hopeful that when they do, they will play an important role in democratizing the industry.\u201cRight now the data isn\u2019t really being valued in an open market, it\u2019s just being given to a few companies,\u201d Mr. Ehrsam said. \u201cWhat if there was now a free market for data?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Sears Helped Oppose Jim Crow", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor black Southerners in 1900, shopping locally meant enduring indignities and implicit threats. Enter the catalog.Mr. Hyman is an economic historian.Every year I give a lecture on the history of retail in which Sears, central to American shopping for a century, plays a starring role. On Monday, when Sears filed for bankruptcy protection, I got a little wistful \u2014 not because I was particularly attached to the company, but because of the largely unsung role of its iconic catalog in helping African-Americans evade the injustices and humiliations of the Jim Crow era.Historians typically date the Jim Crow era to the Mississippi Plan of 1890, which amended Mississippi\u2019s Constitution to allow the disenfranchisement of African-Americans. But the true onset of this era came earlier, and it started with shopping. In 1883, the Supreme Court voided the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had banned discrimination in public businesses like theaters, restaurants, trains and shops. The loss of political rights, then, followed the loss of consumer rights. Jim Crow was active white resistance to black people\u2019s freedom both at the ballot box and at the local shop.Every time black Southerners went to a local store, they were forced to wait as white customers were served first. Serving white customers before black ones might seem a relatively small insult, but behind that racial ordering was an omnipresent threat of violence. Products in these stores reminded black shoppers that whites did not consider them deserving of human dignity: Grotesque caricatures of black faces were used as a \u201chumorous\u201d way to sell toothpaste, soap and nearly anything else; far more harrowing, with the rise of public \u201cspectacle\u201d lynching in the 1890s, black people could find the charred remains of lynching victims for sale alongside postcards commemorating the event.Waiting for service was not mere discrimination. It was part of a larger world of white violence.Then there was the matter of buying items on credit. Farmers, white and black, depended on credit to survive until the harvest. Credit came through small general stores, where the (white) shopkeeper would decide what you were allowed to buy. Black sharecroppers would often be in perpetual debt to a store, which was often owned by their landlord and employer. The credit price for goods, higher than the cash price, always managed to leave sharecroppers a little in the red even after they were paid for their crops. This debt system bound black farmers to the land in an almost feudal fashion. Adding insult to injury, black people were often even not allowed to purchase the same quality clothes as white people.If you were a black Southerner in 1900, finding another way to shop would have been a godsend. Enter the Sears catalog.The catalog, which was introduced around 1891, undid the power of the storekeeper, the landlord and, by extension, the racially marked consumerism of Jim Crow. All of a sudden, black families could buy whatever they wanted without asking permission. The Sears catalog, unlike the earlier Montgomery Ward catalog, also offered credit. With that credit, black farmers could buy the same overalls and hats as white people, and even the same guns (and farm equipment).Prices were lower, too. Indeed, the catalog was so successful in part because it brought low prices to the countryside. And flipping through the catalog was like strolling through a department store in Chicago. For sharecroppers who had often never have left the county in which they were born, the catalog was a window into another, freer life.Shopkeepers resisted this newfound freedom. They convinced their customers to burn the catalogs in public squares, and offered prizes for the most catalogs destroyed. Part of the resistance was economic, pushing back against the catalog\u2019s threat to local businesses, but the racism of Jim Crow was also at work. In an attempt to discourage whites from using the catalog, shopkeepers told them that Sears was a black company, and that was why it sold by mail \u2014 to hide its black face.Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck, the company\u2019s founders, published photos to \u201cprove\u201d they were white. They were not anti-racist crusaders. But in an important sense, it didn\u2019t matter to black customers whether Sears itself was for or against Jim Crow. Simply by giving African-Americans equal access to consumer goods, the company doing something radical, even if it was profitable.This aspect of the Sears legacy is a reminder that retail is never just about buying things; it is also part of a larger system of power that seeks to define and control us. Politics and commerce are never far apart. Capitalism promised both the right to property and the right to shop. Jim Crow denied both.Today, it is easy to take for granted the ability to buy what you want, if you have the money. But that still is not always the case. In some ways, the freedom of the Sears catalog is echoed in how online shopping allows transgender people to buy clothes without being harassed and African-Americans to browse without being followed down the aisles. Even the conservative right to spend your own money still contains radical possibilities.Louis Hyman, the director of the Institute for Workplace Studies at the ILR School at Cornell, is the author of \u201cTemp: How American Work, American Business and the American Dream Became Temporary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Well, from at least one member of the House of Romanov: the self-declared Grand Duchess Maria of Russia.The duchess is a resident of Spain who claims to be the rightful heir to the crown that disappeared from Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Czar Alexander II, who was assassinated in 1881 and was a grandfather of Nicholas II, the czar who was killed, along with his wife and five children, by the Bolsheviks in 1918.\u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is a drama in which each movie-length episode centers on characters who are meant to be descendants of Russian royalty, but are living today, such as an elderly woman in Paris struggling to cope with a Muslim caregiver, and an American man experiencing marital problems.The chancellery\u2019s news release said that descendants of the Russian crown have a \u201cfascinating history\u201d ripe for television. But the release said that Matthew Weiner, the creator of \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d had squandered the chance to present that history.

Just saying.The question now is whether voters are going to re-elect these guys. Both are from safe Republican districts \u2014 Hunter, who represents a rural-suburban area outside San Diego, inherited his seat from his father, and it\u2019s been in the family since 1981.His opponent, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, is only 29, but he worked in the Obama White House, and as a director at the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and he owns a media consulting company. It\u2019s a pretty impressive history for a guy who grew up poor, the son of a Mexican-American mother whose husband had left the family.That missing father was of Palestinian descent, and Campa-Najjar\u2019s paternal grandfather, who died before he was born, was part of the 1972 Munich massacre of Olympic athletes.We can either celebrate Campa-Najjar as an example of the American ability to move beyond the dead weight of your family\u2019s past, or jump right into the great swamp of terrorism-terrorizing.His opponent, Nate McMurray, hoped that Collins would eventually get desperate. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s down, he\u2019s going to throw that Hail Mary, and if he does that, we\u2019re going to intercept that ball, and we\u2019re going to run it back,\u201d said the Democrat. The district is near Buffalo, where sports metaphors are very popular.Collins, who seems to rely heavily on mentioning the name of Nancy Pelosi whenever possible, is still a slight favorite to win in a district that Donald Trump won by 25 points. The voters still have more than a week to decide whether they really want a congressman who uses the \u201cValues\u201d section of his web page to define \u201cPersonal Accountability\u201d as \u201cnever increasing entitlement programs.\u201dPennsylvania boasted two indicted Democrats.

{"Headline": "No Dogs in the House", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia DiarySutherland ShireBy Daniel NourOn a school night in 2006, my dad told me to get in the car for a quick ride.I was sixteen, a little lonely and had mentioned to my parents that I\u2019d like a dog. In my neighborhood in Sydney\u2019s predominately white Sutherland Shire, everyone seemed to have one and I didn\u2019t feel that we, as Egyptian-Australians, should be any different.When I first saw Max, a huge seven-year-old boxer, tawny save for his white chest paws, I felt immediate and visceral fear.He looked so aggressive \u2014 nothing like the harmless childhood fantasies of lassie types, slender and golden with bushy tails and playful demeanors.No, this was a man\u2019s dog: Strong, muscular and dangerous.Our first encounter was abrupt. He sat heavy on my lap in the front seat the whole ride home, looking back dolefully at the owner who he left behind.I too was feeling a little torn; even then, I knew what lay ahead \u2014 the inevitable arguments about whether Max would be an \u201cinside\u201d or an \u201coutside\u201d dog.This was an animal, well-liked but by no means a \u201cmember of the family.\u201dWhen we got him in the house my mum and sisters leapt into protest about his ugly face, the sheer size of him and the possibility that he was a biter. They quickly declared that he would sleep outside.Within mere days, Max had migrated from the backyard, to the doormat, and then, eventually, to wherever the hell he liked.It was his expression of adorable sincerity that melted my parents\u2019 resolve. He was also talented, able to perform tricks like \u201cplay dead,\u201d \u201cshake\u201d and \u201csit.\u201dUnlike the other dogs we had randomly collected throughout my childhood, he seemed to listen and, astoundingly, to understand. He would routinely go for walks around the neighborhood by himself and then come back on his own accord: sometime we didn\u2019t notice that he had done so, save for the open gate left swinging in his wake.Boxers are European dogs, and Max suffered admirably through the extremes of the scorching Australian summer, panting heavily for months on end while enormous horseflies bit his thin ears raw and bloody scabs formed. Where the chemical solution from the vet failed, dad concocted an altogether more ethnic remedy of vinegar and kerosene, more suited to a bonfire than to a medical treatment.By then, my mum, with her feigned apathy, had also fallen prey to Max\u2019s charms. Once, when she didn\u2019t know anyone was looking, I saw her pet him and call him \u201chabibi,\u201d which is Arabic for \u201csweetheart\" or, more dramatically, \u201cbeloved.\u201dThen he got sick. It wasn\u2019t like the time he got pancreatitis because we were feeding him the wrong kind of food, or when he hurt his eye playing fetch at the park. It came on suddenly and gave no warning signs.He died quietly in the night. Dad and I dug a hole for him in the backyard before I left for work that morning. Afterward, while cleaning up the mess he left after suffering what we think was a stroke, I cried bitterly.We had a funeral for Max later that day. We sat outside, in silence, in an open forum seating square, Arab-style. It was only half in jest.I miss him and think of him often, lying across my lap or at my feet: an \u201cinside dog\u201d to the last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Says Russian Firms \u2018Scraped\u2019 Data, Some for Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook said Thursday that it had removed any accounts associated with SocialDataHub and its sister firm, Fubutech, because the companies violated its policies by scraping data from the social network.\u201cFacebook has reason to believe your work for the government has included matching photos from individuals\u2019 personal social media accounts in order to identify them,\u201d the company said in a cease-and-desist letter to SocialDataHub that was dated Tuesday and viewed by The New York Times.Facebook gave the companies until Friday to detail what data they had taken and then delete it all.The case illustrates a new reality for Facebook. SocialDataHub and Fubutech have been around for at least four years, relying in part on Facebook data to build products that might alarm some civil-liberty advocates.As Facebook is taking a closer look at its own products amid increasing scrutiny and public outcry, it is finding more examples of companies that have been exploiting its global social network for questionable ends.SocialDataHub and Fubutech also present another challenge because, Facebook said, at least some of their data collection occurred through web scraping.Scraping is a rudimentary technique in which computer programmers can pull information off a website. It is difficult to detect and prevent, Facebook said. Scraping can pull any data that\u2019s left public on a Facebook profile \u2014 and, theoretically, more private data about the user\u2019s Facebook friends.Artur Khachuyan, the 26-year-old chief executive of SocialDataHub and Fubutech, said in an interview Friday that Facebook had deleted his companies\u2019 accounts unfairly.Fubutech does build facial-recognition software for the Russian government and uses Facebook data, but it scrapes Google search results for that information \u2014 not Facebook, he said. And SocialDataHub\u2019s main product \u2014 a system that assigns scores to Russian citizens based on their social-media profiles for insurers and banks \u2014 required permission from the users it rates, he said.Mr. Khachuyan said that he taught Russian journalism students how to scrape the web and that two of them had scraped Facebook for the public profiles of their classmates. He believes Facebook mistook the students\u2019 activity for his companies\u2019 work.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a reason to deactivate our accounts,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why Facebook deletes Instagram account of my dog.\u201d That account, for \u201cMars the Blue Corgi,\u201d had 176 followers.Katy Dormer, a Facebook spokeswoman, rejected Mr. Khachuyan\u2019s claim that Facebook had conflated his students\u2019 activity with the actions of his companies.\u201cWe don\u2019t take these actions lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact we took the action and sent the letter means we saw enough evidence.\u201dFacebook\u2019s removal of SocialDataHub and Fubutech reflects a larger problem for the social media company as it evaluates its relationship with third-party apps that have access to people\u2019s Facebook data.Mr. Khachuyan said the letter from Facebook had surprised him, particularly because his companies have been operating the same way for years.\u201cAll in Russia know about us for minimum four years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that Facebook sent that only now.\u201dHe said Fubutech scraped data from the web, particularly Google search and the Russian search engine Yandex, to build a database of Russian citizens and their images that the government can use for facial recognition. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what they do with it,\u201d he said.\u201cMaybe government clients connect our software to C.C. cameras,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said, referring to closed-circuit cameras. \u201cMaybe they connect it to social profiles.\u201dMr. Khachuyan compared Fubutech to Palantir, the Palo Alto, Calif., tech company that does data analysis for the American government. At one point in a 30-minute phone interview, he said the Russian Defense Ministry was a client, but later said he could not name Fubutech\u2019s government clients.His other firm, SocialDataHub, works with insurers and banks to evaluate potential customers. Between 30,000 and 50,000 Russian citizens have given SocialDataHub permission to analyze their Facebook profiles to assign a score between zero and 10, which insurers and banks use to help set rates or approve credit cards.\u201cIf you\u2019re a bad client, you have zero to three,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said.He said his companies, which share 52 employees in Moscow, complied with Facebook policies; they use Facebook data only when it is public and available on Google search, or if the user has granted them permission. He said the techniques were also legal in Russia.\u201cIt\u2019s a trick in our federal law to use that data, but that works only with Russian citizens,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said.At the top of the SocialDataHub\u2019s website, there is a single line: \u201cWe know everything about everybody.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Colorado Save America? ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "OpinionIt\u2019s impossible to drive across the state and not be reminded of the first boundlessness of American potential. Supported byOpinion ColumnistNucla, population just over 700, was founded around 1900 by a utopian socialist group, lived off uranium mining during the Cold War and has now turned to the cultivation of marijuana\u2019s cousin, hemp, in a stab at a revival. It\u2019s heavily Republican, like most of small-town America. It is also part of what Deana Sheriff, an economic recovery coordinator, called \u201cthe Mild West\u201d \u2014 complete with broadband and a mill for heritage grains. Nobody is running around with six-shooters on hips taking potshots at streetlights.On the eve of critical midterm elections, Colorado presents an American microcosm, its population of 5.6 million split more or less evenly among Republicans, Democrats and independents. Liberals, including an influx of immigrants, tend to inhabit the more urban Front Range, east of the Rockies; Trump support is intense in the rural Western Slope. Montrose County, home to Nucla, voted 67.9 percent for Trump in 2016; Colorado, thanks mainly to Denver and Boulder, gave Hillary Clinton a narrow victory.John Hickenlooper, the term-limited Democratic governor, told me that when he goes to the East Coast, \u201cI do feel like an outsider. The way we approach things here, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re speaking a different language. In the West, I think there is an inclination, almost an instinct, to sit down with people you disagree with and sort of sort through\u201d \u2014 as he did with the oil and gas industry to produce a rational energy policy, the nation\u2019s first regulatory framework limiting future emissions.Might he, eyeing 2020, run for the Democratic Party nomination for president on this can-do, bridge-building platform? \u201cWe are certainly looking at it,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cWe spent the summer talking to people that are really smart. I\u2019m preparing, but don\u2019t think I\u2019d make a decision probably until February.\u201dThat sounds to me like a yes. A Hickenlooper candidacy would be interesting because there\u2019s no way to govern Colorado, as he has for eight years, without dealing with the way Trump has tapped into a deep-seated economic and cultural frustration. Trump support is no abstraction here, or cause for derision. It\u2019s a fact. The feeling of being left behind, forgotten or cheated by a rigged system in a country of sharpening inequality is America\u2019s core dilemma. The question now is who will more effectively convince Americans that the American dream can be restored: Trump, with his unscrupulous rabble-rousing and America-first nationalism masking tax and other policies that favor the one percent, or a Democratic Party that rediscovers the ability to speak to small-town and blue-collar and barely middle-class America (like the teachers who went on strike in Colorado this year) in a way that does not sound patronizing? At the 5th Avenue Grill in Nucla, with its trophy elk on the wall and a sign saying \u201cHome of the Free Because of the Brave,\u201d Bob Ralph, a plumber, had no doubt. He told me: \u201cA year ago we would have been the only ones here. Now you have to wait for a table. The hardware store has people waiting in line. People are eager to open businesses. I hope Trump will be a two-term president.\u201dIn the last 10 presidential elections, going back to 1980, Colorado has voted Republican six times but Democratic in the last three. It\u2019s a state with a strong libertarian streak, suspicious of government, and so in a sense Republican-inclined; but it\u2019s been won over by strong local Democratic leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all a blue state to be taken for granted; things can easily be reversed,\u201d Ken Salazar, a former secretary of the interior in the Obama administration and a Colorado native, told me. \u201cPeople will vote for results-oriented candidates. Results matter: That\u2019s the Coloradan standard.\u201d\u201cThe one thing you learn in the restaurant business,\u201d the governor told me, \u201cis there is no margin in having enemies. The only way you persuade someone is to listen harder.\u201d[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]As a two-term Denver mayor starting in 2003, and now a two-term governor, Hickenlooper has listened, driven by the conviction that, as he put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to kind of wallow in the partisan mud pit, right?\u201dSome issues elude compromise, of course. In 2013, after the Aurora theater mass shooting the previous year, Hickenlooper signed into law a ban on high-capacity gun magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. This is the measure that incensed Richard Craig and led, as a protest, to Nucla\u2019s obligatory gun-ownership ordinance.\u201cI just got mad because these talking heads decided we did not need high-capacity magazines, and we ended up losing a firearms accessory factory with dozens of jobs that went to Wyoming,\u201d Craig said.Over in nearby Grand Junction, the largest town on the Western Slope, such views are widespread, even if the Mild West is evident again on a Main Street offering lattes, pottery and beads. On the way into town is a large billboard that went up after Trump\u2019s ignominious July meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. It says \u201cG.O.P.\u201d on a red background with the \u201cO\u201d replaced by the Communist hammer-and-sickle.I met Landman, who moved to Grand Junction from Los Angeles, \u201cbecause you can still be by yourself on the final frontier,\u201d in a bagel cafe. To her, the Trump phenomenon has been about releasing xenophobic emotions suppressed as the country headed in a direction many did not like. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to see it. And now that box has been opened, I\u2019m not sure how we close it again.\u201d As we spoke, Elisa Allen, who was on vacation with her family from Baltimore and had seen the billboard, approached. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to find some sanity in the craziness,\u201d she said, pressing $40 on Landman. I drove across town to see Pastor Robert Babcox, who dismissed the billboard as a vile insult (\u201clike saying all Democrats are Nazis\u201d) and listed his reasons for backing Trump.I asked Babcox about a Hickenlooper run for president. \u201cHe\u2019d be foolish to do that, does not stand a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a silly law that high-capacity magazine thing is! He wants to make us like California, but you\u2019re not going to have Priuses around here.\u201dSo are Democrats the enemy? Babcox became reflective, recalling Navy days when, he said, he learned the blood of all Americans runs red. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re all too wrapped up in our differences to see our similarities,\u201d he told me. \u201cI say to Liberals, let\u2019s try to find things we can agree on.\u201dIt seemed a genuine Coloradan sentiment.The race for Hickenlooper\u2019s successor as governor pits Walker Stapleton, the Republican state treasurer, against Jared Polis, a five-term Democratic congressman from Boulder who made a fortune in online start-ups. A recent poll from the American Politics Research Lab in Boulder shows Polis leading Stapleton, 54 percent to 42 percent.Polis seems to be gaining most traction through his bold proposals for universal full-day preschool, powering Colorado\u2019s energy grid 100 percent from renewables by 2040 and ending what, in an interview, he called the \u201cbig health care rip off,\u201d perhaps through a single-payer system.Anger at Trump and the erosion of middle-class life seems to have reinforced a progressive mood among Coloradans. This is suggested by strong support for Amendment 73, a state constitutional amendment that would raise taxes on individuals earning over $150,000 and corporations to increase public school spending. Seth Cagin is one of these mobilized Coloradans. A retired publisher in Telluride, he has knocked on several thousand doors in his campaign as a Democratic candidate for the State House. He\u2019d never run for office before Trump came along. His is an uphill struggle in generally conservative counties, including Montrose. But Cagin finds that wedge issues like guns, immigration and abortion tend to obscure the fact that many Coloradans of whatever political persuasion want the same things: affordable health care, better schools, higher wages and protection of Colorado\u2019s public lands and water. They want a chance at a middle class life in a decent environment. Yet, as Cagin told me, \u201cOne thing every single Trump supporter knows as soon as you start to talk to them is that we think they\u2019re dumb and look down on them.\u201d Democrats, he suggested, might reflect on that.Don Colcord, a pharmacist and one of the rare Democrats in Nucla, also believes that the party needs to stop alienating small-town America. Environmental concerns are worthy, but what happens when, as in Nucla, they lead to the imminent shutdown of a coal-fired power plant with the loss of dozens of jobs and the tax base that pays for schools? \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrificial cow to the environmental movement,\u201d he said.While I was in Nucla, I went to the funeral service at the First Baptist Church for Lacie Redd, a 34-year-old divorced mother of two girls who had just committed suicide by shooting herself.Redd\u2019s mother, Glenna Nix, worked at Colcord\u2019s pharmacy. He knows the family. Redd suffered from seizures; her prescription medicine was wildly expensive. \u201cThirty tablets cost more than $1,000, and she needed more than one a day, and she was fighting and fighting to get insurance to cover it, and sometimes she\u2019d run out,\u201d Colcord recalled. In the end, it was too much for Redd \u2014 caring for her girls, coping with seizures, getting her medicine, just plain surviving.\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful things about free enterprise,\u201d Colcord reflected. \u201cAnd a lot of devastating things, too. Good-old America. Yeah, good-old America.\u201dAmerica cannot find enduring solutions to big problems like health care one party at a time. But Washington has lost the capacity for negotiated outcomes. Trump\u2019s Republicans are all about slash-and-burn. As Senator Bennet told me: \u201cWe can\u2019t get anything of importance done. When was the last time you heard a politician say I only got 65 percent of what I wanted but here is why I think we should do it?\u201dAgainst this backdrop of paralysis, Colorado has done better. The grandeur of its beauty and space seem to stir some nobler instinct in the name of preserving nature and advancing the common good. It\u2019s impossible to drive across the state and not be reminded of the first boundlessness of American potential. People disagree; they are not, however, disagreeable.\u201cThe West is the most collaborative place,\u201d Hickenlooper told me. \u201cIt\u2019s still the place where people can come and be defined by how big their dream is and how hard they are willing to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The rich are banning screens from class altogether.Supported byThe parents in Overland Park, Kan., were fed up. They wanted their children off screens, but they needed strength in numbers. First, because no one wants their kid to be the lone weird one without a phone. And second, because taking the phone away from a middle schooler is actually very, very tough.\u201cWe start the meetings by saying, \u2018This is hard, we\u2019re in a new frontier, but who is going to help us?\u2019\u201d said Krista Boan, who is leading a Kansas City-based program called START, which stands for Stand Together And Rethink Technology. \u201cWe can\u2019t call our moms about this one.\u201dFor the last six months, at night in school libraries across Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., about 150 parents have been meeting to talk about one thing: how to get their children off screens.The psychologist Richard Freed, who wrote a book about the dangers of screen-time for children and how to connect them back to real world experiences, divides his time between speaking before packed rooms in Silicon Valley and his clinical practice with low-income families in the far East Bay, where he is often the first one to tell parents that limiting screen-time might help with attention and behavior issues. \u201cI go from speaking to a group in Palo Alto who have read my book to Antioch, where I am the first person to mention any of these risks,\u201d Dr. Freed said. \u201cThe digital divide was about access to technology, and now that everyone has access, the new digital divide is limiting access to technology,\u201d said Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired magazine.Some parents, pediatricians and teachers around the country are pushing back. \u201cThese companies lied to the schools, and they\u2019re lying to the parents,\u201d said Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting duped.\u201d\u201cOur kids, my kids included, we are subjecting them to one of the biggest social experiments we have seen in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens to my daughter if she can\u2019t communicate over dinner \u2014 how is she going to find a spouse? How is she going to interview for a job?\u201d\u201cI have families now that go teetotal,\u201d Dr. Burgert said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done.\u2019\u201dOne of those families are the Brownsbergers, who had long banned smartphones but recently also banned the internet-connected television.She and her husband, who runs a decorative concrete company, keep their children away from cellphones but found that even a little exposure to screen time changed the boys\u2019 behavior. Her older son, who has A.D.H.D., would get angry when the screen had to be turned off, she said, which worried her.His Christmas wish list was a Wii, a PlayStation, a Nintendo, a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.\u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Kiddo, you\u2019re not gonna get one of those things,\u2019\u201d Ms. Brownsberger said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the mean mom.\u201d\u201cIt takes a community to support this,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I was just talking to my neighbor last night \u2014 \u2018Am I the worst mom ever?\u2019\u201dMs. Boan has three pilots running with about 40 parents in each, looking at best practices for getting kids off phones and screens. Overland Park\u2019s Chamber of Commerce is supporting the work, and the city is working to incorporate elements of digital wellness into its new strategic vision.In Silicon Valley, some feel anxious about the growing class divide they see around screen-time. Kirstin Stecher and her husband, who works as an engineer at Facebook, are raising their kids almost completely screen-free.\u201cIs this coming from a place of information \u2014 like, we know a lot about these screens,\u201d she said. \u201cOr is it coming from a place of privilege, that we don\u2019t need them as badly?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a message out there that your child is going to be crippled and in a different dimension if they\u2019re not on the screen,\u201d said Pierre Laurent, a former Microsoft and Intel executive now on the board of trustees at Silicon Valley\u2019s Waldorf School. \u201cThat message doesn\u2019t play as well in this part of the world.\u201d \u201cPeople in this region of the world understand that the real thing is everything that\u2019s happening around big data, AI, and that is not something that you\u2019re going to be particularly good at because you have a cellphone in fourth grade,\u201d Mr. Laurent said.Dr. Freed, though, argues these tools are too relied upon in schools for low-income children. And he sees the divide every day as he meets tech-addicted children of middle and low-income families. \u201cFor a lot of kids in Antioch, those schools don\u2019t have the resources for extracurricular activities, and their parents can\u2019t afford nannies,\u201d Dr. Freed said. He said the knowledge gap around tech\u2019s danger is enormous.\u201cOnce it sinks its teeth into these kids, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d Dr. Freed said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants.I am a librarian and a white woman. A few years ago, I was working at the reference desk at a library in a suburb of Salt Lake City when an older white woman came to me and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s a black man in the children\u2019s area.\u201d I looked at her with concern and replied, \u201cWhat exactly would you like me to do with that information, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cI just thought you should know.\u201d I replied, \u201cI do know. That is Mr. \u2014, he is our neighbor and brings his children to story time every week.\u201dI went to a famous medical school that I prefer not to name. I was studying in a conference room at midnight during a blizzard, wearing a baseball cap backward, a T-shirt and socks. Police officers approached me with reports that I was robbing the medical school and were in the process of handcuffing me when I said, \"How can I rob this place in a blizzard, wearing socks?\" They asked for proof that I was a medical student (a bunch of medical books wasn't enough). The problem was, we didn\u2019t have student IDs. This was the fifth time I was harassed by police within six months. Soon after, the school issued IDs so that kids of color could prove that we belonged. I\u2019m white, but I\u2019ll never forget the time my son and his black friend \u2014 they were both about 8 or 9 at the time \u2014 went to an art store in Noe Valley, San Francisco, to get some markers. They came home empty-handed and told the same story: A salesperson in the store followed my son\u2019s friend around and then told him to get out.I brought them back to the store and sent them in first. Then I casually walked in, not acknowledging them, and pretended to shop. Immediately, the salesperson started following my son\u2019s friend. You should have seen her face when I said they were with me.I\u2019m an older white woman who shares a home with a black woman and her two sons. One evening, her oldest son, who is 18, wanted to walk up to the convenience store at the front of our neighborhood. She would not let him. She insisted that she drive him there. I gave her a bit of a hard time about babying her 18-year-old, telling her that my son used to make that walk all the time when he was younger and that it was perfectly safe.

{"Headline": "Katniss Everdeen Is My Hero", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayKatniss Everdeen and I met on a rainy Virginia day in 2010. I\u2019d seen \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and its sequels at nearly every bookshop I visited. On that particular day, feeling glum about my own failed attempts to write, I decided to pick up this book everyone was talking about.I read the first quarter right there in the store, bought the sequels, and ignored my family for the next few days while I binge-read the series.Dystopias were not new, of course. As a high schooler, I\u2019d read about power hungry governments (\u201cBrave New World,\u201d \u201c1984\u201d), and in college, I\u2019d discovered underage death battles (\u201cBattle Royale\u201d) and ambiguous but hopeful endings (\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe Giver\u201d).Suzanne Collins\u2019s pointed social commentary about war drew me in, and her almost journalistic writing style helped the pages fly by. But it was Katniss who kept me hooked. Complex, flawed Katniss, with her bow and her braid and her tempered fury. Katniss with her fierce familial love and cussed hope. Katniss, who, as a teenage girl, is scarred and underestimated and dismissed by her government. Until they finally figure out how dangerous she is.Katniss is a character of contradictions. She\u2019s skilled at hunting but she second-guesses herself constantly. Her strength keeps her alive, but her decisions are often questionable. Her struggles made her real and vulnerable \u2014 enough that I could imagine myself in her shoes. Enough that her character stayed with me, long after I finished the books.Clearly, I wasn\u2019t alone. In the 10 years since its publication, the trilogy has been translated into 53 languages, with more than 100 million copies in print. Its success altered the landscape of young adult fiction. If Harry Potter revealed a vast market hungry for children\u2019s literature and Twilight extended the market to young adult books, The Hunger Games cemented the buying power of that market.Waves of heroine-led dystopian books followed Collins\u2019s, including many that spawned their own huge fan bases, like Veronica Roth\u2019s \u201cDivergent\u201d and Marie Lu\u2019s \u201cLegend.\u201d The rise of social media allowed fans to form communities on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to share art, theories, blog-posts, videos, dream casts and reviews \u2014 all of which are still very much a part of young adult publishing.And so Katniss became an embodiment of teenage anger. One that was respected and vaunted, immortalized on the big screen, in cosplays and even action figures.\u201cKatniss Everdeen\u2019s name always booms through me like a firework,\u201d says Dhonielle Clayton, author of \u201cThe Belles,\u201d and chief operating officer of We Need Diverse Books, a nonprofit organization. \u201cA bright reminder of what is required to change the world: defiance, irreverence and a stubborn determination. I needed to read girls like her; girls who weren\u2019t so nice; girls so angry that their rage could topple anything in their path; girls that could face the dark; girls who could never be contained.\u201dIndeed Collins\u2019s vision for a heroine was uncannily prescient, as is so much else in the series. Katniss\u2019s story is set in Panem, ruled by the Capitol, which uses propaganda to turn the populace against each other and hang onto power. Class divisions are rife, and the economically disadvantaged are forced to become participants in their own oppression. Rebels are quickly silenced. The Capitol\u2019s cunning media encourages an obsession with perfection that permeates every aspect of society.To survive all this, Katniss adapts. Her enemies do not expect her to. Again, they underestimate her.Leigh Bardugo, author of the forthcoming \u201cKing of Scars,\u201d recalled the scene in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d where Katniss gets a makeover. \u201cCollins spoke to aspiration and commodification all at once, and the larger way Katniss is forced to transform in order to survive. She has to become a girlfriend, a proto-wife, and then a prospective mother to garner the sympathy and interest of the crowd. She has to belong to a certain kind of narrative to be seen as valuable at all \u2014 and that\u2019s something young women and girls soak up every day from the media and on their Instagram feeds.\u201dKatniss uses her commodification against the Capitol. She fakes a romance to survive. She pretends docility to win over crowds. But doing so has its costs. In \u201cCatching Fire,\u201d a dress Katniss wears transforms into a symbol of rebellion. In response, the Capitol brutally murders the dress\u2019s creator. The scene sends a message that applies as much to Katniss\u2019s world as to our own: Challenging power-hungry governments can be deadly.But that message also emphasizes one of the trilogy\u2019s primary strengths: The story is ugly, because life is ugly. Heroes are not always heroic. The good guys do not always win, and when they do, they are haunted. Collins\u2019s acknowledgment of the lasting impact of war on Katniss\u2019s psyche is heartbreaking and powerful. This young woman who had been so ill-used by her country, a woman who stood up and fought anyway, would never be fully healed.And they should never, ever be underestimated.Sabaa Tahir is the author of \u201cAn Ember in the Ashes,\u201d \u201cA Torch Against the Night\u201d and, most recently, \u201cA Reaper at the Gates.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Really Help Children Abroad ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesFor Americans who volunteer to serve the poor in foreign orphanages, there are many better ways in which to do good than working directly with the children. The internet has made it very easy for unscrupulous orphanages to attract volunteers and donors, and for volunteers to continue raising funds through blog posts and Facebook pages \u2014 often with the ubiquitous orphan in a selfie. For sure, every backpacker on a volunteer trip and Christian on a short-term mission to help children wants to do as much good as possible. So what can donors and volunteers do?Drop the idea of \u201csaving\u201d people.An influential series of books by Steve Corbett and Brian Fikkert, beginning with \u201cWhen Helping Hurts,\u201d has persuaded many churches to rethink their short-term missions. The authors argue for abandoning terms commonly used by church volunteers, like \u201crescuing\u201d people or \u201cbringing hope.\u201d Even the term \u201cmission\u201d is not helpful, they say. (In secular circles, these terms are often called the Great White Savior complex.) When we travel to countries we know nothing about and perform work we are unqualified to do, we reinforce the idea that local people are helpless and need privileged people from America or other developed nations to solve their problems. And that message is counterproductive for fighting poverty.Step away from the baby.Volunteer with community programs.Instead of working in an orphanage, volunteers can work as teachers\u2019 aides. They can help local churches with their activities. They can help run art or sports or other events for children in the community.Fund the move to family care.Good family care requires trained professionals and a system to investigate abuse, locate parents or other relatives, recruit and train foster families, help families to solve their problems and monitor how children are doing.While Whole Child believes that family care is best, the group opposes what Ms. Spencer calls \u201creckless deinstitutionalization.\u201d She said that some African countries are simply taking children out of orphanages and putting them on a bus to their home.Seven years ago, Oasis hired a social worker to develop a program to work with girls\u2019 families, so that the girls could go home once the abusers were gone. It supports, counsels and monitors the families and helps them start small businesses.Corbey Dukes, the director, said Oasis has been able to reunite about half of the girls with their mothers or another relative.Family care will be a long time in coming. For some children, it never will.So it\u2019s important to do whatever is possible to make orphanage care better. Next month, Whole Child will begin a nationwide project with the government of El Salvador to improve care in orphanages, as well as to broaden their scope to include family-based care, reunification and monitoring.If you must go, support the staff.The role of donors in helping orphanages move toward family care is evident. But is there a place for short-term volunteers?Elli Oswald, the interim executive director of Faith to Action, believes that such volunteers are never appropriate in orphanages. (I agree, if only to keep a consistent \u201cdon\u2019t volunteer in orphanages\u201d message. There are exceptions, but they are few and hard to distinguish from afar.)Mr. Dukes, however, said that volunteers are necessary \u2014 as long as they focus on the staff and not the children.Oasis\u2019 short-term volunteers provide services to the staff, such as helping with retreats, and do construction projects. \u201cOf course, you do not need an M.B.A. to understand that any service project could be done cheaper by a Guatemalan laborer,\u201d Mr. Dukes said.Volunteers get one formal supervised activity with the girls, such as a game or craft activity and a barbecue, and sometimes also can play basketball or soccer with the girls.Consider staying home and donating the cost of the trip.If you\u2019re a dentist or soil agronomist traveling to help a great local program train people, then by all means, go.If the only thing you can bring is your good intention, you\u2019ll be more helpful staying home and contributing money.Please do travel and have life-changing experiences. Just don\u2019t confuse it with helping. Especially when you\u2019re spending most of the money on airfare.Find a way to stay involved without traveling.Here\u2019s the problem with staying home, though. Oasis accepts volunteers because without them, it would close. Mr. Dukes needs to raise $1 million a year for his programs. \u201cOf that funding, over 80 percent comes from people who have visited this ministry with church teams or from the churches that send those teams,\u201d he said.The challenge for a church supporting a great project is staying engaged without the wasted expense and potential for harm of a mission trip. That might require a lot of education about how poverty alleviation really works, Skype calls and photo-filled newsletters showing donations in action.Still, it is likely that donations will drop. But thousands of dollars that would have been spent on airfare can help fill the gap.Reporting for this article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened to Center-Right America? ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Starr is a sociologist at Princeton and a founder of a liberal magazine, The American Prospect.Ten years ago, during the 2008 election campaign, a number of prominent commentators, including Jon Meacham and Karl Rove, repeated the claim that America is a \u201ccenter-right country.\u201d That view was plausible when George W. Bush was still president, but since then the center right has lost ground even within the party that has been its traditional home. The past decade\u2019s developments raise the question of what place the center right has in the nation\u2019s politics and what its decline says about America.Barack Obama\u2019s presidency set back the center right, but Donald Trump\u2019s victory has had a far more devastating impact. As right-wing populist and nationalist leaders have risen around the world, one of their first priorities has been to clear the field of their right-of-center rivals. Mr. Trump has done exactly that by seizing control of the Republican Party and relentlessly attacking the few congressional Republicans who have defied him.Mr. Trump\u2019s purges continue the Republican march to the right that began in the 1980s. At that time, many leading Republicans were economically conservative but socially liberal or moderate. Often from elite backgrounds, they called for balanced budgets, free trade and other pro-business policies, while also supporting abortion rights, racial inclusiveness, immigration reform and environmental protection. Republicans had little hope of congressional majorities without them. But as the center of gravity in the party shifted south and west, the moderates became a dwindling and dispensable minority, increasingly forced to adapt to the new orthodoxy or to quit the party.Like the Republican Party as a whole, the center right has been moving right. Fifty years ago, it would have been identified with the Rockefeller wing of the party, more recently with the Bush wing, and now even with traditional conservatives and neoconservatives who oppose Trump. John McCain was the center right\u2019s hero; Chief Justice John Roberts is now its most powerful figure. Robert Corker and Jeff Flake are retiring prematurely because they ran afoul of President Trump. The center right has not disappeared, but it has had its home in electoral politics taken from it.As a result of the Republicans\u2019 rightward shift, the Democrats are attracting some donors who formerly gave only to Republicans and some candidates who in the past would have run as moderate Republicans. Michael Bloomberg, who has committed $100 million to Democratic candidates in this election, is the best-known example.This influx of Republican refugees into the Democratic Party is one reason the party has not seen a movement to the left comparable with the Republican movement to the right. Democrats have seen a burst of progressive anger and energy, but heightened passion is not the same as a major ideological shift, especially among the Democrats elected to public office. In this year\u2019s Democratic primaries, a few insurgent progressives won primaries in urban districts, but nearly all the winners, particularly in races for Senate and governor, came from the party\u2019s mainstream.Republican crossovers are going to be crucial for Democrats running in suburban districts and red states. But a substantial move of the center right toward the Democrats would be a mixed blessing for them. A new Bloomberg wing of the Democratic Party, made up of the remains of the Rockefeller wing of the Republicans, would clash with progressive Democrats over economic policy and undermine their efforts to rebuild the party\u2019s working-class support.The root of the problem of the center right is that it lacks a base in popular politics. The combination of economically conservative and socially moderate views does not match up today with the large blocs of voters who identify with either the Democratic or the Republican Party. The support for that hybrid position lies mainly among the affluent and especially the leaders of corporate America.That\u2019s why America today is not a center-right country. It\u2019s a country with a center-right economic elite and a polarized electorate torn between parties on the far right and center left. But that is not to say the center right is powerless. Where it puts its money and its influence will have an enormous impact.When the United States went from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump, it leapfrogged over the center right, and it may leapfrog over it again in the other direction. Before Mr. Trump, the center right was a restraining influence on the Republican Party, and to some extent it still is if we can believe the anonymous sources in the administration who say they are keeping the president in check.Increasingly, though, the center right may become a restraining influence on the Democratic Party. Center-right support may help Democrats win elections, while also making it difficult for progressives, even when they do win, to move the country much to the left. We may already see that impact if Democrats win the House in November, and we are sure to see it the next time the White House changes hands.Paul Starr is a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton, a co-editor of The American Prospect and the author of the forthcoming \u201cEntrenchment: Wealth, Power, and the Constitution of Democratic Societies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ostensibly, Spotify could have mined a ton of data and created a unique collaboration based on Spotify-linked social accounts, including Facebook. After all, like any big internet platform, Spotify is part surveillance operation, and part whatever it says it is.The darker, more cynical view is to see this as a classic American heritage tourism experience: going to a country for the first time and noticing how different the McDonald\u2019s menus are, but also how it is mostly the same as those in the United States, and finding this all very interesting, but not thinking too much about why.The good news is this: There is already a system for investigating and processing a trove of externally illegible data, all coded and stored and constantly tested and updated, into musical preferences that then be extracted and put into action, for a fee.

{"Headline": "White Male Victimization Anxiety", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistDuring the swearing-in of Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to Kavanaugh and his family \u201con behalf of our nation\u201d for the \u201cterrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure.\u201dHe repeated the tired lines that he and Republicans hope will stick, and steer the comatose base to electoral fervor: That accusations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh were part of a \u201ccampaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\u201d and that \u201cwhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process.\u201dBut to me, this was not just a president and party worried about an approaching \u201cblue wave\u201d and trying to take political advantage of a moment of victory. It was also an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism.During Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, Lindsey Graham had the temerity to say, \u201cI\u2019m a single white male from South Carolina, and I\u2019m told I should shut up.\u201dThe evocation of his white maleness in his argument was an overt shot at the check-your-privilege crowd.They\u2019re saying, \u201cEnough.\u201d They will cede no more ground, they will share no more power, they will accommodate no more ascendancy and validation of the oppressed. That is what they are telling us, and they are speaking through Trump.\u201cMen have a tendency to believe that decreasing bias against women is associated with increasing bias against men, said Clara Wilkins, a professor at Wesleyan University who studies the psychology behind reverse discrimination.\u201dThe site went on:Trump is the paragon, the epitome, of this white male victimization. Everything and everyone is being unfair to him, and by extension, to white men.Montanaro also makes this crucial point about Trump:\u201cHis sense of fairness, or unfairness, really, has driven him, his rise in politics \u2014 and his priorities for the country. He has capitalized on grievance, especially that of white Americans chafing at the culture of a demographically changing country, and has expressed his view of what is unfair \u2014 everything from trade and immigration to the court system, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage mandate, the I.R.S., the plight of political allies and, of course, the news media.\u201dThe word is that they are coming together to have lunch; I think they\u2019re also coming together to lick wounds.Through it all, Trump\u2019s mantra and mission remain clear: to bind together toxic masculinity and racial performance anxiety into a weapon that can repel change and any perceived diminution of white male primacy.Advertisement"}

No one listened.Mr. Bacevich is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cTwilight of the American Century.\u201d Twenty-five years ago this week, a Somali warlord named Mohammed Farah Aidid offered the American military a glimpse of its future. But neither policymakers back in Washington nor commanders in the field were attuned to what he had on offer.A mission that had begun 10 months earlier to provide relief supplies to starving Somalis had evolved into a vastly more ambitious nation-building project. On the night of Oct. 3-4, 1993, an American military operation to capture Mr. Aidid ended in catastrophic failure, including 18 Americans dead. Soon afterward the entire mission collapsed, and the United States withdrew. Yet any lessons that might have been learned from this debacle stayed in Mogadishu, alongside the smoldering wreckage of the Black Hawk helicopter that Mr. Aidid\u2019s fighters had shot down.The United States did not go into Somalia expecting this kind of resistance. But Mr. Aidid took exception to the prospect of outsiders imposing a new political order on his country. From their sanctuaries in the crowded warrens of the Somali capital, his lightly armed but nimble militias ambushed and harassed American and coalition forces throughout the summer of 1993. Casualties mounted. In response, President Bill Clinton ordered an elite commando task force to Mogadishu with the specific assignment of eliminating Mr. Aidid.By most measures \u2014 training and discipline, firepower and mobility \u2014 Task Force Ranger had Mr. Aidid\u2019s irregulars outclassed. His forces were technologically backward while the American troops had all the best gadgets that money could buy.In the end, little of this mattered. Mr. Aidid himself proved both frustratingly elusive and far shrewder than the Americans expected. On six \u201csnatch\u201d attempts, the Rangers came up empty-handed. On the seventh, the enemy forces that the Americans disparaged as \u201cskinnies\u201d and \u201csammies\u201d were waiting. In an instant, the hunters became the hunted.In contrast, back in the United States, the losses suffered by American troops proved politically unacceptable. Mr. Clinton conceded defeat and pulled out the entire American operation. Somalia remained in chaos.We can choose to remember this event, coming during the grander era of American ideological triumph over the recently collapsed Soviet Union, as a minor embarrassment of little real consequence. Yet seeing the outcome for what it was \u2014 a sign of things to come \u2014 offers several useful lessons. First, the contemporary battlefield is more likely to be urban and congested, rather than wide open and sparsely populated. Rarely will adversaries cooperate in fulfilling the American preference for long-range tank battles fought in the desert under skies dominated by American fighter-bombers and attack helicopters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was an exception; the urban battles of the occupation that followed were closer to the rule.Third, if American forces find it difficult to adjust to the peculiar demands of such wars, then those responsible for formulating basic national security policy should consider the possibility that the wars themselves just might be futile. Since 1993, the United States has killed any number of \u201cskinnies\u201d and \u201csammies,\u201d not to mention innocent bystanders, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria and even back in Somalia, where drone strikes and Special Forces routinely target those who have succeeded Mr. Aidid in contesting the control of that country. Rarely does an American leader, political or military, explain what larger purpose these wars are serving. Never do they venture to speculate on when they might end.Why was it necessary for the 18 Americans to die in a failed effort to dictate the future of Somalia? What purpose did their sacrifice serve? A quarter-century later, these questions have lost none of their pertinence. If anything, they have become more urgent.In retrospect, the lessons to be taken from this small but immensely instructive episode appear obvious. In retrospect, lessons always do.Yet with a bit more effort and perhaps a generous dose of humility, the United States might have discerned those lessons at the time. Applying them to subsequent military endeavors might have alleviated or even eliminated the failures and frustrations that have become the principal themes of recent American military history. Instead, America\u2019s leaders chose to ignore it \u2014 the sooner forgotten the better. This turned out to be a profound oversight, and the troops whom Americans profess to admire have since paid a high price for it.Andrew J.

{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina \u201cis a great place to invest,\u201d he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Electric Cars Is Brighter With Elon Musk in It", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "OpinionFederal regulators were right to rein in his reckless management, but the company and the global auto industry need him.Supported byMr. MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.His leadership matters well beyond Silicon Valley. Tesla, under Mr. Musk, has been the single most significant force driving the global automotive industry \u2014 and the consumers who purchase cars \u2014 to take the prospect of a fully electric vehicle future seriously. No other electric vehicle initiative \u2014 from Nissan\u2019s Leaf and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt and Bolt to the new wave of luxury electric cars being rolled out by German automakers and new companies funded by Chinese billionaires \u2014 has achieved the impact on the public\u2019s imagination, brand loyalty or sales success of Tesla. Those initiatives might not even have occurred without the prod of Tesla\u2019s example. Aside from his vision for electric vehicles, Tesla under Mr. Musk has accomplished a remarkable feat: the creation of a new automaker. In the modern era, nearly all new entrants have started in developing countries, at the low end; most new automakers founded in the United States and Europe have failed. Tesla\u2019s approach is not what most expected from a Silicon Valley disrupter. Unlike Apple\u2019s iPhone \u2014 \u201cdesigned by Apple in California, assembled in China\u201d \u2014 nearly all of Tesla\u2019s value chain from product conception through delivery to customers is carried out by the company itself. Tesla\u2019s travails in mastering high-volume production of a mass-market product, the Model 3, are well known, and it may never attain Toyota-like levels of efficiency. But if Tesla can persevere, it could achieve the elusive high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle that would be a tipping point for the future of the industry.Tesla under Mr. Musk has also established a template for what the \u201cmobility\u201d firms of the future must do. Chief among these is the ability to update vehicle functionality via over-the-air software updates; the addition of algorithm-driven features that offer partially autonomous operation along with the collection of data to improve those algorithms; connectivity with the consumer to provide services; and the ability for a customer to configure and purchase a vehicle online. Tesla under new leadership, or as a unit of a much larger company, might be able to maintain what Mr. Musk has achieved. But Tesla\u2019s survival thus far has been a tightrope act, and falling off is virtually guaranteed without Mr. Musk. He has proved uniquely and idiosyncratically able to sustain the loyalty and fervent belief of investors, customers and employees. While Tesla has benefited from public subsidies such as consumer tax credits, federal grants, and the sale of zero emission credits to other automakers, Mr. Musk\u2019s ability as a salesman is apparent in his success at raising private funds and sustaining high valuations. Even Tesla\u2019s luck in buying its factory in Fremont, Calif., at a bargain-basement price from Toyota is attributable to Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to charm Toyota\u2019s chief executive. Tesla owners also seem to identify closely with Mr. Musk. For the Model 3, they had to put down a $1,000 deposit, and most have been waiting months for their new cars. This willingness to commit to a purchase before the vehicle is even available for viewing has enormous value. It means Tesla spends almost no money on marketing, and it knows before building each vehicle who the customer will be and how he wants it configured. No other auto manufacturer enjoys this type of prerelease enthusiasm \u2014 and it is Mr. Musk who single-handedly sustains it. Were Tesla to become the electric car division of an existing automaker, even if its products stay strong, this pattern of advance demand commitments would be unlikely to continue.To be sure, Mr. Musk needs help as a manager. Steve Jobs eventually found Tim Cook; Mark Zuckerberg found Sheryl Sandberg. Mr. Musk has already found a strong managerial partner, Gwynne Shotwell, for SpaceX. He has pointed to his elevation of Jerome Guillen, a seasoned auto industry executive, to president of automotive as a similar move for Tesla. Mr. Guillen has not yet stepped forward in a prominent way as co-leader, but the S.E.C.\u2019s action, along with a much stronger board of directors, could nudge Mr. Musk toward expanding Mr. Guillen\u2019s influence.

{"Headline": "Liberal Hypocrisy in College Admissions?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legacy system is affirmative action for the privileged.Opinion ColumnistWe progressives hail opportunity, egalitarianism and diversity. Yet here\u2019s our dirty little secret: Some of our most liberal bastions in America rely on a system of inherited privilege that benefits rich whites at the expense of almost everyone else.I\u2019m talking about \u201clegacy preferences\u201d that elite universities give to children of graduates. These universities constitute some of the world\u2019s greatest public goods, but they rig admissions to favor applicants who already have had every privilege in life.\u201cIt\u2019s a hereditary principle at work in an area that should be meritocratic,\u201d observed Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution, who criticized legacy preferences in his book \u201cDream Hoarders.\u201d Reeves noted the irony that in Europe and most of the rest of the world, there is no such explicit system of legacy preferences, yet in supposedly egalitarian America it is formal and systematic.Isn\u2019t it a bit hypocritical that institutions so associated with liberalism should embrace a hereditary aristocratic structure? Ah, never underestimate the power of self-interest to shape people\u2019s views. As Reeves put it dryly: \u201cAmerican liberalism tends to diminish as the issues get closer to home.\u201dI write this as a beneficiary of affirmative action. I was an Oregon farm boy, and Ivy League schools wanted the occasional country bumpkin, so I milked this for all it was worth by writing a college essay about me vaccinating sheep, picking strawberries and competing in the Future Farmers of America. Harvard wanted hicks from the sticks, so it chose me to help diversify its freshman class \u2014 and then Harvard had a huge impact on me. I\u2019m also proud to have served some years ago on Harvard\u2019s board and to have been a visiting fellow at its Kennedy School of Government.The top universities say that legacy preferences help create a multigenerational community of alumni, and that\u2019s a legitimate argument. They also note that rewarding donors helps encourage donations that can be used to finance scholarships for needy kids.Yet on balance, I\u2019m troubled that some of America\u2019s greatest institutions grant a transformative opportunity disproportionately to kids already steeped in advantage, from violin lessons to chess tournaments to SAT coaching. On top of that, letting wealthy families pay for extra consideration feels, to use a technical term, yucky.Liberals object to the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowing tycoons to buy political influence, so why allow tycoons to buy influence in college admissions?More broadly, what happened to equal opportunity and meritocracy? They may be ideals rather than reality, but why defend a formal structure of hereditary privilege and monetary advantage in accessing top universities?\u201cLegacy preferences give a leg up to applicants who have typically led privileged lives,\u201d said Susan Dynarski, a (Harvard-trained) professor of economics, education and public policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s the polar opposite of affirmative action, which boosts applicants who have faced adversity. It\u2019s unconscionable for a handful of elite colleges to amass enormous tax-advantaged endowments and use them to perpetuate privilege in this way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But now many of us will live into our late 80s and 90s. Since we were as young as the iGen is now, average life expectancy in America has risen more than five years, and higher for the most affluent. One reason is Medicare, covering Americans over 65 or disabled.Now that doctors keep us alive longer, we\u2019re costing far more than our parents and grandparents did. Annual health spending \u2014 $2,200 per American in 1970 when we were their age \u2014 almost quintupled to more than $10,000 in 2016, after inflation, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts.What should bother the iGen is that 50 years ago this money might have gone to improving schools or roads or safety, or to fighting climate change.I even wonder whether increased Medicare spending is partly responsible for the election of Donald Trump, whose margin of victory came from voters in our generation. Without that spending, might enough of us have died sooner and tipped the balance in favor of Hillary Clinton? My generation will say we paid into the system for decades and deserve our entitlements. But the one-earner baby boomer couple my age who have earned the average wage every year have paid less than $100,000 in Medicare taxes but are taking out benefits worth more than $400,000, after adjusting for inflation, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official now at the Urban Institute.He also found that the couple will receive half a million dollars in Social Security after paying in little more than a quarter million.What should we older folks do?First, those who remain healthy must stay productive \u2014 preferably in ways that help young people. In my case, I created a teaching job that pays me health insurance, so that even as I still contribute to Medicare, I don\u2019t draw benefits.Some of us can\u2019t work full time. But we \u2014 especially the comfortable, like many my age here in Silicon Valley \u2014 could volunteer in programs that benefit children. One woman I know began coaching students, many from immigrant families, on their writing. A college classmate is overseeing and financing the San Francisco high school that educated him and that now teaches low-income students. Another classmate is reviving an athletic competition for Los Angeles children.Second, those of us with savings can donate to causes that benefit the young, including through our wills. Baby boomers sit on many trillions in assets. By diverting some to such causes, we could have a big effect. Two of my former business students have created a company, Freewill, that encourages us to create wills and leave money to worthy causes. A 69-year-old retired businessman in Houston left 20 percent of his $2 million estate to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. By contrast, many baby boomers, even affluent ones, have no will, and only about 5 percent leave money to charity, Freewill reports.Two other students are creating a business that matches volunteers with people who pay for services with a contribution to charity. We could volunteer, or we could hire those volunteers. Yet another former student has created a kind of Common App for scholarships, making it far easier for youths to apply and much simpler for donors to create them.Third, we can create a living will and make clear we don\u2019t want expensive medical care when it won\u2019t make a difference.At Stanford\u2019s commencement last June, the actor Sterling K. Brown, halfway between\u200b our generations, laid out for the iGen a mission that should be the Me Gen\u2019s too. \u201cMy mama always told me, \u2018When you visit someone else\u2019s house, leave things better than the way you found them,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018That way, you\u2019ll always be asked back.\u2019\u2019\u2019The singer Sheena Easton might describe our mission another way: less takin\u2019 and more givin\u2019.Talking with hundreds of students has brought home how worried our children and grandchildren are about climate change, inequality and the shrinking role of government in helping needy people.I tell them about the political system in which we in the Me Generation grew up. In the mid-1960s, Republicans and Democrats of my parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations created Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, immigration reform, education reform, the Highway Safety Act, the Wilderness Act, cleaner air and water, public broadcasting and much more.Our generation has failed at anything close to that. But such magic is possible. Remind your children and grandchildren of that. Tell them it starts with voting, for candidates who will represent their interests. Urge them to make it happen. And help them.Glenn Kramon, a former assistant managing editor at The New York Times, is a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Brett Kavanaugh Failed", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd why the Senate should vote to keep him off the Supreme Court.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as much as any development in the challenging era of Donald Trump, is testing America\u2019s politicians and its civic institutions. Few, so far, have met the test.Not Republican senators, who, after denying one president his legitimate authority to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court, are now rushing their own nominee through, uninterested in the truth, while weeping crocodile tears about other people\u2019s partisanship.Not Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who tainted the process by bringing forward damaging allegations against Judge Kavanaugh only at the last minute.Not the F.B.I., which either of its own volition or because of constraints imposed by Republicans failed to interview many of the key witnesses who could speak to the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh.In this crucible of power politics, of bullying and posturing and rage, no one has been more severely tested than Judge Kavanaugh. If he believes himself innocent of sexual assault \u2014 if he is innocent of sexual assault \u2014 the test, to him, can only appear monstrous. Yet unfair as the test might seem to the judge and his supporters, senators who want to preserve the credibility of the Supreme Court cannot now look away from the result: Judge Kavanaugh failed, decisively.How? First, he gave misleading answers under oath. Judges \u2014 particularly Supreme Court justices \u2014 must have, and be seen as having, unimpeachable integrity. The knuckleheaded mistakes of a young person \u2014 drinking too much, writing offensive things in a high school yearbook \u2014 should not in themselves be bars to high office. But deliberately misleading senators about them during a confirmation process has to be. If Judge Kavanaugh will lie about small things, won\u2019t he lie about big ones as well? Even the small lies, of course, aren\u2019t so small in context, since they relate to drinking or sex and thus prop up his choir-boy-who-indulged-now-and-then defense. Wise words. He wasn\u2019t able to live by them when it mattered. At last week\u2019s hearing, Judge Kavanaugh was a jerk. He spun dark visions of a Democratic conspiracy of vengeance against him. He yelled at Democratic senators, interrupted them frequently, refused to answer questions directly and, at one point, confronted Senator Amy Klobuchar, who had asked him whether he had ever blacked out from drinking.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh sneered. \u201cHave you?\u201d This contempt came only moments after Ms. Klobuchar told Judge Kavanaugh about her father\u2019s struggles with alcoholism. Was Judge Kavanaugh truly out of control, in rage and pain, as he appeared, or had he calculated that a partisan attack would rally President Trump and Republican senators to his side, as it did? (We all know he was capable of a more temperate response to the accusations: He\u2019d demonstrated that just a couple of nights earlier, in his interview with Fox News.) For purposes of Senate confirmation, it shouldn\u2019t matter. Such a lack of self-control, or such open and radical partisanship, ought to be unacceptable in a judge. Judges are human beings, not ideological blank slates, but the American legal system depends on their being fair and open-minded to all who come before them. Judge Kavanaugh failed to show that he can do this, or that he even would want to.  He is not, however, entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court. Republican senators have repeatedly said they respected Dr. Blasey and were sympathetic to her; but to vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh now is to declare that her accusations mean nothing. Presidents have the prerogative to name Supreme Court justices who reflect their values and views of the Constitution. President Trump has no shortage of highly qualified, very conservative candidates to choose from, if he will look beyond this first, deeply compromised choice.Some Republicans have warned that if Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination fails, no decent person will ever want to be put up for the Supreme Court again. This, like so much nonsense in recent weeks, is political hysteria. For starters, consider these seven names: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, John Roberts Jr., Samuel Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. All were seated on the court since 1991, the last time a Supreme Court nominee faced credible allegations of sexual misconduct. In that case, Clarence Thomas got the job, even in a Democratic-controlled Senate. Since then, not a single nominee has faced allegations of the sort leveled at Judge Kavanaugh.That confidence has already been shaken. The court\u2019s party-line vote in Bush v. Gore, which effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, led many Americans to wonder if the justices were nothing but politicians in robes. Sixteen years later, Republicans made the balance of the court more clearly a political prize by blocking Judge Garland. This confirmation battle has been awful for everyone. It has exposed to the country a depth of partisan grievance and connivance within the Senate that should embarrass and worry every American. It is a terrible reality that, at this point, either confirmation or rejection of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination by a narrow and overwhelmingly partisan margin will dismay and anger millions of Americans. But only by voting no, by asking Mr. Trump to send someone else for it to consider, can the Senate pass its test of institutional character and meet its obligation to safeguard the credibility of the Supreme Court.

Molinaro, the Republican candidate challenging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, lagging far behind in almost every measurable way, Republican donors appear to be moving their focus to other races.Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, is entering the homestretch of the governor\u2019s race virtually broke: He reported only $210,000 in cash on hand. Mr. Cuomo still has $9.2 million in the bank, according to his campaign.Put another way, Mr. Molinaro has about as much left for the final month as Mr. Cuomo was spending every 12 hours at the end of the primary against the actress Cynthia Nixon.Given Mr. Molinaro\u2019s financial and polling deficit, Republican attention and cash appears to be shifting to the State Senate, where Republicans are clinging to a one-seat majority, the party\u2019s lone foothold on power in Albany.Despite New York\u2019s Democratic tilt, Republicans have controlled the State Senate for all but two years in the last century. But the threat of a \u201cblue wave\u201d nationally and a spate of Republican retirements has put that majority in dire risk.\u201cThe funding class are investors, and they want to invest in something where they would see a return,\u201d said Chapin Fay, a Republican strategist. Some Republicans had viewed Mr. Cuomo as potentially vulnerable, but his dominant win against Ms. Nixon in the Democratic primary mostly dashed those hopes, he said. \u201cAny path to a statewide victory evaporated for Republicans on that day,\u201d he said.\u201cThe balance of power in the State Senate is really up for grabs this year,\u201d added Mr. Fay, a former press secretary to the last Republican governor in New York, George E. Pataki. \u201cThat is where the money is flowing, where it can really make a difference.\u201dA spokesman for the Senate Republicans, Scott Reif, said they had raised $500,000 just since last Monday \u2014 which is more than Mr. Molinaro has raised since mid-July \u2014 and had more than $3 million heading into the final month, across two party accounts.\u201cThe case we\u2019re making is that checks and balances are important,\u201d Mr. Reif said.Of course, implicit in that is the idea that Mr. Cuomo will be re-elected to a third term in November.A spokesman for the Senate Democrats, Mike Murphy, said they head into the final month with $900,000 cash on hand, though money has been coming in at a faster clip than 2016, he said. (Individual Democratic and Republican Senate candidates have their own treasuries, as well.)\u201cWe\u2019re always outspent because the wealthy, deep-pocketed interests view the Republicans as their best spokespeople,\u201d said State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who heads the Democratic campaign efforts. \u201cSo we\u2019re always fighting against the wealthy.\u201dThere are contested Senate seats across the state, but much of the battleground is in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, where campaigns can be particularly costly. State Senator Elaine Phillips, a Republican incumbent from Nassau, had more than twice as much cash, $477,000, as Mr. Molinaro for her re-election effort to a district seat.\u201cLong Island is definitely the battleground,\u201d said Steve Bellone, a Democrat and the Suffolk County executive, naming as many as five up-for-grabs seats. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this many competitive races.\u201dIn another statewide race, Keith Wofford, the Republican candidate for attorney general and a former partner in the law firm Ropes & Gray, has raised nearly $1.8 million this year, including a $50,000 personal loan. He reported $400,000 cash on hand. Both totals eclipse Mr. Molinaro\u2019s, who is atop the ticket.Last Monday, a who\u2019s who of top Republicans held a fund-raiser for Mr. Wofford, including Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager, Kenneth G. Langone, the Home Depot co-founder, and Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group.Among Ms. James\u2019s recent donors was Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook executive, who contributed $5,000 in late September.All told, Mr. Molinaro has raised $1.3 million in his bid for governor; $223,500 of the funds came from the New York Republican Party and its chairman, Edward F. Cox.It has been more than 15 years since Republicans won a statewide race in New York.Katy Delgado, a spokeswoman for Mr. Molinaro, accused Mr. Cuomo of \u201cthreatening donors, pollsters and civic organizations to try and deprive Marc\u2019s campaign of resources.\u201d She did not provide any specific examples of those alleged threats.\u201cMarc Molinaro\u2019s campaign is a true grass-roots movement that will neither be intimidated nor extinguished by the corrupt Cuomo political machine,\u201d she said.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, called the Molinaro camp\u2019s claims \u201cpathetic and desperate.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s third-party opponents are outmatched financially, as well: the Green Party nominee, Howie Hawkins, has $31,000; the Libertarian Party nominee, Larry Sharpe, has $24,000; and Stephanie Miner, a Democrat and the former mayor of Syracuse who is running on a new party line called the Serve America Movement, has $55,000.Advertisement"}

Politics", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans are an authoritarian regime in waitingOpinion ColumnistBut such long-term worries should be a secondary concern right now. The more immediate threat comes from what we saw on the Republican side during and after the hearing: not just contempt for the truth, but also a rush to demonize any and all criticism. In particular, the readiness with which senior Republicans embraced crazy conspiracy theories about the opposition to Kavanaugh is a deeply scary warning about what might happen to America, not in the long run, but just a few weeks from now.But the significance of conspiracy theorizing depends on who does it.When people on the political fringe blame shadowy forces \u2014 often, as it happens, sinister Jewish financiers \u2014 for their frustrations, you can write it off as delusional. When people who hold most of the levers of power do the same thing, their fantasizing isn\u2019t a delusion, it\u2019s a tool: a way to delegitimize opposition, to create excuses not just for disregarding but for punishing anyone who dares to criticize their actions.And now senior figures in the Republican Party, which controls all three branches of the federal government \u2014 if you had any questions about whether the Supreme Court was a partisan institution, they should be gone now \u2014 are sounding just like the white nationalists in Hungary and Poland. What does this mean?The answer, I submit, is that the G.O.P. is an authoritarian regime in waiting.Add in the investigations closing in on Trump\u2019s many scandals, from tax cheating to self-dealing in office to possible collusion with Russia, all of which give him every incentive to shut down freedom of the press and independence of law enforcement. Does anyone doubt that Trump would like to go full authoritarian, given the chance?And who\u2019s going to stop him? The senators parroting conspiracy theories about Soros-paid protesters? The newly rigged Supreme Court? What we\u2019ve learned in the past few weeks is that there is no gap between Trump and his party, nobody who will say stop in the name of American values.But as I said, the G.O.P. is an authoritarian regime in waiting, not yet one in practice. What\u2019s it waiting for?Well, think of what Trump and his party might do if they retain both houses of Congress in the coming election.

And we\u2019re throwing you out of office. Because I\u2019m sick and tired of your negative ads.\u201dThe ad came as both parties have sparred over the level of civility in politics, with Republicans recently likening Democratic protesters during the confirmation hearings for Brett M. Kavanaugh to a mob and criticizing remarks about Justice Kavanaugh by various Democrats.Unsurprisingly, Mr. Wolf\u2019s campaign condemned Mr. Wagner\u2019s remarks.\u201cScott Wagner\u2019s latest rant shows he is unhinged and unfit for office,\u201d Beth Melena, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cThreats of violence have no place in society, especially from someone running for public office.\"Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times.

Along with Michigan and Wisconsin, it was one of three states considered reliably blue whose votes for Mr. Trump helped decide the election.The political terrain suggests Democrats have reason for hope in November. Republican candidates face an electorate, especially in suburban swing districts, that remains uneasy with Mr. Trump.

Similarly, the claim that the United States \u201crebuilt China\u201d over the last 25 years could be shrugged off as dubious and unfair.But it was unmistakably clear that the era of Washington holding out a hand to Beijing to become a \u201cresponsible stakeholder\u201d in world affairs alongside the United States \u2014 a phrase used in 2005 by Robert B. Zoellick, then the deputy secretary of state \u2014 was over.\u201cThis will look like the declaration of a new Cold War, and what China may do is more important than what it will say about Pence\u2019s speech,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.China could respond by funneling more money toward its armed forces, which Mr. Pence said spend as much as all other militaries in Asia combined. (The International Institute for Strategic Studies said last year that Asian countries combined spent about 25 percent more than China on their militaries, and that the United States spent four times what China did on its armed forces.)China has kept its military budget at 1.5 percent of its economic output over the last few years. \u201cIt has a long way to go to reach the U.S. level of 3.5 to 4 percent,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.China could also reverse course on its support of the American-led effort in the United Nations that has imposed heavy sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.Chinese policymakers, following Mr. Xi\u2019s strictures, are unlikely to give ground, said Yun Sun, a policy expert at the Stimson Center in Washington who is currently visiting China.\u201cMy comments to the Chinese are that maybe China should tone down its assertiveness to avoid further tension,\u201d Ms. Sun said of her discussions with Chinese officials. \u201cAnd the reaction I get is that \u2018We don\u2019t think we are being assertive.\u2019\u201dPresident Trump said last week that the friendship with Mr. Xi that he once was so proud of may now be over. The feeling was most likely reciprocated in the aftermath of the speech, Ms. Sun said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Xi still sees Trump as his friend.\u201dChina\u2019s social media platforms, which the government rigorously censors, eliminating provocative content, bristled in shock at the severity of Mr. Pence\u2019s speech.\u201cPence\u2019s speech is really earth-shattering,\u201d said one commenter. \u201cThis is the official speech of the U.S. I suggest every Chinese person read the whole thing. Is this another edition of the \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 speech?\u201dMr. Pence\u2019s speech was clearly directed at a domestic audience. He gave it at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, and its timing \u2014 11 p.m. in China \u2014 meant it probably had limited viewership in China, mostly among international affairs specialists. And it was given in the midst of a weeklong holiday in China, when the government\u2019s most strident megaphone for foreign policy, the state-run newspaper Global Times, is not publishing.Still, the unfavorable comparison with accusations of Russian interference in American politics probably alarmed Chinese officials, said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former member of the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\u201cThe vice president attempted to shift public scrutiny from Russia to China,\u201d Mr. Hass said. \u201cHe asserted that Russian efforts to interfere in America\u2019s electoral process \u2018pales in comparison to what China is doing.\u2019\u201dBut the address could reassure two nations that fear China \u2014 Japan, an important American ally, and India, a country that Washington is trying to bring closer \u2014 regional analysts said. And the tougher approach reflects a growing wariness of China among American businesses.\u201cThis has been building for a long time across different sectors in the U.S. \u2014 the military and business in particular,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, a former foreign secretary for Singapore. \u201cAmerican business is particularly significant as it had been the stabilizing fact. But their mood has been souring for a decade or more. How the Chinese missed this, I do not know.\u201dIn Australia, another important American ally, the government has been saying many of the same things as Mr. Pence, though in more muted tones.In some ways, Australia has been viewed in Washington as a test case of what China could get away with in a country with a strong economy and Western values. The American and Australian intelligence agencies have consulted on what they see as the China threat.But the Australians have couched their new legislation in general terms, never singling out China.Mr. Pence\u2019s harder line is likely to ignite a debate in Australia about whether it, too, should take a harder line against China.\u201cLet\u2019s take the heat, light, noise and excitement out of the relationship by establishing a clear, declared policy that governs our approach to the economic and strategic relationship with the Chinese state,\u201d said Michael Shoebridge, director of defense at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Australia should follow in Mr. Pence\u2019s footsteps, he said.But there were concerns about pushing too far.\u201cI think Australia is broadly comfortable with the Pence approach,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. \u201cThere is just a worry about it getting out of control.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Lives of Central Bankers", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese architects of the global economy pride themselves on being brilliant, aloof and rational. And then they wonder why they\u2019re not more popular.A few years ago, a senior Japanese central banker let me in on a secret side of his life: Like some others in his rarefied world, he is a passionate devotee of Sherlock Holmes. After formal meetings in capitals around the world, he joins the other Sherlock Holmes buffs over drinks or dinner for trivia competitions, to test their knowledge of obscure plot details, or to share amateur historical research into Victorian London. It is all very casual, but the camaraderie is important to him. Through this informal fan club, the banker told me, he had made his closest professional friendships. \u201cI feel closer to many of these people than to many of my countrymen,\u201d he said.As an anthropologist, I have spent 20 years studying the customs, beliefs and rituals of central bankers around the world. They see themselves as jacks-of-all-financial-trades who solve complex financial crises before they can damage the unsuspecting public. They are as clever as the extraordinarily wealthy banking executives whom they regulate, but motivated by higher ideals. So it made sense that the aloof and justifiably arrogant Sherlock Holmes might represent for them an ideal of masculine brilliance (they are mostly still men), rationality and self-control. Like Holmes, central bankers consider their detachment an asset. The acculturation process for central bankers begins early. Most of them attend a handful of elite universities \u2014 the University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge \u2014 to study neoclassical economics, and their early training often involves a secondment to the central banking institutions of another country. In Tokyo or Frankfurt or New York, they operate within a closed set.In response to criticism, many central banks are trying to diversify their work forces and share more details about the deliberations of their monetary policy committees.But these steps have been far too modest. Central banks should think more boldly about diversity, by welcoming not just more women and people of color, but also more people with real-world economic and business expertise, rather than only Ph.D.s. Central bankers already meet regularly with academics and financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs. Why not also meet with civil society groups that critique their work?The man he was challenging wasn\u2019t embarrassed. Instead, he said, in effect: Well, if you could just learn to play by the rules, then you could be part of that club. Look at the Japanese. They\u2019ve learned all the rules, and now look where they are.This arrogance, toward the public and even toward one another, undermines central banks\u2019 effectiveness. One of the goals of monetary policy is to shape people\u2019s behavior. When a central bank says it anticipates that prices are going to rise, it expects the public to take that advice seriously. If people do, and they buy things now before prices rise, then perhaps prices won\u2019t rise as much. But central banks need credibility for this stabilizing mechanism to work.There are still, of course, central bankers who argue that they should preserve their mystique or people won\u2019t respect them. Others believe that close ties among central bank officials benefit everyone: The 2008 crisis, for example, might have been much worse if they did not have such open lines of communications. One central banker I know, from one of the Group of 7 countries, spoke movingly about how much he valued his deep personal relationships with leaders at the People\u2019s Bank of China. He said both sides shared quite sensitive information and did whatever they could, within the boundaries of their professional obligations, to support one another.In an era of increasing economic nationalism, this cosmopolitan culture may be difficult to maintain.Holmes never worried about this sort of thing. In \u201cA Study in Scarlet,\u201d upon being told that the earth in fact revolves around the sun, Holmes declares, \u201cWhat the deuce is it to me?\u201d Dr. Watson is shocked, but Holmes insists, \u201cIf we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or my work.\u201d His central banking acolytes may not be so lucky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Does No One Vote in Local Elections?", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiming is everything \u2014 and moving them to align with national polls would drive up participation.Professor Hajnal is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Uneven Democracy: Turnout, Race, and Representation in City Politics.\u201dAmerica is facing a crisis on which, for once, Democrats and Republicans can agree: low voter turnout in local elections. Nationwide, only 27 percent of eligible voters vote in the typical municipal election. The result is that an extraordinarily unrepresentative set of residents determines how local governments distribute services and spend the almost $2 trillion that local governments control. In some places, that means that politically active conservative, wealthy, older, white voters have disproportionate sway over local government. In others that means that organized and energetic unions can move policy their way. Seldom is that control shared across the spectrum \u2014 and democracy suffers as a result.This isn\u2019t a new problem, and its causes are fairly obvious: Many local elections are held on dates other than national elections. Sometimes it\u2019s a different day; sometimes it\u2019s an off-year, in between midterms and presidential votes. It\u2019s hard enough getting people to vote for president and Congress; it\u2019s even harder to get them out again to vote for county and city officials.Fortunately, there\u2019s an equally simple solution, and it comes at little cost: Move the dates of local elections to coincide with statewide and national contests. The logic is clear. When local elections are not held on the first Tuesday of November with other statewide and national contests, local voters need to learn the date of their local election, find their local election polling place and make a specific trip to the polls just to vote on local contests. That is a lot of extra work just to vote for a school board contest or a special district measure. By moving those elections to coincide with national elections, though, we make local voting essentially costless. Citizens who are already voting for higher level offices need only check off a few more boxes further down the ballot.That small change in timing makes a huge difference in turnout. In 2016, Baltimore moved to on-cycle elections and its participation soared. Registered voter turnout went from just 13 percent in the last election before the switch to 60 percent in the first on-cycle election. San Diego has on-cycle city elections and generally high turnout \u2014 76 percent in November 2016. But when scandal forced the city to hold an off-cycle mayoral contest in 2013, turnout dropped to 35 percent. Research shows that participation in local elections in cities doubles in on-cycle elections. And when turnout doubles, the skew in turnout declines, local government becomes more representative of its residents and policies become more responsive to the broader public.Remarkably, in these days of partisan polarization, Democrats and Republicans both overwhelmingly favor the same solution. The only national survey done on the subject shows that 73 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of Republicans favored on-cycle over off-cycle elections.And perhaps even more remarkably, Democratic and Republican leaders are both pushing the same reform. In 2015, California\u2019s overwhelmingly Democratic state government passed a law mandating on-cycle local elections when local turnout falls below a certain threshold. This year, Arizona\u2019s overwhelmingly Republican state government passed an almost identical law.But there is still a lot of work to be done. The vast majority of cities around the country continue to hold off-cycle elections. And despite the obvious gains to our democracy, many do not want to change. Incumbents who have won office under the old, low turnout system often fight the shift. And interest groups that have been allowed to dominate sparsely populated elections won\u2019t want to give up their power. Nevertheless, given the potential of this reform to expand participation and improve local democracy and given the widespread bipartisan support behind it, this is a rare opportunity that we cannot let pass by.

Hajnal, a professor of political science at the University of California San Diego, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Uneven Democracy: Turnout, Race, and Representation in City Politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Four Thousand Miles for the W\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "Not long ago, the Seattle Seahawks looked like a budding dynasty. With the franchise trying to rebuild on the fly, a trip to London came at the worst possible time. Or was it the best?The N.F.L. told the Seattle Seahawks last winter that they would face the Raiders in London on Oct. 14.Back then, months before the rest of the 2018 schedule came out, the Seahawks could never have anticipated that last weekend\u2019s trip to London would come at a pivotal juncture for the franchise: Their record stood at 2-3 after a tough loss to the Los Angeles Rams.Then it was time to spread the gospel of American football overseas. Instead of heading about 670 miles south to Oakland, Calif., the Seahawks would fly nearly 5,000 miles to England, eight time zones away.Sending an N.F.L. team overseas is a herculean venture. Players need passports, the equipment staff sends supplies months in advance, the travel director has to navigate an unfamiliar airport and hotel, and the trainers will often modify the players\u2019 diet and sleep regimens. Then there is the equipment, some 21,000 pounds of it, that must be transported.Maybe, with pressure mounting, a venture far away was exactly what this franchise needed.The Seahawks, who had a home game the Sunday before they left for London, practiced the next Tuesday and Wednesday, then left for London on Wednesday night, accompanied by a New York Times reporter and photographer.In the locker room, the mood was loose. Cornerback Neiko Thorpe challenged all comers in table tennis. At his locker, he had a Nintendo Switch gaming console that he was taking on the trip.\u201cHe was who he was, and I think that speaks more volumes about the fun or the type of person that he was that he brought to this locker room more so than anything,\u201d receiver Doug Baldwin said.Their warm comments were a reminder of how difficult it is to keep winning teams together in the N.F.L. The Seahawks were poised to win their second consecutive Super Bowl when, with the ball near the goal line, they opted to pass instead of hand off the ball to Lynch. The interception and loss that followed, against the New England Patriots, halted any talk of a dynasty and left some players, including Lynch, bitter.Now they had to defeat Lynch.They boarded a chartered Airbus A340-600 that included 45 sleeping pods in first class for the veteran players. Coach Pete Carroll sat in the first row of business class along with other coaches. Rookies and members of the practice squad sat behind them. About half the 170 passengers sat in coach, which was filled with giddy chatter before takeoff. The menu was the same for everyone: beef filet, Cajun chicken or herb roasted salmon.For this trip, Ramsden reversed the program: He told players to sleep as much as possible on the flight so when they arrived in London on Thursday afternoon, they would have enough energy to stay up until 9 or 10 p.m. and then get a full night\u2019s rest.\u201cWe try to protect their circadian rhythms as much as possible,\u201d Ramsden said.Ramsden\u2019s staff prepared sleep kits for \u201cmental alertness.\u201d They included blackout eye masks. Some players took melatonin or Ambien, while others used earbuds that played the sounds of wind and rushing water to induce sleep.A few people slept on the floor or were splayed across a row of seats. Wagner watched game video on his iPad. A half-dozen others, including the twins Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, played the card game Spades in the bar area in first class. They trash-talked, laughed and threw $20 bills to the winners. They seemed unaware that Carroll, who tries to give his players room to be themselves, was sleeping in a seat a few feet away.The urgency of the moment seemed intangible \u2014 and maybe that was the point.The players and coaches rolled off the plane on Thursday about 1:30 p.m. Some players struggled to stay awake, like defensive end Frank Clark, who draped his thick coat over his head.Buses took them to the Grove, a resort in Watford, north of London, that features grass tennis courts and a golf course.It has plenty of amenities, but nothing was left to chance. The team shipped 1,150 rolls of athletic tape, two tons of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 pairs of shoes and 240 pairs of socks. In all, the Seahawks had shipped 21,000 pounds of gear and products worth $770,000. Some items \u2014 toiletries, snacks, bottled water, Gorilla Glue, lighters (to burn off loose threads) and cayenne pepper, which when mixed with talcum powder keeps players\u2019 feet warm \u2014 were ordered from the Amazon U.K. website.In the evening, the players let off some steam at a Topgolf facility. Broken into groups of four, they tried to hit balls into giant holes to score points, and took grief every time they were wildly off target.\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Wagner yelled at Austin Calitro, another linebacker.Thorpe, a cornerback, dug into a pile of chicken wings and posted videos on social media. \u201cThis is how I imagined it,\u201d he said of the team\u2019s first day in England.Wilson was in the first booth and seemed to be taking his swings seriously as the three veteran offensive linemen who sat with him checked their cellphones.Then, finally, it was time to return to the hotel, for smoothies, bottles of water and sleep.After several hours of meetings and a practice, some veterans left on a coach bus for Covent Garden and their only chance to see central London. Another bus took about a dozen younger players, with money in their pockets and no family in tow, to Watford Junction station, where they rode the train into London.At a loss where to go, a few English rugby players, who watched the Seahawks practice that day, helped them find Nike Town at Oxford Circus.At the front of the store, mannequins dressed in Seahawks gear stood next to racks of N.F.L. jerseys and shirts. \u201cMan, there\u2019s a lot of Patriots stuff here,\u201d Azeem Victor, a linebacker on the practice squad, said. As he looked for a soccer jersey, two shoppers separately asked him for help, assuming he worked there.Italian tourists asked to take photographs with the players, which made Rashaad Penny, a rookie running back, feel like a rock star. He soon video-chatted with somebody to describe what had happened.Penny and the other players were enjoying the chance to get away from the endless meetings and practices, and the expectations of their coaches and veterans. Lavon Coleman, another running back, stood wide-eyed in the street as people streamed past. He asked strangers for directions and food recommendations. He posed for pictures with Raiders fans from Denmark.\u201cI like that I can be myself,\u201d he said.A group of players went looking for food, but didn\u2019t seem interested in challenging their taste buds. They ended up at a Shake Shack. Linemen Jordan Roos and Elijah Nkansah went to a pub. Surprised by how warm their pints of Guinness were, they went to another pub and ordered lagers that were chilled to their satisfaction. Several more pints were consumed before, with the clock ticking toward the midnight curfew, they made their way to Euston station. There, they bumped into Brett Hundley, the backup quarterback, and several others. The players filled half a train car and compared notes on their first glimpses of London on a commuter train back to Watford Junction.Carroll takes his players to the stadium the day before a road game so they can visualize conditions ahead of time. At 1:30 p.m., the Seahawks drove to Wembley, where they saw the locker room, which had been set up with their gear, and the field, the most famous soccer pitch in England. Worried about the slickness of the grass, Erik Kennedy, the equipment manager, had longer screw-in cleats available for the players.Carroll and the team returned to the Grove around 4 p.m. Wilson, Wagner, Baldwin and a few other players got ready to meet two dozen fans in a session that was broadcast on Facebook Live.In the green room beforehand, the players signed footballs and helmets. Wilson, mindful of his public image, asked a producer if there was anything to worry about. He was assured that the talk was in front of friendly fans.At the event, Baldwin did not sugarcoat his description of the team, even in front of his coach.\u201cPete wouldn\u2019t want to call it this, but it\u2019s a retooling, a process we\u2019re all going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a great job of bringing the young guys along, of establishing what our culture is again, re-establishing it so the young guys can buy into it. It\u2019s been a difficult process but I think, moving forward, we\u2019re going to be really good.\u201dN.F.L. players do whatever they can to relax in the early hours on game day.Some Seahawks packed, others looked at yet more video.D.J. Fluker, the team\u2019s enormous guard, found solace in the players\u2019 lounge, where he sat alone playing the Madden football video game. Fluker, who filled his roster with current and former stars like Antonio Brown and Ronnie Lott, played a virtual foe. He flicked through offensive formations, which he said were similar to those in N.F.L. playbooks. He liked the distraction.\u201cIt takes away my anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I think about football too much, I\u2019ll get antsy. You can be overprepared.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to worry. From the opening whistle of the game, the Seahawks seemed to have every advantage. The meticulous planning, the sleep kits, the choreographed downtime and maybe even the pints of Guinness seemed to help steady the players at a fragile moment. Or maybe they were just better.The defense stifled Lynch, the Raiders running back, while Wilson effortlessly led the Seahawks\u2019 offense up and down the field. Final score: 27-3.As the Seahawks piled back into their locker room, now 3-3 and brimming with confidence, one player yelled, \u201cFour thousand miles for the dub,\u201d a reference to a W, a win.Inside the locker room, before the news media were allowed in, the players were screaming and slapping shoulders. Rainn Wilson, an actor on the television comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d and a big Seahawks fan, was brought in to address the rowdy players. \u201cThat was Seahawks football today,\u201d he yelled as players whooped it up.Then Carroll, his voice hoarse, thanked the staff that organized the trip, \u201cthe whole thing.\u201dAt 1:30 a.m., the Seahawks departed Gatwick Airport. Coleman, sitting in economy class, collected piles of pillows and built a bed on the floor in front of an emergency exit.The flight home was far quieter than the one to London. The staff worked overtime during the four-day trip and many of them were asleep before takeoff. Exhausted after three hours of high-powered football, the players lumbered into their pods.Nearly 10 hours later, the plane landed in Seattle. Carroll spoke over the plane\u2019s intercom, announcing a day off for everyone who did not need to see the training staff. Cheers erupted.He called it a \u201cgreat week,\u201d and then said, \u201cTo everybody, thanks a lot, appreciate ya, love ya, bye.\u201dThe bliss lasted roughly 12 hours. In midafternoon, word spread that Allen, the team\u2019s owner and a co-founder of Microsoft, had died.In football and in life, even the best trips come to an end.Advertisement"}

Politicians used to deceive voters by describing their policies in misleading ways. For example, the Bush administration was prone to things like claiming that tax breaks for the wealthy were really all about helping seniors \u2014 because extremely rich Americans tend to be quite old.But Republicans no longer bother with deceptive presentations of facts. Instead, they just flat-out lie.The true Republican position on health care has been clear and consistent for decades: The party hates, just hates, the idea of government action to make essential health care available to all citizens, regardless of income or medical history.So if you\u2019re a voter who cares about health care, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to figure out where the parties stand. If you believe that Medicare is a bad thing and the government shouldn\u2019t protect people with pre-existing conditions, vote Republican. If you want to defend Medicare and ensure coverage even for those who have health problems, vote Democrat.Now, you might imagine that Republicans would respond to the manifest unpopularity of their health care position by, you know, actually changing their position. But that would be hopelessly old-fashioned. As I said, what they\u2019ve chosen to do instead is lie, insisting that black is white and up is down.And what did \u201cTrump\u201d say Democrats would do?

If the Affordable Care Act is killed, I\u2019ll be back in the same trap. Mr. Eichenwald, a former New York Times reporter, is the author of a memoir about living with epilepsy. Health insurance rules my life. It decides my jobs, my aspirations, my retirement plans and, potentially, my citizenship.When asked how people like me are supposed to obtain insurance, these politicians virtually shrug, trotting out failed ideas from the past or promising that the free market will provide.I couldn\u2019t buy a private policy, because companies either rejected me or imposed a \u201cpre-existing condition clause,\u201d leaving uncovered anything related to my epilepsy. That meant if I was hit by a car after falling into the street during a convulsion, I\u2019d still be on the hook for the full cost of treating my injuries.When I was 23, I approached the founder of a small magazine I had written for, seeking a staff job. He knew about my epilepsy. Apologizing, he explained that another employee also had expensive health problems, and if I was hired, the magazine wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the premiums. I thanked him for his honesty and scratched that option off the list.The next day, the offer came, with one change \u2014 no group insurance. Instead, I would receive $500 to buy my own policy. When I told him that could not work, he pressed me to explain. Reluctantly, I revealed my epilepsy. The next morning, on my first day of work, he told me that I was off salary and I was no longer allowed in the office. Less than 24 hours after I disclosed my epilepsy, the advocacy group decided I had to work as a freelancer from home. My chance for insurance evaporated.Job after job followed, none with coverage. Months before my dreaded 25th birthday, I took a low-level editor\u2019s post compiling career announcements for a Washington magazine; I hated the work, but I needed the health coverage. Weeks into the job, the insurer rejected a bill for my anticonvulsants; unknown to me until that moment, the magazine\u2019s insurance policy included a pre-existing condition clause.Desperate, I pleaded with colleagues for help. One journalist offered to assist me in gaining work as a copy boy at The New York Times \u2014 a job many rungs lower on the career ladder, but one that offered insurance. In my interview, a perplexed editor stared at my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Why, he asked, would I trade an editor\u2019s job for one fetching coffee?I lied. I revealed nothing about my health issues or my fears of financial wreckage. Instead, I rhapsodized about The Times. I got the job.I worked seven days a week as a copy boy and then news clerk, terrified that easing up would cost me my job and my insurance. Thankfully, in 1988, The Times promoted me to reporter. So we are left considering a more dramatic option: leaving the United States for a European country that guarantees coverage. We consulted a lawyer, who is helping me try to gain German citizenship, and my wife, who was born in England, is renewing her British passport. But it angers us that we might be forced to leave our home simply because of this nation\u2019s broken health policies.For almost 40 years, my battle for insurance sent my life in directions I often didn\u2019t desire. Now it tears at me to know that the final choice \u2014 obtaining foreign citizenship and moving an ocean away from our friends and loved ones \u2014 might be necessary.

If you do anything at all, put out a statement saying you support the #MeToo movement, that it\u2019s an overdue and necessary corrective, and that you are taking some time for self-reflection. Spend some months ordering takeout and avoiding parties where everyone is whispering about what they think you did.Rape is what Stephen Elliott was accused of. His entry, along with more than a dozen others on the list, was highlighted in red to denote physical violence. It read: \u201cRape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, unsolicited invitations to his apartment, a dude who snuck into Binders\u201d (a women-only Facebook group).It may have served that purpose for some women. But did it tell the truth about all of the men on it? In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Elliott said: \u201cNo one is going to come forward and say that I raped them. I don\u2019t believe even my enemies believe I raped somebody.\u201dSo what does he want? \u201cAn apology would be good,\u201d he said. \u201cLegal fees would also be good. But maybe seeing it argued out in the court of law will help good people come to their senses and distance themselves from the rotten parts of this movement.\u201dA year ago, that\u2019s where Mr. Elliott was. \u201cMultiple people asked me at first if I was O.K. just taking a bullet for the movement,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause of their politics and, frankly, because of mine.\u201d \u201cIf I was to come out and say, \u2018Hey, I was falsely accused of rape,\u2019 it would be like I was attacking this movement which at the time, was a movement that I believed in,\u201d he said.So Mr. Elliott hid out. \u201cI sat in my apartment and got high for three months,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the closet.\u201dOver those months, he says his life started to fall apart. He lost friends. His Hollywood agent stopped calling him back. Already prone to depression, he became suicidal. I met him in early February for the first time. He had reached out to me via Facebook asking if I would read the essay he\u2019d written about his experience \u2014 it had been accepted and then rejected by New York Magazine and The Guardian, at that point. When we met for coffee in a Beverly Hills hotel lobby, I found him to be shaky and depressed.No longer.\u201cI really feel like I\u2019m happy for the first time since this started,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a politics. I know who my friends are.\u201dWhat are those politics? \u201cI still think of myself as a liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the left moved away from liberalism and I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. If you are a liberal, by definition, you believe that it\u2019s better to let a certain amount of guilty people go free than to jail one innocent man. That\u2019s almost the definition of liberalism. These people on the left aren\u2019t liberals at all, actually. What I\u2019ve come to realize is how close they are to the people on the right.\u201dOf course, none of this means he couldn\u2019t have attempted to rape someone.In the wake of his Quillette essay, two more women came forward with complaints. When I asked him about these stories, Mr. Elliott said: \u201cI\u2019ve certainly been unaware of boundaries and transgressed them without realizing.\u201d But he insists that Ms. Lenz\u2019s and Ms. Siegel\u2019s accounts are not only full of half-truths or lies, but beside the point. \u201cThese people are trying to get me to engage in any argument that is not about the fact that I was falsely accused of rape,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d He added: \u201cIf your position is that it\u2019s O.K. to falsely accuse someone of rape because you don\u2019t like them, just own that position. That\u2019s clearly what a lot of people believe.\u201dOn the one hand, Stephen Elliott v. Moira Donegan and Jane Does (1-30) is a straightforward defamation case.The complaint says that the statements on the list were \u201cabusive, vulgar, intentionally misleading,\u201d that \u201cthe Defendants\u2019 actions were malicious in nature,\u201d and that the list was \u201csent to numerous members of the parties\u2019 shared profession, the media industry to intentionally harm Plaintiff\u2019s reputation and further cause harm to Plaintiff\u2019s career.\u201dThis account of maliciousness does not at all square with how Ms. Donegan has described her aim in creating the list.\u201cI thought it was a good essay,\u201d Mr. Elliott offered when I ask him about it. \u201cThe problem with it is that it\u2019s not honest. She deliberately mischaracterizes her motivation. If you create something with the intention of hurting your enemies, that\u2019s a weapon.\u201dHe is planning to provide documents to the court that he thinks prove Ms. Donegan\u2019s intent was malicious. Chief among them are since-deleted tweets, like:That\u2019s the straightforward part.The new part is that this is a case being brought against a mostly anonymous group who created an anonymous list containing potentially defamatory statements.I asked Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment expert, about this case, and he said he had never seen one like it. Andrew T. Miltenberg, Stephen Elliott\u2019s attorney, admits he\u2019s never brought one like it.\u201cI\u2019ve had cases where we know what the allegations are and we know who said them. None of that is true here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intersection between the internet and allegations like this and anonymity is very dangerous place to be. There\u2019s no protection for the accused. It\u2019s the perfect way to assassinate someone\u2019s character without having to prove anything.\u201dThe other thing that sets this case apart is that it seems likely to snowball \u2014 perhaps more than Mr. Miltenberg appreciated when he took it on.But when he described what could qualify someone as a defendant \u2014 anyone who wrote on the list, edited the list or published it \u2014 15 or 20 seems like a fraction of what the actual number could be. I know dozens of women who have at least emailed the list or received it.I\u2019m one of them. I asked a friend to send me the list. Once I had it, I allowed a few others to look at it on my phone. Does that make me a Jane Doe? Does sharing it with other journalists count as publishing?\u201cSending an email to one person could count as publishing under certain circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Miltenberg.In that case, I suggested to him, you might have many, many more than 30 Jane Does. \u201cThis might be like a 500-person RICO case,\u201d he replied, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.That sounds a bit terrifying, not just in scope, but also in terms of free speech ramifications. If this is grounds for a suit, couldn\u2019t everyone who has ever shared an Alex Jones rant about Sandy Hook being a \u201choax\u201d be subject to civil litigation of this sort? When I asked Mr. Abrams, the first amendment lawyer, about how he would defend this case, at first he said, \u201cIf you say someone has committed rape, it\u2019s very difficult to defend the case without showing that that\u2019s true.\u201dLater, though, he drilled down on the specific language in the spreadsheet: It does not say \u201crape\u201d after all. It says \u201crape accusations.\u201d\u201cThe very first thing I would say to the jury is that she never accused him of rape, but said that he had been accused by some women of rape and that they should bear that in mind. In saying that, she protected those women and certainly didn\u2019t libel him.\u201d\u201cThis is not a \u2018save men\u2019 case for me,\u201d Mr. Miltenberg said of Mr. Elliott. \u201cThis is a case of a person having their name, reputation and future ruined by anonymous allegations that can neither be tested nor challenged.\u201dOver the past year, as #MeToo has morphed into a verb, I\u2019ve been involved in heated discussions about any number of men who have been MeTooed. About Al Franken. About Leon Wieseltier. About Louis C.K. About Brett Kavanaugh.In all of those cases, it is possible to ask: What is the appropriate punishment for behavior that is wrong but perhaps wouldn\u2019t stand up as a crime in a court of law?In the case of Stephen Elliott it is impossible to say almost anything at all about the allegation. There is no named accuser. There is no night in question. There aren\u2019t even contending memories. There is nothing other than what\u2019s written in the cell of that spreadsheet.But something that Ms. Siegel wrote in her essay struck me as one plausible explanation: \u201cWhat happened is that years of behaving badly (not criminally) caught up to him.\"\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger out there about me,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of anger that could produce a malicious allegation \u2014 especially when it\u2019s an anonymous list. I don\u2019t like this guy. So I put his name on the list, throw in a TV dinner, watch \u2018The Wire\u2019 and forget about it.\u201dAn earlier version of this essay included outdated information about Lyz Lenz. She is no longer the managing editor of The Rumpus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election 2018 Digital Misinformation Roundup ", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe midterm elections are 17 days away. Here is a collection of coverage from The New York Times and elsewhere on efforts to mislead voters on social media and the wider internet.As Election Day draws near, a growing amount of disinformation is getting published online to confuse, inflame or distract potential voters. To help readers better understand the information landscape, journalists at The Times have collected five examples of active disinformation campaigns that were reported on or took place this week. On Thursday, Twitter suspended a network of suspected Twitter bots that were sending pro-Saudi Arabian government talking points about the disappearance of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Curiously, many of the accounts were older and dormant. NBC reported that a batch of them \u201cwere created within minutes of each other on Nov. 16 and 17, 2017. Dozens of other bot accounts were created within the same hour on various dates in 2012.\u201dAs CNN reportedWhile the vast majority of the pages and events had no followers or attendees, some of the fake events promoting the wrong march date became popular. Fake events for Philadelphia and Chicago received more than 10,000 RSVPs; the event posted for Seattle picked up more than 20,000. (As ever with numbers on social media sites, it is possible that at least some of the RSVPs came from fake accounts used to make a page seem more popular).\u201cThe coordinated messaging across over 40 pages within a 24-hour period using popular hashtags such as #womenswave and #womensmarch, coupled with locations that include Hartford, Conn., Kodiak, Alaska, Reno, Nev., and Butte, Mont., underlines the potential for legitimate users to become targets of nonpolitical disinformation on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Decker said. Both troll operations put their governments\u2019 needs first. Russia\u2019s troll operation primarily targeted Russian speakers, while Iran\u2019s focused on pushing regime messaging abroad by promoting aligned websites.The Russian trolls were nonpartisan: they tried to inflame everybody, regardless of race, creed, politics, or sexual orientation. On many occasions, they pushed both sides of divisive issues.Other than in the United States, the troll operations do not appear to have had significant influence on public debate.The problem: It wasn\u2019t true. The Washington Post\u2019s fact-check columnist Glenn Kessler went on Twitter to criticize the Brat campaign for misrepresenting his work:During a recent one-week period, the group looked at more than 100,000 political images that were circulated within 347 public groups discussing Brazilian politics on the app.Looking at the most widely shared 50 items, the group concluded that only four were \u201cfully truthful.\u201d In some posts, the pictures were real but \u201cused out of their original context or related to distorted data.\u201d Others posts \u201cincluded unsubstantiated claims.\u201d And some were just flat-out untrue.

Ha.So let\u2019s go easy on this 2001 Styles article that declared, well, not the end of the internet, precisely, but an end to the idea that the internet was culturally relevant and cool. The dot-com crash of 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks the next year, marked \u201cthe next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble,\u201d wrote the article\u2019s author, John Schwartz. Those twin cataclysms led to \u201cthe bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, of the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.\u201d It bears noting that Mark Zuckerberg would enroll at Harvard the following year. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.A generation of young entrepreneurs who had ridden the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d to overnight fortunes and rock star status saw their paper millions vanish overnight as the Nasdaq index collapsed by 78 percent. They lost a lot more than money, Mr. Schwartz argued. \u201cNot much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true believers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules.\u201d Mr. Schwartz quoted a New York Magazine article by Michael Wolff, \u201chimself a failed dot-com executive,\u201d who had written, \u201call it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desire.\u201d Indeed, it was not enough for the young web plutocrats to make money; \u201cthey had to make history,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote. \u201cNow they themselves are history.\u201dHenry Blodget, a former tech industry analyst \u201cwho became famous for predicting early that Amazon.com would reach $400 a share\u201d \u2014 jeepers!\u2014 announced that he was \u201ctaking a buyout and leaving Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35,\u201d and was also writing a book, Mr. Schwartz noted. Ellen DeGeneres even attempted a sitcom about a failed dot-com executive, which became another dot-bomb. \u201cFor the most part,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote, \u201cthe flood of dot-com failure stories is being met with a national yawn.\u201dCollege students who had spent the \u201990s with \u201cvisions of Testarossas dancing in their heads\u201d as they hoped to emulate geek stars like Marc Andreessen of Netscape were now saying that they want \u201cfulfilling jobs, not just ways of earning money,\u201d according to a University of Maryland professor quoted in the article. This made sense in an economy where many skeptics assumed the days of easy money were gone for good. As the writer Thomas Frank, a fierce critic of New Economy values, was quoted saying, \u201cthe Dow isn\u2019t going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren\u2019t going to come back.\u201dBut with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that 2001 was not the end of internet culture, but rather, the end of the beginning of internet culture. Today\u2019s young tech moguls \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s $60 billion man, Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 are not only among the richest people in the world, they are also Beyonc\u00e9-level stars in the eyes of the starry-eyed postgraduates who flock to tech\u2019s promised land, hoping, like the characters in HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d to carve out their slice of the future.When contacted last week about the story, he thanked me for the opportunity to stay humble, but added: \u201cAs the story predicted, a new generation of companies has arisen and changed the world since that story ran: It includes Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Theranos.\u201d He continued, \u201cif there\u2019s a lesson in taking a new look at this old story, it has to be to never bet against greed, and never bet on a cultural shift that requires tech companies to grow a conscience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Meatloaf? Add Tomato Sauce and Cheese", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenThis not-necessarily-authentic take on the classic takes its inspiration from an Italian-American red sauce restaurant.Usually I go to the market or grocery store for inspiration, buy whatever looks most tantalizing and head home to make dinner. Other times, I have a more-or-less fixed idea of what I want, but haven\u2019t fine-tuned it.The other day, I wanted meatloaf, but not any old meatloaf. I didn\u2019t want an American-style version, bland yet comforting. I grew up on that: It was fine, cooked not in the oven, but on a rack in our trusty electric skillet, set on low and covered for an hour and a half. That meatloaf emerged moist, with its signature stripe of bottled chile sauce running end to end down the center. We ate it warm for dinner, or had it cold for lunch on white bread slathered with Miracle Whip.I had in a mind a meatloaf that conjured the feeling of an Italian-American red sauce restaurant. My fantasy was big, flavorful and not at all subtle: a kind of tasty meatball, but bigger, cheesy, drowned in sauce and baked.To this mixture, I added salt and pepper, red-pepper flakes, crushed fennel seed, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, oregano and cubes of provolone. I also blanched and finely chopped some broccoli rabe \u2014 a little voice told me to. The mixture was highly seasoned and delicious (I cooked a small patty to check) and rather wet, which is what you want for a moist meatloaf. I molded it into an oval and placed it in a baking dish.Now it needed a bold red sauce, which I made quickly with canned tomato pur\u00e9e and canned crushed tomatoes, to be poured generously over the loaf. Not stopping there, I topped the whole affair with grated pecorino and provolone and a fistful of dried bread crumbs.I can report success. This meatloaf is loaded with flavor and has a retro red-sauce essence \u2014 so much so, I nearly considered serving it with a side of spaghetti.Bring on the reds, and make them Italian. Not much mystery in this pairing, and choices abound. I\u2019m a sangiovese nut, so I would reach for a young Chianti Classico or Rosso di Montalcino, reds with plenty of acidity and that sweet-bitter combination that seems so intrinsically Italian. Underrated Dolcetto di Dogliani would be great, as would an Etna Rosso or an aglianico from Taurasi or Vulture. This dish also offers an opportunity to try some less familiar wines, like a sagrantino from Umbria, a fumin or cornalin from the Valle d\u2019Aosta, a Rosso Conero from Le Marche, made largely of the montepulciano grape, or a Cir\u00f2 from Calabria, made from the gaglioppo grape. Bubbles? A dry, earthy Lambrusco would be delicious. ERIC ASIMOVAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bearded Seal My Son May Never Hunt", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInupiat have sustained themselves with these seals for thousands of years in the Bering Sea. Climate change threatens this tradition.Ms. Ivanoff is a writer. UNALAKLEET, Alaska \u2014 It\u2019s October and we haven\u2019t yet had a frost. The ground is still soft. When my grandpa was little, ice anchored to the shore would begin to form at this time of year. But last year that didn\u2019t happen until around March and it melted soon after. Every May, when the ocean ice begins to melt and break up, my husband, my daughter and I look forward to a call from my dad or my brother: \u201cCan you be ready in an hour?\u201d We excitedly make snacks and fill a thermos, grab guns and knives, put on our snow pants, parkas and boots, and meet at the boat.Some years, those large bearded seals lie less than a mile from town. In other years, we travel more than 20 miles. No matter the distance, my dad and brother have studied the winds and can tell whether it\u2019s safe to take the 20-foot boats out in the open ocean.And we love it. The water glistens the air is clear and so are our senses as we scan for gray masses on the ice pans.Sometimes small flocks of snow geese stand on ice pans. We boat up, Dad ready with the shotgun. He shoots and we retrieve the geese that fall. Later, while we picnic on the beach, one of us will pluck them and white feathers will blow against the black, rocky shore.We continue our search for ugruk, grateful to share the moments on the ocean with these quiet, confident and beautiful creatures.And then we see it, a big mammal lazing on the ice. Someone grabs the binoculars to look for its characteristic orange face. We slowly get closer, but the animal is spooked. It wakes \u2014 its head lifts up and the back flipper moves. My brother fires. The head drops. The seal lies there, inert. And we feel gratitude to it. The guys begin to cut the flippers and the tail. They remove the blubber that will be used for oil. They remove the organs, the ribs, they rinse the qiaq, or intestines, in the salty ocean water. In the spring, while I was seven months pregnant with our son, Inuqtaq, my husband asked me, \u201cWhat do we want him to know?\u201d I appreciated his question \u2014 forward-thinking, intentional. He\u2019ll be a good dad. \u201cI want him to learn how to boat out in the ice,\u201d I said with a smile in my belly and on my face. \u201cI want him to know how to read the wind, the current and movement of the ice like his grandpa and uncle. I want him to be able to bring us out ugruk hunting when he\u2019s older.\u201d Teaching Inuqtaq how to hunt would ensure we\u2019d eat the food that feeds more than our bodies.Because the indigenous experience is one of loss. My community, like others around the world, has lost a lot: Language. Ceremonies. Dances. Songs. Ways of connecting to the earth, and to one another. We lost ways of nourishing ourselves. Inuqtaq hunting ugruk was going to be a life-giving act of intentional decolonization, our way of keeping alive a simple custom that\u2019s become sacred. It was going to be his way of connecting to his uncle, his grandpa. His way of appreciating the waters. His way of grounding himself, connecting to the Inupiat who hunted the waters of the Norton Sound for millenniums. His way of knowing where he comes from. Instead, he has inherited a warming ocean with encroaching cod and pollock, species not previously seen in large numbers by our hunters and fishers. An ocean changing so rapidly that the auklets, puffins and other seabirds are dying and washing up on Alaska shores in alarming numbers. He has inherited a Norton Sound that, I fear, is becoming too warm for ice to form and ugruk to inhabit.Inuqtaq was supposed to learn how to approach the ice pans. He was going to watch the currents, gauge the winds and ice movement so the boat and its passengers aren\u2019t trapped by the ever-moving floes. He was going to shoot, to butcher, to clean and braid the intestines. I looked forward seeing him give water to an ugruk and slip its head and spirit back to the ocean.I hurt for him. And for my family and our stomachs and spirits.My son, not yet crawling, may never harvest an ugruk for his family. His experience is already one of loss. But I remember our values. Our ways of being. Though the earth changes, it is still giving. Providing. Nurturing. Inuqtaq will still learn respect for what gives life. I hope the rest of the world quickly adapts and also respects the earth \u2014 as we have for millenniums and will continue to do. Advertisement"}

But now that America is great again, people like me are to be redefined out of existence.President Trump and company should be prepared for the consequences of this decision \u2014because the people most likely to be disappointed in this Glum New World will be themselves.They will be disappointed to find themselves \u2014 if they are men \u2014 standing in a men\u2019s room with me.

For the past two centuries, America\u2019s farms have expanded and homogenized, and farming equipment and chemicals have replaced personnel. Farmers have grown older and more isolated and are retiring without successors.This year\u2019s proposed Farm Bill awards millions of dollars to wealthy agribusiness and factory farms in the form of commodity subsidies and crop insurance, while cutting funds for important conservation and stewardship programs and offering little to beginning farmers and ranchers or local farmers markets and local food promotion.If politicians and journalists want to know about the problems of agriculture, they are not likely to go out into \u201crural America\u201d to observe the condition of the fields and the waterways or to talk to the farmers and the ex-farmers, the ex-merchants of the small towns, or to talk to the mayors and county judges of rural counties. Instead, they are very likely to talk to academic and bureaucratic experts, who are tightly bound within the industrial structure of agriculture, agri-science and agribusiness.Those problems could be summed up as the triumph of industrialism and industrial values over the lives of living creatures, and over the life of the living world. The preferences and choices of industrialism do not imply a limit of any kind. They rest instead upon the premises of limitless economic growth and limitless consumption, which of course implies limitless waste, and finally exhaustion.Nothing can take form except within limits. No cure is possible, either in policy or practice, except within understood limits, which is to say within a correct diagnosis. This requires patience. A good solution has to begin with a description of the problem that is full, clear, and reliable.A bill intending to help rural communities, furthermore, might forbid the large chain stores to underprice their goods in order to destroy locally owned small stores. I don\u2019t see why the government should not enforce honest prices for the same reason that it enforces honest weights and measures. I am sure that a lot of conservatives would object loudly to such \u201cregulation.\u201d But for small farms and small businesses, the \u201cfree market\u201d is not a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dBoth of the political sides, so far as I am concerned, have to accept responsibility for the emergence of Donald Trump, the autonomous man, the self-made man, economically \u201cfree\u201d and sexually liberated, responsible only to himself, starting from scratch and inventing his own way of doing things. To get outside the trajectory that produced Trump, we will have to go back to tradition. I am unsure when we began to think of, for instance, the 15th Psalm and Jesus\u2019s law of neighborly love as optional. They are not optional, as I think the Amish example proves, and as proved by present failure.Such an economy, within the variables of weather and human capability, would be formed within certain prescribed limits. To the extent that it would be limited and formed or formal, we might assume that it would be stable. Because such an economy has never been tried, we should not think of it with too much confidence. But there is certainly nothing limited or stable in our present casting about the \u201cglobe\u201d for supplies and demands. This, like our present society, is disorderly if not chaotic.The so-called global economy, because it is predicated on the exhaustion of natural sources and of the land-use economies, is far from a sure thing. An interesting question, then, is whether we might intentionally reform our economies upon the principle of self-sufficiency or be forced to do so by the failure of the global economy. Farmers by themselves can\u2019t protect themselves in a \u201cfree market\u201d economy whether it is national or global. At present they have only the very limited self-protection of supporting their own lives so far as possible from their own land \u2014 that is, by producing their own food and fuel, and by harvesting energy from their own sunlight.It can pretty well be demonstrated, however, that technological progress is the result of choices that have been made all the way from the inventors and manufacturers of technologies to the people who buy and use and pay for them. The important questions all have to do with the standards by which these choices are made. If the standards were different, different choices would be made. And in fact we have plenty of evidence that choices can be made that evidently were not made by your Iowa farmer. That the alternative choices often have to be made against powerful social pressures does not mean that they cannot be made or that they are not valid choices. The finally inescapable standards by which agricultural choices must be made are the ecological health of the farm and the economic health of the farmer.The problem of feeding the world should be addressed, first of all, by calculating the waste \u2014 from farmland and topsoil to thrown-away food \u2014 in the world\u2019s \u201cfood systems.\u201d Perhaps somebody has done this. If so, that is the place to start. The people, fairly numerous and highly credentialed, who argue that only industrial agriculture as we now have it can feed the world are arguing in fact that we can feed the world only by an agriculture that destroys both farmland and farmers. There is a point, obviously, beyond which this kind of agriculture will not be able to feed much of anybody.These clich\u00e9s are sustained by the \u201clarger cultural prejudice against manual labor,\u201d which you mention. But there also are active prejudices against farmers, country people, the country, small-town people and small towns. This at least begins the description of a large cultural problem. Because of such prejudices, and also because of economic adversity, farmers encourage their children to leave farming. Their departing children, so few of them as they now are, amount to an invaluable cultural and economic resource, to which our present economy attaches no value at all.What can we do about this? First, those of us who care must keep trying to bring about improvements, which we can do, and are doing, locally \u2014 where, in any event, the improvements will have to be made. Second, we have got to be patient. That this is a cultural problem means that it can\u2019t be simply or quickly solved. What you speak of as a \u201cpassion for farming\u201d can grow only from an understanding of the intelligence and the learning involved in the right kind of farming, and we should add an understanding of the better cultures of husbandry and of the traditional agrarian values. These things we must try to keep alive, not because of their \u201cpotential value\u201d but because they are now and forever right.Gracy Olmstead is an Idaho native living and writing outside Washington.Advertisement"}

Early in the proceedings, I approached him in a corridor during a break and asked if he was nervous. He wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat\u2019s the expression?\u201d he said to me. \u201cMy record speaks for itself.\u201dThe cases began with a wide-ranging investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, first revealed a year ago after agents fanned out across the country and arrested 10 men, including assistant basketball coaches at the University of Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State and the University of Southern California. Federal law enforcement, employing its customary methods \u2014 wiretaps, hidden cameras, \u201cflipping\u201d suspects and turning them into informants \u2014 put names and faces to long-rumored dirty dealing on the college recruiting circuit. One of the central threads in the current trial involves the recruitment of Brian Bowen Jr., a 6-foot-7 forward from Saginaw, Mich., known to his friends and family as Tugs. The defendants are James Gatto, an executive with Adidas, the sports apparel company; Merl Code, an Adidas consultant; and Christian Dawkins, a \u201crunner,\u201d or go-between, for an N.B.A. agent whose job it was to recruit clients. They are charged with a range of felonies, including wire fraud.The trial told an important story about the buying and selling of young basketball prospects, often in ways that are invisible to the players themselves. The teenage basketball stars are commodities to the hustlers and cons in the hoops underworld \u2014 and more disturbingly, sometimes to their own families. But the looming question for the jury is whether the government, in addition to staging a compelling courtroom drama, has made a convincing case that the defendants broke federal laws \u2014 rather than just N.C.A.A. recruiting rules.The essential facts of the case are unchallenged by the defense: The three men worked together to induce Bowen to enroll at the University of Louisville, an Adidas-sponsored school whose athletes are required to wear Adidas-branded shoes and gear. Bowen\u2019s father, Brian Bowen Sr., was promised $100,000 by Dawkins, with the money to be provided by Adidas. (All colleges at the top level of N.C.A.A. sports are sponsored by one of the major sports apparel companies, and they become known as \u201cAdidas schools,\u201d \u201cNike schools\u201d or \u201cUnder Armour schools.\u201d)Tugs Bowen, now 19, was declared ineligible to play at Louisville last season after the charges were filed \u2014 and after he transferred to the University of South Carolina, the N.C.A.A. said he could not compete there, either. He is currently playing for a pro team in Australia.He explained that he had been accepting money for his son\u2019s services since Tugs was in his midteens. He took $4,000 in return for his son to play on an Adidas-sponsored amateur team in Michigan \u2014 and then $25,000 to switch to a Nike-sponsored amateur squad in Chicago.He said he was paid $2,000 a month by the basketball coach at La Lumiere School in Indiana, a well-regarded private school (it\u2019s the alma mater of John Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the Supreme Court) where Tugs transferred after his sophomore year at a public school in Saginaw. He said that in all these instances, including what he called the \u201cmoney scheme\u201d at Louisville, his son was unaware of the cash he was taking.\u201cSo you\u2019ve been pimping out your namesake since he was 14 years old?\u201d Dawkins\u2019s lawyer, Steve Haney, asked on cross-examination. Bowen did not disagree. He quibbled only about the timing, saying he had not started taking money until Tugs was 15 or 16.A federal crime must have a victim. In this case, the victims, according to the government\u2019s case, are the universities \u2014 including Louisville, the highest-grossing team in college basketball, which plays in an N.B.A.-style arena and has generated about $45 million in annual revenue over the past several years. The prosecution contends that the defendants harmed the universities by saddling them with ineligible players, which could have caused them to have to forfeit games as well as revenue from the lucrative postseason tournament.Part of the defense case is that the three defendants could not possibly have caused harm to the universities by making recruits ineligible, because the whole grassroots scene is so polluted that the young men, under N.C.A.A. rules, had been paid and professionalized from middle school on up. \u201cBrian Bowen was ineligible seven times before he ever got to Louisville,\u201d Dawkins\u2019s lawyer told the jury in his closing, referring to payments that Bowen Sr. had taken while his son was a player on the youth circuit.Only $19,500 of the $100,000 promised for Bowen\u2019s commitment to Louisville ever made its way to his family \u2014 which is one-quarter of 1 percent of the $7.8 million annual salary that Louisville\u2019s coach at the time, Rick Pitino, was making. (He was fired a year ago after news of the case broke.) College football and basketball generate billions of dollars in annual revenue to the N.C.A.A. and its member schools.The N.C.A.A., of course, is not on trial, but it looms as almost a shadow defendant \u2014 a multi-billion-dollar enterprise resting on a pool of unpaid, disproportionately African-American labor. The inequities engender cynicism, and N.C.A.A. rules are not followed and not regarded as having any moral authority \u2014 not by the players, their families, their youth coaches or by many of the college coaches seeking their services. Evidence presented over the past three weeks has certainly helped drive that point home.No matter what the jury\u2019s verdict is in the current trial, it has been impossible to follow the proceedings without concluding that the N.C.A.A. model has reached its logical end. College sports must find a way to fairly compensate its work force.Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Last Temptation of Rick Pitino: A Story of Corruption, Scandal and the Big Business of College Basketball.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Hard Choices on Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn responding to the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S. should balance its values with its national interests.Mr. Baker was secretary of state under President George H.W. Bush.In formulating and implementing United States foreign policy, there is often a tension between the promotion of America\u2019s values and the protection of our interests. Toward the end of the Cold War, our espousal of democracy and free markets converged with our efforts to work with the Soviet leadership to achieve a peaceful conclusion of that conflict. But sometimes effective foreign policy requires balancing our principles and values with our geopolitical interests. That balancing act can demand painful compromises.Such is the case with the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist. If he was murdered inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on the orders of the Saudi government, the affront to American values is clear. Opposition to the killing of dissidents and support for a free and robust press are fundamental American principles.In reacting to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the Trump administration should balance our values and interests. A critical first step is establishing the facts. The Saudi government should issue a comprehensive and accurate detailing of the circumstances of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death. United States intelligence can do its part by gathering and assessing all materials necessary to determine what exactly happened to Mr. Khashoggi and on whose order. For example: What happened to his remains and why?Partner or not, if it is established that the Saudi government arranged a murder, the Trump administration should provide a swift, firm and substantial response that makes it clear that the United States condemns behavior of this sort.A good model would be the approach President George H.W. Bush took with China in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre.In June of 1989, after several weeks of peaceful protests in Beijing and elsewhere, Chinese soldiers attacked demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll ran into the thousands. The public reaction in the United States was one of horror followed by demands that President Bush punish China.Mr. Bush had to strike a balanced response, just as President Trump must today. Mr. Bush wanted to safeguard the underlying geopolitical relationship between the two countries while also letting Chinese leaders know that killings couldn\u2019t be business as usual in the future. The United States could not be viewed as a cynical paper tiger on human rights.Two days after the massacre, Mr. Bush announced the first in a series of substantial penalties against the Chinese government that included suspension of military arms sales and a halt to all visits between American and Chinese military leaders. Further sanctions followed, including economic ones imposed by Congress and supported by the administration.But even as Mr. Bush punished China, he strove to keep diplomatic relations between the two countries alive. While it was important that the Chinese understood he considered their behavior abhorrent and not to be ignored, he took no joy in imposing sanctions and sought ways to ease the estrangement. Mr. Bush dispatched high-level officials to China to let its leaders know that while he would not accept what they had done, he wanted to preserve the relationship.Not being privy to intelligence reports about this matter, I cannot suggest a specific response that the White House ought to take if Saudi government responsibility is established. But it should include actions that signal clear disapproval and a message that reform, not repression, is the best route forward for Saudi Arabia. The response must also reflect a sober assessment of the substantial and abiding value of our strategic partnership with the Saudis.Few will be pleased with the administration\u2019s ultimate response to this crisis, particularly the hard-line realists on one side and the hard-line idealists on the other. Nevertheless, United States officials should consider how President Bush reacted to Tiananmen Square 29 years ago. This is the time for reasoned, careful actions that fully take into account both our national interests and our principles and values.James A. Baker III, the 61st secretary of state, is a senior partner in the law firm Baker Botts, which has an affiliation with lawyers practicing in Saudi Arabia and represented members of the Saudi royal family in the aftermath of Sept. 11.

The deliciousness of Mineo\u2019s pizza made the five miles my brothers and I biked through the predominately Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill well worth it. But the sweet cheese and fresh meats weren\u2019t the only things that brought us back. We didn\u2019t dare enter certain neighborhoods for fear of scrapping with white boys or not being served. Squirrel Hill was one of the few nonblack neighborhoods that would welcome a group of black boys.In 1988, I transferred to Peabody High School, in the other significant Jewish neighborhood, Highland Park. It was right next to the majority-black areas of East Liberty and Garfield, and the fully integrated public school reflected the area\u2019s diversity. I had history teachers who made connections between the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing in 1958 in Atlanta, and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 in Alabama, solidifying for me how vulnerable black and Jewish communities are to white supremacy.As an athlete I competed against Jewish boys from another integrated school, Taylor Allderdice in Squirrel Hill. Sometimes after track meets, we got pizza at Mineo\u2019s. Squirrel Hill\u2019s vibrancy didn\u2019t come by chance. We learned how to live together. There was a deliberate investment in inclusion and peace.The Jewish community has been able to maintain that ethic of inclusion in Squirrel Hill. In 2018, blacks, immigrants and L.G.B.T. people crowd the streets with the same level of comfort I enjoyed as a child. Chatty college students in hoodies sit next to older Jews in skullcaps in coffee shops. When passengers step off the packed city buses along Forbes Avenue, they know they know they will be able to find whatever they need \u2014 an outfit for the weekend, a bite to eat, flowers for a date \u2014 in any of the shops on nearby Murray Avenue.Squirrel Hill is the draw, and the Tree of Life synagogue is its nucleus. The spirit of inclusivity starts there, and spills out in the rest of neighborhood. You see it in the diversity of people and also in the diversity of businesses and cultural events. They are geared to invite and support all the residents of the city \u2014 past, present and future.Instead, we have a president whose loose and divisive language sets the table for violence.My classmates and I may have lived in separate communities, but we learned how to study, play, eat and shop together. We had teachers, schools and synagogues that, in word and deed, made everyone feel welcome and included. Places like Squirrel Hill, Tree of Life and others like them are powerful, but they are not protected. And they will not be as long as President Trump and his followers continue to stoke the white nationalist\u2019s greatest fear \u2014 inclusion.Andre Perry is a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Lost Apples and Reviving a Beloved Cider", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorge Washington was among the many fans of Newark cider, a long-missing treat now being recreated by a former ad man on a mission. Yet they do have common roots, thanks to four very old apple varieties now growing on Mr. Rosen\u2019s land.Newark cider was both a point of pride and big business for the region \u2014 requested by name, reportedly lauded by George Washington and produced by dozens of Newark-area cideries with acres of orchards. The secret wasn\u2019t a recipe, but the blending of a quartet of superior apples born in the region: Campfield, Poveshon, Granniwinkle and Harrison, the most celebrated of the four.As a result of urbanization and then Prohibition, when many of the nation\u2019s remaining cider orchards were destroyed, Newark cider hasn\u2019t been made for at least a century. But after years of planning and planting \u2014 not to mention the accidental discovery of two lost apple trees and the investment of what Mr. Rosen called \u201c100 percent of all the money I ever had in my entire life\u201d \u2014 Ironbound Hard Cider is on the precipice of bringing it back.\u201cI wanted to focus on the most underserved individuals,\u201d he said, though he admitted that he also has a more personal connection to Newark cider. \u201cI live in Montclair, six minutes from Newark,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere my house is, those trees were once growing.\u201dThe author, Fran McManus, ended her story with a suggestion: Some of the four apple varieties were already being grown in other states, from cuttings taken from the last old New Jersey trees in the 1970s and \u201980s. By all accounts they were delicious, she wrote, so why not bring them back to the state?Mr. Rosen decided to try. He gathered a team that includes skilled orchardists, bought his land in 2015 and planted several thousand hard-to-find vintage cider-apple saplings.While he waited for those to grow, he started producing his mainstream ciders \u2014 packaged in aluminum cans, the line includes flavors like cherry-cranberry \u2014 mainly with apple juice bought from other orchards.Then he got lucky. In the fall of 2015, a lawyer, Thomas Vilardi, dropped his daughter off to play in her high school marching band, near a former cider mill in Maplewood. \u201cI knew I had seen apples on a tree,\u201d said Mr. Vilardi, an amateur orchardist who had spent years searching for Harrisons. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to find a Harrison.\u201d\u201cWe prayed to God that the Harrison was a cool tree, if and when we found it,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cTasting this juice, we were all, like, \u2018Oh, God, this was not only worth it, we\u2019ve hit the motherlode with this thing.\u201d\u201cI told my wife, Robyn, \u2018I think I have a bag of these apples in the refrigerator,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stokes said. He has since traced his trees to old New Jersey families, and so far they are believed to be the real thing.Dozens of cuttings from both of the newly found trees have since been planted in Ironbound Hard Cider\u2019s nursery, meaning that all four Newark cider apples have now been returned to New Jersey soil.Cameron Stark, Ironbound\u2019s head cidermaker and Mr. Rosen\u2019s business partner, said the Harrisons that Mr. Vilardi found have more sugars than any other cider apples he has experimented with.In fact, even if that tree turns out not to be a true Harrison but a close relative \u2014 perhaps a younger plant that grew from a seedling, as some in the contentious world of historic apples speculate it may be \u2014 that\u2019s fine by everyone at the company.As the trees grow, he is tinkering with blends of the old varieties, including the Poveshon, which he thinks may have been used in cider to add notes of dark caramel and brown sugar. (Like most hard-cider makers, he believes that the best versions come from mixing apples, balancing out the final product. Traditional Newark ciders used some or all of the four varieties, but always included the Harrison.)The young Newark cider apples growing at the farm here are not yet as high-quality as those from the tree found in Maplewood, Mr. Stark said. But the company, which is using sustainable agriculture methods, hopes to coax ever better fruit from its fields.Back in Newark cider\u2019s heyday, the best apples were said to come from the eastern slopes of the Watchung Mountains, then considered part of Newark. It would have been a great place for apple growing, Mr. Ward said \u2014 the slopes have cool nights and warm days, which protect the fruit from frost and help accumulate flavor and sugar.The Ironbound farm also has gentle slopes and fertile soils, said Megan Muehlbauer, the Rutgers extension agent for the area. Mr. Rosen\u2019s farm is only 10 miles from the university\u2019s apple research headquarters, she said: \u201cHe happens to have a prime piece of property to be restarting the cider industry.\u201dIn the next two years, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Stark plan to add 12,500 more young cider apple trees to their orchards, tripling what they already grow. About two-thirds of the trees will be Newark cider varieties, especially Harrisons, which already comprise half of their plantings. The company has also given some trees to commercial orchards in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York that have agreed to cultivate the fruit and sell it back to the company.Mr. Stark\u2019s 2017 Champagne-style Harrison cider \u2014 an old-fashioned recipe made with apples picked in Maplewood and yeasts added to the bottle for a second fermentation \u2014 is especially promising, aromatic with spark of tart citrus.It probably won\u2019t be ready for serving for another few months, Mr. Stark said. Considering the cider\u2019s extensive history, though, that isn\u2019t long to wait.Advertisement"}

One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant\u2019s name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.)Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance.The dish may not scream \u201cKorean cuisine,\u201d but the next one does. This is hwe \u2014 Korean for raw, you\u2019ll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they\u2019re put together with a harmony that\u2019s hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju.Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix\u2019s opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn\u2019t have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal.Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It\u2019s the foundation for an array of vinegars you won\u2019t find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant\u2019s arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang.Atoboy\u2019s food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It\u2019s like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor\u2019s baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix\u2019s flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients \u2014 around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened.Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d\u2019oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter.The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea\u2019s long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn.Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They\u2019re beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist.Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn\u2019t have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines.The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

In addition to the insults, he told her not to speak to him in a \u201cforeign language,\u201d though Ms. Gayle, who was born in Jamaica, was speaking English.\u201cI feel very low,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cHe paid a fare to go on holiday, I\u2019ve paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the color of my skin?\u201dOnce the flight attendants moved the woman, the plane eventually took off from Barcelona, and the man apparently did not face any immediate consequences.\u201cAbove all, we want to express our solidarity with the victim and our repudiation, not just of the racist, shameless, rude man that perpetrated this act of violence and hate, but also of the company for making the woman move seats, rather than the person guilty of the verbal attack, who deserved to be removed from the plane and taken straight to a police station,\u201d she said.\u201cAs a city we\u2019re going to take this seriously, initiate legal action and present the video as proof,\u201d Ms. Colau said. \u201cNot just so that this racist, hate-filled man is punished, but also to force the company to change its procedures in such cases and support victims rather than aggressors.\u201dThe airline said it had turned over the video to the police in Essex, who are in charge of the region around London Stansted Airport, where the flight landed. But the company, which has faced calls for a boycott, has not commented further.An official at Optivo, the British housing provider for the man at the home, did not immediately return a request for comment.

{"Headline": "How a Democratic House Could Work With Trump", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf he remembers his campaign promises. And cares enough to stick with them. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.But in the gaps between such fantasies, Mr. Trump has also begun revisiting broadly popular policy themes of the sort that he campaigned on in 2016 but then largely abandoned \u2014\u00a0or actively worked against \u2014\u00a0once he settled into the Oval Office.It would be easy to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s latest policy patter as hogwash, the sort of promise-making in which he specializes \u2014 like his pledge to drain the political swamp or get Mexico to pay for The Wall. It further muddles matters that Mr. Trump\u2019s words often seem to contradict his actions, as when he portrays himself as champion of coverage for pre-existing conditions even as he urged Congress to vote to repeal Obamacare without replacing it or as his administration declines to defend the provision against legal challenges.But if Democrats manage to take control of the House after the Nov. 6 elections, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign palaver could shift to something more interesting: a starter map to policies on which the president and Democratic lawmakers might actually be able to get something done. Yes, go ahead and roll your eyes. Yet recall that in the days before Mr. Trump took office, when lawmakers from both parties were anxiously wondering what a Trump era would look like, some Democrats said they would be willing \u2014 happy even \u2014 to work with the new president on shared values. Infrastructure development was one area of potential agreement. Lowering prescription drug costs and shoring up coverage for pre-existing conditions clearly would fall into that category as well.Nearly two years on, a Democratic House majority playing ball with a president that most of its base would love to see driven from office may sound absurd. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises aren\u2019t much different from what he touted in 2016, and so far he has lacked follow-through to realize them, either because he\u2019s not interested or because other Republicans won\u2019t let him. But, if the House flips, there are advantages to at least trying.Many congressional Democrats and presidential hopefuls are eager to avoid looking excessively partisan or vindictive as 2020 approaches. Offering to work with Mr. Trump on drug costs, for example, might help them come across as functioning adults.With Republicans likely to retain control of the Senate, the odds of even a vaguely progressive bill of any real significance making it through the upper chamber are slim. It\u2019s hard to imagine Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, allowing his members to come within 100 miles of, say, a costly infrastructure plan. But this, too, could work to the Democrats\u2019 advantage.By pushing issues that the president specifically and aggressively promoted on the campaign trail this year, House Democrats could turn up the political heat on Senate Republicans to take awkward votes on popular issues. If Mr. McConnell declined to take action, as is so often his way, Democrats could hammer home the contrast between their let\u2019s-get-stuff-done attitude and Republicans\u2019 obstructionism. Along the way, they might even find a way to drive a wedge between Republican lawmakers and the president.As for Mr. Trump\u2019s incentive to reach across the aisle: The man likes to win. It may well be the only thing he cares about. Republican lawmakers acknowledge that he often doesn\u2019t give a flip about the specific contents of a deal, so long as he can climb aboard and declare victory.Thus far, the president\u2019s path to victory has run through a Congress wholly controlled by members of his own party. If the midterms change that, Mr. Trump will need to revise his approach to dealing with the opposition if he ever wants to see another legislative win.Advertisement"}

A thuggish regime might have seized his assets, tried him in absentia on a trumped up charge, or even sought to abduct him.But it takes a striking combination of wickedness, arrogance and idiocy for Riyadh to think it can get away with a grotesque murder of a well-known and harmless journalist on the soil of a Middle Eastern rival in a consulate the Saudis must have known was either bugged or surveilled.A culprit may never be brought to justice, particularly if the hit on Khashoggi was ordered by the crown prince. The suspects named in the Hariri case also got away.The alternative, however, is to allow journalists to be tortured and dismembered with a nod and a wink from Washington, and that is much worse. It makes the U.S. not just a bystander to the criminality of our allies, but also a partner. And it makes it impossible for us to condemn similar acts by our enemies.

{"Headline": "Who Needs a Border Wall When You Have DS-5535? ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new, quietly introduced visa form reminds us that mind-numbing bureaucracy can be an effective family-separation tool if that\u2019s your game.Mr. Schulman is a writer in New York.On May 16, I accompanied my fianc\u00e9e to the United States Consulate in Casablanca, Morocco, for her visa interview. We had waited eight months for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to approve our application and the National Visa Center to issue an appointment. I booked her a return flight, hopeful that we would be flying back together to continue our lives in New York.The DS-5535 requires visa applicants to provide the past 15 years of their travel history, past and current social media handles, email accounts, addresses and employment history. At the interview, the adjudicating officer explained to my fianc\u00e9e that even though he found our relationship to be \u201cbona fide,\u201d she would nevertheless have to fill out the DS-5535 for a \u201cSecurity Advisory Opinion\u201d \u2014 meaning that they want to investigate her further.My fianc\u00e9e is from a Muslim country. Her full name is Arabic. Fifteen years ago, she was 9 years old and traveled with her family on vacations. She attended a university in France for five years and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and computer science. On her social media accounts, you will find a young woman\u2019s love for American culture, New York City, fashion, food, traveling and Drake. Queue the alarm bells.In June 2016, she arrived in New York on a J-1 visa for a yearlong, paid end-of-studies internship at a start-up in Brooklyn. United States law requires anyone on a J-1 visa to leave for at least 90 days before returning. So, in May of 2017, my then-girlfriend left the United States believing she would be returning 90 days later on another J-1 visa sponsored by the same company. But as the return date crept closer, the company pulled its support and left her, and us, in a complicated predicament.I had been planning to propose properly when she returned, but romantic ambitions were pushed aside to consider the legal road map we would have to navigate to be together again. In September of 2017, we filed for a K-1 visa (also known as a fianc\u00e9e visa), hoping that would expedite our reunion. In October, I flew to Paris to propose to her in person.Although Morocco isn\u2019t one of the seven countries on the travel-ban list, the DS-5535 form holds similar power. It\u2019s a bureaucratic ban. If you are required to fill out this form, you\u2019re thrown into a red-tape black hole called \u201cadministrative processing.\u201d According to the State Department, from March to July of 2018, 44 K-1 visas were issued to people of Moroccan nationality. During that same period, more than 10 times as many people from Britain were granted the visa. Britain is 87 percent white; Morocco isn\u2019t. My congresswoman and senator have been responsive and sent letters on our behalf, to no avail. I\u2019ve called the consulate hundreds of times (at $2.49 per minute). I\u2019ve called and emailed numerous employees at the State Department, some of whom seemed unaware of the new form. I\u2019ve overnighted letters requesting they expedite our case because of emotional and financial hardship. Recently, whenever I phone the consulate in Casablanca, the prompts take me straight to automated voice mail messages, or they disconnect the call. When I call the State Department, I\u2019m told to call the National Visa Center. When I call the National Visa Center, I\u2019m told to call the consulate. No one has been able to provide a reason my fianc\u00e9e was flagged for further investigation.So, we wait. We are long-distance when we didn\u2019t choose to be. We try to navigate the six-hour time difference to hear each other\u2019s voices over the phone. I have spent thousands of dollars on filing fees, lawyers and travel expenses. What we have to endure financially and emotionally is not only unexpected but hard to fathom. We believe in immigration laws and vetting visa candidates, but we would have preferred it if the DS-5535 form was required with the initial application we submitted over a year ago.I recently received an email from the State Department in response to one of my letters: \u201cA check of her case today found that it is still under administrative processing. We hope this information is helpful.\u201dAs a United States citizen, I never thought I\u2019d have to ask permission from the government to marry the woman I love. As of today, I\u2019m still waiting to do just that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Shouldn\u2019t Use Facebook to Log In to Other Sites", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI\u2019m going to quit using Facebook to log in to apps and sites online. You should, too.But the mere possibility is highly troubling \u2014 and if the hack allowed access to any other sites, Facebook should be disqualified from acting as your sign-on service.This is a classic you-had-one-job situation. Like a trusty superintendent in a Brooklyn walk-up, Facebook offered to carry keys for every lock online. The arrangement was convenient \u2014 the super was always right there, at the push of a button. It was also more secure than creating and remembering dozens of passwords for different sites. Facebook had a financial and reputational incentive to hire the best security people to protect your keys; tons of small sites online don\u2019t \u2014 and if they got hacked and if you reused your passwords elsewhere, you were hosed.But the extensive hack vaporizes those arguments. If the entity with which you trusted your keys loses your keys, you take your keys elsewhere. And there are many more-secure and just-as-convenient ways to sign on to things online.If for some reason you don\u2019t want to use a password manager, you can use another tech giant\u2019s sign-on service. When presented with different ways to sign on to sites, you can choose Google or Microsoft instead of Facebook.Yes, it\u2019s possible those companies could be hacked one day, too. After all, Yahoo was hacked, as was LinkedIn, as was Equifax. But at this moment, a sign-on service by Google or Microsoft has one big advantage over Facebook\u2019s: Those companies did not lose control of 50 million people\u2019s accounts, and Facebook did.Mr. Polakis allowed that there are tremendous convenience benefits and even some security benefits to a single sign-on. \u201cObviously, big companies like Facebook and Google have amazing engineers, and their security practices are generally ahead of the curve compared to other, smaller websites,\u201d he said.But no company, not even one as big and wealthy as Facebook or Google, can guarantee perfect security.And in some ways, Mr. Polakis said, Facebook\u2019s size and complexity work against its security. The Facebook hack, for instance, seems to have been caused by three different bugs acting in concert.\u201cThe codebase of these services is massive,\u201d Mr. Polakis said. \u201cYou have different teams working on different components, and they can interplay in different ways, and you can have a crazy hack that no one expects.\u201dThe other danger to signing on to everything with Facebook is the threat of phishing. Even if millions of Facebook accounts hadn\u2019t been hacked, people\u2019s individual accounts are hacked all the time through online trickery. Single sign-on compounds the damage \u2014 whoever hacks your Facebook account gets access to everything else you tied to Facebook.Why is a password manager a better way to protect yourself than signing on through a big platform? Password managers can also be hacked, Mr. Polakis said, but \u201ccompared to massive platforms that have millions of different lines of codes and different functionalities, a password manager has one specific job, and so it minimizes the chances of something going wrong.\u201dI asked Facebook for a counterargument to stop using it for signing on. A spokesman said Facebook\u2019s sign-on was still more secure than the weak passwords that people create and reuse for everything.That\u2019s not a bad point. Password managers aren\u2019t as convenient to use as Facebook\u2019s button; if people respond to the Facebook hack by rolling their own passwords instead of using Facebook, that may be worse for everyone.I don\u2019t argue otherwise. I believe Facebook is taking this seriously. At some point, maybe, Facebook will regain my trust enough to handle my digital keys.But it will do so only if there\u2019s some cost to losing them. For now, that cost is: When I see the blue Facebook button offering an easy way to sign up for this or that digital doodad, I\u2019m not tapping it.Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown is still reviewing a murder case that advanced DNA testing could settle.Opinion ColumnistImagine being framed for a horrific crime: the fatal stabbing of a married couple and two children. You then spend 35 years in prison awaiting execution for that quadruple murder. Imagine that you\u2019re a black man and that the trial was tainted by the ugliest racism. Meanwhile, federal judges and F.B.I. investigators cite evidence that the real killer is a white convicted murderer who came home late on the night of the murders in bloody coveralls, but when his girlfriend reported him to the authorities, the police took the bloody coveralls and threw them away.Now I have a new argument that perhaps can move Brown. The white convicted murderer who is the other suspect in the case has voluntarily provided samples of his DNA and told me that he too wants advanced DNA testing of evidence from the murder scene.\u201cI had nothing to do with this crime,\u201d the man, Lee, told me. \u201cI want it all retested, yes. To clear my name.\u201dI\u2019ve used just Lee\u2019s first name, because he asked me not to use his full name and because enough damage has been done in this murder case by people jumping to conclusions without clear proof. Lee said that his former girlfriend had fingered him to the police because she was jealous of his new flame, and that the bloody coveralls were not his.\u201cI have no idea who did it,\u201d said Lee, now 68. \u201cThe police need to do their job properly and find out who did it.\u201dSo both suspects in the case are now pleading with Governor Brown to permit advanced DNA testing of evidence from the murder scene. A towel used by the killers has never been tested at all, and a T-shirt used by a murderer hasn\u2019t been tested for \u201ctouch DNA\u201d to determine who wore it. Some hairs found clutched in the victims\u2019 hands, possibly ripped from the killer\u2019s head, are not from an African-American like Cooper and have also never been tested at all.Will Governor Brown listen?I asked Brown what he is waiting for, and he emphasized that he is reviewing the case with input from both sides. \u201cI\u2019ll act on it,\u201d he said. He also protested that my reporting on the case, which led to widespread calls for DNA testing, was one-sided and had \u201cleft out a number of elements.\u201dWhile Brown denied that he was running out the clock, he refused to commit to resolving the issue before leaving office in January. Referring to the likelihood that Gavin Newsom will be elected governor next month, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get a guy more liberal than me coming around the corner. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dI suggested that for an innocent man on death row, every extra day is no minor thing. Brown shrugged and observed that California has 130,000 prisoners.There has been another important development in the Cooper case. A witness has provided a sworn declaration describing a confession by Lee to the killings, committed with two other named individuals, according to Cooper\u2019s defense counsel, Norman C. Hile. The name of the witness is being kept confidential for now for the protection of the witness, Hile said in a letter to the governor.The 1983 killings \u2014 of Doug and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica, and an 11-year-old neighbor, Chris Hughes \u2014 were as barbaric a crime as one can imagine. Yet the horror of this crime will have been compounded if an innocent man has been framed for it.Granted, maybe I\u2019m wrong about this. So, governor, prove me wrong. Test the evidence. Settle the doubts.I generally admire Brown and agree with him on most issues. But I\u2019m mystified, as are many of his friends, by his recalcitrance in the Kevin Cooper case. I\u2019m glad that my May column finally got him to review options for DNA testing, but almost five months have elapsed and Cooper is still waiting.Brown told me he wished that \u201cpeople would take more of an interest\u201d in criminal justice issues. Governor, here\u2019s one such issue: Please show more interest yourself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bust Magazine Is on a Mission", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "Jane is gone. Teen Vogue (the print version) is gone. The Village Voice, gone. How has this feminist lifestyle publication survived for 25 years?Supported by\u201cThe blood\u2019s not real,\u201d said a staffer at the Brooklyn headquarters of Bust, the independent, feminist lifestyle magazine and website. Her tattooed and bare arms were streaked with red, as were those of an intern, who quipped, \u201cJust another day at the office.\u201d They had been working on a photo shoot for a Halloween-themed haunted house feature.It was a symbolic moment. You don\u2019t need to be a shrink to associate red with power and boldness, as well as with important womanly issues, much as Bust does.Bust is a rarity, having kept its cult following while staying afloat in a media sea of bankruptcies, mergers and buyouts. Founding editors Debbie Stoller and Laurie Henzel started the magazine with a Riot Girls sensibility in 1993. Twenty-five years later, they are still here.\u201cWe started Bust because women\u2019s magazines were crap and made people feel bad about themselves,\u201d Ms. Stoller, 55, said from her office, located in Sunset Park\u2019s Industry City. \u201cI wanted to make women feel better and make a different kind of women\u2019s magazine.\u201dTheir aim was not purely political though; they wanted the magazine to be fun. \u201cBust has never asked readers to divide ourselves into politics versus fashion or seriousness versus adventure,\u201d said Gloria Steinem, the political activist who co-founded Ms. Magazine in 1972, in an email.In the early \u201990s, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel started asking friends \u201cto write stories they didn\u2019t see reflected in the media about their lives,\u201d Ms. Stoller recalled. \u201cWe Xeroxed 500 copies at work, and that was our first issue.\u201dThe magazine was a good 15 years ahead of the outspoken and unapologetic feminist content that would happen online in the aughts, said Anna Holmes, editorial director at Topic.com, a visual storytelling platform, which is part of First Look Media.\u201cBust was an examination of gender politics,\u201d said Ms. Holmes, who was also the founder of the feminist blog Jezebel and its editor in chief for three years. \u201cBust has legitimacy and authenticity because they predate all of the feminist websites, newsletters and verticals that cropped up in 2009 through today.\u201dThe scrappy magazine has endured financial struggles (it still does); being bought by a tech company and then having to buy itself back; the bursting of the internet bubble; Sept. 11; losing business partners; multiple office moves around New York as the city became more expensive; and perhaps most importantly, the implosion of the magazine print business. Old print competitors like Jane and Teen Vogue are long gone. Other downtown alternative outfits, like The Village Voice, have also stopped publication.A Trump bump in 2016 helped, as enraged women took to the web, each looking for ways to lend their support. They donated money to Bust; its subscriptions increased. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. The website is particularly hard to finance because of changing Facebook algorithms and Google ads that don\u2019t bring in much revenue.All that said, since Bust\u2019s inaugural issue, not much has changed in terms of its goals or content, or even its funding. Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel didn\u2019t have money then; they don\u2019t have much now.\u201cThese are passion projects. We\u2019re scrappy. We barter,\u201d Ms. Henzel, 54, said.When times are especially lean, Ms. Stoller explained, she and Ms. Henzel cut their own salaries so as not to bring on debt (the magazine has always been debt-free, she said). \u201cWe never spend more than we have. We find cheaper ways to do things, we learn new skills so we don\u2019t have to outsource. And we make sure we balance out.\u201dSometimes that works, sometimes not. Over the past two months, neither Ms. Henzel nor Ms. Stoller have paid themselves at all.\u201cIf we did, we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay our staff. There isn\u2019t enough money,\u201d Ms. Stoller said. \u201cOur salaries are the first things we cut. We did it once before in 2008, and now again. It\u2019s harder and harder to get people to pay for anything, especially when people are producing all this content and giving it away for free and living off investors\u2019 dollars.\u201dThe Bust team is small. There are six full-time employees and a handful of part-timers; a web editor, a freelance ad sales person, an editor on the West Coast, and rotating interns. Together, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel wear various professional hats, including editor in chief, publisher, creative director, circulation and distributions manager, web design, human resources and senior finance officer.The magazine, which is published six times a year, has approximately 10,000 subscribers. There are also newsstand sales and a pass-along circulation rate bringing it up to 70,000. The website fetches an average of 500,000 unique visitors every month.\u201cI learned so much from Bust\u2019s website,\u201d said Rachele Merliss, 21, a senior at Wesleyan University in Connecticut who was an intern this past summer. \u201cI\u2019ve been really interested in feminist and social justice issues since middle school.\u201d Ms. Merliss was able to write every day, she said, publishing articles about the culture of inappropriate behavior by male counselors at summer camps; the controversy over banning straws; and equal pay for black women.Bust has provided opportunities for young writers to stretch their muscles and build their brands. But there\u2019s a caveat.Interns and web writers write for free, and freelancer rates are humble. \u201cPeople pitch us and don\u2019t realize we only pay $150-$200 for features in the magazine. When we tell them, sometimes they don\u2019t care; sometimes they take it elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t place it, they come back,\u201d she said, explaining that clips from Bust still hold cachet in the publishing world.Aileen Gallagher, an associate professor of magazine journalism at Syracuse University, agrees that Bust is respected.\u201cI interviewed Samantha Bee in 2003 for them. I was 25. It was my first national clip, and it meant I was legit,\u201d said Ms. Gallagher, who was paid $150. Today, she still writes the occasional unpaid book review for Bust simply because she wants to. \u201cI became a feminist from reading Bust,\u201d she said. \u201cThey take chances on writers and publish a lot of women of color. Writing reviews for nothing is how I support them,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a financially sound business model, but it is socially responsible.\u201dMany celebrities still seem game to be on Bust's cover, too. Bjork, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Solange Knowles, Amy Sedaris and Cher, among many other big names, have made appearances. The comedian Jenny Slate recently hosted Bust\u2019s 25th anniversary party, with performances by Phoebe Robinson of 2 Dope Queens, the singer-songwriter Erykah Badu and the actress Amber Tamblyn.\u201cThere\u2019s more and more competition within the craft fair space, and we really count on these to generate income. Without them we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this magazine,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cThen other people started doing them too, so we had to get creative in addition, like offering classes at the event.\u201dAh, the paradox of being rebellious in a capitalistic world.\u201cBust was one of the original resistance magazines,\u201d Mr. Husni said. \u201cThey never let an ad influence their decision, they remained in touch with their audience, and they provided an antidote for women before it was the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of financial trouble, but they were on a mission. When you\u2019re on a mission, you\u2019re not going to let anyone stop you. Their subscribers feel the magazine is like a membership card to a community. That keeps the magazine going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lamb Even Haters Can Love", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlison Roman on the meaty, savory and not at all lamby cut that changed her mind.For years, I convinced myself that I didn\u2019t care for lamb. I found that I could only ever describe it as \u201clamby,\u201d which is not exactly a compliment. But now, the way I am constantly trying to persuade people to cook more lamb, you would think I was secretly working for the American Lamb Board. (I am not.)The lamb that officially changed my mind, which I may now dub \u201cThe Gateway Lamb,\u201d is actually a particular cut: the meaty, savory loin chop.There\u2019s nothing fussy involved, no overnight marinade or hourslong cooking. No shoulder muscles to separate, no unruly leg to truss and tie. Just a quick-cooking, mildly flavored steaklike cut you might otherwise overlook because, well, it\u2019s lamb, and you don\u2019t really like lamb.(Just as certain cuts of beef tend to taste \u201cbeefier,\u201d some cuts of lamb can come across as \u201clambier.\u201d There are, of course, other factors at play \u2014 the lamb\u2019s origin, what it was raised on and fed, and so on \u2014 but flavor varies considerably from cut to cut.)Loin chops look like teeny tiny T-bone steaks \u2014 which, yes, are very cute \u2014 but there\u2019s more to love than that. As with beef and pork, cuts from the loin area of lamb tend to be leaner and more tender than those from the rib area. (Much of the lamb\u2019s flavor comes from the fat, so a leaner cut generally translates to a less lamby flavor.)They\u2019re also typically cut thicker than a rib chop (about one-inch thick), meaning they can be seared long and hard to golden-brown perfection, getting crisp on the outside without overcooking. They are even better when they are dusted with fennel seed and cracked black pepper, which add flavorful, crunchy, toasty bits.After cooking these chops in the largest skillet you have, let them rest on a cutting board for a few minutes. While you do this, throw together a last-minute shaved cucumber and fennel salad with lots of lemon and plenty of herbs. Grains or rice would be a welcome addition, but so would warm flatbreads or roasted potatoes.These chops are so little that it might be too intimate to slice the meat off the bone for anyone who isn\u2019t a child, so just provide small, sharp knives for a D.I.Y. kind of vibe \u2014 which I think is maybe part of the dish\u2019s charm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text to Text | \u2018The Metamorphosis\u2019 and \u2018How Social Isolation Is Killing Us\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by_________It\u2019s easy to assume that these stories have nothing to do with the world we live in today. And yet, his themes and ideas are so prevalent that choosing a New York Times article to pair with his classic 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d was hard \u2014 not for the lack of articles but for the challenge of narrowing it down to just one._________Many believe that the primacy of the human race depends on our brains, our ability and our desire to analyze, process and tame the world around us. Much of this idea stems from a Western way of thinking about ourselves and how we define our humanity, epitomized by the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s world-famous line, \u201cI think, therefore, I am.\u201dBooks@Work chooses literature \u2014 including Kafka\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d and many other classic and contemporary stories, both fiction and nonfiction \u2014 that holds up a mirror to our humanity and lets us explore our paradigms and challenge our assumptions about ourselves and each other. Although we appreciate and respect the need for close reading, at Books@Work we also celebrate how a piece of literature makes us feel and what aspects of our lives and our experiences it engages.Kafka is a treasure trove for these kinds of explorations. For a man who wrote in a decidedly different era, his voice resonates through the decades. So many of his stories feature disaffected human beings, who push the envelope on what makes them human and where they fail. In \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the traveling salesman Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find that he has been transformed into a hideous bug. Unable to communicate, Gregor finds his sense of self \u2014 and his family and work relationships \u2014 in deep crisis. Through his story, Kafka forces us to consider how much we define our humanity by the work we do and the company we keep.It\u2019s never too late to ponder the great essential questions of humanity. This is how a classic story like \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d can find deep resonance with adults in a workplace context. But it\u2019s never too early to build these muscles, either. As students face their own metamorphosis from childhood to adulthood, this open-ended exploration of human nature helps them become thoughtful and interconnected adults, able to withstand the social isolation so hauntingly described in Mr. Khullar\u2019s article.Below are some ideas for connecting Kafka\u2019s novella to these bigger essential questions, as well as options for going further to explore other aspects of the story with the help of The Times and Learning Network resources._________\u2022 What do these texts tell us about the ability (or inability) to communicate and how it affects us?\u2022 What do these texts tell us about how we define ourselves?\u2022 To what extent do the strength and depth of our relationships make us human?_________As students read and discuss, they might take notes using one or more of the three graphic organizers (PDFs) we have created for our Text to Text feature:_________She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\u2019t Gregor feel the same way about it, he\u2019d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added \u201cand by taking the furniture away, won\u2019t it seem like we\u2019re showing that we\u2019ve given up all hope of improvement and we\u2019re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\u2019d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he\u2019ll find everything unchanged and he\u2019ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier.\u201dHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realize that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused \u2014 he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage._________The evidence on social isolation is clear. What to do about it is less so.Loneliness is an especially tricky problem because accepting and declaring our loneliness carries profound stigma. Admitting we\u2019re lonely can feel as if we\u2019re admitting we\u2019ve failed in life\u2019s most fundamental domains: belonging, love, attachment. It attacks our basic instincts to save face, and makes it hard to ask for help \u2026The program works by allowing members to post online something they want help with: guitar lessons, a Scrabble partner, a ride to the doctor\u2019s office. Others can then volunteer their time and skills to fill these needs and \u201cbank\u201d hours for when they need something themselves.\u201cIn America, you almost need an excuse for knocking on a neighbor\u2019s door,\u201d Dr. Tang told me. \u201cWe want to break down those barriers.\u201dFor example, a college student might see a post from an older man who needs help gardening. She helps him plant a row of flowers and \u201cbanks\u201d two hours in the process. A few months later, when she wants to cook a Malaysian meal for her boyfriend, a retired chef comes by to give her cooking lessons.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a playmate every day,\u201d Dr. Tang said. \u201cBut knowing you\u2019re valued and a contributing member of society is incredibly reaffirming.\u201dThe program now has hundreds of members in California and plans to expand to other areas of the country.\u201cWe in the medical community have to ask ourselves: Are we controlling blood pressure or improving health and well-being?\u201d Dr. Tang said. \u201cI think you have to do the latter to do the former.\u201dA great paradox of our hyper-connected digital age is that we seem to be drifting apart. Increasingly, however, research confirms our deepest intuition: Human connection lies at the heart of human well-being. It\u2019s up to all of us \u2014 doctors, patients, neighborhoods and communities \u2014 to maintain bonds where they\u2019re fading, and create ones where they haven\u2019t existed._________1. Gregor works very hard to speak as clearly as possible to spare his family the worry and concern that was rapidly overwhelming him. But he fails. Have you ever felt that no matter what you say or how loud you say it, that no one truly understands you? Why or why not?2. Mr. Khullar describes the great paradox of the digital age \u2014 that the more connected we are online, the further we seem to be drifting apart. In your experience, does social media help or hinder your friendships? Do you need face-to-face interaction to develop a true connection with someone? Or is digital communication enough? Why?3. As he begins to acclimate to being a bug, Gregor gets too be too big for his room. His mother and sister, in an attempt to help, decide to move his furniture to enable him to move around comfortably. But when they begin, his mother wonders aloud whether this action might not have the intended effect \u2014 rather, it might make him feel abandoned. What is it about Gregor\u2019s mother\u2019s voice that brings Gregor \u201cback\u201d to his human self? How much do the relationships and comforts of your childhood define your sense of belonging and connection? How does this relate to Mr. Khullar\u2019s point about connection and well-being?4. Loneliness is something we can feel at any age, but, as Mr. Khullar writes, \u201cAdmitting we\u2019re lonely can feel as if we\u2019re admitting we\u2019ve failed in life\u2019s most fundamental domains: belonging, love, attachment.\u201dHow did Gregor deal with this? Are there effective ways to share a sense of loneliness? To ask for help? How do you help others understand the depths of your emotions, and how do you tune into the loneliness of others?5. Gregor understands everything being said around him, but is powerless to respond. His sister says:\u201cWe can\u2019t carry on like this. Maybe you can\u2019t see it but I can. I don\u2019t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We\u2019ve done all that\u2019s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don\u2019t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.\u201dNot long after hearing her words, Gregor\u2019s will to live falters, and he dies. In the end, does Gregor suffer more from his social isolation or from his new physical form? Why do you think the way you do? What evidence in the texts supports your response?6. Gregor listens to his sister play violin and asks himself, \u201cWas he an animal if music could captivate him so?\u201d What do you think? How thin is the line between humans and animals?_________Exploring What Makes Us Human What are the qualities, emotions, relationships or experiences that make us human?Many of the problems in the world today, when one reflects upon them, call for an answer to an ancient question: What is it to be human?There is no such thing as a human being in the abstract. Only when we see people as embedded in their experiences \u2014 their own social positions, their educations and memories, in pursuit of their own ideals \u2014 can the question \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d fully make sense.You might have students read one or more of the essays in this series and identify, probe or challenge each author\u2019s definition of humanity._________Adolescence and the \u2018Metamorphosis\u2019 From Child to AdultThe transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the most profound \u201cmetamorphoses\u201d we will make in our lives \u2014 and the rites of passage that come with it can be at once exciting, nerve-racking, fun \u2026 and excruciatingly lonely.Across the country, college freshmen are settling into their new lives and grappling with something that doesn\u2019t compete with protests and political correctness for the media\u2019s attention, something that no one prepared them for, something that has nothing to do with being \u201csnowflakes\u201d and everything to do with being human.They\u2019re lonely.In a sea of people, they find themselves adrift. The technology that keeps them connected to parents and high school friends only reminds them of their physical separation from just about everyone they know best. That estrangement can be a gateway to binge drinking and other self-destructive behavior. And it\u2019s as likely to derail their ambitions as almost anything else.Brett Epstein felt it. \u201cI spent my first night in the dorm and it hit me like a pile of bricks: It\u2019s just me here,\u201d Epstein, a 21-year-old senior at the College of Charleston, told me about his start there three years ago. \u201cI was completely freaked out.\u201dYou might invite students to engage with one or both of these texts and write about a big change in their own lives. How did they feel during this period? If they were lonely, how did they deal with it? What effect did social media have on their sense of isolation? How did their experiences compare to Gregor Samsa\u2019s in \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d? What lessons can they take from any of these texts about how to grapple with the sense of isolation that may arise in other momentous transitions throughout their lives? How might they help others?_________Technology: Together but Alone?One of the most popular Student Opinion questions The Learning Network has ever posed is: \u201cDoes Technology Make Us More Alone?\u201dIn the Times piece about the video, Nick Bilton writes:Ms. deGuzman\u2019s video makes for some discomfiting viewing. It\u2019s a direct hit on our smartphone-obsessed culture, needling us about our addiction to that little screen and suggesting that maybe life is just better led when it is lived rather than viewed. While the clip has funny scenes \u2014 a man proposing on a beach while trying to record the special moment on his phone \u2014 it is mostly \u2026 sad._________Creative Ways to Combat LonelinessBased on what they have read and their own experiences, do your students think social isolation is a significant problem \u2014 in their own lives, their school or society as a whole? Do they personally feel connected to others \u2014 their family, friends or community?If so, how might they generate stronger connections on a personal, schoolwide or societal level? As a class, you might crowdsource ideas that students can use in their own lives or in a campaign for building a stronger school community.For ideas, students might conduct their own research or look to resources from The Times, like these:As they read, students might think about why that matters and how the theme resonates in this text-to-text lesson and their own worlds. What ideas can they take from these texts to help them combat social isolation and build stronger communities around them?_________\u2018The Metamorphosis\u2019 on StageThe masterstroke of the production, adapted and directed by David Farr and Mr. Gardarsson, is that Gregor in his rumpled gray suit looks and sounds to the audience like a mild-mannered human. But to his family, he is a hideous monster, his plaintive attempts to communicate causing them to shield their ears in pain.The family\u2019s attitude toward him spirals from revulsion into hatred, largely bypassing pity. This gives the surreal scenario a tragic majesty that works in affecting counterpoint to its farcical, Mittel-European sitcom side.When the Samsas are forced to find employment, even Greta stops tending to her brother, eventually turning on him in a scene of unsettling violence.\u2022 How have the producers reimagined this text for the stage? What are some of the key similarities and differences between the play and the novella?\u2022 What methods do producers use to illustrate the themes of humanity, loneliness, communication and the necessity of relationships explored in the two texts above? Are they effective? Why or why not?\u2022 After seeing this dramatic rendition, how do they think about \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d and \u201cHow Social Isolation Is Killing Us\u201d anew?The playwrights also made a major change to the setting:The writers have shifted the story to the 1930s, reshaping this alienation fable into an explicit if somewhat forced allegory for the coming genocide in Europe.That subtext is hammered in dialogue about the moral rewards of hard work and exercise, and the need to rid society of its undesirables.When and where else in history or present day have the themes of these texts been relevant? What can we learn about those moments through these works?_________What Does \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019 Really Mean?In students\u2019 own words, what does \u201cKafkaesque\u201d mean?

{"Headline": "Deadly Limo Crash: Vehicle \u2018Was Not Supposed to Be on the Road\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA driver with an improper license. A limousine company with a trail of failed inspections and ties to a scheme to illegally obtain driver\u2019s licenses. And a limousine that had also been deemed unsafe.Two days after a devastating limousine crash in upstate New York that killed 20 people, officials revealed new details about their inquiry that suggested the trip never should have been allowed to happen.The mounting questions about the accident increasingly centered on the limousine company, Prestige Limousine, which had a shoddy record, did business out of a low-budget hotel and whose owner may have a curious history with federal law enforcement. On Monday, officials moved to suspend the company\u2019s operations and seize its vehicles.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told reporters that the limousine involved in the accident had failed an inspection last month and \u201cwas not supposed to be on the road.\u201dThe owner of the limousine company, Shahed Hussain, has the same name and address as that of a former informant for the F.B.I. who has testified in two prominent terrorism cases, according to public records. A law enforcement official suggested that his son may operate the limousine company, and a state law enforcement official confirmed that the police had interviewed one of Mr. Hussain\u2019s sons.Shortly before the crash, one of the victims inside the limousine sent a text suggesting that she was worried about the vehicle\u2019s condition, using a profanity to describe the car. And investigators suggested that past problems with the company \u2014 its vehicles had failed several inspections, according to records and state officials \u2014 and its owners may have contributed to the accident.The limousine company issued a statement on Monday expressing condolences to the relatives of those killed. \u201cWe are performing a detailed internal investigation to determine the cause of the accident,\u2019\u2019 the statement said, adding that the company had voluntarily taken its vehicles off the road. \u201cWe have already met with state and federal investigators, and plan to do so again.\u2019\u2019Federal officials said that the crash in Schoharie, N.Y., a small town about 40 miles west of Albany, was the worst transportation-related accident in the country since a 2009 plane crash outside Buffalo killed 50 people.In a briefing at a regional headquarters of the State Police outside Albany, Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that his agency\u2019s inquiry was focusing on mechanical and human causes for the accident and that there was extensive damage to the front and left side of the limousine.He suggested that the engine of the Excursion had been thrust backward into the driver\u2019s compartment, saying the evidence indicated a \u201chigh-energy impact.\u201d But he declined to say definitively that the vehicle had been speeding; there were no skid marks leading to the crash site.Investigators also said they had recovered an airbag control module, which was being analyzed for crash data.State Police officials suggested that the company had been on their radar before the crash. \u201cThat company and that vehicle have been under scrutiny\u201d in the past, said Maj. Robert Patnaude of the New York State Police. He also suggested that Mr. Hussain could face criminal charges. \u201cThat will be part of our investigation,\u201d Major Patnaude said.The investigation will also include autopsies of the victims, a tight-knit group that included four sisters, two brothers and several young couples. Those victims had yet to be identified by the authorities but heartbroken friends and relatives were already posting testimonials.\u201cI lost my two best friends in this,\u201d wrote Justin Cushing, whose brother Patrick, friend Adam Jackson and his cousin, Erin McGowan, all died in the limousine. \u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201dThere were also unsettling signs that the victims may have been concerned by the condition of the limousine. One friend of Ms. McGowan said that she had received a text telling her that a party bus that was supposed to take the group of friends to the Ommegang brewery in Cooperstown had broken down on the way to pick them up.Instead, the group obtained a stretch limousine, which was in shoddy condition, Ms. McGowan told her friend, Melissa Healey.Ms. Healey, 33, who had been the maid of honor at Ms. McGowan\u2019s wedding this past summer, shared the texts with The New York Times.\u201cThe motor is making everyone deaf,\u201d wrote Ms. McGowan, before Ms. Healey asked where they had rented the car.Ms. McGowan responded that she wasn\u2019t sure, but then added, \u201cWhen we get to brewery we will all b deaf.\u201dThey never made it.The limousine company is based at the Crest Inn Suites & Cottages in Gansevoort, N.Y., a small town north of Albany, and on Monday, state troopers were at the hotel. The State Police said they had seized three vehicles from the company and believed that Mr. Hussain was outside the United States.Lincoln Prosser, who lives at the hotel with her husband and three children, said she had not seen any limousines parked outside. But when she lived there between 2013 and 2015, she said, she noticed a few limousines parked there, some of which appeared to be broken down.The intersection where the accident occurred was known among residents as being notoriously dangerous: a tricky T-shape, where east-west traffic often sped by in excess of the posted 50 m.p.h. speed limit.\u201cThis has long been a source of discord in Schoharie,\u201d said Rosemary Christoff Dolan, who had visited the accident site on Sunday.Three years ago, state transportation officials banned trucks from the route after a tractor-trailer barreled through the same intersection. That was one of four accidents reported there since the Department of Transportation made changes to the intersection in 2008 to improve safety.The police said that the limousine had been traveling downhill toward the intersection when it failed to stop, crossing the busy highway, glancing off the second vehicle in the parking lot of the Apple Barrel, a local shop, and striking the two pedestrians nearby. The limousine then crashed into a shallow ravine.Questions about the safety and regulation of such oversized vehicles have also been raised. According to the State Police, limousine drivers are required to wear a seatbelt but passengers who are often riding in open spaces in the back are not. A lack of any restraint can cause serious injuries in a crash \u2014 only one person inside the limousine on Saturday survived the initial impact before being pronounced dead at a hospital in Albany.On Monday, Mr. Cuomo seemed to question whether more legislative oversight of the industry was the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know that this a situation where you can find a new law or a new regulation,\u201d he said.As the investigation into the crash continues, families of the victims continue to grapple with the fallout from the crash.\u201cThey were all friends,\u201d said Valerie Abeling, Ms. McGowan\u2019s aunt. \u201cMost of them were lifelong friends. Relatives, cousins, family.\u201dMs. Healey, Ms. McGowan\u2019s friend, said she was supposed to have gone on the trip, but could not make it. She had a cold.Jane Gottlieb contributed reporting from Schoharie, N.Y., and Gansevoort, N.Y. William K. Rashbaum contributed from New York.

{"Headline": "Brazil Prepares to Elect a Hypocrite", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome Brazilian conservatives see the presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro as representative of everything they value. They should look closer. S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 For a liberal woman like me, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would vote for a presidential candidate who has been described by international publications as \u201cracist, homophobic and sexist\u201d (Lib\u00e9ration), \u201ca threat to democracy\u201d (The Economist), a \u201cTrump of the tropics\u201d (The Guardian), \u201ca xenophobe\u201d (Clar\u00edn) and a sympathizer with \u201cmilitary dictatorships and torturers\u201d who has \u201copenly expressed fascist ideas\u201d (Zeit).I\u2019m referring, of course, to Jair Bolsonaro, the current front-runner to become the next president of Brazil. The far-right Mr. Bolsonaro is a former army officer who has served seven terms as a federal congressman, during which, according to Le Monde, he was \u201can insignificant politician from Bras\u00edlia, better known for his verbal excesses than for his parliamentary activism.\u201d Now, according to a recent survey by the polling firm Ibope, 59 percent of voters plan to support him in the second round of the elections, which will take place on Sunday. (Fernando Haddad, the candidate of the left-leaning Workers\u2019 Party, has 41 percent of voters behind him.)And so in an effort to understand my fellow Brazilians, I\u2019ve turned to the work of the psychologist Jonathan Haidt, whose moral foundations theory makes an impressive attempt to connect people with differing political views. Having done so, I can concede that there\u2019s something about Mr. Bolsonaro that activates deep moral intuitions in his supporters. Many people side with him not for his proposals but because to them, he has become a symbol of everything good. The problem is that these people are responding only to Mr. Bolsonaro the symbol \u2014 not Mr. Bolsonaro the man.Mr. Bolsonaro speaks of fairness, for example. According to Mr. Haidt, fairness is about proportionality; it is the idea that people should get only what they deserve. Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters are angry about the perceived abuse of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which provides financial aid to poor families. They feel aggrieved by the image of people getting money without working. (They also don\u2019t support affirmative action.)According to military records, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s superiors also considered him immature. For a brief time, he was involved in gold mining; his superior, Col. Carlos Pellegrino, said that the captain had ambitions \u201cto seek by other means\u201d \u2014 outside the military \u2014 \u201cthe opportunity to fulfill his aspirations to be a rich man.\u201d So much for all that patriotism.One thing is true, though: Mr. Bolsonaro is loyal. The Bolsonaro clan are a tight-knit bunch, many of them working in the same field. Mr. Bolsonaro is so supportive of traditional family structures that he has been married three times. His first wife, Rog\u00e9ria, was a City Council member in Rio de Janeiro for two terms, with the support of her then-husband. His second wife, Ana Cristina, at one point accused him of threatening her, but eventually withdrew her complaint; she was running for Congress, but failed to get elected.Three of his sons are also politicians: Fl\u00e1vio has just been elected to Brazil\u2019s Senate; Eduardo was re-elected to the congress; and Carlos has been a City Council member in Rio de Janeiro since he was 17. Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s brother, Renato, tried and failed to be mayor of Miracatu and became a special aide to a City Council member. He was discharged from the job after a TV report revealed that he was getting paid without reporting to work.Many conservative voters appreciate authority because it creates order. They aspire to elect a strong ruler with a firm grip on the country. However, I\u2019m not sure Mr. Bolsonaro is capable of enforcing his command. One example: He acknowledges that he has only a \u201csuperficial understanding\u201d of economics. When asked questions about taxes or public debt, he relies entirely on the judgment of his economic adviser, Paulo Guedes. In addition, after being stabbed in a recent street rally, he has refused to attend political debates with Mr. Haddad, which hasn\u2019t made him sound authoritative or self-confident at all.According to Mr. Haidt, conservative voters also place particular importance on the value of sanctity (or purity), rejecting ideas of degradation. But Mr. Bolsonaro would degrade our nation with his rudeness and ignorance. He has been disrespectful to women, homosexuals, blacks and indigenous people, and has shown an inability to represent our people with class and intelligence. He\u2019s far from being a world leader.When it comes to moral intuitions, Mr. Bolsonaro looks poised to fulfill conservative hopes only on the surface: Look closer, and he acts against everything they most cherish. Let\u2019s hope Brazilians realize that \u2014 and quickly.Vanessa Barbara, a contributing opinion writer, is the editor of the literary website A Hortali\u00e7a and the author of two novels and two nonfiction books in Portuguese.Advertisement"}

In recent years, a poor economy and bleak employment outlook have forced many young people to leave Accettura. While foreign investment remains prevalent in Italy\u2019s north, the south lags behind. But, during the Maggio, some 1,000 emigrants return to celebrate.A few months later, on the Feast of the Ascension, a group of woodsmen walk more than 12 miles to the Montepiano forest to cut down an oak to portray the groom, or the maggio, which is then secured to pairs of oxen and walked back to the village. \u201cIt has to be the highest and the straightest in the forest,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said.On Pentecost Sunday, another group goes to the Gallipoli Cognato forest to cut down a treetop for the cima, or bride. The cima is carried by foot to the village, while locals dance, sing and play music. \u201cIt has to be the most beautiful and the most leafy to be considered the treetop,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said.At sunset on the Tuesday after Pentecost, the maggio and the cima are married, and usually joined and hoisted up by a pulley.Mr. De Bartolo, 48, comes from Bari, in the Apulia region of southern Italy, about 91 miles northeast of Accettura. \u201cIn Apulia, these kind of rites don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cI have known this rite for only a few years, and I fell in love with it immediately.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising that a pagan holiday involves tree worship. Pagans often worshiped trees as people. In ancient Greece, worship of Zeus took place in groves of oak, and oaks were associated with Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Zeus. It\u2019s possible the Accettura tradition goes back to the Greeks, who settled in southern Italy in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.\u201cThere are a lot of these rites that are in danger of disappearing,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said. \u201cAnd I would like, also with the help of photography, to preserve them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel\u2019s Out. Now What?", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer retreat from politics could give Germany a chance to re-establish its political center.Ms. Sauerbrey is a deputy editor in chief of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.BERLIN \u2014 It\u2019s happening: the beginning of the end of the Angela Merkel era. On Monday, Ms. Merkel, the three-term German chancellor, announced she was stepping down from the chairmanship of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party, and that she would not run for re-election in 2021.The news was not a total shock: Germans have been alternately praying for, and fearing, such an announcement since the migration crisis of 2015. The question now is whether Ms. Merkel will last her full term; most likely, the grand coalition between her party and the center-left Social Democrats will collapse before the next election. For Germany, this may prove to be a watershed moment. Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision could well mark a new beginning for Germany\u2019s conservatives, who face an identity crisis after years of her pragmatic, triangulating leadership. In the best case, it could consolidate Germany\u2019s faltering party system, in which the two establishment parties, locked in the center, are under siege from smaller parties in the wings. From an international perspective, however, Monday\u2019s announcement means that Germany\u2019s period of intense introspection, at the expense of an assertive regional and global leadership role, will continue. It could also mean that Ms. Merkel will continue to govern, but has to deal with a party leader who does not entirely support her as she faces an increasingly quarrelsome coalition. For many in Germany, it is still hard to imagine a Merkel-less government. The first woman to occupy the German Chancellery, Ms. Merkel has been head of her party for 18 years, and has ruled this country for 13. Her statement encapsulated what makes her such a great leader \u2014 and why she is responsible for the fractured state her party is in. To explain her decision, Ms. Merkel returned to a theme that has characterized her political career: a deeply felt sense of responsibility, and humility. She spoke of herself as a civil servant, someone who should always seek to unite the community she is serving. To that end, she said that she would serve her party and the country best by declining to run again. What may sound like an attempt at dressing a defeat in dignity is authentic. It has always been Ms. Merkel\u2019s greatest strength to be selfless, and humble, and dedicated to a greater cause.But in the years since the migration crisis, those same qualities became twisted, and a problem to her party and coalition partner. Ms. Merkel\u2019s posture as a stalwart civil servant has led her at times to defy overwhelming public opinion. She increasingly conveyed the notion that she did not want to be obstructed in serving by criticism or by discussion of alternatives to her decisions.  It\u2019s something that can happen to anyone who has sacrificed for a cause: in return, he expects to be blessed with epiphany, and thinks of himself as infallible. It\u2019s the humble arrogance of the monk who has renounced the world and dedicated his life to God in the anticipation of exclusive access to some higher truth.It is no surprise that Ms. Merkel\u2019s uncompromising dedication to what\u2019s right has become a threat to Germany\u2019s conservatives. The state elections in Hesse and Bavaria in the past two weeks were painful reminders of the disintegration of Germany\u2019s postwar party system. As in the national election in September 2017, voters slammed the two establishment parties. In surveys, Ms. Merkel\u2019s party is now at around 27 percent, down from 41.5 in the election of 2013.The center-right\u2019s problem goes beyond low poll numbers. Ms. Merkel has modernized the party and given up on most of its hard-held beliefs. While she opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, she has pushed her party to embrace green energy, end mandatory military service and accommodate refugees. As a result, her leadership has left her party without principles. It has no answers for fundamental questions like \u201cWhat is Germany\u2019s identity in an age of globalization?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the place of Islam within German culture?\u201d For years, Ms. Merkel\u2019s pragmatism has caused subcutaneous tensions within the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. Those tensions are now open cracks. A few weeks ago, a rebellion by conservative members of her coalition forced out a longtime Merkel confidant as the head of the parliamentary caucus in favor of an unknown back bencher. Almost immediately after Ms. Merkel\u2019s statement Monday, three candidates announced they would run for party chairman in December, each representing a different center-right faction: Jens Spahn, the young minister of health who has positioned himself as a true conservative; Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the party\u2019s secretary general and a pragmatic ally of Ms. Merkel; and Friedrich Merz, a conventional pro-market liberal (at this point, largely considered a long shot). The campaign among those three could be healthy for the party if it leads to a clarification of its basic values, and therefore for the country, too.And still, while the future may be rocky in the near term, there\u2019s hope in the political air. Angela Merkel\u2019s stepping aside may prove the beginning of a revival of political discourse in Germany, and a much-needed resolution about where the country is headed. She may again, though maybe for the last time, have truly served her country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hate Poisoning America", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Pittsburgh, Americans need to ask more of their leaders, and of each other.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.After the attack on Tree of Life, Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and dean of Simon Wiesenthal Center, told The Times, \u201cI\u2019m afraid to say that we may be at the beginning of what has happened to Europe, the consistent anti-Semitic attacks.\u201d \u201cIf it is not nipped in the bud,\u201d he said, in a remark that should make every American pause and think, \u201cI am afraid the worst is yet to come.\u201d\u201cThese issues are very challenging,\u201d he said after the uproar over his comments about not policing Holocaust denial, \u201cbut I believe that often the best way to fight offensive bad speech is with good speech.\u201dThat this may sound platitudinous doesn\u2019t make it wrong. Good speech may not be enough in itself, but that doesn\u2019t mean that American society couldn\u2019t benefit from much more of it today, particularly from its leaders. So it was reassuring to hear President Trump condemn the attack in Pittsburgh, as he did the pipe bombs. And it was disappointing to see him immediately head back out on the campaign trail, as he did on Saturday, to disparage his opponents and critics all over again. As a candidate and as president Mr. Trump has failed to consistently, unequivocally reject bigotry, and he has even encouraged violence at some of his rallies. He has adopted a temporizing moral equivalency in the face of anti-Semitic hate, most notoriously after neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched in Charlottesville last year, chanting \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Mr. Trump blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the ensuing chaos, in which a young woman was killed, run down by a driver sympathetic to the marchers.Mr. Trump is also setting a low, coarsening standard for how Americans should speak to and about one another. He has urged his supporters to think of his critics as traitors and enemies. Some Democratic leaders appear to be concluding that they will be suckers if they don\u2019t adopt similar smashmouth tactics.The suspects in Pittsburgh, Florida and Kentucky are responsible for their own actions. Maniacs have always existed in dark crevices of American life, and no amount of public condemnation will ever stop them from developing poisonous ideas. But in this harrowing time, more good speech, from more good people, can remind other Americans of the sorts of values that have, so far, managed to contain the divisions in their country, of the moral imagination and empathy that Mr. Bowers evidently so feared.Advertisement"}

American firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world.In India, Visa, Mastercard and American Express, as well as other financial players like Amazon and PayPal, said they needed more time to comply with the order by the country\u2019s banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.The companies told the R.B.I. that their fraud detection and other data processing systems were distributed on machines across the world and could not be quickly redesigned to work in India alone. As an alternative, they offered to store copies of the Indian data in the country for easy access by regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement.But the R.B.I. would have none of it. In recent phone calls to the top Indian executives of the major payments companies and in letters to the companies last week, the banking regulator warned that it would take action, including imposing fines, if they missed the Monday night deadline.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the payments companies were frustrated with the regulators. \u201cThey refuse to sit down and have a discussion,\u201d said Dr. Aghi, whose policy group counts the head of Mastercard on its board.Spokesmen for Visa and American Express declined to comment on their response to the local storage rule. Representatives of Mastercard and the R.B.I. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Amazon, which operates an India-only payments service that uses elements of its global technology platform, said in a statement: \u201cCompliance with local laws and regulation is a top priority for us in all the countries we operate in. We continue to work closely with the regulator towards this.\u201dIts policy changed as other arms of the Indian government \u2014 spurred by both a privacy ruling from the Supreme Court and India-first nationalists in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 had begun deliberating over much bigger changes to the country\u2019s data, e-commerce and privacy laws.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has portrayed himself abroad as a pro-business leader who welcomes foreign investment. At the same time, the right wing of his party has pushed him to adopt more protectionist, India-first policies to appeal to voters, and law enforcement officials have urged him to make sure they can easily get data on residents when they need it.The Trump administration and the bipartisan India caucus of the United States Senate have both urged India to reconsider its data localization campaign, in part because India\u2019s own outsourcing companies depend on moving data across borders to offer their services.On Friday, the co-chairmen of the India caucus, Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote to Mr. Modi warning that data localization \u201cwill have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens\u2019 data.\u201dDr. Aghi, who has helped American financial firms press their case with the Indian government, said top executives of the big payments companies were summoned to a meeting on Wednesday with B. P. Kanungo, who oversees regulation of payments at the R.B.I.At that meeting, the payments companies asked for 12 more months to fully localize Indian financial data. But R.B.I. officials insisted that the companies meet the Monday night deadline.In a follow-up letter to India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, Dr. Aghi said the R.B.I. had improperly suggested that the foreign financial firms seek assistance from iSpirt, a technology think tank in Bangalore with close ties to the government and Indian financial-services players.Advertisement"}

The fires left scenes of ashen destruction, but they did not wipe out everything. Scattered about the ravaged landscapes were islands of trees, shrubs and grass that survived unharmed.It\u2019s easy to overlook these remnants, which ecologists call fire refugia. But they can be vital to the long-term well-being of forests. These havens shelter species that are vulnerable to fires. Afterward, they can be starting points for the ecosystem\u2019s regeneration.\u201cThose trees are lifeboats,\u201d said Meg Krawchuk, a fire ecologist at Oregon State University.Over the years, ecologists have called fire refugia by many names: fire shadows, unburned islands, skips, stringers. But only in the 1990s did the scientists start to pay serious attention to the ecological role that fire refugia play in forests and grasslands.In the Pacific Northwest, for example, fires burn through forests every year, yet some fire refugia remain unharmed for centuries. Trees that are vulnerable to fire, such as Western hemlock and Pacific silver fir, thrive in these shady sanctuaries. And these trees shelter animals, such as the northern spotted owl, that struggle to survive in fire-prone forests.These untouched islands may be essential even for species that normally live outside them. As the fire burns, animals seek shelter inside refugia. As the forest slowly regenerates, they can return to refugia for food or nesting.Trees that survive in a refugium also may help speed the recovery of the surrounding ecosystem. Their seeds float across the charred landscape, producing a new crop of plants.For early studies of fire refugia, ecologists hiked through forests and grasslands, inspecting islands that withstood surrounding flames. Now researchers are scrutinizing fire refugia from space. With nearly 50 years of satellite data, they\u2019re starting to piece together the recent history of these sanctuaries.After a fire wipes out a forest, fire refugia stand out as green jewels scattered across the blackened land. Depending on the forest, up to 25 percent of it may survive in refugia, Dr. Krawchuk estimated.Sometimes a forest refugium survives a particular blaze thanks to luck. \u201cWe might have a change of wind, it cools down at night, and the fire might not grab that patch of forest,\u201d said Arjan Meddens, a fire ecologist at the University of Idaho and lead author of the BioScience review.But when researchers look at satellite images from other years, they see that some refugia are different. \u201cThere are some places in the landscape that seem to avoid fire time and time again,\u201d said Dr. Krawchuk.\u201cThe most interesting thing is why,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat makes that green spot stay that way?\u201dThere are probably many factors at work. In the Northern Hemisphere, the north sides of mountains favor refugia. The plants there get less sunlight that their south-facing counterparts. They often hold more water in their trunks and roots, and they grow in moister soil that can tamp down fires.Fire refugia don\u2019t have to endure for centuries to be ecologically important. Even a fleeting shelter can be important for local biodiversity.Grasslands may catch fire every year, and patches that survive one year typically burn the next. For butterflies that call grasslands home, these fleeting fire refugium can be crucial to survival.As long as some of them can find a safe place to hide from fire each year, the species will endure. If grasslands burned entirely to the ground every year, the butterflies would become extinct.In their review, Dr. Meddens, Dr. Krawchuck and their colleagues argue that short-lived refugia have a lot in common with ancient stands of old-growth forests.\u201cWe tried to tie this all together and say, \u2018It\u2019s all the same idea,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Meddens. \u201cWe can start to think about these things in a more organized way.\u201dToday, fire refugia face many pressures, such as invasive species and outbreaks of pests. But in the future, climate change may pose a far bigger threat.Global temperatures are rising. In many places, this has led to heat waves and droughts, which can turn plants into fuel. In years to come, refugia may become rarer as fires become more intense.Ecologists still don\u2019t know enough about fire refugia to come up with a broad strategy for preserving them. \u201cThat requires identifying where they are and why we think they\u2019re important,\u201d Dr. Krawchuk said.If researchers can reach agreement on that, she said, they build an atlas of fire refugia from satellite images and ground-based studies. \u201cThat would be sort of the Holy Grail,\u201d Dr. Krawchuk said.Advertisement"}

The Age of Un-Enlightenment is using addresses to usher it out.Ms. Mask is working on a book about street addresses. People often think of their street names and house numbers as banal. But they\u2019re an essential part of proving your identity. Want to register for school? Open a bank account? Build credit and start a business? Show proof of address.I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that addresses were being used as a tool for disenfranchisement. Governments have, intentionally or not, long excluded their most marginalized citizens from this crucial aspect of legal identity. There are still at least tens of millions of city dwellers around the world who don\u2019t have an address.Violent protests broke out occasionally across Europe as subjects realized house numbers were yet another way governments could exercise control over their money, time and bodies. A Swiss visitor to Austria was \u201chorrified to see numbers on the houses which appear to us a symbol of the hand of the rule determinedly taking possession of the private individual.\u201d They also noticed that having an address meant that someone might actually want to find you; lacking an address became a badge of inferiority. Maria Theresa only cursorily considered Jews and women in her house numbering campaign; animals, so much more useful in war, received more attention.In parts of the United States, it was often the publishers of city directories who first numbered houses, and they tended to exclude women, children and servants from their books. Reuben Rose-Redwood of the University of Victoria in Canada recounts how one directory publisher in 19th century New York City boasted that \u201cthe names of laborers, colored people, persons in low obscurity who rent tenements by the week or month, may be excluded without impairing the utility of the work.\u201d Some people were simply not worth counting.The Enlightenment gave us street addresses, and at the same time it toppled monarchies and ushered in democracy. So it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the Age of Un-Enlightenment is using addresses as a tool to undo these same democratic ideals, one brown voter at a time.Advertisement"}

For years, he strategically took assignments for newspapers and magazines in brighter and warmer countries during those months to avoid being at home.\u201cActivity was essential as a cure during the winter,\u201d said Goran Odbratt, Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator.In the three years that followed its initial publication, Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s series evolved into an expansive body of work. As he drove around the country, visiting mostly small towns and cities, Mr. Tunbjork searched for people and places that visually reflected his emotions.\u201cThe dark season is heavy for everyone,\u201d said his wife, the filmmaker Maud Nycander. \u201cEspecially if you go to small places in Sweden, nothing happens. You can look out on the streets, and there\u2019s no one there because it\u2019s too cold to go out.\u201dMr. Tunbjork found what he was looking for in dreary apartment blocks, seedy bars and desolate streets. Bathed in the unforgiving light of his flash, Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s disparate subjects \u2014 a dirty snowman with a spray-painted smile, a flock of sea gulls, a man sitting alone on a bus \u2014 emerge from the darkness with brutal clarity. The mundane becomes grotesque.\u201cIt was both a self-portrait and a documentation of what a lot of people go through during this time,\u201d Ms. Nycander said.\u201cI had never seen such a vivid representation of what somebody who\u2019s feeling depressed must be experiencing,\u201d Ms. Ryan said of the series in a speech at the Boraas Konstmuseum last year.Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s most personal artistic work, ultimately, was his last. While he continued to take magazine assignments over the next eight years, albeit less frequently, and to participate in the odd artistic residency, he didn\u2019t complete any subsequent personal projects. He had embarked on a series of landscapes, Ms. Nycander said, but a creeping sense of self-doubt stymied his efforts. Then, in April 2015, Mr. Tunbjork died after suffering a heart attack outside his home. He was 59.\u201cI felt that after \u2018Vinter,\u2019 he didn\u2019t really recover fully,\u201d Mr. Odbratt said.For Mr. Odbratt, \u201cVinter\u201d doesn\u2019t merely represent Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s experience of depression.

Mr. Tunbjork\u2019s photo of an elderly person in a wheelchair being pushed along an icy dead end street, Mr. Odbratt said, sums up the perspective succinctly.\u201cI see it as some kind of allegory of the conditions of life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going toward the dead end, but you\u2019re still striving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For whatever reason, we tend to place an unfair amount of value on early-career success, which can lead to us asking ourselves, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it happened for me yet?\u201d\u201cThe traditional way of thinking is that once you pass 45 years old, the chance for a breakthrough is lower,\u201d said Dashun Wang, an associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University, who led the study.Your hot streak \u201ccan be with equal probability your very first work, your very last work, or somewhere in the middle,\u201d he said.Mr. Wang and his co-authors studied the careers of 3,480 artists, 6,233 film directors and 20,040 scientists, then measured if and when each individual hit a hot streak. About 90 percent of subjects did, with the streak lasting anywhere from two to five years. Mr. Wang said that while the study looked at only three professions, the idea that most people hit a hot streak at some point in their career does translate to other professions.Most surprisingly, Mr. Wang said, was that \u201chot streaks tend to occur randomly,\u201d which means that higher productivity doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with a hot streak. Instead, it\u2019s that the quality of work produced during that time is higher than that of a person\u2019s average output over all.The assumption that we produce our best work midcareer isn\u2019t entirely unfounded, but it\u2019s a mistaken conclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s not because age and creativity are intertwined,\u201d Mr. Wang said. Rather, it\u2019s because people are generally more productive midcareer than at any other time.Still, while hot streaks are quite ubiquitous, they\u2019re also usually unique: Less than 25 percent of the artists and scientists studied experience a second hot streak in their career, and less than 10 percent of the film directors.But that\u2019s beside the point.

{"Headline": "Deer Antlers Couldn\u2019t Grow So Fast Without These Genes", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesStudying the genes that let deer quickly regrow their antlers could one day lead to treatments for people who suffer bone ailments like osteoporosis. Every spring, male deer undertake a unique biological ritual: sprouting and rapidly regrowing their massive, spiky antlers.A complex matrix of bone, living tissue and nerve endings, deer antlers can reach 50 inches long and weigh more than 20 pounds before they are shed in winter. Not only are the antlers useful in attracting mates and fighting, they qualify deer as the only mammal that can regrow lost body parts.\u201cDeer antler formation shares similar biological mechanisms with human bone growth, but deer antlers grow much faster,\u201d said Peter Yang, an orthopedic researcher at the Stanford University School of Medicine and senior author of the study. Perhaps by studying the newly identified genes in humans, scientists may be able to developed treatments that could \u201creproduce the rapid bone growth of deer antlers in human bone,\u201d and provide relief for people who suffer ailments like osteoporosis.Dr. Yang first took an interest in antlers during a 2009 vacation to Alaska\u2019s Denali National Park, where a tour guide noted that the deer can grow their bony appendages nearly an inch each a day in summer. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been fascinated by them,\u201d he said.He and his colleagues traveled to a deer farm in California to take samples of early antler tissue \u2014 which consists primarily of stem cells \u2014 from male red deer. After analyzing the genes in the samples, the researchers tried shutting down some and \u201crevving up\u201d others to determine which function they controlled. They compared samples of RNA \u2014 molecules that deliver messages in genes \u2014 from the antlers with human RNA in search of overlaps. They then tinkered with the relevant genes in mice to see how they affected tissue growth.The team eventually narrowed their focus to two genes, uhrf1 and s100a10, both of which have previously been linked to bone development in humans. They found that when the uhrf1 gene was shut down, the rate of bone growth in the mice significantly slowed. And when the s100a10 gene was put into overdrive, calcium deposits increased and the engineered cells mineralized more rapidly.Dr. Yang and his team concluded that uhrf1 and s100a10 work in tandem to generate rapid antler growth in deer: uhrf1 promotes tissue generation, and s100a10 supports the hardening, or mineralization, of that tissue.If true, the findings may have some \u201creally interesting applications for human health,\u201d said Dr. Yang.Human application of Dr. Yang\u2019s findings are a long ways off, and the findings must be confirmed in other deer species. But he hopes the new research will lay a foundation for future studies.An earlier version of this article misstated the species of deer that researchers studied. They were fallow deer, not red deer.

The boy, dressed in blue trousers and a white shirt, lay face down in the dirt bleeding from a head wound, the handle of a torn plastic shopping bag still looped through his fingers.Mortars killed 60 people that day, but Mr. Hondros paused in the midst of the bombardment to take a picture, one of his many images documenting the human cost of Liberia\u2019s second civil war. He also found the boy\u2019s photo ID from class 7B at St. Mary Catholic School, putting a name and a face to one of the thousand or so people killed during a two-month siege of the capital Monrovia, most of them civilians.\u201cChris was the quintessential photojournalist. He never missed a shot,\u201d said Michael Kamber, a photographer who was with Mr. Hondros that day. \u201cIf there was fighting, he was always right there next to it, getting every moment of action.\u201dMr. Kamber was working for The New York Times and Mr. Hondros for Getty Images. Both were on the government-controlled side of Monrovia, a city perched on a peninsula where rebels lobbed mortars into densely populated areas from across a bridge. Both sides relied on ragtag bands of drugged up child soldiers.\u201cIt was kids in T-shirts and flip-flops as high as kites,\u201d said Mr. Kamber, who worked for weeks amid the chaos alongside Mr. Hondros. \u201cIt was a kind of madness.\u201dDocumenting the conflict from the rebel side was British photographer Tim Hetherington, connected to his two friends across the front line by only the arc of projectiles.\u201cI\u2019m sure Tim had pictures of rebels firing mortars, and Chris and I were in the other part of town where the mortars were landing and killing civilians,\u201d said Mr. Kamber, who compared photos with Mr. Hetherington after the war.\u201cThey were friends and colleagues, they worked together and they died together, but their work has never been shown side by side,\u201d said Mr. Kamber, the founder and executive director of the BDC, a nonprofit gallery and educational space he conceived with Mr. Hetherington.Liberia\u2019s civil wars occurred before the explosion of social media, and the conflict may be one of the last examples of a time when photojournalism had a tangible impact on a war\u2019s outcome.\u201cThe pictures were coming out into a very different context,\u201d said Mr. Kamber. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my contention that their photos helped end the war.\u201dThe two photographers are a contrast in styles, with Mr. Hondros taking a muscular hard-news approach that dominated front pages day after day while Mr. Hetherington, who shot film with a medium-format Hasselblad, was more conceptual and contemplative.\u201cTim was photographing graffiti, and close-ups of fighters\u2019 painted fingernails, and landscapes,\u201d said Mr. Kamber. \u201cFor Tim, everything was about context. He was in the middle of combat, but he was pulling way back and looking at larger concepts of war and humanity.\u201d\u201cWar and Peace in Liberia\u201d also reveals how the country shaped the lives and careers of Mr. Hondros and Mr. Hetherington. Many photographers drop into foreign wars, take their pictures, sometimes win awards and then move on, but Mr. Hetherington returned to live in Liberia for several years and was deeply committed to the people he met. He invested in local communities and paid for his driver\u2019s daughter to attend nursing school. She graduated in 2011.Mr. Hondros returned too, tracking down people he\u2019d documented, most famously Joseph Duo, a fighter he\u2019d photographed shirtless and leaping for joy after firing a rocket at rebels. The picture is one of the defining images of the war. Mr. Hondros encouraged Mr. Duo to go back to high school, and helped pay his tuition. The former fighter who had spent a decade living in the bush later studied criminal justice and last year went into politics.Both photographers created seminal works from more recent wars, especially Mr. Hondros in Iraq and Mr. Hetherington in Afghanistan, but Liberia is where they each turned a corner, according to Mr. Kamber.\u201cTim had never done anything like this, and it was a precursor to everything he did later in terms of concepts of men and war and machismo,\u201d said Mr. Kamber, adding that Mr. Hondros also came into his own during the war. \u201cHe was always a solid photographer, but he proved he had an incredible amount of courage and would put himself out there for the Liberian people. It took his work and his life to a different level.\u201dThe show provides insight into two respected photographers, both of whom have been profiled in documentary films about their remarkable work and lives, but neither would likely have wanted the attention focused solely on them. They often put their concern for civilians above their own welfare and, Mr. Kamber said, would want the exhibition to reflect their devotion to the people they photographed.\u201cChris and Tim would want to focus on cost of war to Liberian civilians, and civilians caught up in war everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Kamber. \u201cThat was the main theme in both of their lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I\u2019m an Asian-American Harvard Alumnus. Affirmative Action Works.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI know it\u2019s incorrect to think of race-conscious admissions policies as helping just the lucky few. Dr. Rhew is a Harvard graduate and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.In a federal court in Boston on Monday, a trial that could have major consequences for diversity on university campuses began. A group of Asian-American students have accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants by rejecting them despite their higher numerical scores in favor of African-American and Latino students.Like many Asian-Americans and many Harvard graduates, I vigorously oppose the lawsuit. I reject the false equivalence of the argument that taking into consideration the race of applicants from underrepresented groups is the same as discriminating against everyone else.The plaintiffs are asking why colleges like Harvard should increase racial and ethnic diversity at the expense of \u201cmore qualified\u201d applicants, in particular Asian-Americans? The assumption here is that factors like an applicant\u2019s SATs, grade point average and number of extracurricular activities can provide a precise ranking of student quality. But that\u2019s not true. While scores and grades may provide a general measure of cognitive ability and motivation, no universal metric can exactly gauge applicants\u2019 intellect or their value to an institution.I would flip the question: Does the racial and ethnic diversity at Harvard enhance the quality of the education there? My answer is a resounding yes. The best college education includes intellectual and social interactions among thoughtful people from a broad range of cultural and racial backgrounds, both inside and outside the classroom. Restricting diversity efforts will ultimately reduce the quality of education.Berkeley is working hard to promote racial diversity among its undergraduate body, but it has a long way to go. The elimination of affirmative action hinders this progress. Still, the university is able to get students representing a wide range of interests, backgrounds and identities because it\u2019s so big (with over 30,000 undergraduates, it is almost five times the size of Harvard). Forbidding race as a factor in admissions would be a bigger blow to diversity at smaller universities, whose smaller student bodies limit the cross-section of the world that can be accommodated.Though I\u2019m a professor, I readily acknowledge that much of the learning occurs outside the lecture hall, in the spaces where students live and socialize. As an undergraduate at Harvard in the early 1990s, I spent countless late nights debating religion, science, culture and politics with classmates of a wide variety of belief systems, backgrounds, interests, political viewpoints, ethnicities and race. These interactions made my mental constructs of society more flexible, allowing me to incorporate new information and to learn from the experiences of others.Some ask why can\u2019t Harvard be more like Berkeley, eliminating an individual\u2019s race as a factor in admissions? As someone who knows both schools quite well, I take the opposite position, and wish Berkeley could be more like Harvard. If students are an integral part of the educational experience, then having a diverse class is essential. Only an admissions process that takes into consideration the whole person \u2014 including race \u2014 can produce the extraordinary diversity of each incoming class at Harvard.I once believed that affirmative action was primarily important as a vehicle to address the decades of racial inequality that have harmed minorities in the past, including Asian-Americans. I now recognize that the benefits of the racial and ethnic diversity that affirmative action produces are shared by everyone. When this diversity exists, stereotypes are shattered, arguments are informed by experience, and alternate perspectives lead to revelations. Race cannot and should not be excised from a person\u2019s identity, but communities can be built around shared undergraduate experiences and friendships among students with different backgrounds.The experiential learning environment provided by a diverse community is vital. Our students are the future professionals who will enter a diverse work force, the business leaders who will work in a global economy and the visionaries who will solve local and global problems. Perhaps most important, diversity is vital to educating citizens who can identify the artificial constructs that divide us and develop new relationships to move our society forward. A race-conscious admissions policy is not about benefiting the lucky few \u2014 it is about improving the educational experience for all.Robert Rhew is an associate professor in the departments of geography and of environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}

I was a close confidante of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and was there for his rise and fall.The Hugo Ch\u00e1vez I knew believed in social justice, equality and fundamental freedoms. He won landslide majorities in multiple elections. He was even re-elected when he was dying of cancer \u2014 that\u2019s how popular he was in Venezuela. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez pardoned many of his adversaries, even those who attempted to overthrow him in a violent coup.Did he have authoritarian tendencies? His military background left him with a firm belief in hierarchy. The longer he remained in power, the more entrenched he became, which is why term limits and checks and balances are essential to a healthy democracy.But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had enormous empathy for the poor and the marginalized. He made great strides during his presidency, helping millions of people.True, he made many mistakes. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez aspired to make his model sustainable, but died without achieving that goal. His habit of choosing loyalty over competence was a fatal mistake. So was entrusting multiple responsibilities to a closed circle of people who were unprepared and unwilling to make hard choices. It nurtures a climate of secrecy and unaccountability, which can be a danger to democracy.I\u2019ve seen that same behavior in Donald Trump, who has surrounded himself with family members, giving them jobs for which they have no experience or knowledge. It\u2019s a standard autocratic tactic in order to keep a tight grip on power, stemming from the paranoia that power addiction creates, and the narcissistic belief that no one can do things better.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Maduro thrives on deception, exaggeration and lies. He denies a humanitarian crisis exists in Venezuela and blames the United States for his own mess. Should he be ousted in a coup, crippled by economic sanctions or overthrown in a foreign invasion? No. Venezuela\u2019s problems must be resolved by Venezuelans. Instead of entertaining the possibility of a military intervention to remove Mr. Maduro, Washington should focus on circumventing our own budding kleptocracy led by another aspiring autocrat.No president should ever rule unchecked. No person should ever be given free rein to disregard the basic tenets of society, law and order, freedom and respect. It is the people who must hold their leaders to account through active, conscientious participation and oversight, always keeping a watchful eye on the dangers and temptations of pervasive corruption and power addiction.Mr. Maduro returned to Venezuela empty-handed. No meeting with Mr. Trump, no easing of sanctions, no lessening of tensions. But, in perfect Trumpian fashion, he went on state TV to grandstand about his trip, making outlandish remarks.Just like Mr. Trump, Mr. Maduro thrives in a parallel world of lies and fantastical chicanery. Unlike Venezuela, the United States still has time to reverse the slippery slope to authoritarianism.Eva Golinger (@evagolinger), a lawyer, is the author of a memoir, \u201cConfidante of \u2018Tyrants.\u2019\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Rust Belt Still Trump Country?", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats are leading in many high-profile races, but there are a lot of low visibility elections that carry exceptionally high stakes. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Democrats are poised to win every Senate and governor\u2019s race throughout the Midwest this November, and they are expected to pick up House seats in the region too.Let\u2019s take a look, first, at the big picture.Barring unforeseen events, Democrats in the region will make gains at every level on Election Day, from statewide contests to House elections to state legislative seats. Still, their gains in state legislative races may not prove to be enough to flip those bodies to Democratic control.It is at this level of legislative races \u2014 low visibility elections that carry exceptionally high stakes \u2014 that Democrats face intimidating Republican majorities. For Democrats to see across-the-board gains on the scale that Republicans achieved in 2010 would require not just a wave, but a tidal wave.It is difficult to overestimate the political importance of the Midwest. The region was not only crucial to Trump\u2019s victory, it has been crucial to continuing conservative control of both branches of Congress.Some interpreted 2016 as beginning of possible realignment of the Great Lakes Midwest, with the white working class leaving Democrats. But this year, Senate races in those states are not even competitive for Republicans.By far the Democrats\u2019 strongest region in Senate + Gov + House polling has been the Midwest, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d really gather that from the tonality of the reporting, which tends to fixate on demographic change and therefore finds races in the South & the West a lot sexier.According to both Democratic and Republican operatives, Republican difficulties in the region stem in part from the trend among many Obama 2012-to-Trump-2016 voters to switch back to the Democrats.Nick Gourevitch, whose Democratic firm, Global Strategy Group, is polling in the Midwest, wrote in an email: \u201cIn general, we are seeing Obama-Trump districts returning to the fold as competitive seats.\u201d He went on:Our postelection research on Obama-Trump voters showed that many of them were conflicted voters who had mixed feelings about supporting the president and that not all of them were the die-hard Trump supporters some in the media like to report them to be.Gourevitch\u2019s assessment is shared by a Republican consultant active in the region who requested anonymity to avoid alienating clients.His studies, and polling by others in the region, he wrote me by email, showthat a significant portion of the Trump vote was comprised of nose-holders \u2014 that is, voters who weren\u2019t particularly fond of Trump, but liked Hillary a helluva lot less, so they voted for Trump.\u201cThese voters have not transitioned into strong Trump supporters, but rather Trump doubters,\u201d the Republican consultant continued.They may like the policies he\u2019s espousing, but are turned off by his style of leadership. To say they are returning to the Democratic fold would be an overstatement because all the Democrats stand for is their opposition to Trump nowadays. Rather, these are swing voters \u2014 they voted for Trump, they may either not vote in \u201918 or may vote Democratic.The Republican consultant was less pessimistic about Trump\u2019s Midwestern prospects in 2020. The \u201cTrump doubters,\u201d he argues, are open for either side in \u201920. They are certainly still open for Trump, depending on who the Democrats put up. Trump\u2019s numbers may not be positive, but two years from now he may look at lot better than the candidate that survives the \u201clurch to the left\u201d Democratic presidential primaries.Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, agreed that while \u201cin 2018, Trump\u2019s victories in the Midwest are not paying off,\u201d Democrats should \u201cbe more wary of 2020. In the Midwest and nationally, Republicans and especially Trump are ahead on economy and trade. That\u200e could have real impact in 2020.\u201d More immediately, Lake cautioned, \u201cWe do need to watch men who seem to be moving toward Trump in this last week\u201d \u2014 referring to the aftermath of the bitter fight over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.A Democratic pollster who works on legislative races and who said he could be more candid if he remained anonymous, told me: We have a real problem with white working class voters heading into 2020. I don\u2019t think it protects GOP federal seats this year, but it protects Trump in 2020.In the coming election, the Republican consultant warned that there is \u201cno question that Republican state legislative bodies are at risk in November. If there is a serious blue wave, it won\u2019t stop at federal campaigns.\u201dA blue wave, however, will have to rise above a Republican breakwater. The State Senate and House districts in Midwestern states governed by the Republican Party after 2010 have been masterfully gerrymandered, and the Republican legislative majorities are now, with few exceptions, huge.We will definitely win seats across the Midwest but I am unsure if we will flip bodies. The 2010 and 2014 cycles were devastating for the party, especially legislatively, and a not very good 2016 did not help. Gerrymandering is a big factor.Take Ohio. In 2009, before the 2010 Republican wave election, Democrats controlled the State House by 53-46Hard numbers demonstrate the scope of the regional shift.In 2009, Democrats held the majority of state legislative seats in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, 343 to 320, a 23-seat advantage. In 2018, Republicans control 415 seats to the Democrats\u2019 245, a 170-seat advantage. (The smaller total in 2018 results from vacancies}.In 2009-11, Democrats had the majority of Midwestern states\u2019 congressional seats, 40-29. Today, the region sends 40 Republicans to the House and 25 Democrats. (The region lost seats because of population declines.)If Democrats were to succeed in winning not only governorships but complete control of a state\u2019s legislature, they would have the power to redraw congressional and legislative districts in their favor after the 2020 census, just as Republicans did after the 2010 census. If Republicans can keep control of at least one branch of a legislature, they will have power to block Democratic gerrymandering and force compromise.Similarly, Democrats would need complete control if they intend to rescind the many Republican-enacted laws designed to restrict and constrain voting by minorities.Until this year, Republicans and conservative groups invested much more heavily in state legislative contests than Democrats and their allies.This year, for the first time in recent memory, Democratic and liberal organizations are investing heavily in the battle for state legislatures.Republicans readily concede the success of the current Democratic mobilization at the state legislative level. In fact, Republicans use the threat of Democratic victory as a fund-raising tool.\u201cThey have been extremely effective in mobilizing their resources,\u201d Matthew Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, told me in a phone interview. After years of neglect, he added, \u201cthe fear of death\u201d has finally captured Democrats\u2019 attention.Walter argues that the strength of the Democratic surge in 2017 \u2014 when the party won 56 of 98 special elections and a special Senate election in Alabama \u2014 has waned this year. So far in 2018, Republicans have won a bare majority of special elections, 38 out of 75, according to Walter.David James, a spokesman for the committee, argues that Democratic special election victories have only made a tiny dent in the 1000 state legislative seats Republicans gained from 2010 to 2016: \u201cSo while the Democrats make headlines on flipping some seats, since 2016 they have regained only about 4 percent of their losses.\u201dIn the four key Rust Belt states Trump carried, the sole legislative chamber clearly vulnerable to Democratic takeover is the 33-member Wisconsin State Senate, which now has 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats. Seventeen of its members are up for election this year.The size of the Democratic advantage in the fight for control of the House is unclear with a month until the midterm elections, and there are recent signs Republicans might have improved their position, possibly because of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.Trump has been highly effective in simultaneously building a resolute army of supporters and an equally determined cadre of voters who can\u2019t stand him. One crucial pillar of his political success has been the vacuity of his Democratic opposition.The Democratic grass roots, however, have been out in full force this fall, equipped with the most powerful of political motivations: rage, fear and anger. Republicans are also mobilizing in force.The Democrats may do well in 2018 by capitalizing on animosity to Trump, but that guarantees nothing for 2020. In fact, Democratic gains this year could serve to give Republicans the edge in the rage, fear and anger department.In our polarized politics, the winning side in one election is very likely to be the underdog in the next. No matter what happens in November, one thing is certain: For the Democrats to beat Trump in 2020, they will need a tough candidate prepared for battle in what has become politics without rules, boundaries or mercy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gillibrand\u2019s (Lack of) Spending in 2018 Offers Hints of 2020", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 The last time that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was on the ballot for re-election, she poured $8 million into a summer television-advertising spree en route to a landslide victory.This year, she has invested zero dollars on television and has spent only a fraction of what she did in 2012. Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, has instead methodically conserved her campaign cash, building a $10.7 million federal treasury that is among the largest in the country; a war chest that she could use to jump-start a bid for the White House in 2020.The lack of spending is just one sign of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s possible trajectory: On Thursday, she stumped in New Hampshire to rally support for Molly Kelly, the Democratic candidate for governor in one of the first two states that will kick off the presidential nominating contest.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s visit followed recent appearances in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania where she also campaigned primarily for female candidates ahead of the November elections. She has so far essentially ignored her own Republican challenger, Chele Farley, a finance executive and first-time candidate.But perhaps even more so than her multistate campaign stops, it is Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s management of her Senate campaign account that reveals the arc of her ambition. As of the end of September, she had accumulated $1 million more than she had at the beginning of the year. Candidates seeking re-election typically spend down their treasury, not grow it.\u201cI don\u2019t feel I need to spend that money in that way right now because of the type of campaign we\u2019re running,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview in New Hampshire. She framed her frugality as a sign of a modernity \u2014 a campaign focused on grass-roots and online organizing \u2014 while insisting that she is \u201csolely focused\u201d on her re-election.\u201cI want to be senator for the next six years,\u201d she said.Much of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s spending has been on the kind of list-building activities that are as likely to pay dividends in 2020 as this fall, investing heavily in digital advertising that cultivates new email addresses and donors. More than 40 percent of her spending in 2018 has been on Facebook advertising, according to an analysis of records from the Federal Election Commission and Pathmatics, an ad tracking firm.Ms. Gillibrand is not the only possible Democratic presidential contender spending judiciously on her 2018 re-election. In Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren ended September with $15 million in the bank; like Ms. Gillibrand, she has $1 million more than she had at the end of 2017. Ms. Warren raised $3.5 million in the most recent quarter and spent $4 million; Ms. Gillibrand raised and spent $1.4 million.Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand are sitting atop the most money among would-be 2020 Democratic candidates (Beto O\u2019Rourke, the fund-raising phenomenon and Texas Senate candidate, is expected to empty his current $22 million campaign chest in his uphill bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz).While presidential campaigns are big-money ventures, the so-called hard dollars that candidates directly control are often in exceedingly short supply, especially in sprawling, multicandidate fields as 2020 is expected to be for Democrats.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s $10.7 million in the bank is about as much as Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, raised during his entire 2016 presidential campaign, and far more than Gov. Scott Walker, Senator Lindsey Graham or Mike Huckabee, all Republicans, was able to collect.\u201cPeople are wise to try to raise early and preserve as much as possible,\u201d said Danny Diaz, who was the campaign manager for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, which eventually ran short of donors and had to make cutbacks. Of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s $10 million and Ms. Warren\u2019s $15 million, Mr. Diaz said: \u201cThat\u2019s not nothing. That\u2019s the seed money starting a campaign.\u201dMs. Farley, who has raised $1.2 million over all and had $152,000 remaining at the start of this month, has tried to make Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s 2020 plans an issue. \u201cShe\u2019s focusing on issues that are relevant for running for president,\u201d Ms. Farley said in an interview, adding, \u201cI\u2019m only interested in representing the people of New York.\u201dOn Sunday, Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Farley had been scheduled for their lone debate, but Ms. Gillibrand withdrew late Friday after labor leaders called for a boycott of the media sponsor. She said she was seeking an alternate sponsor or date before the election, though Ms. Farley said she had \u201cchickened out.\u201dPolls show Ms. Gillibrand far ahead. But Ms. Gillibrand was a heavy front-runner in 2012, too, when she dispatched her opponent, Wendy Long, claiming more than 72 percent of the vote to win her first full term. She had won her first election in 2010 to finish the term of Hillary Clinton, after being appointed to replace Ms. Clinton in 2009.In 2012, Ms. Gillibrand spent $9.3 million in the third quarter, compared with $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, Federal Election Commission records show.\u201cI promise no voter in New York is saying, \u2018I wish more campaign ads were on the air,\u2019\u201d said Glen Caplin, an adviser to Ms. Gillibrand, adding that the campaign was continuously evaluating the state of the race. Her campaign has taped a television ad in case it is needed.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it a little differently,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand explained. \u201cWhat that looks like is I\u2019ve done 16 town halls; I\u2019ve been to all 62 counties; I\u2019m trying to really create a grass-roots-oriented campaign and a modern campaign.\u201dSome of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s limited spending has been geared to an audience far beyond New York.In recent weeks, she has bought Facebook ads nationally to raise money for Democratic senators and Senate candidates, including Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. (Donations are split between Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign and the candidates, while her campaign harvests valuable new donor contacts.)She is running other ad programs to expand her database of supporters: In late September, a series of Facebook ads, which also ran nationally, featured a one-question survey: \u201cDo you approve of President Trump?\u201d Pathmatics said she spent $183,000 on one such ad.Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also on the ballot this year, spent only 1 percent for ads in his home state, Vermont, the study showed. The heavily favored Mr. Sanders has also spent little on his re-election, ending September with $8.8 million in his campaign account, though he is not expected to face the same financial pressures as other candidates if he runs again for president, because he already has an expansive donor base. His 2016 campaign was powered by more than $230 million in mostly small contributions.Ms. Gillibrand, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders would all enjoy one other financial advantage if they run right after getting re-elected: Not only can they transfer everything left over from their Senate campaign to a presidential committee, they can also tap again every past donor, even those who have given the legal maximum of $5,400 in the 2018 cycle, because it would be a new campaign.Ms. Gillibrand remains far lesser known than either of her Senate colleagues. At a phone bank in Concord, N.H., some volunteers knew her enough to rattle off her advocacy against sexual assault in the military. But others had only seen her for the first time on television contesting the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.Most understood the subtext of her first campaign visit to the state. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be in New Hampshire if she wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d said Carrie Thompson, a teacher from nearby Hopkinton, N.H., who was making calls.Earlier in the day, Ms. Gillibrand had walked into one Concord coffee shop virtually unnoticed.

{"Headline": "Harvard and the Myth of the Interchangeable Asian", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019re mistaken for each other, but we\u2019re not mistaken about ourselves.Ms. Ko is a novelist.\u201cI\u2019ve got your letter here, Christina.\u201d My high school guidance counselor gave me a college recommendation for a girl named Christina Chin. I\u2019d been meeting with him for four years. There were fewer than 20 Asian-Americans in my New Jersey public high school of about 700 students, and our teachers frequently mistook us for one another. One of my teachers, who lived near me and had known me since I was a child, received a call during class one day and said I was wanted in the principal\u2019s office. When I arrived, the principal said he\u2019d called for a student named Jane Tawara.\u201cI\u2019m Lisa, not Christina,\u201d I told my counselor, though later I joked that I should have passed for Christina. She had better grades.As I read about this lawsuit, I am reminded of my own college application experience, in the mid-1990s. At the heart of my anger at being seen as interchangeable with other Asian-American students \u2014 and later, at being mistaken for other female Asian-American co-workers in every job I\u2019ve had \u2014 was that we were seen as lacking individuality, and by extension, humanity. My exchange with the guidance counselor was far from the first time this happened, but it still stung: You are invisible. You don\u2019t matter.This narrative is a familiar one in our Asian-American lexicon. My parents, Chinese immigrants from the Philippines, came to the United States on student visas in the 1960s. The first in their families to attend college, they met in New York City and sponsored their siblings\u2019 migration to North America. They moved from the city to a middle-class white commuter suburb and raised me there. For many children of immigrants who came to the United States as beneficiaries of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, our origin stories have centered on our relationships to whiteness and class assimilation. We\u2019re too American, or not American enough. We\u2019re tired of this story being the dominant one.Ethnocentric views of \u201cAsian pride\u201d can be seductive for those who have historically felt disempowered. To acknowledge our collective anger and pain, how we are both targeted by racism from whites and perpetuators of racism against blacks and Latinos, may feel vulnerable and dangerous. My family\u2019s story is far from being the only kind of Asian-American story, though it\u2019s the one that has largely been told, particularly in mainstream media. That\u2019s partly because of who has access to that media and partly because it\u2019s a story white Americans feel more comfortable with, because it still puts them at the center. Asian America is changing. While new immigrants continue to expand our communities, so do the grandchildren of post-1965 immigrants, born to parents who were also born in the United States. Will these third-generation Asian-Americans be less concerned with the white gaze \u2014 with the guidance counselors and college admissions officers who refuse to see them fully \u2014 than previous generations have been? Home on break from college, where I was receiving a new sort of political education, I told my parents they were wrong about who we were. We were Asian-American, not Asian, and we were definitely not Oriental.\u201cWe\u2019re not American,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re Asian.\u201d At least they didn\u2019t laugh me out of the house for my arrogance.\u201cAsian-American,\u201d I said. \u201cNot Asian Asian.\u201dThat was more than 20 years ago. On a recent visit to New Jersey, I asked my parents, former Reagan Republicans turned staunch Obama Democrats who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, if they felt American now that they\u2019ve been in the United States for half a century.\u201cOf course,\u201d my mother said. \u201cWhat else would I be? Even though other Americans don\u2019t see me as American.\u201d\u201cWell, who cares how they see us,\u201d my father said. \u201cThey can think what they want, but it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201dI hope he\u2019s right. Regardless of how we are seen by others, we are the ones who can best see ourselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rifts Break Open at Facebook Over Kavanaugh Hearing", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 \u201cI want to apologize,\u201d the Facebook executive wrote last Friday in a note to staff. \u201cI recognize this moment is a deeply painful one \u2014 internally and externally.\u201dThe unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook\u2019s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s and had broken no company rules, these people said.Yet the disquiet within the company has not subsided. This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.The internal turmoil at Facebook \u2014 described by six current and former employees and a review of internal posts \u2014 illustrates how divisions over Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court have cascaded into unexpected places and split one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.Many employees also viewed it as a statement: Mr. Kaplan believed Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s side of the story rather than Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony. That felt especially hurtful to Facebook employees who were also sexual assault survivors, many of whom began sharing their own #MeToo stories internally.\u201cOur leadership team recognizes that they\u2019ve made mistakes handling the events of the last week and we\u2019re grateful for all the feedback from our employees,\u201d Roberta Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Thursday.Tweets about Mr. Kaplan at the hearing immediately began circulating among Facebook message boards such as \u201cWomen @ Facebook,\u201d a communications chat room called \u201cJust Flagging,\u201d and a group called \u201cWait, what?\u201d where employees can ask public relations questions. Many employees had one query: Why was Mr. Kaplan there, front and center?\u201cLet\u2019s assume for a minute that our VP of Policy understands how senate hearings work,\u201d one program manager said in a post about Mr. Kaplan that was reviewed by The Times. \u201cHis seat choice was intentional, knowing full well that journalists would identify every public figure appearing behind Kavanaugh. He knew that this would cause outrage internally, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t get fired for it. This was a protest against our culture, and a slap in the face to his fellow employees.\u201d\u201cYes, Joel, we see you,\u201d the employee added.Facebook executives knew they had a serious problem on their hands, said the current and former employees. That led to last Friday\u2019s apology from Mr. Kaplan, a former Marine who once clerked for two conservative justices.In the note addressed to his policy group, Mr. Kaplan wrote, \u201cI have known Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh for 20 years. They are my and my wife Laura\u2019s closest friends in D.C. I was in their wedding; he was in ours. Our kids have grown up together.\u201d\u201cI believe in standing by your friends, especially when times are tough for them,\u201d Mr. Kaplan added in a later post.He also said, \u201cLaura and I felt it was important to be with them at the hearing to express our love and support for our friends during a very difficult time for all involved. I took a personal day to be there.\u201dSome Facebook employees noted that according to the company\u2019s internal human resources software, Mr. Kaplan had not taken a personal day to attend the hearing. Only later last Thursday did someone at Facebook update the system to say Mr. Kaplan had taken a personal day, said the current and former employees.At last Friday\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg defended Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance as a personal decision that did not violate company rules. Mr. Zuckerberg also said he trusted Mr. Kaplan\u2019s judgment, even though he himself would most likely not have chosen to attend the hearing, said two people who were at the meeting.The messaging backfired. Some employees \u2014 particularly women \u2014 said it came across as if Mr. Zuckerberg was shrugging off Dr. Blasey\u2019s comments about sexual assault, saying that the chief executive\u2019s remarks had caused \u201cstress and trauma\u201d and were \u201cpainful to hear.\u201dMany female employees were also upset that Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, who has made women\u2019s issues a personal platform and project, did not publicly say something about Dr. Blasey and sexual assault. Mr. Kaplan is known as a friend of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s, with the two having gotten acquainted at Harvard, which both attended.Ms. Sandberg posted internally last Friday, writing, \u201cAs a woman and someone who cares so deeply about how women are treated, the Kavanaugh issue is deeply upsetting to me.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Joel about why I think it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in the company.\u201dIn one internal Facebook group that is aimed at supporting female employees, dozens of women this week posted accounts of their own struggles with sexual assault. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s attendance at the hearing made them uncomfortable, they wrote, according to posts reviewed by The Times. Several said they would not feel comfortable working in the Washington office under Mr. Kaplan.Other employees began criticizing Mr. Zuckerberg directly in recent days.\u201cI appreciate your desire to avoid taking sides, but please don\u2019t insult our intelligence by declaring that this act did not violate our policies, or that it was only an honest lapse in judgement,\u201d one engineer wrote in a post addressed to the chief executive. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell us that you know how hard it is for us when it is very clear from your words, your actions and your tone that you don\u2019t.\u201dOn Wednesday, Mr. Bosworth, a 13-year veteran of Facebook and close friend of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s, weighed in in an internal post.\u201cIf you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand,\u201d Mr. Bosworth wrote. \u201cWe will support you with any path you choose. But it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201dMr. Bosworth backpedaled after facing opposition \u2014 including from Lori Goler, Facebook\u2019s head of human resources \u2014 who said he was dismissing legitimate employee concerns, said the current and former employees. On Thursday afternoon, he posted, \u201cI spoke at a time when I should be listening and that was a big mistake. I\u2019m grateful to employees who shared feedback and very sorry that my actions caused employees pain and frustration when what they needed was better support and understanding from leadership.\u201dBy that point, it was clear the tensions were not fading. Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer and the sponsor of the group \u201cWomen @ Facebook,\u201d scheduled a meeting on Friday to deal with staff concerns. Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Kaplan are all expected to attend to field questions, said the current and former employees.Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catholic Clergy Should Elect Its Own Bishops", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe clergymen of the U.S. can show our fellow Americans that the Roman Catholic Church is much more than the Roman Curia. Mr. Burns is an associate professor of politics at the University of Dallas and a fellow at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Institute for Human Ecology.The recent revelations of corruption, abuse and neglect within the Catholic Church hierarchy have been a trial for every American Catholic. Abuse victims and their families have suffered unspeakably. Next to them, the greatest sufferers have surely been our innocent American clergymen, who bear the brunt of the shame, contempt, and anger directed at the church every day.A great majority of our clergymen share our outrage at clerical abuse. Priests all suffer for the sins of their brothers. Married deacons see their own children and grandchildren in the faces of the victims.To Catholics, our American clergy is an essential link in a living chain of witnesses stretching back to the Apostles. Nearly all of us have had our faith shaped by at least one priest or deacon who showed us what it means to live the Gospel. Today we are experiencing a crisis of trust in our bishops. It is not, as far as I can see, a crisis of trust in the majority of our clergymen.The clergy is therefore in a position to restore our trust in the bishops. But first it would have to have a say in who those bishops are.My faith as a Catholic requires unity with the bishop of Rome. My faith has nothing to do with the workings of the 21st-century Roman bureaucracy, of which I was blissfully ignorant until last month. Now Americans have been shown a small sample of the backbiting, sycophantism, self-dealing and rank corruption within this Renaissance court.What would happen to any American clergyman who tried to run a parish the way these men run the Holy See? I know good and holy men who work for the Curia. I hope they will forgive me for saying that they do not appear to be setting the tone these days. Too many curial officials appear to embody everything that anti-Catholic prejudices have long taught many of our fellow Americans to fear.But the priests and deacons of this country can remind our fellow citizens that the Roman Catholic Church is much more than the Roman Curia. They can seize the initiative before political or legal pressure forces some more painful and destructive set of reforms. They can reclaim their rightful share in our church\u2019s governance.Our American priests and deacons should be picking their own bishops. If they think so, too, then they should tell our current bishops, who can regain some credibility by demanding this of Rome. When each incumbent bishop reaches retirement, his own clergy can elect his successor. West Virginia and Washington, D.C., would be great places to begin immediately.Rome will of course always retain the right to veto our clergy\u2019s choice. But the American laity deserve to know who that choice was. And if Rome does veto, we will want to know why.Those who make decisions in our church should have to live with their consequences. Our clergymen are more or less stuck in their own diocese. They know that their own life\u2019s happiness will always be tied to their local church\u2019s well-being. The same was true of bishops throughout much of Catholic history. It ought to be more true today. The temptations to ambition and careerism are simply too great under the current system. At worst, a serial predator enjoys repeated fresh starts in new surroundings while his successors clean up the wreckage. At best, even a good man flown into a new diocese is tempted to feel that the messes he inherits are not his problem and that the messes he leaves behind will be someone else\u2019s.If our bishops need to be diocesan C.E.O.s adept at risk management, so be it. But surely an entire diocese can produce one C.E.O. with the heart of a pastor. And who would know best where to find such a man: our own clergy or the Roman courtiers who elevated Archbishop McCarrick?We have now seen that bishops who see themselves as an elite class above their brother clergymen will always seek to point the finger of accountability at anyone but themselves. Someone needs to find us shepherds who smell more like the sheep. Our clergymen know that smell. If they cannot reform the ranks of our chief shepherds, it is inexcusably na\u00efve to expect that Rome will.These calls for reform in church governance structures have gone unheard in our country. Now the time is ripe and the reform is overdue. It will happen only when the clergy and laity alike demand it. If bishops should be pastors, let pastors choose our bishops.Daniel E.

That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association. FedEx said it wasn\u2019t a response to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, but because the partnership didn\u2019t bring in enough business.The company had faced pressure from gun-control activists to end the program, in particular after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February. At the time, companies including Delta, United Airlines, MetLife and several car-rental outlets dropped deals with the N.R.A.But FedEx had refused to do so.

A couple years ago, my son asked me why homeless people were called \u201chomeless,\u201d when they had tent homes on the sidewalk. We had to have a conversation about how that wasn\u2019t normal, and how people would probably prefer to live inside, especially when it rains and is very cold.

They can never be gunned down.Ms. Weiss is a writer and editor in the Opinion section.On a Saturday morning in March of 1997 I became a bat mitzvah at Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill.I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. The previous October a fire had blazed through my family\u2019s regular synagogue, Beth Shalom, less than a mile away.Anyone who is from Squirrel Hill, or has ever spent time in the place where I was lucky to be raised, will not be surprised to know how the community responded to this disaster.Squirrel Hill, Mr. Rogers\u2019 real-world neighborhood, is full of such people. His home was three blocks from Tree of Life.He isn\u2019t the only one. Mike Tomlin, the coach of the Steelers, lives nine doors away. Rich Fitzgerald, the county executive, a few doors farther. The mayor lives five blocks away. I grew up down the street from the synagogue.But 11 of our neighbors were killed. We are waiting to hear their names. My family will certainly know most if not all of them.My parents, my sisters and my aunts and uncles will attend many funerals this week. That\u2019s because Squirrel Hill functions like an urban shtetl.In most American cities, Jews tend to live in the suburbs. Not so in Pittsburgh, where more than half of the Jewish community still lives in the city, mainly in Squirrel Hill. And unlike in other urban centers, like Los Angeles or New York, Pittsburgh\u2019s Jewish community is small enough that we don\u2019t stay in our religious and political lanes.

Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201dThe heartbreaking coincidence is that the Jewish emphasis on the open door, on welcoming the stranger, is exactly what the Jews of Tree of Life and the Jews of every synagogue big and small in every far-flung corner of the globe were reading about this Shabbat morning.They were reading from the chapters of Genesis we refer to as Vayera. The Torah portion opens on Judaism\u2019s founding father and mother: Abraham and Sarah. Three men show up to their tent \u2014 strangers \u2014 and the couple welcomes them: feeding them, giving them shade and washing their feet.These strangers come with a shocking message: Sarah, then the ripe age of 90, will bear a child.Sarah laughs, incredulous. But she soon gives birth to Isaac. And the strangers, tradition teaches us, are not strangers at all, but angels in disguise.Every Jewish community in America will now have to make sensible decisions about how to ensure that they are not the next victims of such a crime. But those hard choices should not make us forget the core values that make communities like Squirrel Hill what they are: welcoming, big-hearted and profoundly decent. One of the gifts of the Jewish experience in America is that because we have been so welcomed and so safe here, these values have been able to flourish.Just as every Jewish couple gets married under a canopy open on all four sides \u2014 a replica of the tent modeled for us by Abraham and Sarah \u2014 so must Jewish communities keep our tents open. This is the true source of our longevity and resilience.Now the Jews of Pittsburgh join the growing list of communities around the world that have been terrorized by anti-Semitic fanatics, from Kansas City to Brussels to Mumbai to Jerusalem. The heartbreak is indescribable.But Squirrel Hill, I am certain, will continue to live by the values that the Jews have sustained for more than 2,000 years. They can never be gunned down.Advertisement"}

The documentary is airing in four-hour blocs over the next five Tuesdays, although the order of the shorts doesn\u2019t appear to have any real impact; dip in or out as desired. Some of the films are quite specific \u2014 say, the saga of the 1978 Portland Trailblazers \u2014 and others more broad, like musings on the nature of coaching.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Instagram, 11,696 Examples of How Hate Thrives on Social Media", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Monday, a search on Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook, produced a torrent of anti-Semitic images and videos uploaded in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.A search for the word \u201cJews\u201d displayed 11,696 posts with the hashtag \u201c#jewsdid911,\u201d claiming that Jews had orchestrated the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Other hashtags on Instagram referenced Nazi ideology, including the number 88, an abbreviation used for the Nazi salute \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201dThe Instagram posts demonstrated a stark reality. Over the last 10 years, Silicon Valley\u2019s social media companies have expanded their reach and influence to the furthest corners of the world. But it has become glaringly apparent that the companies never quite understood the negative consequences of that influence nor what to do about it \u2014 and that they cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\u201cSocial media is emboldening people to cross the line and push the envelope on what they are willing to say to provoke and to incite,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \u201cThe problem is clearly expanding.\u201d\u201cSocial media companies have created, allowed and enabled extremists to move their message from the margins to the mainstream,\u201d said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organization that combats hate speech. \u201cIn the past, they couldn\u2019t find audiences for their poison. Now, with a click or a post or a tweet, they can spread their ideas with a velocity we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dFacebook said it was investigating the anti-Semitic hashtags on Instagram after The New York Times flagged them. Sarah Pollack, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement that Instagram was seeing new posts related to the shooting on Saturday and that it was \u201cactively reviewing hashtags and content related to these events and removing content that violates our policies.\u201dYouTube said it has strict policies prohibiting content that promotes hatred or incites violence and added that it takes down videos that violate those rules.Social media companies have said that identifying and removing hate speech and disinformation \u2014 or even defining what constitutes such content \u2014 is difficult. Facebook said this year that only 38 percent of hate speech on its site was flagged by its internal systems. In contrast, its systems pinpointed and took down 96 percent of what it defined as adult nudity, and 99.5 percent of terrorist content.YouTube said users reported nearly 10 million videos from April to June for potentially violating its community guidelines. Just under one million of those videos were found to have broken the rules and were removed, according to the company\u2019s data. YouTube\u2019s automated detection tools also took down an additional 6.8 million videos in that period.But even as the companies throw money and resources at the problems, some of their employees said on Monday that they were rethinking whether the social media services could have a positive effect.At Twitter, for example, employees are increasingly concerned that the company is floundering in its treatment of toxic language and hate speech, said four current and former employees who asked for anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements.Twitter did not address questions about its employee concerns on Monday, but said it needed to be \u201cthoughtful and considered\u201d in its policies.\u201cProgress in this space is tough but we\u2019ve never been as committed and as focused in our efforts,\u201d Twitter said. \u201cServing public conversation and trying to make it healthier is our singular mission here.\u201dInstagram, which was created as a site for people to share curated photos of their food, adorable pets and cute children, has largely avoided scrutiny over disinformation and hate content \u2014 especially when compared with its parent, Facebook. But social media researchers said that the site had over the last year become more of a hotbed for hateful posts and videos meant to provoke discord.That was evident after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, with the mushrooming of new anti-Semitic content on the site. On Sunday, one new video added to Instagram claimed that the state of Israel was created by the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish family. Underneath the video, the hashtags read #conspiracy and #jewworldorder.By late Monday, it had been viewed more than 1,640 times and shared to other social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook.Advertisement"}

But the Trump E.P.A. keeps propping up coal. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The worst impacts can be avoided only by a \u201cfar-reaching and unprecedented\u201d transformation of the global energy system, including virtually eliminating the use of coal as a source of electricity, the panel warned. Yet President Trump, who has questioned the accepted scientific consensus on climate change, continues to praise \u201cclean beautiful coal\u201d and has directed his Environmental Protection Agency to reverse major strides undertaken by the Obama administration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. This is unbelievably reckless. In addition to undermining the fight against climate change, the president's efforts to prop up the dirtiest of all fuels will also exact a significant toll on public health, on the hearts and lungs of ordinary Americans.The Wheeler proposal would disallow any calculation of these side benefits and allow only those associated with the regulated pollutant. Mr. Wheeler promises that existing mercury emissions limits will remain in place. He also acknowledges that industry has already invested billions of dollars on new technology to comply with the mercury rule, and that many companies have done so. But weakening the foundation on which that rule was promulgated could invite lawsuits to overturn it entirely, and \u2014 even more ominously \u2014 could make it easier for the Trump administration or a like-minded one to ignore important ancillary public health benefits when devising other environmental regulations in the future. Nobody really expected a new policy direction from Mr. Wheeler, who was once consigliere to Senator James Inhofe, Congress\u2019s most outspoken climate change denier. But in Mr. Wheeler\u2019s insistence on a narrow, even cramped, reading of the nation\u2019s landmark environmental laws, he is ignoring science and threatening the public health and welfare.Advertisement"}

In the real world, such is not the case. Despite everything we know about the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, women are still not believed. Their experiences are still minimized. And the male perpetrators of these crimes are given all manner of leniency.And those are essays in publications I once held in high regard. Even more impoverished accounts have been published elsewhere, men writing about how their lives have been derailed with no clear understanding of the lives they have derailed with their actions.Starkly lacking in these accounts is any accountability or genuine recognition of the wrong done. They display entitlement and rage and contempt for being seen for who they truly are. The people who publish such pieces treat the perpetrators of sexual misconduct as intellectual curiosities. They reserve their empathy for these broken men, for themselves, rather than for women because, as a culture, we expect women to suffer. We gild women\u2019s suffering with both inevitability and nobility. Time and again women splay themselves. Women share their painful stories. The world remains largely indifferent.In his statements to the committee, Judge Kavanaugh said that the allegations against him had ruined his life even though he may well be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. Mr. Hockenberry and Mr. Ghomeshi also lament how their lives have been ruined. The bar for a man\u2019s ruin is, apparently, quite low. May we all be so lucky as to have our lives so ruined.History is once more repeating itself and will continue to do so until we, as a culture, begin not only to believe women but also to value women enough to consider harming them unacceptable, unthinkable.Advertisement"}

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\u201cBy the end of this weekend,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI will have walked my daughter down the aisle and we will have a new Supreme Court justice.\u201dBut late Friday, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said that she would be recorded as \u201cpresent\u201d rather than \u201cno\u201d during Saturday\u2019s vote as a courtesy to Mr. Daines, making his vote unnecessary if no other senators change their vote from cloture.But in a sign of how cautiously Republicans were approaching the next 24 hours, a spokesman for Mr. Daines confirmed on Friday afternoon that he would be monitoring the vote over the weekend, and would remain at the ready in case his vote was needed.In a call late Thursday night at his desk in Washington, Mr. Daines, who has supported Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination from the beginning, personally told the judge that if it is necessary, he would not refuse the request to travel for the vote on the day of his daughter\u2019s wedding. Even if he was not needed, he had indicated he wanted to cast his vote.In order for Mr. Daines to do so, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, would have to hold the floor vote open \u2014 potentially for several hours \u2014 to allow Mr. Daines to fly back to the Capitol and cast his vote late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.That task may be made easier thanks to Representative Greg Gianforte, also a Republican of Montana and one of the wealthiest members of Congress, who had offered up his private jet to whisk Mr. Daines away from the wedding and to Washington.\u201cIf Greg\u2019s good friend, Steve Daines, can participate in his daughter\u2019s wedding and ensure Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, Greg is happy to help for the sake of family and country,\u201d Travis Hall, a spokesman for Mr. Gianforte, said in a statement. (Mr. Gianforte and his wife were invited to the wedding and hope to attend, but they have a conflict of their own: He has a debate scheduled that day against the Democrat hoping to unseat him next month.)Ms. Daines, 27, a graduate of her father\u2019s alma mater, Montana State University, frequently makes cameos on her father\u2019s social media, appearing in campaign ads, alongside him at Washington events, and at home on their ranch, hunting and riding horses.She will wed Brad Moss at Manhattan Christian Reformed Church, according to an announcement on the bridal website The Knot, in a 120-year-old building once described as \u201cthe largest rural church west of the Mississippi River.\u201dMr. Moss is the founder of Shop Dog Industries, a company based in Bozeman, Mont., that creates agriculture machinery implements.

Other people\u2019s screens got clearer and brighter, from a wider range of angles: flat on a desk; held low, for a glance during dinner; held out for a group to see; and of course, spied over a shoulder, on the way to work.Vic and Cas, who, disarmingly, \u201ccould both be you or anyone else\u201d are shown as stick figures to help participants respond to prompts like: \u201cDo you know of a **real** situation in which this happened?\u201d and \u201cWhat exactly could Vic see on the screen (e.g. text, pictures, passwords/PINs, maps, videos, apps, games, etc.)?\u201dOther people also do not enjoy being asked about other people\u2019s screens, in my experience, in part because they know what they\u2019ve seen, and that they probably shouldn\u2019t have seen it. (Fellow journalists seem somewhat less conflicted about catching a glimpse of a screen on the subway or a bus.) It\u2019s a global phenomenon, of course, but stories abound in New York, the American capital of other people\u2019s screens. On the subway, and on the bus, other people\u2019s screens join distinguished company: ads, the floor, the covers of books, and \u2014 a closer relation \u2014 accidental eye contact. Other people\u2019s screens on the subway were, until recently, glimpses of an archive: there was little access to cell service, or Wi-Fi. That was a more leisurely era, on other people\u2019s screens; the Candy Crush years, the reading-in-apps years, the phone-as-book-or-magazine years, and the tiny television years. Other people\u2019s screens found the fabled end-of-the-feed, at least for the duration of an underground commute. Then came the signal, and with it everything else. In 2018, other people\u2019s screens are habitually, frantically refreshed. Other people\u2019s screens are works in progress: they are tense and short texts with no context, typed and retyped, and then, for those underground, sent at the next stop; they are extraordinarily long messages, exchanges of lengths I was not aware were possible on a phone, from which one instantly turns away in shame after spotting the word \u201cdivorce;\u201d they are selfies getting touched up, and then discarded; they are seemingly infinite group message chains full of religious affirmations; they are work emails with a lot of talk about clients, and the client, and our client, because the train is a place of work now, just like the office, just like the home. Other people\u2019s screens may also be a brief historical aberration. Phones now unlock by scanning their owners\u2019 faces, and, separately, can tell if you\u2019re smiling in a photo; it is not much of a jump that they could tell when other people are watching, too, on a train or elsewhere. More broadly, it may just seem strange, someday, according to a few conceivable futures, that other people\u2019s screens were in their hands for a while, out in the world, instead of in front of their eyes, or attached to their brains.

{"Headline": "Google Plus Will Be Shut Down After User Information Was Exposed", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it would shut down Google Plus, the company\u2019s long-struggling answer to Facebook\u2019s giant social network, after it discovered a security vulnerability that exposed the private data of up to 500,000 users.The decision to stay quiet, which raised eyebrows in the cybersecurity community, comes against the backdrop of relatively new rules in California and Europe that govern when a company must disclose a security episode.Up to 438 applications made by other companies may have had access to the vulnerability through coding links called application programming interfaces. Those outside developers could have seen user names, email addresses, occupation, gender and age. They did not have access to phone numbers, messages, Google Plus posts or data from other Google accounts, the company said.Google said it had found no evidence that outside developers were aware of the security flaw and no indication that any user profiles were touched. The flaw was fixed in an update made in March.Google looked at the \u201ctype of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance,\u201d Ben Smith, a Google vice president for engineering, wrote in the blog post.The disclosure made on Monday could receive additional scrutiny because of a memo to senior executives reportedly prepared by Google\u2019s policy and legal teams that warned of embarrassment for the company \u2014 similar to what happened to Facebook this year \u2014 if it went public with the vulnerability.In May, Europe adopted new General Data Protection Regulation laws that require companies to notify regulators of a potential leak of personal information within 72 hours. Google\u2019s security issue occurred in March, before the new rules went into effect.California recently passed a privacy law, which goes into effect in 2020, allowing consumers in the event of a data breach to sue for up to $750 for each violation. It also gives the state\u2019s attorney general the right to go after companies for intentional violations of privacy.Steven Andr\u00e9s, a professor who lectures about management information systems at San Diego State University, said there was no obvious legal requirement for Google to disclose the vulnerability. But he added that it was troubling \u2014 though unsurprising \u2014 to see that the company was discussing how reporting the vulnerability might look to regulators.There is no federal law requiring companies to disclose a security vulnerability. Companies must wade through a patchwork of state laws with different standards.Just last month, Google was criticized for not sending Mr. Pichai to a hearing attended by top executives from Facebook and Twitter.Introduced in 2011, Google Plus was meant to be a Facebook competitor that linked users to various Google products, including its search engine and YouTube. But other than a few loyal users, it did not catch on. By 2018, it was an afterthought.Google would not say how many people now frequent Google Plus, but it said in the blog post that the service had low usage \u2014 90 percent of users\u2019 sessions are less than five seconds long.When Google\u2019s engineers discovered the vulnerability, they concluded that the work required to maintain Google Plus was not worth the effort, considering the meager use of the product, the company said.Google said it planned to turn off the consumer version of Google Plus in August 2019, though a version built for corporate customers will still exist.The failure of Google Plus has relieved Google of some pressure on issues faced by Facebook and Twitter, particularly Russian disinformation efforts.When Google announced in August that it had deleted accounts suspected of ties to Iranian influence campaigns, the company disclosed that it had deleted 13 Google Plus accounts \u2014 compared to 652 accounts that Facebook had deleted for the same concerns.Advertisement"}

It was like a crossword, except that instead of clues, every answer was alphabetized by length, presented as a word bank. I was so fascinated by this display of interlocking words, and although I didn\u2019t know what 75 percent of them meant, I was able to fill the grid successfully. I loved the experience so much, and still remember parts of the puzzle today! Thus began an obsession with crossword-style grids that has lasted 17 years and counting.Not only did I enjoy solving Fill-It-In puzzles throughout elementary school, but I was always intrigued by their construction, so there was never a real transition between being a constructor versus a solver. On long car rides, I would draw up grids in crayon, and they were half-decent; \u201chalf-decent\u201d in the sense that maybe half my answers were acceptable for current standards. Because it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m good at.I use CrossFire on my Mac, Crossword Compiler on my PC, and Crossword Maker for Cruciverbalists on my iPhone. That sounds like a lot, but I only use them so as not to do anything by hand.Zero. All my filling is done manually by querying databases using strings of known and unknown letter patterns. I enjoy this approach to construction as it allows me to get creative when no results are returned, and the increased challenge of pulling off a wide-open grid is so exciting. If it\u2019s not real, it\u2019s not going in my puzzle. OON and INI are common suffixes? People say E-MAG? \u201cThe three R\u2019s\u201d is the same thing as RRR? Come on, now.Advertisement"}

Mr. Nesbit is the author of the new book, \u201cThis is the Way the World Ends.\u201dAs climate change begins to make water scarcity a critical security issue globally, wealthier countries have begun to look outside their borders to meet their water needs. In moves that have important trade and geopolitical implications, Saudi Arabia and China have come to America to help solve their water problems and feed their people.The country, rich from its vast oil deposits, has one of the world\u2019s smallest water reserves. Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t have a single lake or river. For thousands of years, the Saudis have depended on wells or the occasional oasis. Infrequent rainfalls replenish shallow aquifers 150 feet or so underground. Wells dug ten times as deep as those shallow aquifers tap into reserves not renewed by rainfall. Once used up, they\u2019re gone.But it wasn\u2019t enough. So they turned to the United States and other places rich in water.And water is becoming more precious in some regions of China.

{"Headline": "Cats v. Rats? In New York, the Rats Win", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a NumberAt a recycling plant in Brooklyn, fat, stealthy rats were more than a match for feral cats, scientists found. But New Zealand rats weigh an average of 150 grams, or about five ounces, whereas rats in the most recent experiment in New York were more than twice as large. Bulk, it turns out, is an obstacle for cats who might otherwise dine on city rats.It was not easy for the scientists to find a place to do their research. The lead author, Michael H. Parsons, a research biologist at Fordham University, said property owners generally want their rats killed, not caught and then released for study. But the team did eventually find a recycling plant in Brooklyn whose staff members were willing to let the rat detectives do their work.Dr. Parsons and his colleagues began with another aim: tracking the rodents\u2019 activity at the plant and their reactions to various scents. The scientists captured and anesthetized 37 rats, inserted radio frequency identification tags under the skin of each, and then released them into their colony. But while the researchers were watching these rats, five feral cats took up residence at the plant, so the team seized the opportunity to study them, too.Dr. Parsons used motion-sensitive video cameras to record cat behaviors in the presence of rats \u2014 walking, running, stalking, chasing, feeding and so on. They made 306 videos over almost three months.All the cats stalked rats, but over the entire period only two cats even dared to chase and attack a rat. Each made just one kill. Apparently New York rats are not only large and bold, but smart and stealthy. In any case, the researchers concluded, cats \u2014 despite their reputation as rodent killers \u2014 are utterly ineffective in controlling urban rat populations.\u201cA lot of people confuse rats with mice,\u201d Dr. Parsons said. \u201cSo they\u2019ve seen their cat bring back a mouse, and assume their cat is a rat killer. It\u2019s not.\u201dPredation, by cats or any other animal, will not reduce the rat population, Dr. Parsons said. Only cleaning up the garbage \u2014 the rats\u2019 food \u2014 will do that.\u201cRats have a high reproductive rate, and if there\u2019s rubbish around, you\u2019ll have rats no matter what you do,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Miscarrying at Work: The Physical Toll of Pregnancy Discrimination", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "In 2014, while Chasisty Bee was pregnant, her supervisors at the Verizon warehouse in Memphis refused to grant her request for light duty. One day, she collapsed at work. She later miscarried.Women in strenuous jobs lost their pregnancies after employers denied their requests for light duty, even ignoring doctors\u2019 notes, an investigation by The New York Times has found.MEMPHIS \u2014 If you are a Verizon customer on the East Coast, odds are good that your cellphone or tablet arrived by way of a beige, windowless warehouse near Tennessee\u2019s border with Mississippi.Inside, hundreds of workers, many of them women, lift and drag boxes weighing up to 45 pounds, filled with iPhones and other gadgets. There is no air-conditioning on the floor of the warehouse, which is owned and operated by a contractor. Temperatures there can rise past 100 degrees. Workers often faint, according to interviews with 20 current and former employees.One evening in January 2014, after eight hours of lifting, Erica Hayes ran to the bathroom. Blood drenched her jeans.She was 23 and in the second trimester of her first pregnancy. She had spent much of the week hoisting the warehouse\u2019s largest boxes from one conveyor belt to the next. Ever since she learned she was pregnant, she had been begging her supervisor to let her work with lighter boxes, she said in an interview. She said her boss repeatedly said no.She fainted on her way out of the bathroom that day. The baby growing inside of her, the one she had secretly hoped was a girl, was gone.\u201cIt was the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life,\u201d Ms. Hayes said.Three other women in the warehouse also had miscarriages in 2014, when it was owned by a contractor called New Breed Logistics. Later that year, a larger company, XPO Logistics, bought New Breed and the warehouse. The problems continued. Another woman miscarried there this summer. Then, in August, Ceeadria Walker did, too.The women had all asked for light duty. Three said they brought in doctors\u2019 notes recommending less taxing workloads and shorter shifts. They said supervisors disregarded the letters.The New York Times reviewed thousands of pages of court and other public records involving workers who said they had suffered miscarriages, gone into premature labor or, in one case, had a stillborn baby after their employers rejected their pleas for assistance \u2014 a break from flipping heavy mattresses, lugging large boxes and pushing loaded carts.They worked at a hospital, a post office, an airport, a grocery store, a prison, a fire department, a restaurant, a pharmaceutical company and several hotels.But refusing to accommodate pregnant women is often completely legal. Under federal law, companies don\u2019t necessarily have to adjust pregnant women\u2019s jobs, even when lighter work is available and their doctors send letters urging a reprieve.That means that companies that do not give anyone a break have no obligation to do so for pregnant women. Employees say that is how the warehouse\u2019s current owner, XPO Logistics, operates.If companies \u201ctreat their nonpregnant employees terribly, they have every right to treat their pregnant employees terribly as well,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who has pushed for stronger federal protections for expecting mothers.In every congressional session since 2012, a group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would do for pregnant women what the Americans With Disabilities Act does for disabled people: require employers to accommodate those whose health depends on it. The legislation has never had a hearing.\u201cWe are deeply troubled by these allegations,\u201d said a Verizon spokesman, Rich Young. \u201cWe have no tolerance \u2014 zero tolerance \u2014 for this sort of alleged behavior.\u201d He said the company opened an internal investigation in response to The Times\u2019s inquiry. \u201cNone of these allegations are consistent with our values or the expectations and demands of contractors that work directly for us or have any affiliation with us.\u201dErin Kurtz, an XPO spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe\u2019re surprised by the allegations of conduct that either predate XPO\u2019s acquisition of the Memphis facility or weren\u2019t reported to management after we acquired it in 2014.\u201d She said the allegations \u201care unsubstantiated, filled with inaccuracies and do not reflect the way in which our Memphis facility operates.\u201d The company also disputed that the warehouse was windowless, noting that there were a number of interior windows.Ms. Kurtz said XPO prioritized the safety of its workers, had \u201cno tolerance for any type of discriminatory behavior\u201d and has enhanced pay and benefits for employees in recent years.Those improvements didn\u2019t help Ceeadria Walker when she got pregnant. The 19-year-old said she gave her XPO supervisor a doctor\u2019s letter from OB/GYN Centers of Memphis saying she should not lift more than 15 pounds. She said she asked to be assigned to an area with lighter items. Ms. Walker said her supervisor regularly sent her to a conveyor belt line where she had to lift more than she was supposed to. She miscarried the day after spending her shift handling those heavier boxes.A pregnant Ceeadria Walker continued lifting heavy boxes at XPO after being denied a reprieve. The day after a grueling shift in August, she miscarried.\u201cWe\u2019re saddened that Ms. Walker had a miscarriage over the summer,\u201d Ms. Kurtz said. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating these newly raised claims.\u201dFor most women, it is safe to work while pregnant.Two decades of medical research have established a link between physically demanding work and fetal death, though there is debate about how strong the connection is. Part of the difficulty in measuring the relationship, researchers say, is that it\u2019s impossible to design a study that isolates the impact of heavy lifting versus other risk factors, like pre-existing conditions.Another possibility, doctors said, is that extreme physical exertion diverts blood from a woman\u2019s womb to her muscles.The potential dangers are greatest for women whose pregnancies are already classified as high risk, which is why doctors often advise that they be given easier tasks.\u201cWhen employers ignore these medical recommendations, they are potentially jeopardizing patients\u2019 health,\u201d said Rebecca Jackson, the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at San Francisco General Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s especially bothersome to me that this is occurring for women in strenuous jobs, given that they are at the most risk of injuring themselves or the pregnancy.\u201dWarehouses are among the fastest growing workplaces in the country, employing more than a million Americans. Retailers, competing against the likes of Amazon, demand high speed at low costs.On Memphis\u2019s east side, these are often the highest-paying jobs available for people without college degrees. Drawn by the proximity to rail lines and highways, some of the country\u2019s largest companies have set up distribution centers here. One dispatches Nike shoes. Another handles Disney toys. And a short drive from Graceland, Verizon has its hub.XPO runs all of those warehouses. The Verizon facility, which XPO took over when it bought New Breed Logistics in 2014, is the only one where The Times interviewed workers about pregnancy discrimination. Shifts there can last 12 hours. Workers get 30 minutes for lunch and as many as three other 15-minute breaks.XPO\u2019s 2017 employee handbook warns that taking unapproved breaks, arriving to work late or leaving early can result in \u201cimmediate termination,\u201d unless the reasons for the departures are \u201clegally protected.\u201d The Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not guarantee women such protections.It was the fall of 2013, and Erica Hayes was convinced that she was having a girl. She daydreamed about the clothes she would buy and made a list of favorite names. Her friend was pregnant with a boy, and they talked about raising their children together.At first, Ms. Hayes was processing individual shipments to Verizon customers \u2014 one phone, one charger, onto the next. Then, a crush of holiday orders hit the warehouse in December. She said that her boss began dispatching her to the area of the warehouse that handled bulk shipments, often destined for Verizon stores, where the warehouse was struggling to keep up. She often spent up to 12 hours a day lifting huge boxes, some with 20 iPads and 20 accessories.She said she could have handled paperwork or stayed in the section of the warehouse devoted to small shipments. But she said her supervisor kept ordering her to work with the largest boxes. Ms. Hayes\u2019s mother said that her daughter talked to her about the rejected requests at the time.Ms. Hayes said she began to bleed regularly at work. She sometimes left early to go to the hospital. Each time, she said, her supervisor wrote her up. As the demerits accumulated, she stopped leaving. Instead, she bled through four maxi pads a day.\u201cMy job was on the line,\u201d she said. At the end of a long shift in January 2014, she felt blood gushing into her jeans.A co-worker fetched her a black peacoat to wrap around her waist to cover the spreading stain. Another grabbed plastic bags to line the leather driver\u2019s seat of her 2003 Hyundai. Ms. Hayes fainted before she could get to the car. An ambulance took her to the hospital.A couple of weeks later, she said, her supervisor handed her a $300 invoice for the cost of the ambulance ride. (Ms. Hayes, who still works at the warehouse and is hoping for a promotion, said she never paid the bill.)That spring, two more women had miscarriages at the warehouse. Both said that their supervisors rejected their requests to pack lighter boxes.One of the women, who still works at the warehouse, declined to be identified for fear of losing her job.The other was Tasha Murrell. She already had two boys and was praying for a girl. She planned to name the baby Dallas, after the Cowboys, her favorite football team. Ms. Murrell said that she told her boss she was pregnant and asked to leave work early one day that spring because the lifting had become painful.While employed at the Verizon warehouse in 2014, Tasha Murrell, pregnant at the time, told a supervisor she was in pain and asked to leave early; the manager said no. Ms. Murrell miscarried the next day.Ms. Murrell\u2019s husband keeps the ultrasound from the pregnancy she lost in his wallet. It has become deeply creased from being in his wallet.Her supervisor told her to get an abortion, according to a discrimination complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2018. Ms. Murrell woke up the next morning to find her mattress stained with blood. Her husband drove her to the emergency room, where doctors told her she had miscarried. Ms. Murrell left the job last year and is now an organizer with the Teamsters, which is trying to organize a union at the warehouse.Ms. Bukvic said that she made sure that the pregnant women whom she managed had workloads that were not excessive. She said she never denied help to the pregnant employees. \u201cIf they had any work restrictions, I always took all steps to make sure their work duties never exceeded those restrictions,\u201d she said.A few months later, in September 2014, it happened to another woman.Chasisty Bee, 33, was four months pregnant. Hoping for a girl, she bought a newborn\u2019s blanket from Burlington Coat Factory.Ms. Bee had miscarried in 2008 while working at the Verizon warehouse. This time, she said, she brought in a doctor\u2019s note recommending that she work shorter shifts, be given a chair and light duty. Supervisors rejected her requests. One afternoon, after almost 14 hours on her feet, she started feeling dizzy and crumpled to the warehouse floor. Her physician told her that she had miscarried.After Ms. Bee got pregnant again in 2015, she found a new job. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to lose another child,\u201d she said. The next February, she gave birth to a healthy girl.Ms. Kurtz, the XPO spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe false and misleading allegations directed at our Memphis facility are fueled by the Teamsters and are part of their ongoing, but unsuccessful, attempts at organizing.\u201dA bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed upgrading the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The bill would compel companies to accommodate pregnant women \u2014 for example, by offering extra breaks or the option of light duty \u2014 as long as it does not impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on their business. That is the same language used in the Americans With Disabilities Act.Women \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between keeping a doctor appointment or their job,\u201d said Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, one of 125 co-sponsors of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in the House and Senate.But some Republicans, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, where the XPO warehouse is, viewed that bill as adding a confusing new layer of regulations, according to Senate aides. Mr. Alexander, who is chairman of the Senate committee on health and labor, co-sponsored a competing bill. It expanded protections for pregnant women in some cases. But it still allowed employers to deny accommodations if they weren\u2019t being provided to other workers in similar situations.\u201cIt was a useful mechanism in order to divert some of the momentum that was building,\u201d said Emily Martin of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, an advocacy group focused on women\u2019s rights.Both bills stalled.Outside Washington, there have been fewer roadblocks. At least 23 states have passed laws that are stronger than current federal protections (Tennessee is not among them). In Utah, Delaware, Colorado and New York, Republicans led the charge. In Nebraska, an anti-abortion Democrat pushed the measure.\u201cWomen have lost their children due to the lack of robust pregnancy protections in the workplace,\u201d said Catherine Glenn Foster, the president of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t get behind this or uses it as a political game \u2014 it\u2019s a travesty.\u201dXPO Logistics has had run-ins with regulators over labor issues. Last year, the state of California awarded four truck drivers $855,000 in back wages after XPO misclassified them as independent contractors.The problems extend beyond the warehouse floor \u2014 to hotels, restaurants, fire stations and stores.At the Albertsons grocery store in Atascadero, Calif., Reyna Garcia had one of the toughest jobs. She pushed 200-pound carts, dragged sacks of cat litter and climbed 10-foot ladders to stock goods.Ms. Garcia got pregnant in July 2012, found out she was having a girl and decided to name the baby Jade.Ms. Garcia told her boss that her pregnancy was high risk \u2014 she had previously given birth prematurely. She presented a doctor\u2019s note saying she should not lift more than 15 pounds. The boss ignored the recommendation, according to a lawsuit she filed against Albertsons in federal court in Los Angeles.\u201cShe was feeling like she wasn\u2019t getting any response from her supervisor,\u201d her doctor, Mareeni Stanislaus, said in an interview. She said the restrictions were \u201ceven more important\u201d because Ms. Garcia had a high-risk pregnancy. Heavy lifting can prompt smooth muscles like the uterus to contract, potentially inducing preterm labor, Dr. Stanislaus said.The regular twisting and hoisting caused intense pain, but Ms. Garcia needed the paycheck and the health insurance. She requested any other position \u2014 in the Albertsons bakery or at the meat counter or as a fruit cutter or in the pharmacy or at the customer service desk.Her boss turned her down, according to the lawsuit, which included corroborating statements from her colleagues.Her doctors sent two more notes. \u201cShe should avoid prolonged standing without a break and should avoid excessive bending and reaching and balancing,\u201d Dr. Stanislaus wrote. Copies of the letters were included in the suit.About three weeks later, in the middle of her shift, Ms. Garcia began feeling \u201cpelvic pressure,\u201d according to her lawsuit. She asked her boss for permission to leave early; he gave her a long list of tasks that she needed to finish first.Ms. Garcia ended up working overtime. By the time she got home, she could feel her amniotic sac bulging between her legs. It felt \u201clike a balloon coming out of me,\u201d she said in a sworn statement. She went to the emergency room. She could feel something scratching from inside; her doctor told her it was the baby\u2019s fingernails. She was 20 weeks pregnant.Five days later, Ms. Garcia gave birth to Jade. The baby lived less than 10 minutes.\u201cMy husband and I watched her die,\u201d Ms. Garcia said in her statement. \u201cIt was the most painful thing I have ever experienced.\u201dIn 2014, Albertsons settled Ms. Garcia\u2019s lawsuit for an undisclosed amount; the deal prohibited her from speaking publicly about what happened. \u201cThe company has a policy against pregnancy discrimination, and we accommodate employees with pregnancy-related disabilities in accordance with state and federal law,\u201d said Christine Wilcox, an Albertsons spokeswoman.Ms. Garcia\u2019s boss demoted her when she returned to work.\u201cI lost my baby for this job,\u201d Ms. Garcia said, according to her lawsuit. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give me help when I was pregnant and asked for it?\u201dWorkers at the Memphis warehouse thought conditions might improve when XPO Logistics acquired New Breed in September 2014.At the time, XPO and its chief executive, Bradley S. Jacobs, were on a buying spree. His strategy was simple: slash expenses and deliver quick profits. Today XPO, based in Greenwich, Conn., has a market value of $12 billion.The company has had multiple run-ins with regulators. In one instance, the California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office last year awarded four XPO truck drivers a total of $855,000 after finding that the company had misclassified them as independent contractors.In Memphis, XPO\u2019s ownership changed the warehouse, but not the way workers had hoped. Over the next couple of years, pressure on employees intensified and working conditions deteriorated, according to the 20 current and former employees. Supervisors began demanding that they pack 120 boxes an hour instead of 60. Some bosses penalized employees for spending too much time in the bathroom or on breaks.Plaques marking her years of service at the warehouse hang in Chasisty Bee\u2019s home. She left the company after getting pregnant in 2015. After two previous miscarriages while there, \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to lose another child,\u201d she said.A spokeswoman for XPO Logistics, which processes orders for Verizon, said the allegations made by pregnant workers were \u201cunsubstantiated, filled with inaccuracies and do not reflect the way in which our Memphis facility operates.\u201dSummer temperatures inside the warehouse regularly exceeded 100 degrees, the current and former employees said. It was so hot and humid that workers sometimes found it hard to breathe.Every week from June through September 2017, at least one worker collapsed on the warehouse floor, the employees said. Supervisors took to wheeling the sick workers to the break room, where they sometimes received an ice pop.On the morning of Oct. 17, 2017, Linda Neal crashed to the warehouse floor, dead of cardiac arrest.Ms. Neal, 58, had suffered from heart problems. She previously had complained to her son, Dean Turner, that XPO supervisors would not let her leave early when she was feeling unwell, Mr. Turner said in an interview. That day, she had told managers that she was short of breath and asked for an extra break, but her supervisor rejected the request, according to Lakeisha Nelson, who witnessed the exchange and still works there. When Mr. Turner arrived at the warehouse, he said, three of his mother\u2019s colleagues told him the same thing.Ms. Kurtz, the XPO spokeswoman, said the company did allow workers to leave for the day after Ms. Neal died. She added that the Teamsters \u201ccontinue to shamefully exploit the passing of our colleague through the spreading of false information\u201d in their effort to organize at the warehouse.That same month, Ceeadria Walker joined XPO. The pay was decent, about $12 an hour, an upgrade from her last job at a car-parts warehouse. At first, she didn\u2019t mind the frequent 12-hour shifts. But she learned she was pregnant in June 2018 and started feeling nauseated and dizzy at the end of the long days.Ms. Walker said she gave her supervisor a doctor\u2019s note saying she should reduce the number of hours on her feet to avoid hurting herself or endangering her pregnancy. \u201cThey looked at it like it was nothing,\u201d she said.There were days when XPO let her work in the \u201cpit,\u201d dealing with the paperwork for orders, but she said she spent most of July on the conveyor-belt line hoisting 45-pound boxes.Ms. Walker toyed with leaving. But, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t just quit my job.\u201d She was near the end of her first trimester and needed money. She planned to name the baby, her first child, after her boyfriend \u2014 Octavia for a girl, Octavius for a boy.By the end of her shift on Aug. 4, Ms. Walker said she had handled hundreds of Verizon boxes. When she woke up bleeding at 6 a.m. the next day, her mother drove her to the doctor.Two days later, Ms. Walker spoke with The Times. She was distraught. \u201cThis was going to be my first.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.June 15, 2018Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Photo Book as Art Object", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSFor Dayanita Singh, photography is inseparable from its presentation, and she has spent years experimenting with unusual photo book formats to display her work.When did you start photographing?I started in 1980 in order to make a book. To me, photography equaled making a book. The idea that there could be exhibitions or museums might want your work didn\u2019t exist at that time for me. So I made a book in \u201986 of Zakir Hussain, the tabla player.This is before India opened up, so we used to have just a few photo books from the U.S.S.R. to look at.I think what was more an influence was that my mother was such an obsessive album maker. So you made photos to make albums, to make a sequence and to arrange photographs; you didn\u2019t just randomly make photos for the heck of it.My mother loved to photograph. Everything in my childhood had to be documented by her.Did your mother put them into photo albums?She bought very beautiful, large, handmade ones. And she also covered every vertical surface with glass and put photos under it. You lived with photos, you lived through these albums. Photos were not something that got put on the wall behind glass.What did you study in school?Typography. I wanted to make type.Then how did you become a photographer?Completely by accident. Someone pushed me over while I was taking photos at a concert and I got really annoyed, and so afterward I said to them, \u201cI\u2019m a young student today, so you can push me around \u2014 someday I\u2019ll be an important photographer,\u201d and then I burst into tears. I was just 18 years old.That night is the night I decided that if I become a photographer I can escape all the social expectations of marriage and children.I didn\u2019t know any women in photography at that time. So I just made up my own rules.It was really a way to be free of social norms more than any love for the medium.Tell me about your exhibit in New York.I am taking over the Callicoon art gallery starting on Oct. 18 and turning it into a pop-up bookshop, for book objects and things like that.What\u2019s a book object?My most recent book object \u2014 the Pothi Box \u2014 is a wooden structure that has within it 30 images of paper archives, a film archive and a printing press. You take the image cards out and put another one in front and you can keep changing the images. I call it an unbound book.At the Callicoon gallery I will show 30 of these boxes, and in doing so I will show the entire set of 30 images. I publish the boxes with my own imprint called Spontaneous Books in an edition of 360. The Pothi Box is a miniature version of what I\u2019m showing at Carnegie International, which is six big pillars with 100 prints.I\u2019ve always wanted to find this space between publishing and the art gallery. What I love the most about photography is dissemination, and publishing gives me that. But I also love how the art gallery can make you look at things in a very special way. They can make things \u2014 not unique, but more special. Photography I feel got a little stuck with prints on the wall in editions. So it\u2019s like the print is there and the book is here, but for me the book has always been the work. So I wanted to find something in between that had the dissemination of the book and the art object of the gallery.What is your fascination with books?I feel the book is the one form where I can be the complete author of my work. And I love the book for the sequence, which no other form really gives me. It\u2019s this beautiful art object that you can have beside your bed, you can travel with it. Exhibitions, as we know, come and go but the book just sort of \u2014 you don\u2019t know where you might chance upon it. And photo books are great, but often they just get put on the shelf. And I\u2019ve been struggling for the last few books on how to make it a work that can be on the wall.Your books are not like other people\u2019s books. You\u2019re always striving to find the perfect expression of the work.It has to be more than the sum of the photos. So the book becoming the exhibition was really important. I always want to push it even more, even further.Tell me about your first book.Nobody bought it. Because in those days people thought it was absurd to make a book about one person. Straight after that I went to study at I.C.P. (the International Center of Photography) in New York. To be able to afford it I asked my mother to use the money that would have gone to my dowry if I got married, because in those days you needed a dowry.She said that yes, education is more valuable than dowry, but then this is it.And I said, That\u2019s fine.After I.C.P. I went right back to India because I thought I could change the world \u2014 as I.C.P. had taught us \u2014 with our photojournalism. And within two or three years I realized that was the biggest myth, and that there were situations where I felt I had no business photographing, and it would be more important to become an activist than to be photographing the children of the prostitutes.I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t be a photojournalist, so what am I going to do?\u201dAnd that\u2019s when I decided to make family portraits with the only idea that if at the end of my life 300 families have my portraits hanging in their house then it\u2019s better than any museum exhibition.What happened? Why haven\u2019t you just finished your 300th portrait?I met Walter Keller (a publisher and curator) very early in the \u201990s. He told me don\u2019t get involved in books and exhibitions, that will drain all your energy. Just keep photographing. And I listened to him.I remember in \u201997 Michael Hoffman wanted to make a monograph of my work from the little bit of photojournalism to the family portraits. Walter Keller said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, you\u2019re not ready, that\u2019ll be the end of your career.\u201d And so I said no to Aperture \u2014 to the great Michael Hoffman. He was furious. But I believed Walter when he said just keep making the work. Books and exhibitions can come later.You had stolen his book?It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve stolen in my life. I don\u2019t steal. But when I was a student at I.C.P., I felt that if I didn\u2019t have \u201cLines of my Hand\u201d by Robert Frank, then I could not become a photographer. I had to possess that book. Not because of the images but the way it was made. It had a gateway cover with a pencil drawing of a hand on it.So I went in with a big black coat and smuggled the book out.Since then you\u2019ve made 12 books. You seem to have an obsession with the form.I would go so far as to say that the book is my work and the exhibition is a catalog of that book. It\u2019s not about individual photographs. It\u2019s about how they work together, and the sequencing and editing to me anyway is 80 percent of photography \u2014 making images is just one small part.Do you design your books?Yes, of course. This idea of book building is so crucial to photography. The vast terrain between making your images and designing a book, that sitting with the prints and seeing what the work wants to be rather than what you want the work to be. The form then suggests itself. So it\u2019s at a much later stage that I would go to the publisher and thereby the designer.How long do you sit with the work?Two years, sometimes longer. There\u2019s lots of works from 30 years ago that I still haven\u2019t done anything with. I think you can get away with doing a bad exhibition, but you can never get away from a bad book. So I try to urge people to really think very carefully about their books and to somehow be the author of the book and not just the supplier of images to a designer.So you\u2019re a photographer, you\u2019re an editor, you\u2019re a designer, and the editing and designing is no less important than the photography?The photography is the smallest part of it, 10 to 20 percent, that\u2019s it. The rest of the work is really editing and sequencing. And there\u2019s no shortcut there. Can we talk about making the concept of the book?I started to introduce the idea that a book be an exhibition with [the book publisher Gerhard] Steidl. We made \u201cMuseum of Chance\u201d with 88 different covers, so that you could buy 88 books and have my exhibition, or four or whatever. They all had different covers. Then I said to Gerhard that we have to introduce that each of the boxes is unique with \u201cMuseum Bhavan.\u201dMy Pothi Box is a conceptual work. I have these 30 cards in it. If we wanted to do an exhibition in your workplace I would bring 30 of these boxes, we would have a different image in front in each one of them and that becomes the exhibition. We would invite all your colleagues at lunchtime to see if they would like to buy any of the work, maybe all 30 get sold. And then I get the money and I don\u2019t have to carry the books back.Which is the ultimate goal.Absolutely, no shipping.But also what I like is the fact that you can keep changing this box, you know. It\u2019s not a book in a bookshelf, it\u2019s not a print behind glass on the wall. And you can also sit it down on the table.In \u201cBhavan Museum\u201d you have these nine museums, and you can just show one of them, or you can show nine. Or you can take bits of \u201cMuseum of Machine\u201d and put it next to \u201cMuseum of Men\u201d or \u201cMuseum of Little Ladies\u201d and make your own museums. Making you part of the work, making you curator of the work, and not just a fixed format that a bound book would give you.So essentially it\u2019s an interactive book, but analog. What was before the \u201cMuseum Bhavan\u201d?There was \u201cSent a Letter\u201d in 2007. That\u2019s when I realized that the book can be the exhibition. And then after that there were two color books \u2014 \u201cBlue Book\u201d and \u201cDream Villa.\u201d \u201cBlue Book was the industrial landscapes and that was really a book of postcards, but nobody sent me the postcards. But then by 2011 I made \u201cFile Room,\u201d which was photographs of all the archives. And that\u2019s when I asked Gerhard if I could have 10 different colored clothes. And, as always, he said absolutely not, a book has to have an identity \u2014 you can\u2019t have it in 10 different colors. Then the next morning he said, O.K., we\u2019ll do it but it\u2019s ridiculous.It\u2019s fantastic working with Gerhard. I can dare to think at this kind of scale. No other publisher is going to let you cut up your book and make as many covers as you want out of \u201cFile Room.\u201d He gets the idea of making the book the exhibition.But subsequently I started to make these wooden structures, so the book would be on the wall. It still remains a book, it\u2019s true to the book, but it\u2019s on the wall, like you would have a print or a watercolor. At the Callicoon gallery it will be a shop too \u2014 it\u2019s not just books. There\u2019s going to be pillows and scarves that say, \u201cgo away closer.\u201d There will be \u201cFile Room\u201d book objects. But what I\u2019m most excited about is my jacket with nine pockets that I made for my nine \u201cMuseum Bhavan\u201d books. So you might say, \u201cNo, Dayanita, you can\u2019t come into the Times office and have an exhibition, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d But I can just pull out this book, and show it to people, and by the time you say, \u201cNo, Dayanita, this is not O.K. to do \u2014\u201dYou\u2019ve done it.I put that in my pocket and I walk away to somebody else. On the back of the vest it says \u201cMy life is a museum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Settled a Sex Discrimination Complaint. Now He Wants to Lead Maine.", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCARBOROUGH, Me. \u2014 Shawn Moody has made his difficult upbringing and success in business the twin pillars of his campaign to become Maine\u2019s next governor, boasting in commercials, debates and speeches about how he built his automobile repair stores from scratch after he was raised by a single mother.\u201cI would put my record up against anyone about knowing how to grow a successful business,\u201d said Mr. Moody, the Republican nominee in one of the country\u2019s most competitive races for governor.But for Jill Hayward, herself a single mother, there is nothing quite as painful as seeing Mr. Moody appear on television recounting how he overcame childhood hardship to make Moody\u2019s Collision Centers into a multi-million-dollar regional powerhouse.In 2006, Ms. Hayward, a former member of management at a Moody\u2019s store, filed a sexual discrimination complaint against Mr. Moody with the Maine Human Rights Commission, accusing him of firing her because he did not think she was up to the job after giving birth to her son. \u201cI want to see you grow,\u201d he told her, according to the previously undisclosed complaint, but with her new parental obligations, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that you can do that in this job.\u201d Mr. Moody ultimately settled the complaint and, she said, paid her around $20,000.\u201cAny time he comes on, I turn it off because it\u2019ll make me teary,\u201d Ms. Hayward said in an interview.In a separate interview, Mr. Moody repeatedly cited the settlement to indicate he was restricted from addressing Ms. Hayward\u2019s accusations.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say the details of what was finalized, but we reached an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe allegation was withdrawn and it was resolved.\u201d\u201cI just have to rest on our track record, our reputation in the community,\u201d he said, arguing that he had led \u201ca very compassionate, well-run organization.\u201dMr. Moody has made his reputation and character a part of the campaign because of how much he leans on his biography in his race against Janet Mills, the Democratic state attorney general. Opinion polls show a tight contest to succeed the pugnacious term-limited governor, Paul R. LePage, whose lieutenants are guiding Mr. Moody\u2019s campaign.And to be competitive, Mr. Moody is drawing on his fortune earned from his repair stores in cities like Biddeford and Scarborough.It was in those two Portland-area Moody\u2019s shops where Ms. Hayward worked a few years after graduating from college. By her late 20s she was an expediter, spending more than two years coordinating with vendors and processing orders. Ms. Hayward said she received no written complaints from her superiors and earned a raise during her time there. (Mr. Moody would not address Ms. Hayward\u2019s work history.)It was a collegial environment and she gave as good as she got from \u201cmy boys,\u201d as she called her co-workers. They ribbed her about the oil spill pads laying around the shop, joking that she could use those in case her water broke when she was pregnant. But Ms. Hayward said her colleagues were also tender: Two of them helped build her crib, and they chipped in to get her a gift card from Wal-Mart as a baby shower gift.But shortly after she gave birth to her son, she said, Mr. Moody sent her life into a tailspin from which she only emerged after more than a decade. As Ms. Hayward sees it, he fired her because he did not think she could do the job as a single mother.Sharing her story with a reporter for the first time, Ms. Hayward, 44, said that in November 2005 Mr. Moody visited her apartment while she was on maternity leave after having an emergency C-section. As she sat feeding a bottle to her weeks-old son, her boss explained to her that she could no longer work for him because of her duties as a mother, she said.\u201cMy heart was in my throat or at my feet, and I\u2019m looking at him like, \u2018You\u2019re kidding,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Hayward, who remembered \u201cbawling\u201d as it became clear there was nothing she could say to keep her job.Mr. Moody, again citing the settlement he reached, did not directly answer when asked if he visited her at her apartment and fired her. But he said that his company had a multi-step process on terminations and that multiple people were involved in such decisions, which take place at the store where the employee in question worked.In the 2006 complaint filed to the human rights commission, and obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Hayward made the same claims she leveled in the interview and said she was replaced by a man. She accused Mr. Moody of sexual discrimination in violation of state and federal law and listed a series of comments he made upon firing her.\u201cYou are no longer going to be able to do the job in Biddeford now that you have\u201d your son, Mr. Moody told her, according to the complaint.According to publicly available documents on file with the human rights commission, which enforces Maine\u2019s anti-discrimination laws, Ms. Hayward and Mr. Moody eventually agreed to a settlement and Ms. Hayward agreed to withdraw the complaint.A former counsel for the commission, John P. Gause, said he could not speak specifically about the case. But Mr. Gause said the panel generally encouraged parties to settle disputes and avoid protracted wrangling in court.Asked why he did not fight the claim, Mr. Moody suggested he harbored some regret for not doing so.\u201cThat is a great question,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know how proud of an individual I am about how we do treat people, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d But, he said, his insurance company handled his side of the case and it was \u201ckind of out of our hands.\u201dIn the interview, Ms. Hayward said Mr. Moody paid her around $20,000 as part of their settlement, $3,000 of which went to her attorney.But that was not until October 2006, nearly a year after she lost her job, Ms. Hayward recounted. She would eventually lose her apartment and her car.\u201cHow do you dispose of a single mother when that\u2019s your claim to fame in your campaign?\u201d she asked in her thick Maine accent over pumpkin spice lattes at a Starbucks here, as her son, who turned 13 on Tuesday, sat eating a cookie just out of earshot.In interviews, Ms. Hayward\u2019s mother, brother and a one-time colleague of hers at Mr. Moody\u2019s business, who asked to remain anonymous, separately corroborated her recollection of events.Two current Moody\u2019s employees, whose names were shared by his campaign, said they could not speak to the case itself but added that they were stunned that Mr. Moody was accused of mistreatment.\u201cWe have women who work in this company who have had children, we have women who are pregnant now,\u201d said Debra Gale, who has worked in Mr. Moody\u2019s Gorham store for 20 years. \u201cThey are not discriminated against whatsoever.\u201dAs for Ms. Hayward, Ms. Gale only pointed out that she had changed store locations and gently said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel we ever found a proper fit for her.\u201dMs. Hayward, who described herself as a Republican and a supporter of President Trump, said she had no political motivation in speaking out and was \u201cscared\u201d about reprisals from Mr. Moody. After being contacted by a reporter on Facebook, she agreed to discuss her story over the phone on an off-the-record basis.

{"Headline": "Goodbye Silicon Valley, Hello East Village", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntFrequent working trips to New York convinced a couple of Facebook employees to leave the West Coast for the East. Kendra Sinclair and Jared Vengrin met as college students in Montreal, and after graduation had planned to move to one of two tech hubs, New York or San Francisco.Instead, alarmed by the high cost of housing in both cities, they landed in Austin, Tex. Eventually they picked a coast, and rented a two-bedroom apartment in the Mission District of San Francisco for $2,000 a month. It was a real hovel, Ms. Sinclair said, as noisy and dark as it was small.The distance to their office wasn\u2019t too bad \u2014 both work at Facebook, in Menlo Park \u2014 but traffic was heavy, and the commute consumed three hours a day on the company shuttle bus. \u201cIf it rained, it would be two hours each way,\u201d said Ms. Sinclair, 32.Around the same time, they started making frequent trips to New York for work, learning how much they loved the city, yet still unfamiliar with much of it. \u201cOur experience of New York was very much in a bubble,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said. \u201cWe would stay a five-minute walk from the office and go to dinner near the office,\u201d south of Union Square.But that was enough to convince them to relocate. So the couple, who married last winter, arranged to transfer to Facebook\u2019s New York office. They gave up their San Francisco apartment, rented the Palo Alto house and stayed in temporary housing in Chelsea while looking for a rental.Referred by a friend, they contacted Ben Brown, a licensed salesman at the Corcoran Group, and told him what they wanted (to be within walking distance of work) and what they needed (a dog-friendly home with few stairs for their French bulldog, Pacman, who has back problems). Ideally, whatever they found would also have a washer-dryer and a dishwasher, and maybe even a gym.When the friend who had been living in their Mission District apartment decided to move to New York too, the couple asked if he would be interested in joining them, assuming they found a big enough two-bedroom. He was.\u201cWe figured you could get more space with a two-bedroom, and it would be nice to live with a social friend during our first year,\u201d Mr. Vengrin, 31, said.The trio were willing to spend into the $7,000s. Mr. Brown showed them a cross-section of apartments in various neighborhoods. One, in a glassy tower with great views, felt uncomfortably small for the price. Another was undergoing renovation, with missing finishes and appliances. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell where they will cut corners,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said.In Little Italy, a pristine and lovely two-bedroom floor-through in a charming three-story brick townhouse was listed for $6,500. But the stairs were a deal-breaker for Pacman.A spacious two-bedroom on a high floor in a white-brick postwar building near Union Square was available for $7,250. But like many older buildings, it had no amenities to speak of.During a tour, they saw several units with different layouts, sizes and views. \u201cThe beauty of this building was no one was really living here yet,\u201d said Ms. Sinclair, who welcomed the choice of so many available units. And the Facebook office was about a 15-minute walk away.They checked out a handful of other buildings, looking for something similar but less expensive. Nothing measured up. \u201cThey kept thinking about EVGB,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey enjoyed the idea of being the first people to live in a brand-new spot.\u201dReturning with their friend, who was in town for a visit and was impressed by the size of the units, they chose a $7,600 two-bedroom with two bathrooms and walk-in closets, facing a quiet back courtyard rather than busy East 14th Street, which is riddled with construction. The building is currently offering two months free on a 14-month or 26-month lease, and waiving the amenity fee of $80 a month per person. The trio opted for the shorter lease and arrived in the summer. Their California living situation \u201cwas definitely us on a budget,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said, so \u201cin our first year in New York, we wanted to live big. We wanted to max out our budget in a place we wanted to be, make new friendships and have people be comfortable visiting us.\u201dIn the apartment they chose, she said, \u201cEverything is wonderfully new. There is not a scuff mark. It is pin-drop silent. We haven\u2019t heard a single thing \u2014 not a siren, not a motorcycle revving. We keep pinching ourselves about how appreciative we are to be here.\u201dThe building has more amenities than they use, including a 19,000-square-foot roof deck and a two-level gym. \u201cI bought goggles, thinking I\u2019d be all about the pool,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said. \u201cI intend to use the sauna on the weekends, and I always forget.\u201dWhen they can, they ride Citi Bikes to work, but they often find that the nearby bike stations are empty in the morning. \u201cA lot of people on the East Side use Citi Bike,\u201d Mr. Vengrin said. \u201cIf Citi Bike is not available, we walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Many Native Americans Are Angry With Elizabeth Warren", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Warren defended herself by saying she was not claiming to be eligible for membership in the Cherokee Nation \u2014 and she isn\u2019t, given that her ancestors do not appear on the Dawes Rolls, early-20th-century government documents that form the basis of the Cherokee citizenship process. She said she was simply corroborating the family stories of Native American lineage that she has often recounted.But that distinction actually cuts to the heart of why Native Americans are so upset with her. Fundamentally, their anger is about what it means to be Native American \u2014 and who gets to decide.\u201cThe American public doesn\u2019t understand the difference\u201d between ancestry and tribal membership, said Kim TallBear, a professor at the University of Alberta who wrote a book titled \u201cNative American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science.\u201dWhile many people see \u201cNative American\u201d as simply a racial category, she said, \u201cwe have additional ideas about how to identify when one is Native American that aren\u2019t really consistent with the way most Americans think. Our definitions matter to us.\u201dAnd so when someone like Ms. Warren emphasizes undocumented lineage over tribal citizenship criteria, said Dr. TallBear, who is a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate tribe in South Dakota, \u201cwhat they\u2019re telling us is they are privileging nonindigenous definitions of being indigenous.\u201dMembership in a Native American tribe is \u201cvery precious to us,\u201d Mr. Hoskin, the Cherokee Nation secretary of state, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a card that we hold. It\u2019s something that we consider a dear possession, and so we don\u2019t take it lightly.\u201dThis perspective is grounded in a long history of persecution, displacement and massacre. Over many decades of United States history, the government took the land of Native American tribes, including the Cherokee, and pushed them steadily west. President Andrew Jackson\u2019s policies, continued under Martin Van Buren, forced the Cherokee into their current territory in Oklahoma in the Trail of Tears during 1838 and 1839. Administration after administration signed treaties with tribes and then violated them. It was not until the 1930s that tribes gained the sovereignty they now have on their reservations.\u201cThose of us who are Cherokee citizens, we know our ancestors in some cases perished along the Trail of Tears,\u201d Mr. Hoskin said.\u201cMost reasonable people can understand,\u201d in that context, why claims to Native American heritage based on a DNA test are fraught, he added.Neither Ms. Warren nor anyone on her staff contacted the Cherokee Nation before publicizing the DNA results, Mr. Hoskin said. A spokeswoman for Ms. Warren\u2019s re-election campaign, Kristen Orthman, declined to comment on this point.Asked about the criticism, the senator\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Ms. Orthman, sent links to a tweet by Ms. Warren and to a statement posted on Facebook by the Eastern Band Cherokee, a separate tribe from the Cherokee Nation.The Eastern Band Cherokee\u2019s statement was supportive of Ms. Warren, saying that she \u201chas not used her family story or evidence of Native ancestry to gain employment or other advantage\u201d and that she \u201cdemonstrates respect for tribal sovereignty by acknowledging that tribes determine citizenship and respecting the difference between citizenship and ancestry.\u201d It also listed Native-friendly bills she had supported in the Senate.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cSome people who have family stories or evidence of Native ancestry have sought to appropriate Cherokee culture, claim a preference in hiring, claim that their art is \u2018Indian art,\u2019 or advance their careers based on a family story or evidence of Native ancestry,\u201d Principal Chief Richard G. Sneed added in the statement, which argued that Ms. Warren had not done any of those things. \u201cWe strongly condemn such actions as harmful to our tribal government and Cherokee people.\u201dBy Wednesday, the post had been deleted from the Facebook page of the tribe\u2019s newspaper, but Ashleigh Stephens, a spokeswoman for Principal Chief Sneed, said he stood by it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019d Trade It All In to Be With My Brother and Friends Again.\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Army veteran responded to readers\u2019 comments about the lessons he learned deploying in Afghanistan and Iraq after losing his brother in 9/11. Mr. Quinn is a United States Army veteran.The problem is that our civilian leaders, and most of our population, have no skin in the game, and there\u2019s an ever-growing deference to the opinion of senior military leaders (many now wearing suits instead of fatigues) when it comes to foreign policy. My hope is that our leaders don\u2019t act like a 21-year-old from Brooklyn who wants to avenge his brother\u2019s death, but that they will be the adults in the room, develop a grand strategy to protect the U.S., our allies and our interests and not fall for the sunk-cost fallacy, where we are continuing to invest in Afghanistan because of costs already incurred.On the other side of the coin, which can be harder to admit, war has also changed me for the better. In a word, it probably comes down to perspective. The problems we face as Americans may seem difficult. They are not. When you witness Afghans struggle with food, shelter and security, it's difficult to get upset about the Wi-Fi not working on a JetBlue flight that was delayed two hours. It also taught me that our relationships are the most important things in life. The family and friends I lost to war make me cherish every moment I get to spend with the people I love. It also made me braver and bolder. Before, I would never have had the guts to submit an Op-Ed to The New York Times. Yesterday, I went with my husband, a Vietnam veteran, to the V.A. hospital in Madison, Wis. I urge people to go to a V.A. hospital sometime. You see firsthand young and old soldiers who have given their lives in one way or another, and still pay a price, physically or emotionally.I see that in some bizarre iterations, Vietnam now counts among our \u201cvictories.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that in many wars, the United States owned the skies and still couldn\u2019t manage a victory. The brilliant new plan for Afghanistan, announced during the 2016 election, doesn\u2019t seem to be much better than any of the previous plans, or much different. Nor will the outcome, I dare to predict. Q: Can any side be truly victorious in a war? Are there any sacrifices, including your own, that could be justified by a victory?I will not address my sacrifices, as they pale in comparison to the sacrifices of friends who have given life, limb and mind to the cause, but we shouldn\u2019t use the word victory. Instead, use words like \u201cstrategy\u201d and \u201cattainable objectives.\u201d Over the course of 17 years and three administrations, our senior leaders have failed to give our troops a sound strategy with attainable objectives and a clear exit plan.Q: If we pull out of the war in Afghanistan, are we accepting defeat? How do you see the U.S. stepping out of the conflict? Is there a peaceful way forward?You also mentioned that if we left, ISIS would take safe haven under a friendly Taliban regime, but the truth is that the Taliban hate ISIS more than we do. Additionally, we continue to fear a safe haven for Al Qaeda, but Al Qaeda has had a safe haven in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border for the last 17 years. Osama bin Laden lived comfortably in a suburban town of Pakistan called Abbottabad, where his home was a stone\u2019s throw away from the Pakistan Military Academy. Let\u2019s be clear that Al Qaeda was the terrorist organization with the international ambition to strike the U.S. with 15 of its hijackers coming from Saudi Arabia. It wasn\u2019t the Taliban. Although not ideal (war never is), there will be a continuing clash between the Taliban and the current Afghan government, and it\u2019s up to the Afghan people to decide their destiny, without a kid from Brooklyn being in the middle of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ancient Ant-Bacteria Partnership to Protect Fungus", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesAmber specimens indicate that fungus-farming ants have been cooperating with antimicrobial bacteria for tens of millions of years.Long before early humans cultivated wheat, barley, lentils and flax, ancient leafcutter ants raised fungus. And like human farmers, the ants had to fend off crop pests, particularly a parasitic fungal disease.One of the fossilized ants had specialized pockets on its head, called crypts, that are also seen on modern ants. The crypts are known to house the fungus-protecting bacteria, called actinobacteria. The other ant specimen was entombed with gas bubbles on its body, likely produced by the respiration of the actinobacteria.\u201cIt was a shock to me,\u201d said Dr. Li.The partnership has been a vital part of the ant\u2019s evolutionary story, and it continues to reveal itself.It is seen in modern leaf-cutting ants, which take such tender care of the fungus that when a new queen is ready to start her own nest, she will cut off a piece of it from her parent\u2019s fungus garden and carry it in her mouth until she finds a spot to begin her colony.

{"Headline": "Mexico Should Not Consent to Do Washington\u2019s Dirty Work", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImmigration and trade are now closely linked, at least in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. There lies part of the current caravan crisis. It is not just Trumpian electioneering.Mr. Castaneda was Mexico\u2019s foreign minister from 2000 to 2003.A migrant caravan from Honduras is marching north through Mexico. They regrouped and continued their exodus north, escorted by the federal police and aided with water and medicines by Mexican townspeople along the way. Other caravans are reported to be underway. Does this migratory and diplomatic crisis have a solution?Maybe not, but there is at least an explanation for it, which lies in another question. Why, after all his huffing and puffing, did President Trump accept a watered-down version of a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, known now as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA?No one knows for sure, but after nearly 40 years of being intimately involved, as an academic and public official, with these situations, I can offer an informed guess: The United States gave up most of its trade demands in exchange for a confidential commitment by Mexico to do Washington\u2019s dirty work against would-be immigrants and refugees. Of course, this is speculation, and the evidence is all circumstantial.From experience, though, I know how both countries, for diverse reasons, tried always to keep different issues on the bilateral agenda separate and not mix them together. In an ideal world today, that is how it would be, but not with Mr. Trump. These American bureaucratic traditions, which Mexico always counted on to maintain stability and sensibility in the relationship, have been overturned. Immigration and trade have become intimately linked, at least in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. Therein lies part of the origins of the current caravan crisis. It is not just Trumpian electioneering.On Sept. 29, Mexico, Canada and the United States finally reached a deal on a revised version of NAFTA that was promptly rebranded by Mr. Trump with a new name largely because it doesn\u2019t have much new content. The president achieved far less than he originally sought. His initial goals \u2014 reducing the United States trade deficit with Mexico, bringing automobile jobs back to the United States \u2014 are unlikely to be accomplished any time soon, if at all. He acquiesced to a deal that fell far short of his ambitions. And he hardly mentions it on the campaign trail as one of his signature triumphs.He was probably referring to the two main American demands on Mexico that have been made public in the United States press over the past weeks. They are ominous for Mexico and ignoble for the United States.Second, and most important, since 2014 under President Obama, and now more than ever, Washington has pressured Mexico to shut down as much as possible of its southern border \u2014 in a nutshell, to do its dirty work. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has reluctantly gone along, but the cost for Mexico is rising, and he is soon to be no longer in charge.This is why it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Trump administration conditioned its acceptance of a diluted new NAFTA on Mexico\u2019s acceptance of more cooperation, or complicity, with the United States, for keeping Central Americans, be they refugees, economic migrants, or a combination of both, from reaching the United States border. This is what Mr. Pompeo said in Mexico: Stop the Hondurans from reaching the United States border. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has insinuated that he won\u2019t maintain this policy. Knowing him on and off for more than 30 years, I think the chances are that if he is left no choice, having agreed to the NAFTA/immigration trade-off, he might cave in to American pressure, despite his displeasure and current denials. He has staked too much on USMCA as a source of economic stability for his incoming government to put it at risk simply because of Central American refugees. But deporting thousands of Central Americans or placing them by force in refugee camps would be intolerable for his supporters.There is obviously a great deal of electoral distraction in all of this, and Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster on these matters has proved meaningless in the past. Still, these pressures on immigration, coupled with the rise of deportations of Mexicans from the United States heartland, bode not well for Mexico nor for the United States. These approaches are harmful for Mexico, and unworthy of the United States.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s flash visit to Mexico City confirmed what has been known for months. Immigration is at the top of the Trump agenda with Mexico (and other countries); this approach is damaging to Mexico, Central America and the United States. The new government in Mexico, a hypothetical new majority in the House of Representatives, and hundreds of thousands of Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees should all be aware of this. Together, they are responsible for designing a response that is both effective and practical, but most importantly, humanitarian.Jorge G.

Even people with jobs often cycle on and off assistance as work comes and goes, or to plug the gaps when it just doesn\u2019t pay enough. These programs allow people to remain healthy and solvent \u2014 supporting their independence. This rule therefore hurts everyone, not just immigrants, by stigmatizing the safety net funded by all of us to help people survive when they fall on hard times.These families would most likely chafe at the idea that they aren\u2019t independent or self-sufficient. They\u2019re working and trying to earn a decent living. But given the way our low-wage, service sector economy functions \u2014 offering erratic, stingy jobs \u2014 it\u2019s often not enough to survive. So families patch together the holes in their finances with the threads of our safety net.Under the administration\u2019s new rule, any immigrant who needed this kind of help \u2014 food stamps when work dries up, Medicaid and rental vouchers when it doesn\u2019t stretch far enough \u2014 could be denied an extension of their stay or a more permanent status because of that need. By making such a change and labeling these people \u201cpublic charges,\u201d the administration is signaling even to the native born that using government programs as stopgap measures makes you a leech on the system.The Department of Homeland Security estimates that the deterrent effect of this rule would result in immigrants forgoing $2.3 billion in federal and state benefits a year, benefits that they would otherwise be eligible for. The department does not estimate how many other Americans will be pushed away from these programs because of the potential stigma. But if the rule becomes federal policy, it\u2019s hard to see how anyone would feel the right to use the social safety net.Bryce Covert (@brycecovert) is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Gadget Is a Video-Chat Screen With a Camera That Follows You", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2004, Facebook has said it wants to bring the world closer together. To accomplish that goal, the company has relied mostly on the web and smartphone apps.But software is no longer enough. On Monday, Facebook introduced a pair of video-calling devices \u2014 Portal and Portal Plus \u2014 to help expand its reach into people\u2019s living rooms.Portal, which has a 10-inch screen, will sell for $199, while the other model, with a 15-inch display that can be rotated, will be priced at $349. Facebook plans to offer the gadgets on a stand-alone website in time for the holidays, and has a major marketing campaign in the works.The devices are Facebook\u2019s first major foray into designing, building and selling consumer hardware from scratch. If the Portals are successful, the company could encourage more people to use its social network regularly to keep in touch with friends and family, as well as for apps like Spotify and Pandora.To address privacy concerns with Portal and Portal Plus, Facebook said the products include an electronic kill switch for the front-facing camera, as well as a cover for the lens. In addition, video calls are encrypted, and the camera\u2019s A.I. technology runs on the device itself, not on Facebook\u2019s servers, the company said.The company said the utility of the devices, which work on a household Wi-Fi connection, would convince people of their importance in a home. The devices are built atop Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, and the communication software is hooked into a user\u2019s web of Facebook connections. Once Portal is connected to a Messenger account, people can video chat with anyone in their network across devices, be it on Portal, a tablet, a smartphone or a desktop computer.Instead of building its own virtual assistant three years after Alexa\u2019s debut, Facebook worked with Amazon. Like other Amazon-powered products, Portal can be controlled by speaking the word \u201cAlexa\u201d before a question or a request, like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d or \u201cSet a timer for 10 minutes.\u201dJonathan Collins, a research director for ABI Research, said it was wise for Facebook to collaborate with Amazon. While creating a digital assistant has helped Apple, Google and Amazon make their products look more attractive, there was no clear benefit for Facebook to make one of its own, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an obvious link to what they do for people at present,\u201d which is to deepen people\u2019s relationships, Mr. Collins said.Facebook had worked on hardware previously, though its involvement with Portal goes much deeper and further. In 2013, the company and the manufacturer HTC produced the HTC First, a smartphone that ran on a new Facebook-based operating system. The phone flopped.The company also sells virtual-reality goggles, which it got into when the start-up Oculus was already building those products. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014.Rafa Camargo, Facebook\u2019s vice president who oversees Portal, said that when his team said it wanted to work on a smart home product with a large screen, his peers reacted in disbelief \u2014 especially since Amazon and Apple were focused on speakers and not video.\u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\u2019re nuts. The whole thing is just about smart speakers and just voice,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Camargo, who joined Facebook about two years ago.But he said that voice was just one feature of the product and that Facebook could offer customers a different type of experience.\u201cWe come from focusing on people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Center-Right Delusion", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPoliticians and pundits get America wrong.Opinion ColumnistAnyway, what I\u2019d really like to see are comparable surveys of other groups \u2014 say, political analysts for major media organizations. Why? Because I suspect we\u2019d see a similar result: people who opine on politics also imagine that voters are farther to the right than they really are. What I\u2019m suggesting, in other words, is that there\u2019s a shared inside-the-Beltway delusion: that America is a conservative, or at most center-right nation, a view that isn\u2019t grounded in reality.It\u2019s true that Republicans, who are increasingly a far-right party, have been more than competitive politically, controlling the White House, the House of Representatives, or both for all but four of the past 24 years. But this owes a lot to a tilted playing field \u2014 they only won the popular vote for president once over that stretch, and can hold the House even when Democrats get a lot more votes.And it also reflects a political strategy in which Republicans run on anything but their policies. Trump\u2019s frantic attempt to make next week\u2019s election about scary brown people rather than health care or tax cuts is cruder and uglier than anything we\u2019ve seen for a long time, but it\u2019s not fundamentally out of character. Bush the elder ran against Willie Horton. Bush the younger ran on national security. Their actual policies, not so much.In fact, we got an object lesson in the dissonance between G.O.P. electioneering and public preferences in 2004-5. Bush made it a national security election, with a tinge of culture war; as I used to joke, he ran as the enemy of gay married terrorists. Then, with victory under his belt, he proclaimed that he had a mandate to privatize Social Security. He didn\u2019t.But many pundits thought he did. For several months after the 2004 election it was conventional wisdom in the commentariat that of course Bush would get his way on Social Security, and that people like Nancy Pelosi who were trying to stop his push were on the wrong side of history. The overwhelming backlash from voters, who really, really like Social Security (and Medicare, and Medicaid) completely surprised many self-proclaimed political experts.So what are the effects of this delusion of America as a center-right nation? It has clearly inhibited Democrats from taking bold policy positions, out of fear that they\u2019ll be too far left for voters \u2014 a fear fed by journalists who keep insisting that the public wants centrists who are somewhere between the parties. Remember the Bloomberg for president bandwagon, which consisted of a number of prominent pundits and maybe three non-journalist voters.And Republicans appear to have been completely blindsided by the public backlash against their attempts to remove protection for pre-existing conditions, which is amazing if you think about it. How could they not realize that this is a sore spot?I\u2019d say that this goes even more for professional G.O.P. politicos, who are all apparatchiks. That is, they grew up inside the apparatus of movement conservatism, and really imagine that everyone except a few leftist losers shares their ideology. They don\u2019t even realize that their party\u2019s success has been based on racial antagonism, that most people want to raise taxes on the rich and maintain social benefits.And this, by the way, is where Trump has an advantage. He didn\u2019t grow up in the conservative hothouse; his very crudity means that he understands that his electoral chances depend not on repeating conservative pieties but on maximum ugliness.Advertisement"}

It is 21 feet long; its head is about five feet tall; and it had been securely displayed on the lawn of the city\u2019s community center since spring.For months, residents drove by and got out of their cars to take pictures with the art installation, which officials said quickly captured the small city\u2019s imagination.But sometime on the weekend of Oct. 6 and 7, it vanished. Since then, the city has had a mystery on its hands.\u201cThere are no leads at this time,\u201d Officer Darryl Erkel of the Healdsburg Police Department said Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019re taking it seriously,\u201d he continued, adding that the hammer heist was potentially a felony offense. \u201cWho knows what the motivation is?\u201dAt first, the authorities wondered if it was a prank. The high school\u2019s homecoming festivities took place the weekend the hammer disappeared, and some believed it would soon reappear.But reached by The New York Times days later, Officer Erkel bemoaned that it had not shown up.The crime left residents wondering not only who had stolen the hammer, but also how. Officer Erkel said the police believed the thieves had to \u201cuproot\u201d the hammer from the ground, and that road marks showed that they then dragged it about 100 feet.All of which leads to more questions: Why would someone want a giant hammer this badly \u2014 and where would someone even put it?\u201cI highly doubt it\u2019s in someone\u2019s personal art exhibit,\u201d Officer Erkel previously quipped.Then, a twist.Sometime on Oct. 20 or 21 \u2014 another weekend \u2014 someone pounded a three-foot metal nail into the site where the sculpture had been. Etched on the head of the nail? \u201cBAIT.\u201d\u201cThe initial reaction was \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d Rhea Borja, a Healdsburg city spokeswoman, said on Tuesday. \u201cWere we being goaded by the people who took the hammer?\u201d\u201cIt was supposed to attract the hammer,\u201d Officer Erkel said of the nail, adding that it had since been removed.In the meantime, the artist who created the hammer, Doug Unkrey, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to its recovery, officials said.Many are hopeful; others are upset; and a few feel as if they have been unwitting participants in a multi-act performance. With a new roundabout scheduled to be unveiled in town \u2014 which officials noted was a \u201cvery big deal\u201d and \u201cyears in the making\u201d \u2014 some residents are half expecting the hammer to materialize at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.\u201cIt\u2019s a fun thing for the community to talk about,\u201d Ms. Borja said. \u201cThere are so many derisive things going on in the world. This is light enough for people to be able to commiserate.\u201dIndeed, in a gesture of support, Healdsburg\u2019s city manager was recently given a signed hammer (of normal size) by other city managers to replace the one the city has lost.Told Tuesday of the stolen colon\u2019s triumphant return in Kansas City, Mark Themig, Healdsburg\u2019s community services director, perked up.\u201cIf and, hopefully, when the hammer returns, we\u2019re going to do something big,\u201d Mr. Themig said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some ideas.

Pope Francis called Mr. Duterte \u201ca blessing.\u201d Prince Harry and his new wife, Meghan Markle, praised him, too. None were true.While Rappler\u2019s fact checkers work closely with Facebook to investigate and report their findings, they believe the company could do much more.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Marguerite de Leon, 32, a Rappler employee who receives dozens of tips each day about false stories from readers. \u201cWe\u2019re cleaning up Facebook\u2019s mess.\u201dFacebook says it has made strides but acknowledges shortcomings. It doesn\u2019t have fact checkers in many places, and is only beginning to roll out tools that would scrutinize visual memes, like text displayed over an image or a short video, sometimes the fastest ways that harmful misinformation can spread.\u201cThis effort will never be finished, and we have a lot more to do,\u201d said Jason Rudin, a Facebook product manager.For fact checkers themselves, the work takes a toll. Members of Rappler\u2019s staff have received death and rape threats. Rappler brought in a psychologist. It debated bulletproofing the windows and installed a second security guard.The job also requires patience. One busy day this summer, the newsroom\u2019s fact-checking team asked Mr. Esmaquel, who covers religion, to look into the story about Mr. Duterte\u2019s debating the bishop. Even though the story had been shared nearly 4,000 times and had reached more than a million followers, he knew right away that it was a hoax. But he still had to call up the Archdiocese of Manila for comment.\u201cI said, \u2018Father, I know that this is fake, but I need a quote from you,\u2019\u201d he said.This kind of work doesn\u2019t end for Mr. Esmaquel, 32, and his colleagues.\u201cWe kill one,\u201d he said, \u201cand another one crops up.\u201dRappler has experience battling misinformation. It was founded as a scrappy investigative reporting and entertainment outlet in 2012 by Maria Ressa, a former CNN bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta, Indonesia. She persuaded three female friends \u2014 a group she nicknamed \u201cthe manangs,\u201d a Tagalog word for old ladies or sisters \u2014 to leave their high-powered jobs at news stations and magazines. They shared an optimism that the internet would be a platform for the powerless to find a voice and that Rappler, which is a hybrid of \u201crap\u201d and \u201cripple,\u201d would be a vehicle for social change.Instead, the internet in the Philippines became an outlet for threats and deceit.That is particularly true on Facebook, through which about 97 percent of internet users in the Philippines get access to the web. Before the Philippine election in May 2016, fake accounts appeared on Facebook spreading positive stories about Mr. Duterte, who was running for president as a blunt-spoken, antidrug populist. They also excoriated Mr. Duterte\u2019s opponents, often with personal and inflammatory attacks. Much of the content was untrue.The administration did not respond to a request for comment. It has denied past accusations by Rappler that it is behind misinformation campaigns.The developments alarmed Ms. Ressa. Armed with details of dozens of fake accounts, she met with three regional Facebook executives in August 2016 in Singapore to express her warnings and ask the company to take down the fake accounts.\u201cI said, \u2018If you don\u2019t fix this, you\u2019ve got U.S. elections coming up in November,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ressa, 55, recalled.For Ms. Ressa, the response was not enough.\u201cIt was like the guns were trained on the press,\u201d said Gemma Bagayaua-Mendoza, who runs Rappler\u2019s fact-checking team.Natashya Gutierrez, 31, another reporter, has turned off the comments on her Facebook page. \u201cThere was one comment that I will always remember,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was something like: \u2018You should take a gun and shoot yourself in the mouth.\u2019\u201dIn April, Facebook created an official news verification program and made Rappler one of its third-party fact checkers as part of a commercial partnership, a move that reporters there welcomed. Neither Facebook nor Rappler would disclose financial terms.\u201cWe recognize the role Facebook plays in the Philippines, and are taking responsibility for that,\u201d said Clair Deevy, director of Asia Pacific community affairs at Facebook.A team of four researchers at Rappler was quickly set up to look for bad content and then send it on to reporters to discredit and notify Facebook. The results, however, are mixed.\u201cWe see repeated claims that we have tagged and they are still there,\u201d Ms. Bagayaua-Mendoza said.Just one example: That story about Mr. Duterte and the bishop is still circulating online.The relationship between Rappler and Facebook isn\u2019t always smooth. Ms. Ressa still points out flaws in Facebook\u2019s system and questions its priorities. She recalled telling Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, at a lunch last year that the problem had to be fixed because 97 percent of people on the internet in the Philippines used Facebook. His response, she said: What about the 3 percent who didn\u2019t?Facebook declined to comment on the lunch.There is no question in Ms. Ressa\u2019s mind about who is responsible for false news in the Philippines. \u201cFacebook broke democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they have to fix it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Rappler began testing a Facebook program to flag fake videos and pictures. It was September, not this month.Advertisement"}

Take Ms. Lo\u2019s recipe for pan-roasted cauliflower, which relies on a store-bought spice mix \u2014 tangy with dried mango and black salt \u2014 to effortlessly turn the vegetable into a quick, South Asian-style chaat.The cauliflower is broken into florets and browned in a saucepan (an impossible task when cooking a large amount), then seasoned with a sauce of cilantro, yogurt and green chiles. To make the garnish, Ms. Lo warms chopped almonds in the toaster oven, which she considers a valuable and versatile tool in any small, efficient kitchen.In her book, Ms. Jones wrote that \u201cthe secret of making cooking for one fun and creative is not to think of a meal as self-contained, but to understand that home cooking is an ongoing process, one dish leading to another.\u201d This is distinct from leftovers, warmed up as they are.To preserve vegetables when cooking in small amounts, Ms. Lo cuts them with care. \u201cIf you\u2019re cutting an onion, you cut it from the growth side, not the root side,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you leave the brown paper skin on so it holds the moisture. Then you cut off what you\u2019re going to use and only peel and chop that part.\u201dFrom shopping to prepping to eating, cooking for one requires more efficiency to avoid waste or a mountain of leftovers.\u201cI think a lot of learning to cook for yourself is about portions, and just making sure you\u2019re cooking the amount you\u2019re going to eat,\u201d Ms. Lo added.\u201cPeople want more recipes for one,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who usually pours himself a glass of wine and plays an episode of the Netflix show \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d on his laptop while he cooks. \u201cCooking for myself is part of my ritual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt keeps me sane.\u201dMr. Kim also believes that cooking on a smaller scale happens to yield more delicious food. \u201cI think it\u2019s a volume situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a huge batch, it\u2019s hard to make it taste the way you want.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a way to nurture yourself and nourish yourself,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Ms. Miller\u2019s approach is exact. \u201cOne thing I believe strongly in is buying small quantities of food so you don\u2019t end up wasting ingredients,\u201d she said.When she buys something big, like a whole chicken, Ms. Miller might roast it and use the meat for four consecutive recipes, cooking each one differently but still using up every part of the bird.Otherwise, she\u2019ll portion meat or fish individually and pack them in the freezer. \u201cGetting good at using your freezer is key,\u201d Ms. Miller said. (Likewise, Ms. Lo vacuum-seals bacon in packages of two slices so she can grab a single portion from the freezer.) Ms. Miller also uses ice cube trays to freeze sauces, such as chimichurri, and to store any excess herbs in olive oil before they have the chance to spoil in the fridge. Later she\u2019ll pop out the herb cubes one at a time to finish a soup or stew.She first began cooking for herself when she lived in Paris while attending culinary school. She started small, with rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables from the market, but later, at a restaurant called Mama Shelter, she tasted a shepherd\u2019s pie made with duck and decided to recreate it at home, just for herself, using mashed potatoes and a piece of store-bought, fat-encased duck confit.\u201cMost people are taught from a young age to be kind and generous to other people,\u201d said Ms. Miller. \u201cWhy not turn some of that kindness and generosity toward yourself?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Can\u2019t Afford to Ignore Its Dire Economic Outlook", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeither of the two presidential candidates has offered a comprehensive plan for an increasingly shaky economy.Dr. de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Driven by anger, resentment and a desire to obliterate the establishment, Brazilians chose on Sunday two presidential candidates at the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum. Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-right firebrand who has spoken fondly of the country\u2019s bygone military dictatorship, and the left-wing Fernando Haddad, from the corruption-mired Brazil\u2019s Worker\u2019s Party, will now face off in a second round of voting on Oct. 28. The economy has not fully recovered from the recession of 2015-16, the worst ever to hit the country. Growth has resumed, but not enough to create jobs for the more than 13 million unemployed Brazilian workers. Inflation has been contained, despite recent financial market turbulence, but wages are stagnant. Most ominous, Brazil has high and uncontrolled deficits and a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that are unsustainable. These challenges require comprehensive action: spending cuts and tax increases, accompanied by pension reform. Without urgent moves, debt could reach 100 percent of G.D.P. in the next two years, leaving the government unable to finance itself. A fiscal crisis would tip the country back into recession, slashing even more jobs in an already grim labor market.Mr. Bolsonaro or Mr. Haddad will have no choice but to face up to this dire outlook. But so far, neither candidate seems willing to do so. Although austerity could hurt growth in the short term, the only way to reduce the widening gap between revenues and expenditures is by paying the price of a weaker economy now to guarantee the return of stability and growth later. The politics of the moment will complicate this prescription.  The next president will face a highly fragmented Congress; 30 political parties will have seats in the next session, up from 28. And neither candidate has the right political experience to build stable coalitions.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s party, the Social Liberal Party, known as the PSL, made big gains Sunday, winning 52 seats to the lower house of Congress. It\u2019s now the second biggest party in Congress, behind Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT. And Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also look likely to win governorships in key states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, in the runoff on Oct. 28. But Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to halve the number of cabinet positions to reduce costs, and this may hurt his ability to forge a stable coalition. Brazil has some 29 cabinet posts \u2014 much too many. Coalitions are built by handing off cabinet jobs to allied parties. If there are fewer cabinet positions on offer, the incentive for political parties to align with the president is lowered, making legislation much more difficult to pass. Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT holds 56 seats in Congress, a decrease from 2014 but still the most in Congress. As president, he would face hostility from Bolsonaro-supporting governors, who have a lot of influence in Congress, helping to shape policies or hampering reform. Mr. Haddad, if elected, would also have to confront anger toward his party for recent corruption scandals. Many former members of PT\u2019s leadership are in prison, including former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Despite these political challenges, we still have little idea what the candidates would do for the economy, less than three weeks from the runoff. In previous elections, candidates presented comprehensive economic plans. Not this time. Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad have been vague and general when discussing the economy. To be fair, Brazilian voters have been mainly concerned about corruption and violence. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympic Games in 2016, has had such a spike in violence that federal government ordered a military intervention. Brazilians have wanted to hear candidates\u2019 plans for cleaning up the government and restoring law and order.Mr. Bolsonaro, in choosing a prominent, pro-market chief economic adviser, has hinted that he plans to embrace a more liberal economic philosophy. But he is known to have nationalistic views, with a preference for state intervention to drive growth \u2014 not unlike policies that the PT has pursued in the recent past. Some observers appear to believe that his views have changed \u2014 but in the absence of detailed plans, there\u2019s little reason to believe that. Mr. Haddad has also failed to offer much substance. Although he has vowed to study the pension crisis, he has not recognized that reform is necessary. Moreover, he has defended the need for a strong public investment program to create jobs, but he has not explained where the money will come from. Mr. Haddad has talked loosely about the need for tax reform, but there\u2019s no clarity on what measures it would entail. It is likely that he would need to bow to the wishes of the left-wing PT leadership and thus avoid politically unpopular fiscal reforms. Following Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s strong showing on Sunday, the currency rallied and stock markets rose. Markets dipped on Wednesday, as they did around the globe, but enough investors appear to believe that Mr. Bolsonaro, if elected, will deliver pension and fiscal reform. Yet we don\u2019t have good reason to be sure. No matter what happens on Oct. 28, the economic outlook is bleak. Brazil\u2019s problems are far from over, and the two presidential candidates don\u2019t appear to have the plans or the political capital to make the necessary reforms. There is still too little to cheer in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.Monica de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Did Fish First Evolve? The Answer May Be Shallow", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesSome had armor and spikes. Many lacked jaws. They evolved in the shallow coasts around supercontinents and they were some of our earliest ancestors with spines.More than 400 million years ago, ancient oceans were teeming with many fish that might seem alien in today\u2019s seas.Scientists have long wondered where in the sea these extinct fish groups and their living relatives first evolved. Was it the open ocean? Perhaps on coral reefs? Or maybe in the depths of the abyss?Figuring out the answer has been difficult. While there\u2019s an abundance of fish fossils from about 420 million years ago, the ancient fossil record gets scarce farther back at about 480 million years ago, when fish are believed to have first appeared. To better understand the ancient evolutionary history of fish, the researchers trawled through the scientific literature and created a database with more than 2,700 fossil records of jawed and jawless fish from every continent that stretched from 480 million to 360 million years ago. The database allowed the team to determine where in the ocean the ancient fish groups lived and evolved.\u201cPreviously we thought the early reef systems would be the cradle of diversification,\u201d said Dr. Coates. \u201cBut no, it seems that these early armored forms were in much nearer shore environments. That explains why our early record is so cryptic.\u201dThe team is not exactly sure why fish evolved near the coast in clear, shallow lagoons and intertidal zones that were typically no deeper than about 100 feet. They think it may have to do with the waves, sea level changes, runoffs, rainfalls and other environmental factors of shallow water habitats.The team also found that as the fish evolved in the shallow water, the more flexible swimmers, like the thelodonts, eventually left and invaded deeper areas like coral reefs and the deep sea.

Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, says he is returning to his roots: He has re-registered as a Democrat \u2014 an initial but essential step toward a possible run for president in 2020 as a Democrat.Mr. Bloomberg made the announcement in simultaneous social media postings on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which showed the left-handed 76-year-old filing out his registration paperwork (and also, incidentally, the absence of his middle \u201cR\u201d initial).\u201cAt key points in U.S. history, one of the two parties has served as a bulwark against those who threaten our Constitution,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg wrote, adding later, \u201cWe need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs.\u201dMr. Bloomberg had abandoned the Democratic Party to launch his political career in 2001 and win the mayoralty in New York City as a Republican. But he noted on Wednesday that he had been a Democrat \u201cfor most of my life.\u201dHe ended nearly two decades of estrangement, inspired by what he said was the call of history and the need for an opposition party to provide on a check on President Trump.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s centrist politics are very likely to create some friction with the current activist class of the Democratic Party, including his views on Wall Street regulations and the stop-and-frisk police tactics he embraced as mayor. He also would be 78 on Election Day in 2020 \u2014 older than anyone elected president.The spending is expected to make him the single biggest political contributor in the country in 2018. \u201cHis name is synonymous with excellence,\u201d the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, gushed earlier this year.This Tuesday, back in New York, Mr. Bloomberg hosted a fund-raiser for Phil Bredesen, the former Democratic governor of Tennessee and current candidate for United States Senate.Mr. Bloomberg is not solely backing Democrats this year; in June, he held a fund-raiser for Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, with whom he worked closely following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Still, his re-registration as a Democrat is not a shock.In that interview, Mr. Bloomberg hinted that he might formally register as a Democrat, saying he would \u201clook at it\u201d but had no imminent plans.\u201cI think at the moment, there\u2019s no reason to do anything,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said then, of changing his registration. \u201cBut if I think \u2014 if I wanted to change parties and I thought it sent the right message, I would do it.\u201dMr. Bloomberg\u2019s registration announcement comes ahead of New York\u2019s deadline later this week and after the deadline has passed in more than a dozen states in recent days.Alexander Burns contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make America America Again", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElect Democrats and win back the House or the Senate.Opinion ColumnistWhat is there left to say about the terrible murder of moderate Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its aftermath? Only one thing, and I have said it before, but I feel it even more strongly now: In the midterm elections, vote for a Democrat, canvass for a Democrat, raise money for a Democrat, drive someone else to a voting station to vote for a Democrat.I don\u2019t say that because I\u2019m particularly liberal and want to shift the whole country to the liberal agenda. I say that because I\u2019m particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy and politics. President Trump has spent two years attacking our best values \u2014 truth and trust \u2014 and I believe that Democrats getting a lever of power is necessary, but not sufficient, to reverse that.Democrats could blow it if they get back a lever of power and use it just to bully Trump and Republicans the same way he has them. But I\u2019ll take that chance. Because there is a basic respect for truth, science and decency in the Democratic caucus and because I know that two more years of the G.O.P. holding every lever of power and blindly following Trump\u2019s basic disrespect for truth, science and decency will make it impossible to elevate America\u2019s best values.Truth without power today is just background Muzak to the march of the Trump administration.You see, I can write that it is vitally important for global stability and the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of Khashoggi be punished. But if Democrats do not control either the House or the Senate, I fear Trump will try to avoid any meaningful U.S. censure of Riyadh or its top leaders, if they are proven culpable.I can write that the president, by telling us that we must weigh a $110 billion Saudi arms purchase against taking a moral stand on Khashoggi\u2019s murder, is literally telling us the price of our values \u2014 about $333.33 for every American. (Your check is in the mail.) But if you think, as I do, that countries that sell out their core values for financial gain suffer in the long run or if you think that such a country is not the America you want us to be, and that the world needs us to be, then you need to vote for a Democrat for the House and the Senate.I can write that a president who praises a U.S. politician who body slammed a journalist for politely asking a valid question \u2014 and who is utterly indifferent to the plight of jailed democracy advocates and journalists from Egypt to Turkey to the Arabian Peninsula to the Philippines \u2014 is giving license to thugs all over the world. But that criticism will never have any impact if Democrats control neither the House nor the Senate.But not a finger will be lifted to prevent any of these devastating outcomes unless Democrats control at least the House or the Senate.I can write that the growing tribalization of our politics, the notion that members of the other party are not just opponents but \u201cenemies\u201d who must be crushed, is being fueled by a president who has no desire to be president of all the people, but rather only his base, and who delights in dividing us and insulting people, thereby debasing his office. But it will be impossible to impose any accountability on Trump for his toxic behavior and reverse the tone of incivility that has overtaken U.S. politics if the Democrats do not control either the House or the Senate.I can write that it is impossible to have a healthy democracy when our president spews a steady stream of lies every day, has denounced the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, refused to take seriously Russian interference in our elections and still has not revealed his tax returns. But this president will continue soiling our institutions and his office unless Democrats control at least the House or the Senate and can impose penalties for such corrosive behavior.I could write that one reason the Saudis probably thought they could cross a red line with their depraved murder of Khashoggi was that Trump never appointed an ambassador to Riyadh \u2014 relying instead on his and his son-in-law\u2019s personal contacts with the Saudi ruler \u2014 and because Trump regularly denounced journalists as purveyors of fake news. Why Trump never sent an ambassador to Saudi Arabia needs to be investigated, but it won\u2019t if Democrats do not control the House or the Senate.One day I hope the truth will be enough again. One day I hope great journalism will be enough again. But today only a lever of power \u2014 the House or the Senate \u2014 will make it so. Facts, science and truth \u2014 without power \u2014 are just leaves floating through the air in the age of Trump, scattering aimlessly without impact.Nothing else matters. Pass it on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Geoff Emerick, 72, Dies; Recorded the Beatles in Their Prime", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeoff Emerick, a sound engineer who recorded, among others, the Beatles, helping to shape the band\u2019s ever-evolving music on pivotal albums like \u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d died on Tuesday. He was 72.Mr. Emerick was just out of Crouch End Secondary Modern School in North London in 1962 when he was hired for an entry-level job as an assistant engineer at EMI\u2019s Abbey Road studios. In his memoir, \u201cHere, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles\u201d (2006), written with Howard Massey, Mr. Emerick described his second day on the job, when he watched as the producer George Martin brought in his newly signed foursome \u2014 Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr \u2014 for an early recording session.\u201cIt\u2019s almost embarrassing to admit today,\u201d Mr. Emerick wrote, \u201cbut what struck me most about the Beatles when I first saw them was their skinny knit ties.\u201d He bought himself one, and he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cWithin a short time,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit seemed like everyone at EMI was wearing them.\u201dMr. Emerick assisted on some of the Beatles\u2019 first records while also working on other projects for the studio, including classical recordings. Then, in 1966, he was chosen to replace Norman Smith (who became a producer) as the group\u2019s chief engineer.His first record in that capacity was \u201cRevolver,\u201d the 1966 album that included \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d and the otherworldly \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d The next year came \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s,\u201d one of the most innovative and influential albums of the era.It was Mr. Emerick\u2019s job as engineer to figure out how to create and capture the sounds that the band was after. With the Beatles reaching for new levels of musical complexity, that wasn\u2019t easy.\u201cIf there was going to be a piano used on a track, or a guitar, it was always John or Paul or George saying, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t want it to sound like a piano or a guitar,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Emerick told The Boston Globe in 1987. \u201cI had no gimmick boxes to play with, like there are today. All we had was tape machines, and four tracks.\u201dMr. Emerick also engineered later Beatles albums, including \u201cAbbey Road\u201d (1969), and he engineered or produced solo albums by Mr. McCartney and albums by Elvis Costello, Art Garfunkel, the group America and many more.Mr. Martin\u2019s son Giles wrote on Twitter, \u201cWe have all been touched by the sounds he helped create on the greatest music ever recorded.\u201dGeoffrey Ernest Emerick was born in London on Dec. 5, 1945. His father was a butcher, his mother a homemaker. There was no information on survivors immediately available.As a child he surprised his parents by plunking out songs on his grandfather\u2019s piano that he had heard on the radio, playing them by ear. As he grew older he became interested in the electronics behind the record player and radio he listened to, and as a teenager he made a fateful trip to an annual trade show where the latest technology was on display.The BBC was doing a live orchestral broadcast, and young Geoff was particularly fascinated by the fellow at the mysterious console who was turning knobs and dials \u2014 the sound engineer, he would come to learn. He would soon tell his school guidance counselor that he was interested in a job in that field; it was the counselor who first heard about the job opening at EMI.In the studio, Mr. Emerick did not necessarily want everything to be perfect.Mr. Emerick\u2019s engineering tended to have a D.I.Y. quality; sounds might be found anywhere. Speaking of clocks, in his book he said the alarm clock heard partway into \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d the seminal final track on \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s,\u201d came from a windup clock on the piano.\u201cLennon had brought it in as a gag one day, saying that it would come in handy for waking up Ringo when he was needed for an overdub,\u201d he wrote.In a 2017 interview with Variety, Mr. Emerick called the complex, layered \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d one of the highlights of his years with the Beatles.\u201cThe night we put the orchestra on it,\u201d he said, \u201cthe whole world went from black and white to color.\u201dIt would not be long before all of the seat-of-the-pants flourishes Mr. Emerick helped the Beatles create for those late-1960s records would be easily accomplished with synthesizers and such. He said the fact that the albums were not made that way has helped them endure, especially \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the human aspect,\u201d he told The Globe in 1987. \u201cEverything on the album was done human-ly. There was no electronic gimmickry on it; it was all done with mechanics and imagination.\u201dMr. Emerick won a Grammy Award for engineering that album, as well as for \u201cAbbey Road\u201d and Mr. McCartney\u2019s 1973 album \u201cBand on the Run.\u201dGiven the sophistication of \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s,\u201d it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that Mr. Emerick had barely turned 20 when he was tasked with helping to get the Beatles\u2019 vision on tape. It was, he recalled 50 years later in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a daunting challenge.\u201cJohn came into the control room on that first day and said, \u2018We\u2019re never gonna tour again and we\u2019re gonna make an album that\u2019s gonna have sounds on it and things on it that no one has ever heard before.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Emerick remembered. \u201cAnd everyone looked at me, and I know what I\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve got nothing!\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Cooks Embrace the Instant Pot", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThe electric pressure cooker is well suited for many Indian dishes, and a slew of new cookbooks are seizing on its popularity.When the cookbook author and food editor Chandra Ram was a child visiting relatives in India, the sounds coming from the kitchen would make her jump.The electric pressure cooker that Ms. Ram was using on a recent evening to saut\u00e9 onions and green chile in her Chicago apartment, on the other hand, would be a much calmer experience. It cooks more evenly and efficiently, without the stovetop pot\u2019s noisy need to let off steam.Ms. Ram was making shrimp biryani. After the rice and shrimp had cooked for a mere three minutes, Ms. Ram twisted the vent, which sent forth a rush of spicy vapor with a companionable whoosh. Scented with turmeric, ginger and fresh curry leaves, the biryani was far more complex and fragrant than anything you might ever hope to make in under half an hour on a weeknight. And yet she had.Of all the genres of electric pressure cooker cookbooks, there are more for Indian food than for any other cuisine. More than keto. More than paleo. More than vegan.Kormas, biryanis, dals and curries are particularly well suited to the moist environment of a pressurized pot, and Indian home cooks have made use of the stovetop cooker for generations. The electric version makes cooking these dishes even more convenient, streamlining the process and often eliminating the need for several different pots and pans. And without the whistle, it\u2019s quieter.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting moment for Knopf,\u201d the book\u2019s editor, Lexy Bloom, said, \u201cit\u2019s our first Instant Pot cookbook, and we are marketing it to several communities. There are people who are already familiar with the Instant Pot and want to go deeper, the people who love Indian food but are looking for easier, faster recipes, and then fans of Madhur.\u201dMs. Jaffrey had never used an electric pressure cooker before writing the book, but, like most cooks from India, where the Instant Pot has not officially been rolled out, she was well versed in the whistling stovetop kind.\u201cI do not know when pressure cookers found such wide usage in India, but they have been firmly entrenched in Indian kitchens for at least 40 years,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cWhen people give you a recipe they say: \u2018Cook it for two whistles,\u2019 or \u2018Cook it for three whistles,\u2019 and everyone understands what they mean.\u201d For example, a typical recipe for rajma, spiced red kidney beans, will call for soaking the beans overnight, then cooking them for three or four whistles. In an electric pressure cooker, that translates to 30 minutes, no soaking.It took some trial and error to convert Ms. Jaffrey\u2019s classic Indian recipes to an electric pressure cooker \u2014 even those she was already making in a stovetop model \u2014 and figure out which settings (pressure, steam, saut\u00e9, slow cook) worked best for each particular recipe.\u201cThis is an Instant Pot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is not a Magic Pot. It will make food for you but, rather like a computer, you have to create the programming that gives you the perfect dish.\u201d When Ms. Pitre was writing her cookbook, her goal was to make the recipes faster, simpler and more accessible to a wide variety of cooks.\u201cI wanted to use the science behind pressure cooking to make Indian food easier,\u201d she said.She tested and retested, taking out steps to see if the dishes ended up tasting just as good without them. Now she rarely browns her onions or her meats before pressure-cooking them. And instead of creating a custom spice blend for many recipes, she substitutes garam masala, which is easy to find in any large supermarket.\u201cMy audience is non-Indians who love Indian food, and second-generation Indians who want to cook Indian food but are intimidated,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe Indian audience has been my hardest audience to crack. They look at the recipes and say, that\u2019s not traditional.\u201dFor some second-generation Indian cooks, the notion of using a stovetop pressure cooker as their parents and grandparents did was a barrier to cooking Indian food.Riya Patel, a 22-year-old research lead for a tech accelerator in Washington, D.C., was given an Instant Pot when she graduated from college.\u201cAll of my Indian friends who graduated got one from their moms, so they would cook more Indian food,\u201d she said, adding that she would never use a stovetop cooker.\u201cI was in charge of counting the whistles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of the worst sounds of my childhood. It still freaks me out.\u201dNow with her Instant Pot, she cooks dishes like rajma, lamb keema, and biryani much more often because, she said, \u201cwhat used to take four hours now takes five minutes, and I don\u2019t need to supervise it.\u201dFor Ms. Ram, who grew up in Kentucky and never felt Indian enough when she visited her family in Visakhapatnam, on the Bay of Bengal, not owning a stovetop pressure cooker was yet another thing that separated her from her cousins.\u201cThe Instant Pot made this big part of my culture accessible to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I got my Instant Pot, I felt like I was cooking dumbed down Indian food. Now I feel like I\u2019m doing the real thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But efforts to erect barriers to the ballot box are wrong regardless of whether they decide the outcome of an election. If Democrats turn out in large numbers on Nov. 6, as the early-voting data suggests is happening in some key states, it will be in spite of these barriers, not because they didn\u2019t exist or didn\u2019t matter.Despite rampant suppression efforts, there is some hope. In seven states, ballot initiatives would restore voting rights to ex-felons, make it easier to register to vote and crack down on gerrymandering. If these pass, we could see 2018 as a turning point for expanding voting rights, instead of an election tainted by voter suppression.

{"Headline": "James Beard Foundation Makes Changes to Diversify Its Awards", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe changes were announced Tuesday and go into effect immediately, in time for the coming nomination season, which begins this month and culminates in a black-tie ceremony in May.Most notably, the powerful volunteer committees that govern which restaurants, chefs, media outlets and publications are nominated for medals will aim to be at least as diverse as the United States population. The larger groups of judges who vote on winners will face a similar mandate.The committees, which will initially use Census Bureau statistics as a guide, won\u2019t remove members to achieve racial and gender parity, but rather will fill vacancies or expand the committees to increase diversity, she said.The leadership awards, which focus on issues of food justice, public health and sustainable practices, are also undergoing a modest renovation. Instead of selecting winners from a list generated by both a standing committee and previous winners, the awards will allow the public to nominate people. For the first time, winners will receive $10,000.The foundation is also waiving some media entry fees in an effort to attract new voices. First-time entrants in the journalism awards may submit work without charge. Entry fees for its other media categories, including books, broadcast and design, will be waived for the first two weeks of the submission period, which begins Oct. 15. (Restaurants and chefs don\u2019t pay to enter.)The changes come during what has been a challenging year for the Beard Foundation, which handed out its first awards in 1991 and has become the premier vehicle to recognize chefs, restaurateurs and food media in the United States.Like much of the restaurant industry, the organization has been reckoning with systematic sexual harassment, as well as racial and gender imbalance.The foundation will continue to ask judges to factor in restaurant culture and leadership values when suggesting possible winners. \u201cExtra time for fact-checking has been built into the foundation\u2019s schedule to ensure nominees and winners are vetted to the best of our capabilities,\u201d the foundation said in a statement on Tuesday.\u201cWe want to keep the momentum of last year\u2019s awards moving forward, which we don\u2019t want people to think for any reason was some kind of a fluke,\u201d Ms. Quatrano said. \u201cThese are still merit-based awards.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But when love is true, you embrace all the unknowns, regardless.I am 44, in a complicated romantic situation, never been married. I am no expert on love. I love the idea of love but I have lived and loved long enough to recognize that there is a difference between the idea of love and the reality of love.You never really know if a marriage or relationship will last a lifetime. You can want that. You can work hard to make a relationship work and have the best of intentions and still, things might not work out but that doesn\u2019t mean you have wasted your time or failed. Many people who choose divorce are completely fine with it because they know the difference between the idea of love and the reality of love. They know there is nothing to be gained from staying in a marriage simply because the idea of love demands pretending everything is fine when such is not the case. What may seem cavalier to you is most likely a decision that has been agonized over. Few people take divorce lightly because it is a profoundly painful thing to end a commitment you nurtured and fought for and hoped would last a lifetime.In your letter, you are very much focused on what could be rather than what is. You worry about choosing wrong but are not considering that you might choose right for a lifetime or right for a moment. When you meet someone and start dating, you have no idea where things will lead. You have hopes, yes, and dreams, but you also have to get from one day to the next, getting to know a person, deciding to deepen the relationship and, sometimes, choosing to formalize a commitment. It is so very important to know what you want from a relationship but you also have to create space for a relationship to develop without worrying about what the relationship will or won\u2019t become. You have to be in the relationship in the present, from one day to the next, and some of those days will be glorious, but some of them are going to be a complete disaster. You would like a marriage to last a lifetime, but you are, perhaps, overlooking what it takes to love someone for a lifetime. You are overlooking the small joys and sorrows and frustrations of threading all the days that make up a lifetime of loving someone.Ask 33 people about the difference between loving someone, being in love and soul mates, and you will get 33 different answers, so I will simply tell you what these things are to me. I must also warn you, I am a passionate, foolish romantic. I believe in love and grand gestures. I am all about the chase, seduction and woo, not just during the shimmering early days of a relationship but also years in when you\u2019re thinking about the maddening ways your person behaves but still, isn\u2019t today a good day to send them some sunflowers or bring them their favorite coffee?Loving someone is recognizing the role they play or have played in your life and honoring that presence. Sometimes, love feels like an obligation but it is one you are willing to fulfill. Sometimes it takes hard work but you are willing to put in that work. Love is the constant you hold on to when you don\u2019t particularly like the one you love. Love is recognizing the ways in which, for better and worse, someone has contributed to your life. Being in love is wild, breathtaking, infuriating. It is butterflies in your stomach when you think about your person, when you see them, when you hold them. It\u2019s the electricity when your skin meets. It\u2019s smiling at your person with wide eyes and an open heart and seeing them smile back at you in the same way. It\u2019s wanting to hold someone\u2019s hand, even when your hand is hot, a little sweaty. It\u2019s lust and the heat of wanting, wanting, wanting. It\u2019s seeing who someone truly is, the best and most terrible parts of them, and choosing not to look away from everything you see, actively embracing everything you see. It\u2019s the willingness to have difficult but honest conversations. It\u2019s compromising on the structure of your relationship. It\u2019s about patience and being flexible and getting irritated or furious with a person but still holding on. It\u2019s wanting to be the best version of yourself for your person but also for yourself, especially for yourself. It\u2019s the pride you feel in their accomplishments and being as happy for their successes as you are for your own, if not more. It\u2019s their hurts becoming your hurts. It\u2019s feeling their absence when you are apart and the rush of joy when that absence ends. It\u2019s liking someone as much as you love them, being interested in who they are, marveling at the ways they are interested in you. It\u2019s a gut instinct. You just feel it. You know it in your bones. It isn\u2019t perfect, not at all. It doesn\u2019t need to be. It is, simply, what fills you up.As for soul mates, I did not believe such a thing existed until I did. A soul mate is someone so deeply part of you that they feel like a vital organ, living outside of your skin. They are the hottest part of the sun, your true north, your home, the one from whom you will never walk away, no matter what the material conditions of your relationship might be. Your soul mate is the one you wait for knowing no matter what happens, that they are worth the wait. Your soul mate is the person you choose because you look at them, always and think, \u201cYou \u2026 there you are.\u201dBut it truly doesn\u2019t matter how I or anyone else understand love. You get to decide what loving someone, being in love with someone and having a soul mate mean. You get to choose the kind of person you want to spend your life with and for how long and what that relationship looks like. You get to fight for what you want so long as the person you love is fighting alongside you. I hope you find that person you are looking for. I hope when you meet him, you don\u2019t worry about how the relationship might end. I hope you find joy and fulfillment in the very act of loving and being loved, no matter what may come.\u201cAsk Roxane\u201d is an advice column that appears periodically in The New York Times Opinion section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pope and the Accusers", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan Francis change the church while stonewalling on sex abuse?Opinion ColumnistLet me ask you to do the impossible, tear your mind away from the Kavanaugh affair for a moment, and cast your eyes from the new Rome to the old one \u2014 from the American Empire\u2019s judicial wars to the similar mix of scandal, polarization, and intrigue in the Roman Catholic Church.This month the crux of the drama is the Synod on Young People, a meeting of bishops in Rome that like prior synods in the Francis era is a chance for the pope to prod some alteration of church teaching on sexuality through a process stage-managed to give the appearance of consensus.No such consensus was evident in the prior two synods, in which the contested issue was divorce and remarriage, but the pope forged ahead with an ambiguous revision of church teaching, currently half-digested around the Catholic world. This time, thanks to his appointments there are fewer bishops in opposition, and the synod\u2019s endgame is probably some ambiguously liberalizing statement on homosexuality, contraception or both.The promise of such change would normally guarantee the pontiff a wave of favorable media coverage. But glowing profiles of Francis are no longer easy to write, because the pope is now besieged by sexual scandal and his initial response was in a style familiar from Trump-era American politics \u2014 a mix of stonewalling, scapegoating and literal demonization.[Hear Ross debate Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt each week on \u201cThe Argument,\u201d the new Opinion podcast from The New York Times.]To Francis\u2019s allies much of the scandal is dismissed as a plot by his enemies, an attempted coup by frustrated conservatives.The truth is that Francis can pre-empt the right-wing partisans with a Roman housecleaning, an American investigation, an accounting for both his own record and his predecessors\u2019 failures. Perhaps all this will happen. The alternative, silence and stonewalling, promises a church permanently in flames.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What \u2018Justice\u2019 Really Means", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEThe word has taken a beating in the past few weeks. But what role does it truly play in our lives? Mr. Bloomfield is a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut. The virtue of justice requires not only that we judge others fairly, but also that we judge ourselves fairly. This is no mean feat. The trouble is that if a person is a poor judge of him or herself, it is hard to imagine that person being a good judge of others. Bias toward the self often leads to bias against others. Justice begins within ourselves.While justice is important for each of us in our personal lives, it becomes strikingly important when we think of those in positions of power. We need leaders motivated by a love of justice and not merely self-aggrandizement. Leadership without an inner moral compass reliably pointing toward justice inevitably ends in the abuse of power.Philosophically, all virtues are ideals that we can only approach without fully attaining them. So, we can always aspire to do better. Given this, what role does the virtue of justice play in our personal lives? What role ought it to play?The apotheosis of justice is the courtroom judge, interpreting the law and ruling on evidence concerning innocence and guilt. Model judges are epistemically just: Their cognitive processes are never biased or unduly swayed, their conclusions are not prejudged, and their verdicts reliably correspond to the facts. Truth is their goal. Not only must there be no thumb on the scale, the evidence must be balanced while wearing a blindfold. The rulings of judges, however, are also undeniably moral, bearing as they do on issues of justice, restitution and the execution of punishment.Just people are wise in the ways of fairness, equality, desert and mercy. They are normally pacific. Just people mind their own business, except when they see and call out injustice, speaking truth to power, which they\u2019ll do even at a personal cost. Justice questions authority.Just people also question themselves. This makes them honest and non-self-deceptive. They vigilantly maintain a clear conscience. Just people are cognizant of their own mistakes and faults, and so they are forgiving of others. They respect who they actually are and not whom they merely wish they were, and their authentic self-respect makes them respectful of others. People who are just do as they say and say as they do: their word is their bond. They are capable of great loyalty and fidelity, but not without limit.From sidewalk sexual harassment to the obstruction of justice, all abuses of power involve an unjust willingness to greedily arrogate more than one\u2019s due. Typically, those who abuse their strength or cheat, and then don\u2019t get caught or punished, self-deceptively think they\u2019ve \u201cbeaten the system\u201d and \u201cwon.\u201d But fooling others into thinking you have earned a victory is not the same as genuinely being victorious. Cheaters fool themselves when they elide this difference.The other way to fail justice is by judging ourselves to be less worthy than we truly are. This is sadly common among oppressed people, but it also arises among the affluent and powerful under the guise of the \u201cimpostor syndrome.\u201d Humility has its place, but we shouldn\u2019t overdo it, nor let it interfere with the intellectual courage required to call out injustice. Those who unfairly put themselves down or are servile, for whatever reason, are doing themselves an injustice by willfully accepting less than their fair share.Given all this, the virtue of justice plays an important role in families and friendships, between neighbors and citizens, colleagues and clients, acquaintances and strangers. But it is also central to being a good person and living happily, and not merely deceiving oneself into believing that one is a good person and that one is happy.Bringing justice fully into our lives, thinking in terms of it, will make us more circumspect. We are all too fallible. But it is often the case that we are much better at spotting the faults of others than we are at spotting faults in ourselves. Our blind spots are conveniently located to keep us from seeing our own weaknesses. What a coincidence!Life is neither just nor fair: Good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. This, however, only increases our obligation to be as just and fair as we can be, to be honest with ourselves as well as others, to try to correct injustice when we see it, and to do as much right in this unfair world as we can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Genetic Sleuthing Helped a Kidnapped Girl Recover Her Identity", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSixteen years later, the man who abandoned Lisa was arrested on charges of killing his girlfriend. When investigators looked into his history, they began to wonder if he was Lisa\u2019s father after all. A DNA test showed he was not related, and it seemed likely he\u2019d kidnapped her as a baby.Lisa\u2019s kidnapper died in prison in 2010, without revealing any clues to Lisa\u2019s past. By then she was in her early 30s, married with kids of her own. She still often wondered: who was she really?One night, Lisa saw a TV program about how DNA testing was helping people learn about their roots. She contacted Peter Headley, a detective who had tried unsuccessfully to find her real identity years before. Maybe this approach would help them?Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent lawyer and volunteer with the organization, offered to help search for Lisa\u2019s identity.But how do you identify someone with no name, no place of birth and no birthdate?For years, adoptees and the \u201csearch angels\u201d who volunteer to help them have used genealogy websites and public records to try to find unknown parents.An adopted child will typically have at least one piece of biographical data, such as a birthdate. But in this case, all Lisa had was her DNA. (Lisa declined to be interviewed but consented to having Dr. Rae-Venter and Mr. Headley recount the story of the investigation.)Family relationships can be estimated by the amount of DNA shared by two people:Great-Great-GrandparentsGreat-Great-Aunt or Uncle3\u201313%Great-Grandparents7\u201322%Great-Auntor Uncle4\u201331%First Cousintwice removed1\u20138%Grandmother or Grandfather17\u201334%Aunt orUncle20\u201332%First Cousinonce removed2\u201313%Second Cousinonce removed0\u20135%Mother or FatherSELF(100%)Sibling33\u201350%First Cousin8\u201318%Second Cousin1\u20138%Third Cousin0\u20133%Niece orNephew20\u201332%First Cousinonce removed2\u201313%Second Cousinonce removed0\u20135%Third Cousinonce removed0\u20133%Child49\u201355%Great-Nieceor Nephew4\u201331%First Cousintwice removed1\u20138%Second Cousintwice removed0\u20134%Third Cousintwice removed0\u20132%Grandchild17\u201334%Great-Grandparents7\u201322%Great-Auntor Uncle4\u201331%GrandparentsAunt orUncle20\u201332%1st Cousinonce removed2\u201313%Parent49\u201355%1st Cousin8\u201318%2nd Cousin1\u20138%SELF(100%)1st Cousinonce removed2\u201313%2nd Cousinonce removed0\u20135%Child49\u201355%1st Cousintwice removed1\u20138%2nd Cousintwice removed0\u20134%Grandchild17\u201334%Had Lisa been very lucky and matched with someone who shared 25 percent of her DNA, that person could have been a grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew.To understand how Lisa was related to her three newfound cousins, Dr. Rae-Venter had to convince them to upload their DNA profiles to GEDmatch, which has advanced tools for comparing genetic and family tree data.But the cousins were suspicious of the claim that their DNA could help a kidnapped woman find her real identity.Eventually, Dr. Rae-Venter and detectives convinced Paul and Adam that it was not a scam, and they agreed to help. (With the exception of Adam, who asked to be identified, family members\u2019 names are pseudonyms used by researchers to protect the family\u2019s privacy.)When Dr. Rae-Venter compared Lisa\u2019s DNA sequence with Paul\u2019s DNA, she found they had a surprisingly large match on the X chromosome.The X chromosome was a hint that they must be related through Paul's maternal line. (A son typically inherits a single X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father, while a daughter inherits an X from each parent.)12345678910111213141516171819202122X12345678910111213141516171819202122X12345678910111213141516171819202122XPaul had already assembled an extensive family tree of his own, and Dr. Rae-Venter began to narrow it down. Based on their relative ages \u2014 Lisa was around 35, less than half Paul\u2019s age \u2014 and from the percentage of matching DNA, Dr. Rae-Venter estimated that Lisa was likely Paul\u2019s first cousin twice removed, on his mother\u2019s side.Paul\u2019sGrandfatherPaul\u2019sGrandmotherPaul\u2019sFatherPaul\u2019sMotherPaul\u2019sMaternal AuntPaul\u2019sFirst CousinPaulLisa\u2019sParent?Lisa?Paul\u2019sGrandfatherPaul\u2019sGrandmotherPaul\u2019sFatherPaul\u2019sMotherPaul\u2019sMaternal AuntPaul\u2019sFirst CousinPaulLisa\u2019sParent?Lisa?Lisa\u2019s cousin Adam had been adopted, and had joined 23andMe to try to find his birth parents.A volunteer working with Dr. Rae-Venter found Adam\u2019s mother\u2019s maiden name in California birth records. It was an unusual name and family members were everywhere on Facebook, so within a few hours Adam\u2019s maternal line was mapped out and he\u2019d found photos of his mother and half-brother.\u201cI just immediately started crying,\u201d Adam said in an interview. \u201cTo go in just a few days time from feeling I'll never find anything else out about my family, to getting an email about a kidnapped girl and then getting all that. It was a whirlwind.\u201dAdam\u2019s birth mother agreed to a DNA test, which revealed that she was not related to Lisa. That meant that Adam must match Lisa through his father\u2019s family.Eventually, by researching Paul\u2019s large family tree, Dr. Rae-Venter identified a single branch in Southern California, where Adam was born, that seemed most likely to contain Adam\u2019s father.Adam was left unsure who his father was, but Dr. Rae-Venter now had enough information to connect Adam and Paul.Adam\u2019sGreat-Great-GrandfatherMarie is Paul\u2019s maternal grandmother and the most recent common ancestor of Paul, Adam and Lisa.Marie(died 1962)Adam\u2019s Great-GrandfatherAdam\u2019s Great-GrandmotherAdam\u2019sGrandfatherAdam\u2019sGrandmotherAdam\u2019sFatherAdam\u2019sMotherAdam\u2019sUncle JeanAdamMarie is the most recent common ancestor of Paul, Adam and Lisa.Marie(died 1962)Great-Great-GrandfatherGreat-GrandfatherGreat-GrandmotherAdam\u2019sGrandfatherAdam\u2019sGrandmotherAdam\u2019sFatherAdam\u2019sUncle JeanAdamComplicating the search, however, were ancestors with 10 or more children who sometimes married their cousins, creating dozens of branches that intersected in confusing ways.Peter become nearly as invested in the search as Dr. Rae-Venter was, scouring records and recruiting his cousins to take DNA tests and submit their own family trees.Eventually 120 family members joined a closed group where they could divvy up research tasks and share their findings. They spent thousands of hours sifting through birth, death and marriage records, handwritten church documents, social media profiles and newspaper clippings.Many of Lisa\u2019s closest genetic matches were from New Hampshire, and Dr. Rae-Venter developed a hunch that Lisa might be from there. One particular branch contained a woman, named in two relatives\u2019 obituaries, who seemed to be about the age that Lisa\u2019s mother should be.Adrian was skeptical and declined to help, but detectives eventually learned that his daughter had not been heard from since 1981, when she left with her boyfriend and daughter in what her family thought was an attempt to avoid debt collectors.Adrian eventually agreed to a DNA test, which confirmed he was Lisa\u2019s grandfather.Lisa\u2019sGreat-Great-GrandfatherMarie is the most recent common ancestor of Lisa, Paul and Adam, and the source of the matching DNA on Lisa and Paul\u2019s X chromosomes.Marie(died 1962)Lisa\u2019s Great-GrandfatherLisa\u2019s Great-GrandmotherLisa\u2019sGrandmotherAdrianLisa\u2019sFatherLisa\u2019sMotherLisaLisa\u2019sGreat-Great-GrandfatherMarie is the most recent common ancestor of Lisa, Paul and Adam.Marie(died 1962)Lisa\u2019s Great-GrandfatherLisa\u2019s Great-GrandmotherLisa\u2019sGrandmotherAdrianLisa\u2019sFatherLisa\u2019sMotherLisaAdditional investigative work suggested that the boyfriend of Lisa\u2019s mother had told her relatives they would be leaving town. Soon after that he likely killed Lisa\u2019s mother and kidnapped Lisa.As new matches emerged on 23andMe and Ancestry.com, Lisa\u2019s paternal side began to take shape.  Dr. Rae-Venter eventually narrowed Lisa\u2019s father down to one of five brothers who also lived in New Hampshire. All the brothers were married when Lisa was conceived and those who were located refused to be tested.This was far from a traditional happy ending: Lisa\u2019s father\u2019s family would not acknowledge her and her mother likely had been murdered. (Her body still has not been found.) But Dr. Rae-Venter explained that by then Lisa already had a sense that her mother might be dead, and she was grateful to finally have answers to questions that had long plagued her.The investigation helped detectives better understand the history of the con man who kidnapped Lisa and murdered her mother, and helped link him to other murders. In total, he\u2019s believed to have killed at least seven women and young girls.In recent months, dozens of other law enforcement agencies have experimented with this approach. But identifying a bit of blood from a crime scene has one major difference: only one genealogical database \u2014 GEDmatch \u2014 permits law enforcement uploads without a court order.But once a genetic profile is extracted from that blood and uploaded to GEDMatch, the steps are essentially the same: Find a highly skilled genetic genealogist to help you. Look for the closest relatives you can find. Search for common ancestors.  Build a family tree using genetic clues and public records until you\u2019ve found someone in the right location and the right age to be a suspect. Then have law enforcement collect their DNA and see if it matches the crime scene evidence.That process has lead to more than 10 arrests in the last five months, but has also sparked a public debate about privacy.In 2015, there were about one million people on Ancestry.com. Now there are around nine million. Other sites like GEDmatch and 23andMe have grown at similar rates, which makes it much easier to use DNA to find an unknown relative \u2014 or to identify a suspect.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different landscape for doing analysis in unknown-parentage cases,\u201d said Dr. Rae-Venter. She estimated that the search for Lisa\u2019s identity, which took her and other volunteers 20,000 hours three years ago, could now be done in just two days on her own.Sources: Barbara Rae-Venter; San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department; Institute for Genetic Genealogy.

{"Headline": "The Far-Reaching Threats of a Conservative Court", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill the Supreme Court wipe out the government protections that have shielded Americans from abusive business practices since the New Deal?Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, many people are wondering whether the conservative majority, which has taken a further step to the right with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, will overturn Roe v. Wade. But that\u2019s not where the action is. As two cases argued before the court this month illustrate, the real question is whether it will undermine the system of government that has protected the public from abusive business practices since the New Deal.Liberals might root against the government \u2014 the immigration and sex offender policies are harsh. But they should be careful what they wish for. The conservative majority can, and most likely will, rule against the government using broad theories that would also eat away at the constitutional foundations of the New Deal system, which is essential for protecting health and safety, the environment and much else.The New Deal agencies initially encountered resistance from the Supreme Court, which was then, like now, a reactionary institution that frowned on novelty. For one thing, when agencies issue regulations, they make law, which was the traditional prerogative of Congress. Moreover, the agencies were mostly overseen by the White House, which is not supposed to make law. And Congress also gave many regulatory agencies some autonomy \u2014 protecting staff from removal, for example \u2014 that seemed to infringe on the president\u2019s authority to supervise the executive branch.Eventually, common sense prevailed over these legalistic objections. Congress itself lacked the capacity to engage in the detailed regulation that is necessary to keep a modern economy humming while protecting workers and consumers. Agencies were needed. The executive branch was the sensible place to house agencies because the agencies combined both policymaking and enforcement functions. And agencies need some protection from political meddling.By the 1980s, half a century after the New Deal, a political and legal consensus in favor of the administrative state had solidified. Left and right argued about how much regulation was needed, of course, but no one doubted the constitutional foundations of the administrative state \u2014 not even Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading conservative lawyer of the past half century and an academic expert on administrative law before he ascended to the bench.But Brett Kavanaugh is a skeptic. And so are Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s first appointment to the Supreme Court, and Clarence Thomas, who was appointed back in 1991. The views of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are less clear, but their judicial opinions point in the same direction.The conservative assault on the administrative state has four elements.What is the basis for this radical change in the law? Justices Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Thomas claim to be \u201coriginalists,\u201d who believe that the court should strike down laws that violate the original understanding of the Constitution. But the founders did not bar Congress from creating administrative agencies or think that the First Amendment protected businesses from commercial regulation.The answer is both obvious and depressing. The modern conservative jurisprudence is an exercise in nostalgia, a yearning for pre-New Deal America when, supposedly, government was less oppressive and people were freer than they are today. You can see this nostalgia in the homilies to olden times in Justices Gorsuch\u2019s and Kavanaugh\u2019s lectures \u2014 and their insistence that answers to today\u2019s challenges can be found in a theory of government invented in the 18th century by men wearing breeches and powdered wigs.This jurisprudence appeals to many people in a populist era that distrusts experts, chafes at bureaucracy, fears change and longs for a simpler past. But like so much being peddled by ideologues and partisans these days, it\u2019s a sham. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Different Ends of NeverTrump", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre Trump's conservative critics really conservatives anymore?Opinion Columnist Earlier this month Jennifer Rubin, the prolific #NeverTrump pundit who writes for The Washington Post, got something that every columnist craves: a petition against her.As an op-ed conservative who opposed Trump and finds some of his policies indefensible, I have a self-interested resistance to this logic. Op-ed pages should seek intellectual diversity, including Trump-supporting diversity, but it\u2019s obviously possible to be a serious conservative and still oppose many of \u201cthe policies of our nation\u2019s elected president.\u201d And if most of your conservative columnists are hostile to a Republican president, that tells you something about his flaws that simply relabeling all his critics as liberals would obscure.But at the same time, labels do sometimes need to shift with political realities. The neoconservatives of the 1970s, former liberals who became Nixon or Reagan backers, eventually accepted the \u201cneocon\u201d description instead of calling themselves \u201cThe Real New Deal Democrats\u201d forever. And for an important part of the NeverTrump movement a similar shift may happen, so that within a few years figures like Rubin will just identify as centrist Democrats or left-libertarians or \u201cneo-neoliberals\u201d or some other term that\u2019s yet to be invented.This expectation doesn\u2019t apply to many NeverTrumpers. It doesn\u2019t fit Reaganite Trump-skeptics who hate the president's temperament but have been pleasantly surprised by his judicial appointments and tax cuts, or younger, heterodox conservatives who regard Trump himself as a bigot but consider his populist campaign a possible road map for the future.But an important group of NeverTrumpers identified with the right on a very specific set of issues \u2014 support for the 1990s-era free trade consensus, Wilsonian hawkishness, democracy promotion \u2014 that are unlikely to animate conservatism again any time soon no matter how the Trump presidency ends. These intellectuals and strategists aren\u2019t particularly culturally conservative, they\u2019re allergic to populism, they don\u2019t have any reason to identify with a conservatism that\u2019s wary of nation-building and globalization \u2014 and soon enough, they won\u2019t. People in this camp will remain interesting, as converts and apostates often are. But observers trying to imagine what a decent right might look like after Trump should look elsewhere \u2014 to thinkers and writers who basically accept the populist turn, and whose goal is to supply coherence and intellectual ballast, to purge populism of its bigotries and inject good policy instead.I don\u2019t know if any of these efforts can pull the post-Trump right away from anti-intellectualism and chauvinism. But their project is the one that matters to what conservatism is right now, not what it might have been had John McCain been elected president, or had the Iraq War been something other than a misbegotten mess, or had the 2000-era opening to China gone the way free traders hoped.And for anyone whose commitment to conservatism is defined by those now-lost possibilities, the logical turn to make goes left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Kisum\u00e9 in Melbourne, Australia", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare9 PhotosDescribed on its website as drawing on \u201cthe purity and integrity of Japanese cuisine while infusing it with Japanese sensibility,\u201d Kisum\u00e9 was originally overseen by the chef Kyungsoo Moon, who was recruited from Dubai. He is no longer with the company, but the format has not changed since his departure. (The current chef is Joshua Bedel.)The restaurant offers a number of experiences on its three levels: the top-floor chef\u2019s table, a 12-seat, $195 omakase experience ($165 at lunch); the ground-floor sushi bar, with a less expensive and more casual omakase; and a basement dining room where a large menu offers various izakaya-style dishes, noodles, salads, main courses, and sushi and sashimi combinations.The top floor also has a bar area named the Chablis Bar. What does a wine from northern Burgundy have to do with sushi, the menu asks? So much. In fact: \u201cEverything. Chablis is the purest expression of chardonnay in the world and it happens to pair exceptionally well with sashimi.\u201dJapanese food, and sushi in particular, has been one of the greatest edible culture shocks of my move from Los Angeles to Australia. It\u2019s not a fair comparison, perhaps, given that many strip-mall sushi joints in Los Angeles would be the best Japanese restaurants by far in almost any American or Australian city.But given Australia\u2019s incredible seafood, the general lack of diversity in the country\u2019s sushi offerings is surprising. It\u2019s rare to find fish beyond the standard tuna-salmon-yellowtail-shrimp-scallop basics, and the details that truly matter to sushi obsessives \u2014 like knife skills and rice \u2014 are often afterthoughts.These accolades invariably focus on the 19-course menu at the horseshoe-shaped bar on the top floor, while only briefly mentioning the offerings in the rooms below. But below, at the ground-floor sushi bar, is where my Kisum\u00e9 journey began.I tried to book two seats at the regular sushi counter, but when we arrived I was told there was no space, and we\u2019d have to take a table. We tried to order the sushi omakase, but were told it was available only at the counter. We went through a ridiculous dance when one server told us that we might snag a counter spot in 20 to 30 minutes if we wanted to order something in the meantime, and then 30 minutes later got the same spiel from someone else, who quoted a further 20- to 30-minute wait.The sommelier lectured me about the general qualities of Vouvray after I asked about the specific attributes of a Vouvray on the list. An hour in, and still no spot at the counter, we relented and ordered the $145 deluxe sushi box.The sashimi and nigiri were standard salmon, tuna and the like. Once you removed the very pretty garnishes, the food reminded me of what you might get from a corporate catering platter.A few weeks later, we were up two flights of stairs and tucked into a back room, and the tone of service could not have been more different. A sommelier and a server flitted around the horseshoe counter attending to every person\u2019s need. A set of impressive sushi knives lay across the counter where Jangyong Hyun, a senior sous-chef, prepared the evening\u2019s food after he made a somewhat grand entrance.Over 19 courses, I occasionally found what I\u2019d been hoping for: beautifully fresh seafood over barely warm rice. Squid from Port Phillip Bay was lightly singed, and as tender and sweet as a scallop, but with a slight textural snap. Scampi sushi, also known as sweet shrimp, was daubed with three kinds of roe as well as finger lime. The richly creamy flesh made it the dish of the evening, delicately bolstered by freshly grated Tasmanian wasabi.Those moments were mostly eclipsed by a heavy reliance on theatrics, on the plate and in the meal\u2019s execution. Charcoal crackers with eggplant miso were presented like cigars from a box pouring dry ice smoke. The chef seemed bewildered that I didn\u2019t want to videotape the moment.Despite the date printed on the menu, many components of advertised dishes were missing. In a tiny chirashi bowl that should have included mud crab and sea urchin, the uni were replaced with salmon roe. Instead of black truffle on the Wagyu sashimi, there was mushroom pur\u00e9e. \u201cBut we\u2019ve added foie gras!\u201d the chef said, beaming, not mentioning that the foie gras had been pilfered from the following dish, where it was supposed to appear atop toro sushi.And those beautiful knives were barely used; almost all of the fish was cut by a cook working behind a curtain. Slicing fish may sound boring compared with dry-ice smoke, but knife work is arguably the greatest skill a sushi chef possesses.That kind of quiet craft is replaced by spectacle, like a dessert that diners suck through a large clear straw, the chef pausing in front of each person to watch as finger lime and passion fruit jelly shot into our mouths. My fellow diners took longer photographing each twist and turn of the meal than they did actually eating anything.It\u2019s hard to fault a restaurant for giving people what they want, and increasingly diners want an experience that looks good enough on social media to justify the cost. Every dish I ate at Kisum\u00e9 was visually impressive and photo-worthy, from the dismal sushi platter in the basement to the toro encased in foie gras choux at the exclusive tasting table, to a lunch of tempura zucchini and a bowl of elegant but bland udon.Kisum\u00e9 does offer the occasional magical bite, a shimmer of promise that transcends fashion and framework and honors the pure pleasure of cool raw fish, barely warm rice and the beauty of quality and simplicity and tradition.Those moments, those bites, were rare. It would be silly to complain too loudly about the frippery of the chef\u2019s table \u2014 while certainly not life-changing it\u2019s not an experience you\u2019ll soon forget. But I\u2019m not sure that Kisum\u00e9 as a whole has earned its reputation for quality. It certainly does not manifest for the regular diner on a regular night, who will nonetheless pay a hefty sum for the sprinkle of reputation dusted over her lackluster but highly photogenic meal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Who Led Sears Into Bankruptcy Court", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial engineers like Eddie Lampert are wreaking havoc on American companies.Mr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.It\u2019s yet another cautionary tale about the limits of financial engineering. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Mr. Lampert began this 15-year odyssey in 2003 after he bought the bonds of the failing discount retailer Kmart and converted those bonds into a controlling position in Kmart\u2019s equity. He ran his own hedge fund, ESL, investing money from wealthy billionaires such as David Geffen, the Ziff family and Michael Dell. Using their money, and some of his own, Mr. Lampert became a billionaire, too, with gargantuan successes investing in, among others, AutoZone, an auto parts retailer, and AutoNation, a car retailer. He saw opportunities where others did not, often won big, and became an investing legend.Mr. Lampert was wrong about that. He decided not to invest the capital needed to refurbish the Sears and Kmart stores to keep their inventory and appearance fresh. Instead, he made a huge gamble, one that never really paid off, to invest in Sears\u2019s website and online shopping. He was too early, and the Sears customer base never cottoned to shopping online. Instead, Amazon ate Sears\u2019s lunch (and breakfast and dinner) until he threw in the towel this year and joined forces with Amazon to allow it to sell Kenmore appliances, something that he long refused to do.Most others would have bailed years earlier. Not Mr. Lampert. It really was little more than an intellectual exercise. Could he figure out ways to save Sears and Kmart from bankruptcy, even though nearly everyone told him he could not? The answer, of course, was no. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Since Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019 largest single creditor, he is in a position to control the company again if and when it is able to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Mr. Lampert appears to be gearing up for that outcome. He\u2019s still the chairman of the Sears board of directors, although he gave up his role as chief executive as part of the bankruptcy filing. He\u2019s also proposed making a new secured $300 million loan to enable the company to continue operating in bankruptcy. And he\u2019d still like to buy the Kenmore brand, one of its most valuable properties, from Sears for $400 million. It will be up to a bankruptcy judge to decide.The question is, why would anyone give him that chance? Yes, many old-economy retailers have failed to adapt to consumers\u2019 changing needs. But the wizards of financial engineering \u2014 whether it\u2019s Mr. Lampert at Sears or the venerable buyout firm KKR at Toys \"R\" Us \u2014 have not done much better. The next time the Masters of the Universe come knocking with a buyout proposal, a smart company may want to lock the boardroom door.William D. Cohan is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and the author of, most recently, \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Benioff is the chairman and a co-C.E.O. of Salesforce. Unfortunately, some C.E.O.s still embrace this myopic view and believe that they have a duty to shareholders alone, with little or no responsibility to the communities in which they operate. I contend that business must have a purpose beyond profits, and that such purpose can, over time, benefit both stockholders and stakeholders.This is a humanitarian emergency and it demands an emergency response. San Francisco\u2019s epidemic of homelessness is solvable, but only if we devote the resources that are necessary.This would raise up to $300 million a year to address homelessness, roughly double what San Francisco spends now. Yes, we are a business that supports a tax on our business \u2014 because we are a part of our community and our community is in crisis.As our residents are forced onto the streets, many large companies \u2014 some of which have benefited from tax breaks given to them by the city \u2014 are also reaping a windfall from recent cuts to corporate taxes. It\u2019s absurd to believe that these businesses can\u2019t afford one half of 1 percent of gross receipts to help address the most important problem facing our community. Salesforce, for instance, is the city\u2019s largest private employer. Proposition C could increase our annual tax by about $10 million; we expect revenues this year of $13 billion. Even with Proposition C, we\u2019ll be just fine.This crisis reminds us that business does not exist in a bubble. Companies can truly thrive only when our communities succeed as well: when our public schools prepare our children for a digital economy; when people are treated equally, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity; when we protect our environment from pollution and climate change; when our residents are no longer forced out of their homes and onto the streets. In this sense, Proposition C is a referendum on the role of business in our communities and, by extension, our country. The business of business is no longer merely business. Our obligation is not just to increase profits for shareholders. We must also hold ourselves accountable to a broader set of stakeholders: to our customers, our employees, the environment and the communities in which we work and live. It\u2019s time for the wealthiest businesses and business owners to step up and give back to the most vulnerable among us. Marc Benioff is the chairman and a co-C.E.O. of Salesforce. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pando, the Most Massive Organism on Earth, Is Shrinking", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe grove of 47,000 quivering aspen trees in Utah is being diminished by mule deer, foraging cattle and human mismanagement.On 106 acres in Fishlake National Forest in Richfield, Utah, a 13-million-pound giant has been looming for thousands of years. But few people have ever heard of him.This is \u201cthe Trembling Giant,\u201d or Pando, from the Latin word for \u201cI spread.\u201d A single clone, and genetically male, he is the most massive organism on Earth. He is a forest of one: a grove of some 47,000 quivering aspen trees \u2014 Populus tremuloides \u2014 connected by a single root system, and all with the same DNA.The study, consisting of recent ground surveys and an analysis of 72 years of aerial photographs, revealed that this unrealized natural treasure and keystone species \u2014 with hundreds of dependents \u2014 is shrinking. And without more careful management of the forest, and the mule deer and cattle that forage within him, the Trembling Giant will continue to dwindle.How Pando got so big is a mystery. Perhaps it lived among other clones and became dominant over time. Or maybe the relatively flat land where it grows encouraged its spread. Maybe Pando just outcompeted other trees.Pando is constantly reproducing, which is essential to its resilience. Lacking genetic diversity, it relies on having trees of different sizes and ages. That way, if one layer or generation dies off, there\u2019s another waiting to replace it.\u201cIf this were a community of humans, it would be as if a whole town of 47,000 had only 85-year-olds in it,\u201d Dr. Rogers said. \u201cWhere is the next generation?\u201dAerial photos also revealed that Pando\u2019s crown steadily thinned as human activity grew, especially in the last half century, with the addition of campgrounds, cabins and a telephone line, which drew animals that graze on forest leaves and shoots.\u201cAll these human actions have favored these browsers \u2014 their numbers, their lack of movement \u2014 so that they have a safe haven,\u201d said Dr. Rogers. \u201cAnd all of this is to the detriment of the survival of this clone.\u201dBut there\u2019s hope for Pando as managers learn from past mistakes and take advantage of an improved understanding of forest ecology.More fencing, culling of deer, and experimentation with the forest\u2019s natural ecology ultimately might save Pando, Dr. Rogers said. And educating the public about the giant\u2019s significance may spur novel conservation methods. For instance, saving common species such as aspen, which support high biodiversity, might be just as important as saving rare, charismatic species.Advertisement"}

She\u2019s facing a Republican incumbent whose popularity has tumbled recently.Supported byBARRE, Vt. \u2014 Christine Hallquist is the first transgender person to be nominated for governor by a major party, and she knows people are interested in hearing her life story. She is more than happy to tell it, but the thing she really wants to talk about is the electric grid.\u201cThe foundation of all humanity, way back to the beginning, has been energy,\u201d she said, walking outside the Washington County Treatment Court, a drug-treatment program, on a brisk fall day. \u201cThe rise and fall of empires has been based on energy.\u201dBack then, she would retreat after school to the attic of her home in rural New York to relax, pick an outfit from her hidden stash of women\u2019s clothes and tinker beneath the eaves on homemade electrical circuits and other projects.\u201cI had my own little fortress, and it was cool. I never got caught,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was kind of like Christine\u2019s playground.\u201d\u201cMy whole life has been about understanding that most things are non-binary, including my gender,\u201d she said. \u201cSome things are really obvious, but most issues are pretty complicated, and to be self righteous and believe that you know the answer does an injustice to the issue.\u201dAs a candidate, Ms. Hallquist believes the electric grid \u2014 that vast reservoir of energy that powers everything from smartphones to sonogram machines \u2014 can, if managed correctly, fight all manner of social ills, among them rising global temperatures, rural poverty and the opioid epidemic. \u201cImmediately after the election I was like, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 I felt like Forrest Gump,\u201d Ms. Hallquist said. \u201cYou stumble into this historic thing and then you have to understand what it means.\u201dBut transgender rights activists said they immediately knew what it meant. \u201cThis could be truly life saving for some trans kids,\u201d said Mara Keisling, the executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. \u201cThat she won the nomination \u2014 or just that she got to be the C.E.O. of an electric utility \u2014 shows that transgender people can have any kind of position. Christine has been a trailblazer.\u201d\u201cWe can grow the hell out of this rural economy if we connect every home and business to fiber optic cable\u201d strung alongside power lines, which could bring high-speed internet to the state\u2019s many remote towns, she said. And by moving electricity production away from fossil fuel she believes \u201cthe electric grid could be the tool to solve climate change.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Ms. Hallquist said they have since reunited (\u201cBoth of our Facebook statuses say, \u2018It\u2019s complicated,\u2019\u201d she said), but her campaign declined to make Pat available for an interview, citing her desire for privacy. Safety is also a concern. The campaign has received roughly a dozen death threats that lead them to stop publicizing Ms. Hallquist\u2019s schedule and to assign an aide to travel with her in public. \u201cI get hecklers at parades, sometimes people say things like, \u2018What\u2019s his problem?\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not voting for that,\u2019 but I don\u2019t let it bother me,\u201d Ms. Hallquist said outside the venue. \u201cVermonters have welcomed me with open arms.\u201d(Others on the right have been more derisive, including The Daily Caller, a conservative website that used male pronouns to refer to Ms. Hallquist in an article on her primary victory.)After she won, she kept her team in place rather than hire consultants from out-of-state. \u201cEmotional commitment will more than compensate for what you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the key things about Vermont is you can\u2019t get elected if you\u2019re not nice.\u201dPerhaps with that in mind, Ms. Hallquist said she \u201cabhors\u201d labels. When asked to describe herself politically, she declined to use words like \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cliberal\u201d in favor of \u201cpragmatic, loving and decent.\u201dBeneath that sentiment is an independent streak that can sometimes irk supporters. Over three days of interviews last month, she occasionally bemoaned \u201cextreme progressives\u201d and the \u201cpurity tests\u201d of social media \u201cthought police\u201d who criticized her as insufficiently leftist for accepting the endorsement of Mr. Biden.And as exciting as Ms. Hallquist\u2019s campaign has been for many transgender people, she has also faced criticism in the past for some of her statements on L.G.B.T. issues.Brenda Churchill, 61, an L.G.B.T. activist who also works for the campaign, described those tensions as a byproduct of the many generations contained within the wider transgender community. \u201cDid she get into any kind of pitched battle with folks?

She is hardly alone in this assessment. It\u2019s safe to say that a vast majority of Democrats feel that President Trump and his congressional accomplices need to be reined in \u2014 and preferably hogtied \u2014 to halt their flagrant assault on democratic norms and institutions.It is, however, extremely likely to electrify the Republican base, in whose collective lizard brain Mrs. Clinton still looms large \u2014 the ultimate boogeyman to be invoked whenever a Republican politician is having trouble exciting his constituents, or when a Supreme Court hopeful needs to shore up his endangered nomination. For a G.O.P. desperate to get its voters to the polls on Nov. 6, what could be more welcome than \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d jumping in to inflame partisan passions?But Mrs. Clinton went further. She smacked down the notion that her husband should have resigned over the whole sordid mess \u2014 \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d \u2014 or that it constituted an abuse of power. Which it absolutely did \u2014 and would have been even if Mr. Clinton had been the president of a small business rather than of the United States.It\u2019s one thing for a wife to stand by her spouse, especially when both have long been the targets of partisan warriors dead-set on destroying them. But it is no secret that Mr. Clinton\u2019s response to sexual scandal was to try to trash the reputations of the women involved. And while the degree to which Mrs. Clinton joined in such efforts may remain in dispute \u2014 in the CBS interview, she denies having played any role \u2014 her fundamental complicity is beyond reasonable doubt.This is the sort of moral arrogance and self-justification that has long troubled even many Democrats about Mrs. Clinton. The former first lady, turned senator, turned secretary of state may have been one of the most qualified nominees ever to run for president. But widespread ambivalence about her among not only swing voters but also her own base set the stage for her to lose the presidency to arguably the least qualified individual ever to hold that office.Hillary Clinton is a woman of extraordinary achievement who has earned the right to share her views on whatever topic she sees fit. But this close to Election Day, discussing hot-button issues in national interviews is nothing but problematic for her party \u2014 and, ultimately, her own legacy. She and Mr. Clinton are set to begin a series of joint speaking appearances soon after the elections. Perhaps she could save her more incendiary observations for then.Advertisement"}

It is down more than 9 percent from its high in September.Disappointing earnings reports from the tech giants Amazon and Alphabet set off another turbulent day on Wall Street on Friday, and the benchmark stock-market index briefly dipped into a correction. Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening. Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon\u2019s sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet\u2019s revenue fell short of analyst expectations. \u201cThe poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20. By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year.In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction \u2014 a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February. There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets.Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent.Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record. But given the length of the current bull market \u2014 in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent \u2014 investors have been uneasy. \u201cThe question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG. But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said.\u201cFrom our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,\u201d he said.Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits \u2014 which public companies are currently releasing \u2014 are on pace to be up more than 20 percent. Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet\u2019s share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent. Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent. Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week. The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year.\u201cWe think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cFor whatever reason, you\u2019re seeing money come out of those high-growth software names.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then it creates an informal authority structure that transcends public-sector/private-sector lines, that rallies cops and churches, the grass roots and the grass tops. Members put data in the center and use it as a tool not for competition but for collaboration. Like the best social service organizations, it is high on empathy and high on engineering. It is local, participatory and comprehensive.A methodology was born: organize around the data, focus on the assets of the community, not the deficits; realize there is no one silver-bullet solution; create a \u201cbackbone organization\u201d (like SAM) that can bring all the players together; coordinate decision-making and action; share accountability.Such structures are now being used to address homelessness, hunger, river cleanup and many other social ills. Collective impact approaches have had their critics over the years, in part for putting too much emphasis on local elites and not enough on regular parents (which is fair). Frankly, I don\u2019t need studies about outcomes to believe that these collective impact approaches are exciting and potentially revolutionary. Trust is built and the social fabric is repaired when people form local relationships around shared tasks. Building working relationships across a community is an intrinsically good thing. You do enough intrinsically good things and lives will be improved in ways you can never plan or predict. This is where our national renewal will come from.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of a philanthropic organization assisting StriveTogether.

{"Headline": "Down With the Year of the Woman", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisWe need to normalize female politicians, not act as though they\u2019re unicorns. And if someone says \u201cpink wave\u201d again, I\u2019m going to dry heave.I know that when I hear 2018 called the Year of the Woman, I am supposed to huddle with my girlfriends, preferably over ros\u00e9, and celebrate the historic number of female candidates in the midterm elections. And yet, I have to confess that the term bums me out.The way we talk about all of these female candidates as they try to drag that cave man known as Congress a bit closer to gender parity leaves me discouraged about how little progress we\u2019ve made. After all, it was Senator Barbara Mikulski who, after she was re-elected in the first Year of the Woman in 1992, said that the term \u201cmakes it sound like the Year of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus.\u201dAre female candidates still unicorns, magical woodland creatures that rear their sparkly horns every couple of decades, and only when provoked, as they were after Anita Hill\u2019s testimony in 1991 and Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s agonizing account of sexual assault last month?I was curious about whether other women felt the same way I did \u2014 encouraged by the uptick in female candidates yet exasperated that the phenomenon is still characterized as some chromosomal anomaly that couldn\u2019t have happened without a man. If President Trump hadn\u2019t bragged about sexual assault and called a gorgeous porn star a horseface, would we still be getting our year?I started to ask around, a bit sheepishly. It turned out I wasn\u2019t a traitor to my gender after all. Almost every woman I talked to also chafed at the Year of the Woman framework. \u201cIt makes us seem like the outliers, we\u2019re still not the norm,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.The fact that we\u2019re wrestling with what to call this female-infused election year speaks to the underrepresentation of women not just in politics but also in media, said Jessica Knoll, a Los Angeles-based novelist and screenwriter. There was a reason it was Ms. Bolduan who put a stop to the \u201cpink wave\u201d talk.\u201cIt minimizes it, it cutesies it up, and you needed a woman to say, \u2018Don\u2019t call it that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Knoll said. \u201cOn a macro level, that\u2019s why we need more women at the table everywhere.\u201dWe\u2019ve settled on \u201crunning mate\u201d (thank you, Sarah Palin), but 34 years and a woman at the top of the presidential ticket later, so many questions remain.\u201cThey\u2019re often treated like they\u2019re exceptional, miraculous,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has advised female candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s great to celebrate and energize people around women running, but we need to normalize, not exceptionalize it.\u201dBut there is also a fear that for every story about juggling politics with play dates, we aren\u2019t hearing about the candidate\u2019s agenda.\u201cIt obviates some of the larger policy questions these candidates want to talk about and recenters their candidacies around identity and more specifically gender,\u201d said Anne Helen Petersen, the author of \u201cToo Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud: The Rise and Reign of the Unruly Woman.\u201dWe might as well have been talking about where Ms. Ferraro should plop down her purse. That\u2019s when I realized that as much as I recoil at the Year of the Woman (and dry heave at the \u201cpink wave\u201d), the bigger problem with treating female candidates like novelties is that, sadly, they are.That\u2019s progress, but not exactly a tsunami, or even a wave. It\u2019s more like \u201ca pleasant ripple that gets us closer to 50 percent,\u201d Ms. Knoll said.As Jennifer L. Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia who has written extensively about women in politics, put it, \u201cIt will be the \u2018Year of the Woman\u2019 when we\u2019re not talking about it.\u201dAmy Chozick, a writer at large for The Times covering business, politics and media, is the author of the memoir \u201cChasing Hillary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Orthodox Schism and the Spiritual Limits of Politics", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA serious rift in the church could have big consequences in Ukraine, Russia and Greece.Mr. Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.Russia\u2019s effort to keep Ukraine under its thumb prompted a revolution in 2014 and a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. It also prompted, on Monday, what may be one of the most serious splits in Christendom since the Great Schism between Rome and Constantinople in 1054 and the Protestant Reformation 500 years ago. This new crisis has deep historical roots, and could shape religious and secular ties among many countries for years to come.This will further strain relations between Ukraine and Russia. Also, the break in relations between Moscow and the Ecumenical Patriarchate could weaken the latter if other Orthodox churches follow Russia in rejecting Constantinople\u2019s primacy. The shock waves would affect relations between churches that find themselves on either side of the divide, forcing them, too, to sever ties. The churches of Poland, Serbia and Antioch (Syria) have already come out on Russia\u2019s side.The Church of Greece could also be shaken, as a number of Greek clergymen may support Moscow against Bartholomew. Russian claims to leadership of the Orthodox Christians have appealed to many since Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 and the patriarchs became subordinate to Muslim sultans. Furthermore, the Ecumenical Patriarchate\u2019s dialogue with other faiths, including the Roman Catholic Church, is deeply unpopular with hard-line Orthodox priests and monks.There was no immediate response from Mount Athos following the break in ties between Moscow and Constantinople, but having to choose sides would be a problem for many monks. A representative of the Moscow church has said that Russian pilgrims to Mount Athos will not be able to receive communion there.Greece and Russia, traditional friends, have already found themselves at odds on the political level, with Athens expelling Russian diplomats in July for trying to influence public opinion against an agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under which Greece\u2019s small neighbor would be renamed Northern Macedonia. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, which broke away from the Church of Serbia in 1967 and is not in communion with any church, has appealed to Constantinople for independent status as the Archdiocese of Ohrid. The outcome of the appeal could depend on whether the agreement between Greece and Macedonia regarding the name is ratified by both countries. This, in turn, could complicate things further with Russia and other churches opposed to Ohrid\u2019s autonomy. As in most schisms in Christianity\u2019s history, this one is determined as much by realpolitik and national interests as by dogma. Canonical issues can determine political behavior, while politics often dictate church developments. The Ecumenical Patriarchate is asserting its ancient right to grant autonomy to churches and to judge issues of church law. Constantinople was established by the Emperor Constantine in 330 and, as the \u201cNew Rome,\u201d it came just after Rome in seniority. The schism in 1054 left Constantinople the primary church in the East. It is these rights of primacy that the Ecumenical Patriarchate is determined to defend, despite its very reduced circumstances following the city\u2019s fall to the Ottomans and the withering of its own flock in Turkey.Russia wants to project its leadership of the Orthodox world as the \u201cThird Rome,\u201d a role it took upon itself after breaking away from Constantinople in 1448, when its leadership disagreed with efforts to unite East and West Christendom. After 1453, many Orthodox, including the Greeks, looked to Russia for salvation from the Turks. But today Ukraine is forging a separate identity after centuries of Russian domination, strengthening ties with the European Union and the United States. Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, greeted the Ecumenical Patriarchate\u2019s announcement of its decision on Oct. 11 with fighting words. \u201cThis is the collapse of Moscow\u2019s centuries-old claims for global domination as the Third Rome,\u201d he said. \u201cThe independence of our church is part of our pro-European and pro-Ukrainian policies that we have been consistently pursuing.\u201dOn Oct. 12, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, charged that the Ecumenical Patriarchate\u2019s decision was a \u201cprovocation\u201d backed by the United States. On the same day, Mr. Putin discussed the issue at his Security Council. Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Church of Russia, is a close ally of Mr. Putin\u2019s and has taken a hard line on Ukraine for years. On Monday, the governing body of the Russian Church, the Holy Synod, decided to break off relations with Constantinople. Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Russian church\u2019s external relations, stressed that Moscow would not abide by any decisions taken by the Ecumenical Patriarchate regarding the Ukrainian Church. \u201cAll these decisions are unlawful and canonically void,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian Orthodox Church does not recognize these decisions and will not follow them.\u201d He called on the Ecumenical Patriarchate to change its decision. This is unlikely, as Bartholomew has long seen the Russian church as trying to undermine his authority. Patriarch Kirill stayed away from a Holy and Great Council hosted by Bartholomew on Crete in 2016, a meeting of all Orthodox church leaders aimed at promoting unity, which had been 55 years in the making. The patriarchs of Bulgaria, Georgia and Antioch also did not attend. Turkey, which has enjoyed good ties lately with both Russia and Ukraine, has stayed out of the issue so far. As for the United States, it has stressed its support for both Ukraine and Bartholomew. \u201cThe United States respects the ability of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox religious leaders and followers to pursue autocephaly according to their beliefs,\u201d said a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, in September. \u201cWe respect the ecumenical patriarch as a voice of religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue.\u201dBartholomew needs American support. He is considered the spiritual head of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians and \u201cfirst among equals\u201d of the 14 church leaders. Also, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America falls under Constantinople\u2019s direct jurisdiction. Losing the Church of Russia, and any that might follow its lead, would be a serious blow to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In church time, 1721 is not so long ago \u2014 that\u2019s when Peter the Great abolished the Russian patriarchate, appointing a Holy Synod instead. Nor is 1918, when several decades of persecution of Russian, Ukrainian and other Christians began.The feeling at the Patriarchate, in a run-down part of Istanbul, is that things must be done correctly and when the time is right. In nearly 2,000 years, the Church of Constantinople has seen several empires rise and fall, but has remained standing \u2014 chiefly by defending its historical role and responsibility, despite the temporal cost.Nikos Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

I was one of them. The militarists are back. Mr. Veloso is a composer, singer, writer and political activist.RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 \u201cBrazil is not for beginners,\u201d Antonio Carlos Jobim used to say. Mr. Jobim, who wrote \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema,\u201d was one of Brazil\u2019s most important musicians, one whom we can thank for the fact that music lovers everywhere have to think twice before pigeonholing Brazilian pop as \u201cworld music.\u201dWhen I told an American friend about the maestro\u2019s line, he retorted, \u201cNo country is.\u201d My American friend had a point. In some ways, perhaps Brazil isn\u2019t so special.Recently, I\u2019ve found myself thinking about the 1980s. I was making records and playing to sold-out crowds, but I knew what needed to change in my country. Back then, we Brazilians were fighting for free elections after some 20 years of military dictatorship. If someone had told me then that some day we would elect to the presidency people like Fernando Henrique Cardoso and then Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, it would have sounded like wishful thinking. Then it happened. Mr. Cardoso\u2019s election in 1994 and then Mr. da Silva\u2019s in 2002 carried huge symbolic weight. They showed that we were a democracy, and they changed the shape of our society by helping millions escape poverty. Brazilian society gained more self-respect.But despite all the progress and the country\u2019s apparent maturity, Brazil, the fourth-largest democracy in the world, is far from solid. Dark forces, from within and from without, now seem to be forcing us backward and down.Many artists, musicians, filmmakers and thinkers saw themselves in an environment where reactionary ideologues, who \u2014 through books, websites and news articles \u2014 have been denigrating any attempt to overcome inequality by linking socially progressive policies to a Venezuelan-type of nightmare, generating fear that minorities\u2019 rights will erode religious and moral principles, or simply by indoctrinating people in brutality through the systematic use of derogatory language. The rise of Mr. Bolsonaro as a mythical figure fulfills the expectations created by that kind of intellectual attack. It\u2019s not an exchange of arguments: Those who don\u2019t believe in democracy work in insidious ways.As a public figure in Brazil, I have a duty to try to clarify these facts. I am an old man now, but I was young in the \u201960s and \u201970s, and I remember. So I have to speak out.In the late \u201960s, the military junta imprisoned and arrested many artists and intellectuals for their political beliefs. I was one of them, along with my friend and colleague Gilberto Gil.Gilberto and I spent a week each in a dirty cell. Then, with no explanation, we were transferred to another military prison for two months. After that, four months of house arrest until, finally, exile, where we stayed for two and a half years. Other students, writers and journalists were imprisoned in the cells where we were, but none was tortured. During the night, though, we could hear people\u2019s screams. They were either political prisoners who the military thought were linked to armed resistance groups or poor youngsters who were caught in thefts or drug selling. Those sounds have never left my mind.Many people here say they are planning to live abroad if the captain wins. I never wanted to live in any country other than Brazil. And I don\u2019t want to now. I was forced into exile once. It won\u2019t happen again. I want my music, my presence, to be a permanent resistance to whatever anti-democratic feature may come out of a probable Bolsonaro government.Caetano Veloso is a Brazilian composer, singer, writer and political activist.Advertisement"}

He has simply decided to quit. But at 51, Mr. Bradley is not retiring. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great run, and I\u2019m certain there\u2019s another great chapter for me.\u201d He said that he had no idea what that chapter might be, but that he loves to be in the kitchen. For several years he ran the restaurant but did not cook, but earlier this year he returned to the stove.Mr. Bradley said he told his architect, Mark Zeff, that he did not want the Red Cat to look like a New York City restaurant, but more like \u201cNew England goes to Paris, without a stop at Martha Stewart\u2019s house.\u201d Mr. Zeff installed hanging Moroccan light fixtures that Mr. Bradley thought dubious, but came to appreciate.\u201cMy goal was to have my own business by the time I was 30,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. He was 31 when he became the chef and an owner of the Red Cat, on 10th Avenue.Chelsea was a much different place back then, with no High Line, art-gallery scene or sleek high-rise condominiums. London Terrace had elegant apartments; nearby there were, and still are, public housing projects.Gentrification has not had a huge impact on the Red Cat\u2019s business Mr. Bradley said. The condos often have absentee owners who don\u2019t come in for a bowl of lentil soup or a plate of local skate, and tourists plying the High Line are not particularly tuned in to the restaurant\u2019s presence.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for small businesses in New York now,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. \u201cMy staff can\u2019t afford to live nearby like me. They get home at 2 a.m. and have to be back at work at 9.\u201dOver the years Mr. Bradley has, in turn, employed and nurtured a number of chefs and restaurateurs, including Harold Dieterle, Joey Campanaro, Brian Bistrong, Amanda Freitag, Alicia Nosenzo and Gabe Stulman. They worked at the Red Cat, the Harrison or Pace, another TriBeCa restaurant which has become Mr. Chow Tribeca. He did not dismiss the notion of opening a Red Cat elsewhere. \u201cI own the name, and I think it would be easy to relocate it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I open another restaurant, I\u2019d want to be in the kitchen. It\u2019s the most fun job I ever had.\u201dAs for the run-up to the closing, Mr. Bradley said he planned to leave any festivities up to the staff. In the meantime, there\u2019s still plenty of time for another plate of signature saut\u00e9ed zucchini with pecorino and almonds, or a pile of tempura green beans with sweet-hot mustard sauce, for dipping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping for a Midterm Split Decision", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conservative case for a Republican Senate and a Democratic House.Opinion ColumnistSince the election of Donald Trump, the conservatives who opposed him in 2016 have increasingly divided into distinct camps \u2014 one group continuing to criticize him but still backing the institutional G.O.P., and the other following their anti-Trumpism into root-and-branch opposition to his party. This division extends to midterm attitudes: Some NeverTrumpers will cheer for every Republican defeat, while others pull for G.O.P. victories in exactly the way they would have in 2010 or 2014. Let me suggest a third option. If you are a conservative who is moderately happy with some of Trump\u2019s policy steps, fearful of liberalism in full power, but also fearful of Trump untrammeled and triumphant, the sensible thing to root for \u2014 and vote for \u2014 is the outcome that appears most likely at the moment: A Republican majority in the Senate and a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.The best argument for conservative support for Donald Trump was always defensive: Elect him and you prevent the installation of a long-term liberal majority on the Supreme Court, and perhaps chasten the Democratic Party and arrest its leftward march.For that argument to persuade, you had to trust the institutional Republican Party\u2019s promise to contain Trump\u2019s authoritarian instincts and restrain his follies. You also had to downplay the long-term damage, to conservatism and the body politic, of putting someone with such poisonous rhetorical habits in the bully pulpit.I wasn\u2019t persuaded. But so far Trump has been more constrained and less destructive than I expected \u2014 his foreign policy less destabilizing (so far) than either of his predecessors, his cruelest policy instincts walked back under pressure, the country more prosperous, his appointments more responsible and a large-scale investigation into his possible crimes proceeding, beset by Trumpian insults but otherwise mostly unimpeded by the White House.To the extent that any Republicans deserve credit for this constraint, though, they are mostly elected Republicans in the Senate. The House is more pure, uncut MAGA, more reflexive in its defense of a president whose behavior is often indefensible, more poisoned by the worst Trumpist tendencies (witness the steady migration of the Iowa congressman Steve King toward an overt white nationalism) and more inclined to allow Trump a free hand should he seek to make his actual presidency exactly like his Twitter feed.So giving up the House restrains and redirects Trump at relatively little cost, and perhaps even some policy advantage. Keeping the Senate Republican in this cycle, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t just allow for more conservative judicial nominations. It also provides a hedge against a future where the Democratic Party returns to power flush with ideological zeal, committed to its own forms of norm-busting, and eager for a measure of revenge.Given the more favorable Senate map and the possibility of a recession, Democrats can reasonably hope to retake the upper chamber in the next four years no matter what. And it will go much worse for the right if that Democratic majority has 60 seats in that scenario as opposed to 52 \u2014 something that will be determined by this fall\u2019s election as much as by what happens two or four years hence.Of course, if you\u2019re a Trump skeptic who believes that only an earth-salting defeat will enable the re-emergence of a decent right, then trying to constrain a future liberalism will seem less important than rooting for the necessary disaster to arrive for Republicans today. But I don\u2019t think our polarized system lends itself to salt-the-earth defeats anymore, and I also don\u2019t think that parties necessarily emerge from them wiser than before \u2014 since in such defeats they\u2019re condensed to their more fervent and often foolish core.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Domestic Violence Awareness Hasn\u2019t Caught Up With #MeToo. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Kaylee Kapatos posted on Facebook this month that she was a survivor of domestic violence, using the hashtag #WhyIStayed, the response among her friends was muted.Only the week before, she had posted about sexual assault with the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport and got what she called \u201coverwhelmingly positive feedback.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s totally different,\u201d said Ms. Kapatos, 25, who works as a residence life coordinator at Michigan Technological University. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201dBut how does domestic violence, one of the most common ways women suffer at the hands of men, fit into that conversation?October is domestic violence awareness month. We talked to experts and survivors about why the conversation around domestic violence differs from sexual assault and what would need to change for domestic violence to have its own cultural reckoning.In 2018, the National Domestic Violence Hotline and its youth outreach effort, loveisrespect, have experienced a 30 percent increase in calls, texts and chats compared with the same period last year \u2014 a larger than usual year-over-year increase.\u201cWe think #MeToo is part of that,\u201d said Katie Ray-Jones, the chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline.She believes that domestic violence victims identify with the national conversation, but that they feel safer speaking confidentially as opposed to sharing publicly on Facebook or Twitter.Unlike posting generally about sexual harassment or disclosing a past sexual assault without naming the perpetrator, simply identifying as a domestic violence victim online could expose an ex as an abuser.\u201cPeople feel like they could be tied back to who their abusive partner was,\u201d Ms. Ray-Jones said. \u201cBut also, think of a time when someone came forward around domestic violence and their character wasn\u2019t assassinated in some way.\u201dAfter the #MeToo movement went viral, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence created its own hashtag, #SurvivorSpeaks.\u201cIt really was a thoughtful look at what we heard, which was, \u2018We so appreciate that we\u2019re talking about sexual assaults and #MeToo but, basically, what about us?\u2019\u201d said Ruth M. Glenn, the coalition\u2019s chief executive and president.Ms. Glenn said she has seen a steady use of the new hashtag, but it has not taken off the way #MeToo has. \u201cSurvivors know when and if they\u2019re going to get support,\u201d she said, and right now, \u201cthere is still some heavy-duty stigma.\u201dShe said there was an added layer of victim blaming in domestic violence relationships because the abuse happens over many months and years in what people view as a consenting adult relationship.\u201cPeople have a really difficult time understanding, why doesn\u2019t she leave?\u201d Ms. Glenn said.Ms. Kapatos, who broke up with a college boyfriend who she said was jealous and controlling and threatened to kill himself if she left, tried to answer that question with her Facebook post.\u201cI stayed because I was afraid he would hurt himself,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI stayed because I thought he loved me. I stayed because I thought I could fix him. I stayed because I thought it was normal.\u201dShe got just six \u201clikes.\u201dThe #MeToo movement has shown what can happen when women agree to stop staying silent. But in most cases, men have not been held accountable until multiple women have spoken up.That\u2019s difficult to replicate in domestic violence cases, where there is one victim in an isolated relationship who is unlikely to know about past abuse, said Ebony Johnson, the founder of the Next Chapter, Corporation, a grass-roots support group that works with victims of sexual and domestic violence in Maryland and Washington, D.C.Ms. Johnson, a 39-year-old veteran who works for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is a survivor of both. She was raped by a stranger when she was 15, she said, and as an adult, she divorced after her husband choked and threatened to kill her. She later got a protective order against a boyfriend who abused her.The boyfriend had a domestic violence case filed against him in an earlier marriage, Ms. Johnson said, but she did not find out about it until after he became abusive toward her. The man has since remarried.\u201cImagine if I contacted his wife, and said, \u2018Oh my gosh, he abused me; I just want you to be careful,\u2019\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to think I\u2019m crazy, unless it happens to her.\u201dThere is another element missing from the conversation surrounding domestic violence: public outrage.Like it or not, experts say, it often takes a high-profile celebrity case to start a cultural movement. For domestic violence, that first happened in the 1990s when O.J. Simpson was accused of killing his ex-wife, said Paige Flink, chief executive of the Family Place shelter in Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s like when it happens to regular people it\u2019s not as real as when it happens to a celebrity,\u201d she said.As a society, Ms. Flink said, we must decide: \u201cAre we going to take seriously that bad things happen to women at the hands of men?\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Advertisement"}

Mr. Judis is the author of \u201cThe Nationalist Revival: Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization.\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of nationalism, Muslims and Mexican-Americans are stigmatized, and African-American football players who protest racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem are denounced. Some of his applications of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2014 repudiating the Paris climate agreement or abandoning the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 may not even prove to be in the national interest. But these failings should not lead you to dismiss the value of nationalism, which, by itself, is neither good nor evil, liberal nor conservative. The perception of a common national identity is essential to democracies and to the modern welfare state, which depends on the willingness of citizens to pay taxes to aid fellow citizens whom they may never have set eyes upon. Today\u2019s nationalist revival is in reaction to the failure of global, not nation-based, initiatives that sailed over the heads of ordinary citizens. The reaction has been most potent on the political right, but there is certainly a basis for a liberal or social-democratic nationalism. If anything, the decline of liberal and social-democratic parties is a result at least in part of their inability to distinguish what is legitimate and justifiable in nationalism from what is small-minded, bigoted and contrary to the national interest it claims to uphold.The bold supranational initiatives of globalization \u2014\u00a0a system of floating exchange rates in relation to the dollar; the unrestricted flow of capital; free trade (with few tariffs and government subsidies) monitored by the new World Trade Organization; the expansion of NATO and the European Union to ensure that former Communist states became liberal capitalist democracies \u2014\u00a0have unquestionably done some good. They helped expand trade and benefited immigrants who fled from less to more developed nations.But in the United States and Western Europe, none of these initiatives really delivered as promised. The global economy has suffered a succession of financial crises culminating in the Great Recession and continuing to this day in Turkey and Argentina. The free movement of companies has led to a global race to the bottom for wages, taxes and regulation and to growing inequality within nations. Instead of producing convergence between the richer export-driven economies of Northern Europe and the less developed countries of Southern Europe, the euro has widened the gap between them.The rush of immigrants in the United States has brought about a clash of culture just as it had in past centuries. Employers have also used low-skilled immigrants to undercut unions and to turn mid-wage jobs in construction, meatpacking and janitorial services into low-wage labor. After Sept. 11, 2001, the resentment toward immigrants became fused with a rising fear in the United States and especially in Europe of Islamist terrorism. That created a huge political backlash against immigrants and refugees.Put that backlash together with the anger bred by lost manufacturing jobs and declining social services from reduced tax revenues, and you have the political base for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, Brexit and Italy\u2019s League party.In the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist policies have not been without merit. Where his predecessors have feared alienating China, he has boldly challenged its transfer of technology, cybertheft and hidden trade subsidies and barriers. He has also spoken up for American manufacturing industries and their workers, and chided footloose companies like Nabisco, Ford and Carrier.His Hobbesian take-no-prisoners approach to trade and foreign policy \u2014 sowing conflict with allies as well as rivals and foes \u2014 will threaten the underpinnings of global peace and prosperity, which still depends on a grudging acceptance of American economic and military power. There are already foreshadowings of future financial disorder \u2014 in discussions by the European Union, Russia and China to defy American sanctions against Iran by creating a new funding authority that would evade the dollar and by Russia and China\u2019s decision to use their own currencies rather than the dollar as the medium of exchange. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration initiatives, too, have merely reinforced cultural resentments and done little to stem the oversupply of unskilled and easy-to-exploit unauthorized immigrants.In all of these areas, Mr. Trump has harmed, not strengthened, our nation. Yet in the United States, the liberal opposition has generally failed to acknowledge what is valid in the today\u2019s nationalist backlash. Many liberal pundits and political scientists continue to echo Hillary Clinton in characterizing Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in 2016 as deplorables. They denounce Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs without proposing any plausible means of counterbalancing the huge surpluses from China and Germany. They dismiss as a lost cause the attempt to revive the towns of the Midwest and South by reviving manufacturing. They rightly insist that the United States find a way to integrate and assimilate the country\u2019s 12 million or more unauthorized immigrants, but they ignore the continuing flood of people without papers crossing the border or overstaying their visas and they dismiss attempts to change national priorities toward skilled immigrants. Here is the simple truth: As long as corporations are free to roam the globe in search of lower wages and taxes, and as long as the United States opens its borders to millions of unskilled immigrants, liberals will not be able to create bountiful, equitable societies, where people are free from basic anxieties about obtaining health care, education and housing. In Europe, social democrats face very similar challenges with immigration, refugees and euro-imposed austerity. To achieve their historic objectives, liberals and social democrats will have to respond constructively to, rather than dismiss, the nationalist reaction to globalization. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond the Narrow Expectations of Gender", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLens\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Each portrait has a personal reflection about identity, proof that non-binary is about more than external markers: it is also about internal feelings. These first-person accounts exist beyond the frame, with and against the portraits they illuminate and complicate.Age: 25 London\u201cI rather use genderqueer than non-binary. It\u2019s a political term not only describing my individual positioning but my rejection of the binarism as a whole. I think gender is something fluid and the world is non-binary in itself. I always struggled with narrow expectations of gender. The gender binarism that surrounded me felt really oppressive. And I don\u2019t want to conform to something that feels oppressive. To me, it\u2019s very much about complicating gender to make space in between what most people see as male and female. Embracing genderqueer lets me explore different ways of living with gender, queering gender and breaking free from gender. I want to confuse people with my gender expression, play with their assumptions. This is how I feel that there is some space in between all these rigid ideas and images of how women and men look, move and sound like.\u201dAges: 20 and 28London\u201cFor me being non-binary is more of an internal thing, the way I dress, the way I present myself to others has always been quite back and forth. One day I look more stereotypically masculine, the next day more female, one day androgynous, but internally I consistently feel like I\u2019m neither. I feel like I couldn\u2019t put myself into being male, which is why I\u2019m not a trans male, and I could not identify myself as a cisgender female because I don't think I\u2019m all female, so it\u2019s definitely something that is a bit more of an internal thing for me. \u201cI was assigned female at birth and I am transitioning. I am evolving to become more comfortable with myself. I have always felt non-binary because the binary idea of gender does not makes sense and I never fitted typically into any gender and the expression of my gender is very androgynous so I am not changing from a woman to a man, I am changing from myself to more of myself.\u201d \u2014 N8 (Nate)Age: 43 London\u201cI do define myself as a non-binary person, so I was originally assigned female at birth and that never really felt right but I also didn\u2019t identify as male. It kind of took me a long time to work out what I was. And then at some point I came across the concept of non-binary and that just felt right. To me it is about being able to accept myself in any way and not feeling bad or that I am doing it wrong or that I am not being enough of a woman or enough of a man. I can kind of create my gender without feeling that I am not authentic.\u201dAge: 27Oslo\u201cNon-binary is a very wide term, but for me it is a place between being a man and a woman, or being both at the same time, depending on the mood I\u2019m in or what my day\u2019s like. I have always felt this way and I see myself as a gender-creative person. Gender alone is a much bigger theme. Instead of looking at it only as two genders or a diagnosis, you can look at gender as a spectrum of different kinds of gender, and if you can relate to the text above, you\u2019re not alone. There are many who fight for the non-binary and non-gender conformative to be recognized and to be seen as you are.\u201dAge: 19Denver\u201cLast year, at my work, they were referring to people as \u2018they, them, theirs\u2019 instead of assuming people\u2019s genders and it really made me think about who I was as a person. So for me, being non-binary means that I do not want to be categorized as one group, I want to be whomever I want to be. I do not want to be pulled into one gender, I want to embrace both but also be in between and not be either; because I feel that gender is a social construct and we\u2019ve created them to separate people. I am feminine but also masculine, but I don\u2019t want to be referred to as either. I would want to tell people to be more open-minded and educate yourself on certain things that you might not be aware of, because at one point in my life I was not aware of it, and now I\u2019m here. Me educating myself has changed my life completely.\u201dAge: 27London\u201cI define non-binary people as those who identify as something other than female or male, at least partially and at least some of the time. Personally I do not identify as female or male at all. I was assigned male at birth but I tend to lean toward a more femme presentation these days. But it\u2019s not all about presentation: it\u2019s also a sense of what female and male mean within your own culture. I\u2019m non-binary because I don\u2019t really align with what those identities and categories mean for me within my culture. I think non-binary could potentially be a way of labeling the system of gender, so gender is inherently non-binary. Within the system of gender there are categories such as female, male, genderqueer, maverique and so on, as well as agender, which is essentially a lack of alignment to any of them. So non-binary can be a way of describing the fact that the system is comprised of more than just two categories, but as it currently stands it is also a discrete identity on its own. I think the non-binary community is very diverse. Anyone could potentially identify as non-binary but there are arguably some trends within various subsets of the non-binary community. Some non-binary people will present in similar ways, but not all.\u201dAge: 28Hamar, NorwayAt 16, I concluded that I was actually a woman. And so, I lived as a woman for six years. Even before then I was mostly feminine all my life. However, at 22 I didn\u2019t want to live that way anymore. I tried putting on a more masculine expression, and that was entirely new to me. I viewed it as entering a third phase, not going back in any way. I don\u2019t identify through gender at all anymore. When people call me \u2018he,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019 or \u2018they,\u2019 I just feel like they highlight different traits of mine, and it\u2019s all positive. I\u2019ve realized that I can be exactly who I am, in the body that I have. I don\u2019t need any acknowledgment either way. It\u2019s not so much that I\u2019ve changed, but through living and learning, with time and experience, I\u2019ve developed new views. And so, I see myself in a new light.\u201dAge: 22Yogyakarta, Indonesia\u201cI do not want to be categorized as male or female because being gender-fluid is being borderless. It means that I can be anything. I\u2019ve felt this way for a long time, since I was a child. But I do not mind being called a girl in my daily life. In Indonesia, one has to be referred to by one of two pronouns. Mas (brother) or mbak (sister). If I lived in Europe I would use they/them pronouns. But the term in which I am called by does not matter. Being gender-fluid is very complex. Especially when I start dating or having feelings for someone else. People always require an explanation as to what gender I am, and I never felt comfortable explaining. And guys just want to date me because they assume I am lesbian and they want to try and date a lesbian despite the fact that I am not. I feel that I am unable to explain my gender and identity to them. I just want to be myself and be accepted for who I am.\u201dAge: 22Jakarta, Indonesia\u201cI lean more toward being non-binary because I love my feminine side. I explore myself through art, fashion, I wear women\u2019s clothing, heels and so on. It\u2019s been a long journey for me. I came out as L.G.B.T. in junior high school, to my close friend. After being in Milan and working in fashion, I started to feel more like myself. I realized it was O.K. to be me and after moving back to Indonesia, I felt more comfortable in being myself. I feel like I\u2019m more woman now but it has been changing. Like this is a male body but a woman\u2019s soul. But I have experimented a lot with my gender. My parents are still close-minded about this, and I want to help them become more open-minded. I told them times are changing and they have come to be more accepting once they understood that I am capable of supporting myself and living independently. I have felt this way since I was very young. Non-binary to me is a person that is either male or female but actively takes on the role of the opposite gender. Transsexuals would want to change their whole identity to female or male. Transsexual is more like the next level after non-binary. For me the name is not so important, the self is more important.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Azerbaijani Feast Awaits in Brooklyn, if You Can Find It", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant ReviewDuring the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world\u2019s smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing.But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I\u2019ve gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite\u2019s limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down.There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking.I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant.There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz.Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I\u2019ve planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it\u2019s from Azerbaijan, and it\u2019s good with yogurt.And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe\u2019s kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful.Village Cafe\u2019s hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I\u2019ve had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe\u2019s two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the \u201980s plays on the sound system.You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the d\u00e9cor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall.For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \u201cprivate club,\u201d past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away.But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb.Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \u201cMiracle of Village\u201d and another \u2014 buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce \u2014 that goes by \u201cMother In Laws Chicken.\u201dBut really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \u201chomemade potatoes,\u201d if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries.A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon.Advertisement"}

They reveal the horror that is Yemen today. You may choose not to look at them. But we thought you should be the ones to decide.\u201dWhen Jarjieh Fang, a graduate student in Washington, saw the article about Yemen around noon on Friday, he found the photographs shocking. \u201cI thought it would be something worth sharing, to sort of jolt people to start paying attention to what\u2019s going on in Yemen,\u201d he said.He posted a link to the article on his Facebook page, and couple hours later, he got a notification. His post had been taken down, and there was a message from Facebook.\u201cOn Facebook, we don\u2019t allow offers of sexual services, solicitation of sexual material, threats or depictions of sexual violence, threats to share intimate images or any sexual content involving minors,\u201d it said.The experience left Mr. Fang confused about Facebook\u2019s policies. \u201cI was disappointed when it was taken down so quickly, and that something so important was being scrubbed from people\u2019s News Feeds,\u201d he said.Facebook uses a combination of algorithms, employees and flags from users to screen for content that may need to be removed.

I think Collins knew all along that she\u2019d be voting yes and was just trying to teeter dramatically on the fence for as long as humanly possible.The political world is divided between those who think Collins is a brave and independent voice for moderation and those who think she\u2019s a person who enjoys playing that role while keeping herself safe, snug as a bug in a rug.And try to imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump had behaved a fraction that well. Instead of turning everything into a debate about whether the #MeToo movement was really about persecuting men.\u201cI say that it\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of,\u201d he told reporters.

A vote for the nomination became a symbolic vote for a political ethos that thinks grabbing private parts is fun and complaining about sexual assault is a threat to young manhood.\u201cI didn\u2019t look at this from a political standpoint,\u201d he fibbed.Heitkamp won her first senate race by less than 3,000 votes, and cynics assumed she felt free to be brave and vote no because polls suggested her re-election campaign is a lost cause anyway. It is my experience that politicians never believe they\u2019re doomed to defeat unless the mailman ceases deliveries because no one has sent a contribution in six months.Do you get the pattern here? A vote for Brett Kavanaugh delivered a message to women who\u2019ve suffered sexual assault: If the powerful can find a way to not take your claim seriously, they will.We have to do better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Doesn\u2019t Architecture Care About Sexual Harassment?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "OpinionSeven months after women accused Richard Meier of sexual misconduct, too little has been done to change the profession.Supported byMs. Lee is a founding partner of Bureau V, an architecture firm.Like many women before and after me, I simply moved on. I attended graduate school to study architecture and finished with honors. I worked for other well-known studios, became a licensed architect, joined the American Institute of Architects and co-founded my own practice: a woman-, minority-, and L.G.B.T.-owned award-winning architecture studio.I have often thought that this would be my contribution to the profession and the future of women within it: the creation of my own work space, in which diversity and respect are supported \u2014 to lead by example. Yet over the past year, as women across a number of industries have told their stories of abuse by powerful men and complicit workplaces, this dormant trauma began to stir. When I first recounted my story to a reporter from The Times, the fear and rage came flooding back to me. I had hidden behind humor to tell this story to close friends in the past, but without this foil, I was stuck with telling the story in earnest, exactly as I remembered it, and all I was left with was the visceral horror of that moment.When the scandal about Mr. Meier first broke \u2014 six other women joined me in detailing his abusive behavior \u2014 it felt like a dam was about to break, that other women would start to come forward, from his office and others. There were rumblings of revoking Mr. Meier\u2019s Pritzker Prize. Architecture, we were told, was having its own #metoo moment.But that didn\u2019t happen. First, there was no reckoning within Mr. Meier\u2019s firm. Most of those six women have left the firm, or even the profession; those who remain have stayed silent. And no wonder: Though Mr. Meier is stepping down from his leadership role and day-to-day involvement, he will remain at the firm, will continue to profit from its operation and will stay the majority shareholder. And the firm will still bear his name.Rather than revoking his Pritzker, the prize\u2019s administrators issued a weak statement declaring that they do not comment on the personal lives of the laureates \u2014 a confounding denial of the workplace context of much of Mr. Meier\u2019s misconduct. This disappointing dodge only served to reveal the Pritzker\u2019s own complicity in glossing over workplace abuse, within the same paragraph in which they claimed otherwise.It\u2019s not just about Mr. Meier. He did not act alone \u2014 as we know from countless #metoo stories, people like him have enablers all around them.The day after Mr. Meier exposed himself to me, I approached my supervisor, who had worked with him for 15 years. Before I could explain in detail, she stopped me midsentence and let me know that it would be \u201ctaken care of.\u201d This is when I knew that this harassment fit a larger pattern of behavior, and that senior management was well aware of it. And yet nothing was taken care of. It seems my supervisor, as well as many others in the office, felt either powerless or, in some cases, indifferent to refuse Mr. Meier his requests for opportunities to prey on young women. Those who occupied my junior position were particularly vulnerable bait for his advances. Several of us were tasked with working on his archives, which would plausibly lead us to work out of his home where he kept many of his sketchbooks. My supervisor certainly understood the risk of sending me to his home unaccompanied.The problem extends beyond the confines of one office. Economic, institutional and social forces have erected a culture that support this behavior by powerful men who, as world-famous architects, offer a valuable brand as much as a service for clients and patrons. It is up to them to decide whether they will choose to work with the firm that bears Mr. Meier\u2019s name or find talent elsewhere.Institutions also need to step up. While some have issued statements and made supportive gestures, leadership in architecture as a profession, which should have been the first voice to speak up after our own, has stumbled. Not long after our allegations became public, the Women in Architecture Committee, part of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, organized a round-table discussion of sexual harassment. But a co-chairwoman of this committee is Vivian Lee, the sole female partner at Mr. Meier\u2019s practice, creating a problematic disparity between her firm\u2019s tone-deaf defensive statements and her committee\u2019s declaration of support for victims of sexual harassment. How can women feel comfortable joining a local organization with this level of self-conflict, on what should be a clear voice on the matter? And what are we to make of the Pritzker Prize, which has not only shown little interest in female architects in the past, but has also now effectively glossed over sexual misconduct at the workplace? What is the real value of these organizations to our discipline if they do not help support the women who also take part?This is a start, but it needs to go further. Most architecture firms are small businesses with no dedicated human resources department; when the problem is coming from the top, how does this rule change the outcome for the employee? How does one actually foster \u201can equitable working environment\u201d \u2014 and what do employees do when that doesn\u2019t happen?To really effect change, we need to focus on culture, and where it is solidified \u2014 in education. Architectural education is plagued by the mentality that suffering is a necessary part of its practice. Sleepless nights and poor self-care seem to be par for the course for creative production. As a guest juror at a university architecture department, I once watched in horror as a student fainted from lack of sleep during her presentation.The acceptance of suffering easily slips into normalizing sexual misconduct and its suppression as simply part of the practice. Cultlike worship of the star architect only exacerbates this condition, and there are plenty of those who work for these so-called star architects, willing to sacrifice their time and integrity because they have been conditioned to believe that this mode of production is normal. It may be expected, but it is not acceptable.Educational institutions need to prepare their students for the work force by fostering environments wherein students learn to respect their own time, are encouraged to manage it properly, and ensure that their bodies are respected.I admire the women who held Mr. Meier accountable for his behavior and pushed for change within the office afterward. While our stories took place years ago, time does not erase them. Rather, they have now become an important part of Mr. Meier\u2019s legacy. It is up to the rest of us to learn from mistakes and construct a new and better normal for future generations.Stella Lee is a founding partner of Bureau V, an architecture firm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Hack Puts Thousands of Other Sites at Risk", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Mark Zuckerberg introduced an online tool called Facebook Connect in 2008, he hailed it as a kind of digital passport to the rest of the internet. In just a few clicks, users would be able to log in to other apps and sites with their Facebook passwords.The tool was adopted by thousands of other firms, from mom-and-pop publishing companies to high-profile tech outfits like Airbnb and Uber.But the impact could be significantly bigger since those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised.The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.\u201cJust the sheer fact that this exists will magnify the scale of any hack,\u201d said Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.In Europe, where tough new data privacy regulations went into effect in May, the authorities are preparing an investigation of the Facebook breach. Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for overseeing Facebook in the region, said it was gathering information and establishing the scope of its inquiry.Tinder, the dating app, has found no evidence that accounts have been breached, based on the \u201climited information Facebook has provided,\u201d Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Tinder and its parent company, the Match Group, said in a statement. Tinder, as well as other Match Group apps, rely on Facebook Connect as a method of logging in.Ms. Sacco added that Facebook could do more to help by providing a specific list of users hit by the attack.Over the past decade, Facebook has sold outside companies on Facebook Connect with a simple proposition: Connect to our platform, and we\u2019ll make it faster and easier for people to use your apps.The Connect tool was about achieving ubiquity. Users would be more apt to sign up for new apps and sites if doing so was easier, Facebook argued. It also brought an added measure of security, since users wouldn\u2019t need to create and remember new passwords every time they signed up for a new app.But in July 2017, that measure of security fell short. By exploiting three software bugs, attackers forged \u201caccess tokens,\u201d digital keys used to gain entry to a user\u2019s account. From there, the hackers were able to do anything users could do on their own Facebook accounts, including logging in to third-party apps.But there are still questions about an additional 40 million Facebook accounts that may have been affected. Facebook forced those 40 million users to log out and reauthenticate their credentials. It was unclear whether these accounts used Facebook to connect to outside apps.Citing \u201can abundance of caution,\u201d Facebook said it was building a tool to help outside developers identify users who were affected in the hack by pinpointing potentially compromised accounts on their services.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Facebook said it had not assessed the scope of the breach, nor did the company discover who was responsible for the attack.Hackers often target large databases of credentials, which can provide access to other accounts if users created the same password for multiple sites or have logged in to third-party accounts with their Facebook account.Since Friday, Facebook has held calls with developers at other companies to explain steps they can take to assess the damage at their own organizations.The security team at Uber, the ride-hailing giant, is logging some users out of their accounts to be cautious, said Melanie Ensign, a spokeswoman for Uber. It is asking them to log back in \u2014 a preventive measure that would invalidate older, stolen access tokens.Uber has reviewed its login data from the past year and hasn\u2019t found any indications that Facebook credentials were used improperly.\u201cBut we still have to go through the investigation,\u201d Ms. Ensign said. \u201cFor those that are most at risk, we have logged them out, so they\u2019ll have to log back in to the account.\u201dFacebook faces fallout from regulators both at home and abroad. On Friday, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, both Democrats, used the occasion to renew their calls for legislation reining in large tech companies.The European Union\u2019s probe will be an early test of its new data-protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation. The law allows Facebook to be fined up to 4 percent of its global revenue, though many consider such an outcome unlikely.\u201cG.D.P.R. was designed to address the big tech giants, who are enormous, have huge resources and do very complicated things with personal data,\u201d said James Castro-Edwards, the head of the data-protection practice at the London law firm Wedlake Bell. \u201cThis is the sort of battle that G.D.P.R. was drafted to be used in.\u201dAs Facebook\u2019s power has grown, some outside companies have become wary of relying on it too much.While Tinder originally relied exclusively on the Facebook login for several years, the dating company last year introduced a way for people to create new accounts without using Facebook. Since then, fewer than 25 percent of new users sign up for Tinder using Facebook Connect.Similarly, Netflix stopped allowing users to connect using their Facebook accounts three years ago, and new customers must create user names and passwords when they sign up.But for the thousands of other companies that rely on Facebook to serve customers, it is unclear whether or not they will know the extent of the damage.\u201cSo many websites support Facebook login, and it was vulnerable for so long that it\u2019s hard to give an idea of the scope of this attack,\u201d Mr. Polakis said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Protest Singer Finds Her Voice in Vietnam\u2019s Police State", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 The taxi was weaving through evening traffic, inches from the motorbikes that were swarming it like hornets.Such maneuvering, and proximity to danger, is common on Vietnamese roads. But Mai Khoi, the singer-songwriter in the back seat, said it felt familiar on more than one level.\u201cWe keep going,\u201d she said, speaking of artists who offer social commentary under the gaze of Vietnam\u2019s sprawling police state. \u201cBut we have to be careful to avoid problems.\u201dMai Khoi, once a conventional pop star, is now a protest singer who challenges Vietnam\u2019s political status quo. Her metamorphosis, and the government\u2019s efforts to silence her, have drawn attention to the escalating repression of political activists since 2016 by the ruling Communist Party.But in some ways Mai Khoi, 34, is a unique amalgam of a performer: a young, female Vietnamese activist who has a public following, support from international human rights groups and a band whose traditional-yet-experimental sound defies easy categorization.Most Vietnamese artists \u201ccannot overcome their fears to really say what they think,\u201d said Ngoc Dai, a well-known songwriter in Hanoi, the capital, whose own lyrics carry pointed social commentary. \u201cMai Khoi is a precious gem because she realized the mission of an artist is to speak about the common problems of a society.\u201dMai Khoi was born and raised in the southern Vietnamese city of Cam Ranh, where her father teaches guitar and piano. She played in his wedding band as a teenager and won several singing competitions.She later moved farther south to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\u2019s commercial capital, and in 2010 became only the second female singer to win a prestigious songwriting award from Vietnam Television, a state-run broadcaster.\u201cI just want to make politics more public,\u201d she said at the time.That dramatic spring was a \u201ctransformative catalyst\u201d for Mai Khoi\u2019s career, said her husband, Benjamin Swanton, a social justice advocate and a Ph.D. student in social policy at the University of Sydney. \u201cShe ended up having this oppositional consciousness.\u201dMai Khoi said her shift away from conventional pop music has been partly inspired by fellow dissident artists she has met since 2016 at human rights conferences outside Vietnam. She said they have taught her crucial lessons about using art for social commentary in repressive societies.She now lives in Hanoi, where she has formed a band with Quyen Thien Dac, a jazz saxophonist, and Nguyen Duc Minh, a multi-instrumentalist whose compositions are inspired by the music of some of Vietnam\u2019s 53 ethnic minority groups.The trio\u2019s first album, \u201cDissent,\u201d was recorded during clandestine performances at their Hanoi rehearsal and performance studio. Mai Khoi\u2019s powerful voice feeds off jazzy sax arpeggios and a dissonant riot of wind and string instruments \u2014 some traditional, some invented \u2014 that might sound unfamiliar to Western ears. Mr. Norton, the ethnomusicologist, said the music was a clear departure from Mai Khoi\u2019s pop sound and perhaps a better fit for her new protest message.Mai Khoi\u2019s lyrics and activism, which often promote freedom of expression in an abstract way, are a far cry from the cerebral advocacy work practiced by some Vietnamese activists and human rights lawyers.Still, her music carries a powerful message and appears to make the government uncomfortable, said one of her fans, Quoc Sy Nguyen, a Vietnamese medical researcher in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a knife cutting into the soul of intellectuals and people who are concerned about our country\u2019s destiny,\u201d he said. The Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend.Mai Khoi said that in addition to being effectively barred from performing in Vietnam, she has faced personal hardships because of her work. She and her husband were twice evicted from their apartment because of political pressure on their landlords, she said, and some friends have kept their distance for fear of associating with a dissident artist.\u201cPeople here have had to live under this system for 50 years, and they\u2019ve been scared of the police every day,\u201d she said on a recent evening at the Hanoi performance space, where the floor was littered with microphone stands and wooden instruments. \u201cI cannot judge them; I just feel sad.\u201dShe said that to minimize the risk of arrest, she has scaled back what she writes on Facebook. Her band, Mai Khoi Chem Gio, has also removed the word \u201cdissidents\u201d from its name.But she has not stayed silent. When President Trump visited Vietnam last year, for example, she flashed an obscene sign at his motorcade. She is also writing an autobiographical graphic novel and, in collaboration with the Hanoi artist Thinh Nguyen, preparing a virtual-reality art installation that will simulate her experience of being trolled on the internet.\u201cI\u2019m trying to express myself freely, but that led me to troubles, and I don\u2019t know what to do to change that,\u201d she said, nearly whispering. \u201cI just write a song.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cesar Sayoc\u2019s Path on Social Media: From Food Photos to Partisan Fury", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil 2016, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr.\u2019s life on social media looked unremarkable. On his Facebook page, he posted photos of decadent meals, gym workouts, scantily clad women and sports games \u2014 the stereotypical trappings of middle-age masculinity.But that year, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media presence took on a darker and more partisan tone. He opened a new Twitter account and began posting links to sensational right-wing news stories, adding captions like \u201cClinton busted exposed rigging entire election.\u201d On Facebook, his anodyne posts gave way to a feed overflowing with pro-Donald Trump images, news stories about Muslims and the Islamic State, far-fetched conspiracy theories and clips from Fox News broadcasts.\u201cHe went from posting pictures of women, real estate, dining and cars to posting pictures of ISIS, guns and people in jail,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, the research director for Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable change.\u201dTwitter was warned at least once about Mr. Sayoc\u2019s threatening behavior, but failed to act. On Friday, the company took down Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts after he was named as a suspect.Facebook, which also took down his account on Friday, condemned his actions in a statement. \u201cThere is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who attempt such horrendous acts.\u201dBut before Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts were taken down, The New York Times archived their contents. And a closer study of his online activity reveals the evolution of a political identity built on a foundation of false news and misinformation, and steeped in the insular culture of the right-wing media. For years, these platforms captured Mr. Sayoc\u2019s attention with a steady flow of outrage and hyperpartisan clickbait and gave him a public venue to declare his allegiance to Mr. Trump and his antipathy for the president\u2019s enemies.On social media, none of this behavior is particularly out of the ordinary. In fact, to many of his followers, Mr. Sayoc may have appeared to be just one of many partisan keyboard warriors working through their rage.\u201cThere are tons of people like this,\u201d said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who studies social media. \u201cHe took these memes to their most violent extreme, but this is a pretty big world on social media.\u201dThe genesis of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s partisan awakening may never be known, but hints of it first appeared on his Facebook feed in early 2016, as the primary season for the presidential election was starting.That February, he posted a link to a conspiracy theory video on YouTube titled, \u201cIs Barack Obama THE ANTICHRIST \u2014 100% PROOF Is There!\u201d Days later, he posted a second YouTube video, \u201cSatan Sent Obama to Destroy America,\u201d and a clip featuring Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, which was called, \u201cMUST HEAR: Sean Exposes Illegal Immigrant Crime Stats.\u201d He posted several anti-Obama videos multiple times on his feed, interspersed with stories about personal finance and his favorite soccer players.By the summer, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media activity was all politics, all the time.On Facebook, he posted stories from Infowars, World Net Daily, Breitbart and other right-wing websites. His posts, which rarely included commentary apart from the links, showed a fascination with Islamist terrorism, illegal immigration and anti-Clinton conspiracy theories. (On one post, a YouTube link, he wrote: \u201cThe Clinton have funneled two billion dollars through Clinton foundation.\u201d)In October, a month before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Sayoc posted a series of photos of himself at a Trump campaign rally, watching from the crowd in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.Despite his prolific posting, Mr. Sayoc does not appear to have gained a wide audience. His Twitter account was followed by fewer than 1,200 people as of Friday morning, and although he had nearly 3,000 friends on Facebook, many of his posts were never commented on or shared.He did, however, display an unusual tendency to post stories and images over and over again, sometimes dozens of times.But while Mr. Sayoc may have been an outlier in frequency, the content he posted resembled the kind of highly charged outrage bait that is a staple of partisan internet circles. On social platforms, where polarized content is often better at generating engagement than nuanced conversations, there can be a temptation to veer into more extreme territory to stand out.\u201cPeople find people with similar interests, and it naturally leads them to encounters and relationships and information they wouldn\u2019t necessarily find offline,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cBeing able to find similar communities can really lead you down a path of radicalization.\u201dFor years, many of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s posts simply reshared existing images, links and videos. But in recent months, he began to create more of his own posts. He began posting less on Facebook and dialed up his efforts on Twitter, where he could engage directly with his political heroes and foes.In March, he cheered on Republican tax policies, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have pay taxes on bonus yea Trump Trump Trump.\u201dIn June, he tweeted a birthday card to Mr. Trump and wrote: \u201cHappy Birthday to greatest gift from God President Trump Trump Trump. The greatest result President ever and economy for all American Soaring 2016-2024 Trump Trump Trump.\u201dAnd on Twitter, he began to attack prominent liberals, especially those who had either criticized or been criticized by Mr. Trump.He called Lena Dunham, the outspoken creator of \u201cGirls\u201d on HBO, \u201cHollywood slime\u201d and told her to \u201cstick your show where sun doesn\u2019t shine.\u201dHe became obsessed with David Hogg, a student who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and had become a prominent advocate for gun control. He tweeted out dozens of photos of Mr. Hogg, accusing him of being a \u201cfake fraud\u201d and being paid by the billionaire George Soros, a benefactor of liberal causes and a frequent target of the right.In recent months, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s behavior changed. His posts took on a darker, more obsessive tone, often accompanied by threats of violence and gory images of bloody animal carcasses. No longer mistakable as an everyday internet partisan, he posted repeatedly about \u201cunconquered Seminoles,\u201d a reference to the tribe that he appears to have adopted. (It also appeared on his van.) And on Twitter, his messages turned dark and sinister.He directed a tweet at Ms. Waters, the California Democrat, with a photo of what appeared to be her house. The message read: \u201csee you soon.\u201dHe sent another to Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under Mr. Obama, that read, \u201cSee u soon Tick Tock.\u201d And he told Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in New York, that he had a surprise waiting for her. \u201cWe Unconquered Seminole Tribe have a special Air boat tour lined up for you here in our Swamp Everglades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSee u real soon. Hug your loved ones.\u201d\u201cWe are deeply sorry for that error,\u201d Twitter added.Mr. Sayoc continued to post unabated until as recently as Wednesday, even as the authorities were conducting a manhunt for the sender of the explosives that had been mailed to prominent Democrats. He sent a tweet to the Twitter account at the website TMZ that criticized Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, for raising campaign funds from Mr. Soros and other liberal donors.\u201c$500,000 Soros puppet,\u201d read the text over the image.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lemon Cake That Cuts to the Pith", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThis recipe, using the whole fruit, is full of deep citrus flavor and may just be worth baking right away.This is why I found myself rushing home from work one day to bake a lemon cake recipe a friend had sent. It didn\u2019t matter that it was a weeknight, and that I had no reason to bake a cake. A new lemon cake recipe is its own best excuse.What makes this cake so unusual is the way the lemons are treated. Instead of being zested and juiced, they are boiled and pur\u00e9ed, using the whole fruit, pith and all. Boiling brings out a deeper, muskier side of a lemon, making it taste a little like marmalade, with a bitter edge. The lemon pur\u00e9e also gives the cake a dense texture that\u2019s lightened by beaten egg, and enriched with ground almonds. Separating and beating eggs made it a little more work than I wanted for a weeknight, but it was a fine cake nonetheless.What it was missing, at least for me, was that characteristic zippy brightness I love about lemon \u2014 the pucker factor. The boiling had brought out some lemony characteristics but muted others. So the next time I made the cake, I some grated fresh lemon zest to the batter.Then as a final touch, I drizzled on a simple confectioners\u2019 sugar glaze spiked with lots of lemon juice. It made the cake more intensely sweet and tart, and it looked pretty, too, with its frosty white icing.Once I had tweaked the recipe to my liking, I made the cake all summer long, sometimes topping it with fresh berries, sometimes leaving it plain. I made it with regular lemons, Meyer lemons, a combination of lemon and lime. All were good, but my favorite was the Meyer lemon version. Meyer lemons have a more rounded and complex citrus flavor than regular lemons, and less of the bitter pith. But you can use whatever lemons you have.You will still need to separate and beat the eggs, which might make the cake too much for any given Tuesday. But if you can\u2019t resist lemon, the recipe will be here when the weekend comes. It\u2019s worth the wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Way to Stay Cool", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration can decrease global warming by improving refrigerators and air-conditioners.There is a seemingly simple solution to this feedback loop: Stop making and using HFCs. But so far, we\u2019ve been unable to do it \u2014 not for scientific reasons, but for political ones. Just as we do with fossil fuels, we already have alternatives to HFCs that don\u2019t contribute to warming. For cooling, a range of substances including ammonia, propane and iso-butane can do the trick.There\u2019s another reason to be optimistic that we will break from the environmentally catastrophic refrigerants: We\u2019ve done it before. HFCs are actually themselves a replacement for CFCs, which were phased out by the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty that was amended in Kigali in 2016 to also eliminate HFCs. First used as refrigerants in the 1930s, CFCs were on the market for more than four decades before scientists discovered they were eating away at the ozone in our atmosphere \u2014 a process that, had it been allowed to continue unchecked, would have eventually exposed us to lethal amounts of the sun\u2019s radiation.The threat from HFCs is no less existential \u2014 or urgent. As the climate report makes clear, avoiding climate catastrophe will require almost superhuman efforts to overcome the wall of opposition to regulation erected by the fossil fuel industry. In comparison, breaking from HFCs should be comparatively easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVery pragmatic advice for anyone thinking about not casting a ballot.Contributing Opinion WriterA young woman in Milwaukee recently asked me if I had any advice for disillusioned young voters. She said that in a representative democracy it was hard to want to vote for, in her words, \u201cyet another 40,000-year-old white man\u201d who didn\u2019t look like her or have familiarity with her experiences. I could have offered a warm, gentle answer but these are not warm, gentle times. Given everything that has transpired since President Trump took office, I have no patience for disillusionment. I have no patience for the audacious luxury of choosing not to vote because of that disillusionment, as if not voting is the best choice a person could make. Not voting is, in fact, the worst choice a person could make.We are reaping what has been sown from voter disillusionment and we will continue doing so until enough people recognize what is truly at stake when they don\u2019t vote. A representative democracy is flawed but it is the political system we must work within, at least for the time being. We have a responsibility to participate in this democracy, even when the politicians we vote for aren\u2019t ideal or a perfect match. Voting isn\u2019t dating. We are not promised perfect candidates. Voting requires pragmatism and critical thinking and empathy and now, more than ever, intelligent compromise.Only 40 percent of Americans choose to vote during midterm elections, generally speaking. There has been a lot of talk about the importance of voting next Tuesday because we are desperate to change the political climate and the first step in doing that is shifting the balance of power in Congress. Politicians, their volunteers and progressive publications have been vigorously trying to get out the vote in a range of ways. We deserve a better class of politicians who recognize the greater good and act in service of that greater good rather than in service of amassing more power. We deserve politicians who are held accountable for their decisions. We deserve politicians from all walks of life, not just the same old wealthy white heterosexual people who are overly represented in all branches of the government.We also deserve to be disillusioned and disappointed with what our politicians, thus far, have offered. For the most part they have failed us spectacularly because they understand that radicalism doesn\u2019t play well even though radicalism is what we need now, more than ever. And it is certainly a travesty that universal health care and a livable minimum wage and civil rights and higher taxes on the wealthy are considered radical, but here we are.I am going to vote on next Tuesday but I can\u2019t say I am particularly optimistic about the impact my vote will have. Between the corrupt stranglehold the Republican Party has on political power and the incompetence and cowardice of the Democrats, voting feels futile. The politicians I will vote for don\u2019t represent me and what I believe in as much as I would like them to.Every single day there is a new, terrifying, preventable tragedy fomented by a president and an administration that uses hate and entitlement as political expedience. If you remain disillusioned or apathetic in this climate, you are complicit. You think your disillusionment is more important than the very real dangers marginalized people in this country live with. If you are feeling disillusioned, get over it, at least enough to vote and vote pragmatically. Tell your friends to vote. Drive people to the polls. Support candidates you believe in with your time or, if you can afford it, money. Volunteer for community organizations that address to the issues you most care about. Attend town halls held by your elected officials. Hold them accountable for the decisions they make with the power you give them. Run for local office. Do something. Do anything. Nothing will change by sitting at home for the midterms or any other election. We cannot afford disillusionment. We cannot afford to do nothing. Lives are at stake and if you don\u2019t recognize that, you are no better than those with whom you are disillusioned.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Spycraft and Stealthy Diplomacy Expose Russian Subversion in a Key Balkans Vote", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Ivan Savvidis has been the Kremlin\u2019s man in Greece.A Greek-Russian billionaire, a former member of the Russian Duma and the owner of a professional Greek soccer team, Mr. Savvidis has moved seamlessly between the sporting worlds of both countries. He has a finger in seemingly every facet of life in Thessaloniki, the Greek port city where he lives, and is a well-known player in the often feuding world of Greek and Russian oligarchs.All of which has made him of intense interest to American spy agencies.United States officials say they intercepted communications in June showing that Mr. Savvidis was working as Russia\u2019s conduit to undermine an agreement between Greece and Macedonia that would have paved the way for Macedonia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Greece has long objected to Macedonia\u2019s entry into NATO. Moscow, which sees the expanding alliance as a major threat on its border, was determined to defeat a referendum on the deal.In retaliation, American officials made an unusually aggressive move: They turned over the intercepts to the left-leaning Greek government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The Greek government responded by making a rare break with Moscow, expelling two Russian diplomats from Athens and barring the entry of two more.American spies and diplomats remain elated. Although a referendum vote last month in Macedonia on the agreement was inconclusive \u2014 the Macedonian Parliament must now decide, perhaps as early as this week, whether the country joins the Atlantic alliance \u2014 American officials see the exposure of Mr. Savvidis and the expulsion of the diplomats as a rare victory in a catch-up effort against Russian disinformation campaigns in Europe and the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing back and showing that we can play hardball too,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, a former United States ambassador to Macedonia. \u201cWe can tattletale, we can do things that maybe in the past we did not do.\u201dWhen American national security officials first saw signs in the summer of 2016 that Russia was trying to interfere in the American presidential election, the State and Defense Departments, working closely with the intelligence agencies, formed what is now called the Russia Influence Group to try to counter the Russian attempts, principally in Europe. That included looking for elections in Europe where Russia might try to intervene.Late this past spring, they saw that Macedonia was a likely target. On June 12, Macedonian and Greek officials announced that the country would change its name to North Macedonia to end a three-decade dispute with Greece, which saw \u201cMacedonia\u201d as implying territorial aspirations over a Greek region of the same name.Once the country became North Macedonia, Greece would lift its veto on the country joining NATO. A formal vote to adopt the new name was set for late September.Moscow was not pleased. At a conference in Athens three days after the agreement, a top Russian diplomat issued a stark warning to the West about the plans to invite Macedonia into the alliance.\u201cSure, we will not shoot nuclear bombs,\u201d said Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the European Union. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are errors that have consequences.\u201dMr. Chizhov\u2019s threat prompted a series of diplomatic cables back to Washington from Geoffrey R. Pyatt, the American ambassador to Greece who was at the same conference, to warn that Moscow was going to try to stymie the upcoming referendum. The State Department, the C.I.A. and the Pentagon\u2019s European Command, based in Stuttgart, Germany, were already on the case, officials said.By then, opposition to the referendum had already surfaced in Macedonia. Over the summer, there would be hundreds of new websites calling for a boycott of the vote and Facebook posts urging Macedonians to burn their ballots \u2014 classic disinformation, Macedonian and American officials said, directed by Russian-backed groups.The day of the agreement, there were also violent protests outside the Parliament building in Skopje, the Macedonian capital.Enter Mr. Savvidis. He had been on the radar of American and Greek intelligence agencies for years as a member of Mr. Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, when he was in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and had parlayed a fortune first made through a Russian tobacco company into a string of interests throughout northern Greece.As the owner of the Greek soccer team, PAOK FC in Thessaloniki, he famously stormed the field during a match this year against an Athens team while armed with a holstered handgun and surrounded by bodyguards. The Athens team\u2019s players left the field over concerns for their safety and the match was abandoned.In June, American officials determined from the intercepts of his communications \u2014 email, texts, phone calls or a combination \u2014 that he had been paying the protesters.One senior United States official said American agencies were able to easily collect financial data that put Mr. Savvidis behind payments to citizens and soccer fans to incite violence against the Macedonia referendum.Mr. Savvidis strongly denied the accusations. \u201cTotally false and highly slanderous,\u201d his holding company said in a statement this past summer.Conveying the American intelligence report to the Greek government in early July fell to Mr. Pyatt, a seasoned American diplomat who has been Washington\u2019s ambassador to Athens for two years, several United States officials said. Mr. Pyatt was well prepared for such as role, having served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine from 2013 to 2016, when Russia seized Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\u201cThere\u2019s not a trick the Russians can pull that Pyatt doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. Mr. Murphy said he had spoken to Mr. Pyatt about Russia\u2019s meddling in the Macedonia referendum, but he declined to comment on specifics of their private conversations.But getting the information to the Greek prime minister was one thing. Getting him to act on it was by no means assured.The prime minister, Mr. Tsipras, who had refused to join the rest of Europe in backing Britain in blaming Russia for a nerve agent attack on a former spy, was from a political party with a historically cozy relationship with Moscow. Still, the decision to move against Moscow was made easier by the effort Mr. Tsipras had just put into breaking a 30-year logjam with Macedonia, only to see Russia try to spoil it.Serbia50 milesKosovoBulgariaSkopjeMacedoniaAlbaniaThessalonikiGreeceAthensBy The New York TimesRecent American diplomacy helped, officials said. The Obama government stood by Greece during its yearslong financial crisis, advocating for Athens to stay in the eurozone when some European countries initially balked at bailing out Greece. Jacob J. Lew, President Barack Obama\u2019s Treasury secretary, spent so much time on the Greece debt relief package that senior officials joked he had become the Treasury desk officer for Greece. Mr. Obama and Mr. Lew both traveled to Athens during the crisis, as did Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who returned there after leaving office last year.Mr. Trump hosted Mr. Tsipras last October at the White House, and the two countries are discussing expanding the American military\u2019s presence in Greece, including access for United States ships and aircraft.\u201cIf you look at geography, and you look at current operations in Libya, and you look at current operations in Syria, you look at potential other operations in the eastern Mediterranean, the geography of Greece and the opportunities here are pretty significant,\u201d Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a recent visit to Athens.On July 11, Mr. Tsipras broke with Moscow. His government expelled the two diplomats and barred two other Russians from entering Greece, accusing them of trying to bribe unidentified officials and foment demonstrations against the Macedonia deal.\u201cThe constant disrespect for Greece must stop,\u201d the Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \u201cNo one can or has the right to interfere in Greece\u2019s domestic affairs.\u201dMoscow later said it was expelling Greek diplomats in retaliation.The American role in the Greek expulsion also shows how wide a gulf has developed between Mr. Trump \u2014 who has publicly questioned NATO while at the same time professing his deep admiration for Mr. Putin \u2014 and an American national security establishment that remains rooted to a deeply held belief that Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in elections both in the United States and among American allies is a geopolitical threat to American security.That is a thought rarely, if ever, expressed by Mr. Trump. But it is one that a succession of American security officials repeat every day.\u201cThe kind of mischief that Russia has practiced, from Macedonia to the United States,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Sept. 11, ahead of the Sept. 30 referendum, is \u201calways beyond the pale as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d He followed his remarks with a trip to Skopje to \u201cmake a specific statement that we stand with the Macedonian people,\u201d he said.Asked if there was anything the United States was doing to combat Russian efforts to interfere in the referendum, Mr. Mattis said, \u201cYes.\u201d He declined to go into specifics, but Defense Department officials said that they are also launching information operations, jointly with the governments of Macedonia, Montenegro and Ukraine, to counter Russian disinformation in elections and referendums there.None of the American behind-the-scene efforts may come to anything if the Macedonian Parliament does not agree to the name change. But Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who sent the measure to lawmakers this week, said he will call early elections if the measure fails.Julian Barnes contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a Frog Needs to Make That Leap", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysciencetakeThe interesting thing about frogs, Dr. Richards pointed out in an interview, is that the ones that jump do so with power and accuracy. It has always been known that the hinge-like iliosacral joint in the pelvis, which is unique to frogs, was significant in jumping. The joint opens to let the frog unfold like a flip phone, so that in the air the animal\u2019s long, powerful legs and stubby rigid torso align like a straight, flying arrow.The question Dr. Richards and his colleagues asked was whether the joint was necessary for the evolution of frog jumping.To look at the role of the joint, they recorded jumping frogs with high-speed video (Twain was stuck with words alone) and measured the forces involved in real jumps. The scientists created a computer model to fiddle with, modifying the action of the joint, for instance, to see what would happen.Their calculations and virtual experiments suggest that the frog can jump without such a joint, since the legs still have plenty of power, but not as accurately.And while frogs on a riverbank may leap anywhere to avoid predators, some frogs, like those in trees, can be highly accurate. There are signs of the joint in frog fossils, said Dr. Richards, although it\u2019s not clear how mobile that joint was. \u201cThere's also evidence just looking at the frogs that exist today, which are thousands of species, that this hinge mechanism evolved multiple times independently,\u201d he added.What Dr. Richards and his colleagues suggest is that jumping evolved first and the flexible joint evolved later for finesse, accuracy and control of the jumping process.This finding may even have some application to prosthetics. It took Dr. Richards years to realize the similarity \u201cbetween a jumping frog and a reaching arm.\u201d \u201cWe can do that motion with extreme speed and accuracy,\u201d he said. We can throw a ball, he said, but we can also reach for a piano key. Frogs, too, can go for power, distance and accuracy. Frogs have been good to Dr. Richards, and he plans to keep studying them. Early on, when people pegged him as a frog guy, he would tell them, \u201cI\u2019m not a frog guy \u2014 I\u2019m a muscle guy. I study the muscles.\u201dBut after a while, he realized that everything he wanted to learn in biology he could observe in frogs and their movements. \u201cThey\u2019re just so diverse, and they do so many things, and they\u2019re just cool animals, so I\u2019ve become endeared to them. Now I do feel like I\u2019m a frog guy.\u201dNo doubt Twain would approve. An earlier version of this article misstated the affiliation of Chris Richards.

{"Headline": "Conservatives Are Wrong to Gloat About Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJoining the frat party might be fun, but it will do great harm to the court and the country. Mr. Marcus is The Federalist's New York correspondent.The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the Supreme Court is a conservative victory of generational proportions. It is the capstone of a decades long project to fundamentally change the judicial branch of the government in ways that can open heretofore locked doors on abortion, affirmative action, gun rights and religious freedom.There is every reason for those on the right \u2014 like me \u2014 to celebrate. But there are also some very good reasons to keep those celebrations quiet, respectful and dignified.This kind of gloating is a mistake for Republicans and, more important, for the country.One reason a muted and conciliatory approach is advisable is that the Supreme Court, unlike the elected branches of government, exercises its power not through control of the purse or the military, but through the faith of the American people. If that faith is sufficiently shaken, the most vital check Americans have on elected power could be shattered, and the Democrats are not without options to capitalize on it.The concern that millions of Americans will, thanks to the controversial confirmation, now see the court as illegitimate surely weighed heavily on the decisions and actions of Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, whose votes ultimately got Justice Kavanaugh over the finish line.Mr. Flake\u2019s call for an F.B.I. investigation infuriated many conservatives but was, in retrospect, clearly meant to secure Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s legitimacy as much as his confirmation. Likewise, Ms. Collins\u2019s speech on the floor of the Senate, while a resounding defense of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record and the presumption of his innocence, also showed deference and decency to Christine Blasey Ford, whose testimony the senator from Maine called \u201csincere, painful and compelling.\u201d These words stood in stark contrast to President Trump, who callously mocked Dr. Blasey\u2019s allegations at a political rally last week.The difference between Ms. Collins\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks reveals a deep tension within the Republican Party today. Mr. Trump\u2019s bullheadedness and bluster has arguably led to many of the big wins he promised. But it has also divided the nation and left moderate conservatives in a difficult position. They refuse to mimic his behavior, as Mr. Graham has in recent weeks, but they realize that refusing to join in pushes them farther from the new center of conservative power.They are right to resist. Joining the frat party might be fun in the short term, but it will gut any small remaining claim the Republicans have to Romney-like dignity or McCain-like duty to serve all Americans. Whatever one believes about the allegations leveled against Justice Kavanaugh, it is clear that millions of Americans are in real pain. The widespread feeling that the voices of women are being ignored \u2014 once again \u2014 is leading to a rage that many on the left are increasingly embracing as the necessary counter to Trump-era conservatism.The anger on both sides has already shut down communication and compromise among our politicians. Now it threatens the ability of average Americans to talk to each other.The task for conservatives in the wake of these ugly two weeks is not to point and laugh, but to show care and compassion that may build trust in Justice Kavanaugh and the court among those who so bitterly and sincerely opposed him. There is plenty of blame for the tribalism in our country to go around. Ending it, however, is a task best undertaken by the side that is winning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Scientists Cracked the Climate Change Case", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe biggest crime scene on the planet is the planet. We know the earth is warming, but who or what is causing it?Dr. Schmidt is the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.But how do we know what is driving these climate trends? It comes down to the same kind of detective work that typifies a crime scene investigation, only here we are dealing with a case that encompasses the whole world. Let me give you my view, which does not necessarily represent the position of NASA or the federal government.For the past 100 years we have documented good, independently confirmed observations of change at the surface of the planet, and for the past 40 years satellites and comprehensive measuring efforts have provided a much fuller view of changes throughout the earth system. These observations show clearly that among other things, the surface of the planet has warmed, the upper atmosphere has cooled, the oceans are gaining an enormous amount of heat, sea level is rising, Arctic ice has greatly receded and glaciers around the world are in retreat. Scientists have no shortage of suspects for the causes of climate change. Over the 4.5-billion-year history of the planet, almost anything that might have happened has happened, sometimes many times over. The sun has brightened and sometimes dimmed, massive volcanic eruptions have occurred, the planet\u2019s orbit has wobbled, the continents have moved, the land surface has been remade, the composition of the atmosphere and its ability to trap and reflect solar and terrestrial radiation has altered, ocean circulations have sputtered and stopped, and we have been struck, at least once, by a mass-extinction-inducing asteroid.Each of these events left a unique fingerprint of change on the climate system, with impacts reaching from the upper atmosphere 30 miles high to the deep ocean four miles down, from the tropics to the poles, and in the sediments laid down in the geological record. To track down the culprit of any one specific climate change involves piecing together the contemporaneous fingerprints and tracking them back to the plausible causes.But even taking into account uncertainties in the amount of air pollution in the 19th century or in estimating global temperatures through time, scientists have concluded that the current warmth is impossible to explain without human contributions. It is on a par with the likelihood that a DNA match at a crime scene is purely coincidental. Moreover, when we include the multiplicity of human effects, we match them with the observed trends at the surface, in the Arctic, in the ocean and aloft. The dominant factor that emerges is the rise in greenhouse gases, which we know comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. When this is all put together, the conclusions are inescapable: Without human activities the planet would not have warmed over the past century. When scientists include all of the effects that humans have had on the climate system, they can match them with these many independent and varied observations. Our best assessment is therefore that humans, at least the ones responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions, have been responsible for all of the recent trends in global temperatures.The forensics have spoken, and we are to blame.Gavin Schmidt is a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Week\u2019s Mail Bombs Are No Surprise", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are examples of stochastic terrorism \u2014 individually random, but these days, statistically predictable.Mr. Press is the author of \u201cBeautiful Souls\u201d and \u201cAbsolute Convictions.\u201d\u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable,\u201d the White House announced on Wednesday in response to the spate of bomb threats. But as the anniversary of another act of homegrown terrorism suggests, they are also unsurprising. The event in question was the murder of Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider from the Buffalo suburb of Amherst who, 20 years ago this week, was shot while standing in his kitchen by James Charles Kopp, an anti-abortion extremist.Dr. Slepian\u2019s murder was not an isolated act. It came amid a wave of violent terrorism targeting abortion providers in the mid-1990s, including a series of shootings and sniper attacks that took the lives of six doctors and clinic workers. It also came after years of increasingly confrontational protests at Buffalo WomenServices, the clinic where Dr. Slepian worked.The anti-abortion protesters in Buffalo, as elsewhere in the country, claimed to be nonviolent, invoking the example of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and portraying themselves as defenders of innocent life. But their abrasive rhetoric and tactics sent a different message. Not infrequently, women arriving for appointments at Buffalo WomenServices and other clinics in Western New York were screamed at and harassed. The physicians who provided them with care were likewise verbally threatened and denounced as \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201cmass murderers,\u201d sometimes at demonstrations in front of their homes.It was a bullet, not those words, that ended Dr. Slepian\u2019s life. But by repeatedly using rhetoric that demonized abortion providers as monstrous \u201cbaby killers,\u201d the protesters increased the likelihood that someone in their ranks would eventually decide using lethal force to stop them was justified. In recent years, a term has begun to circulate to capture this phenomenon \u2014 \u201cstochastic terrorism,\u201d in which mass communications, including social media, inspire random acts of violence that according to one description \u201care statistically predictable but individually unpredictable.\u201d In other words, every act and actor is different, and no one knows by whom or where an act will happen \u2014 but it\u2019s a good bet that something will.When a drifter named Robert Lewis Dear opened fire on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs in 2015, killing three people and injuring nine, anti-abortion activists like David Daleiden described Mr. Dear as a \u201cmadman\u201d acting on his own. A few months earlier, however, Mr. Daleiden had released a series of undercover videos that falsely suggested Planned Parenthood sold fetal organs for profit. The videos had a powerful effect, causing a surge of threats against doctors and abortion clinics and potentially explaining why the organization became a target of Mr. Dear\u2019s wrath. (\u201cKill the babies, that\u2019s what Planned Parenthood does,\u201d he announced in court.)Not surprisingly, Mr. Daleiden\u2019s effort to disavow responsibility for the shooting in Colorado Springs rang hollow to Planned Parenthood, which knows all too well that incendiary language can spur extremists to act. Before he was murdered, Barnett Slepian knew this as well.

It is Mr. Trump who ran a campaign ad depicting George Soros as part of a cabal of globalists \u2014 all of whom happened to be Jewish \u2014 who have \u201cbled our country dry.\u201d It is Mr. Trump who suggested that \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d might have to \u201cdo\u201d something if his opponent in the 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, got to pick judges they did not like.These are just words, some would say.

{"Headline": "O.C.D., My Exhausting Best Friend", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byObsessive-compulsive disorder is a companion that constantly wants to protect me, never realizing the threats it sees aren\u2019t legitimate.Contributing Opinion Writer O.C.D. has often been misunderstood, undiagnosed and exploited as a set of amusing quirks for Hollywood characters. I wish my O.C.D. was as fun and lovable as depicted in \u201cMonk.\u201dIt\u2019s not.At one point in my life, I endured an endless stream of tormenting thoughts about sex, overwhelmed by visions of every vile variation, partnership and arrangement imaginable. They would make Caligula blush.Here I am, a somewhat intelligent, moral, responsible individual fully aware that the thoughts are irrational, but nonetheless I must perform ridiculous rituals to try to feel safe and achieve relief.I think of it as God\u2019s sick joke.Dr. Phillipson compares O.C.D. to a best friend who desperately wants to protect us but warns us about threats that are never legitimate.I obviously need a new best friend.Most people wouldn\u2019t guess that I\u2019m constantly tortured by disturbing thoughts. I\u2019ve hosted live TV shows and given speeches in front of large audiences. During the LSAT, a few friends from college sat next to me because they said I had a calming energy. They had no idea of the internal storm always raging in my mind.As far as acting on my thoughts and fears, I don\u2019t: I\u2019m possibly the most boring man on earth. I\u2019m married with kids, don\u2019t drink or get into bar fights. This makes sense. \u201cThemes of O.C.D. have no absolutely no implication about the character of a person,\u201d Dr. Phillipson said.This is the most successful treatment for O.C.D., and it involves repeated exposure to the fearful thoughts without giving into the short-term relief delivered by compulsions. The trick is that you can\u2019t outthink the disorder, you can\u2019t outargue it, you can\u2019t outrun it. You have to make the voluntary choice to confront it. It\u2019s like inviting Pennywise the Clown, the demon from Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt\u201d who feeds off your fears, over for a nice cup of tea. For example, if you\u2019re obsessed with germs and contamination, then you have to abandon your compulsions and instead use public toilets and avoid repeatedly washing your hands. You choose to sit with the threat. Eventually, your brain habituates to the threat and is even bored by it, realizing there is nothing to fear.Dr. Phillipson said people should first choose to forgive themselves for having O.C.D. If everyone had our misfiring brains, the whole world would behave exactly like us. Second, he advised against using negative imagery and instead welcoming our \u201cbest friend\u2019s warning\u201d but then choosing to ignore it. \u201cThe goal of the treatment is to make the thoughts irrelevant,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not to make the thoughts go away.\u201dO.C.D. has exhausted me. I\u2019m tired of suffering. I\u2019m now doing exposure and response prevention, voluntarily exposing myself to my fears. It\u2019s terrifying and often excruciating, like walking through a gauntlet of horrors without a shield or sword, armed only with belief and resolute conviction.All the while, I\u2019m working to abandon shame and guilt about my mental health disorder and to embrace the \u201cbest friend\u201d I didn\u2019t ask for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Find a Facebook Workaround: Their Own Apps", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine a society in which everyone more or less agrees with you.You wake up in the morning to online greetings from people who share your views on guns, religion and country. Your news feed contains only posts from like-minded politicians or articles from like-minded news outlets. You can safely post your own comments without fear of vitriol from trolls or challenges from naysayers.This is the insular world in which tens of thousands of Americans who use conservative political apps are experiencing the midterm election season.The apps deliver curated partisan news feeds on what are effectively private social media platforms, free from the strictures and content guidelines imposed by Silicon Valley giants. Some allow supporters to comment on posts or contribute their own, with less risk that their posts will be flagged as offensive or abusive.Many apps have video-game-like features where users can earn points for making campaign donations or contacting their legislators. Amass enough points and a supporter can attain increasing status levels \u2014 like \u201cBigLeague\u201d or \u201cPatriot\u201d \u2014 or even gain a spot on the app\u2019s leader board.Crucially, these mini-platforms harness the powerful reach of platforms like Facebook and Twitter even while competing with them. Some apps give users the option of posting on Twitter or Facebook messages that are scripted by the campaigns, combining the seeming authenticity of organic social media posts with the message discipline of paid advertising.Proponents are positioning these apps as durable communities that offer conservatives viable alternatives to mainstream social networks.The Great American app has offered text messages that you can send to your representatives with a push of a button. The app identifies your representatives from the ZIP code you provide when building your profile. Sheltered from the broader public, however, the platforms can intensify political polarization and social divisiveness, or circulate disinformation.Anyone in the United States may download uCampaign apps, Mr. Peters said, but they give a campaign the ability to bar interlopers who post messages challenging the campaign\u2019s positions.The Great America app juxtaposes a mix of enthusiastic posts about Mr. Trump and photos of puppies with anti-immigrant memes like \u201cToday\u2019s illegals, tomorrow\u2019s Democrats.\u201d One recent post, with an image depicting nooses, read: \u201cNoose flash: Treason still punishable by death.\u201dThe Great America app also hosts a ritual called \u201cFake News Friday,\u201d in which it awards \u201cTrump points\u201d to users who post liberal-bashing, mainstream-media-trashing memes.\u201cIs this the beginning of the political Balkanization of digital engagement technologies?\u201d asked Michael Slaby, a communications strategist who oversaw technology for President Barack Obama\u2019s national campaigns. \u201cGiven the tribalism of current American politics, it\u2019s possible.\u201dDan Backer, general counsel for the Great America PAC, said the app was a place for like-minded Trump supporters to socialize and entertain themselves. It has also enabled the campaign to quickly and inexpensively engage supporters. Since 2017, the Great America PAC has paid uCampaign about $108,000 for development and monthly service fees.Mr. Backer added that the app\u2019s user policy prohibits abusive comments and those that incite criminal activity. But, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to be in the business of trying to censor people\u2019s political views.\u201d\u201cIt did not do the one thing I wanted it to do,\u201d he said, which was to \u201chelp win the election for Mitt Romney by asking me to donate money to them, to post things to social media, to invite my friends and family to register to vote \u2014 to do all of the things, basically, that the Obama app did.\u201dIn 2014, Mr. Peters started uCampaign with $150,000 in start-up capital. The money came from Sean Fieler, the president of the hedge fund Equinox Partners and a well-known donor to conservative groups.The N.R.A. and Great America apps, which enable users to friend and message one another, have developed cultures with their own parlance and rituals.In their posts, users sometimes greet one another as \u201cdeplorables\u201d or \u201cfellow patriots\u201d and refer to liberals as enemies, \u201clibtards\u201d or traitors. Conspiracy theories \u2014 including memes against the financier George Soros \u2014 abound. The midterm elections are not about Democrats vs. Republicans but, as one N.R.A. app poster put it, \u201csocialism vs. freedom.\u201dOutsiders, for their part, can keep out.Soon after a reporter for The New York Times contacted 10 users via the apps, a person with the user name Deplorable Dee posted on the Great America news feed: \u201cTroll Alert!!! New York Times asking for interviews, do not communicate with these libtards.\u201dOnly one user, Ken Kumerle, a car rental agent in South Carolina who has earned more than 366,000 points on the N.R.A. app, agreed to be interviewed for this article.\u201cThey all seem very patriotic to me,\u201d Mr. Kumerle said of the members of the N.R.A. app community. \u201cI go in every day and try to do something, post or send a tweet.\u201dBy tracking their users\u2019 activities, political apps can collect a wealth of data about them and their social circles outside Facebook\u2019s control. Apps from uCampaign and WPA Intelligence, for instance, ask users for their name, address, phone number and email address. The apps from uCampaign may also collect user names and other details when users post campaign messages from the apps on Twitter or connect their Facebook accounts.The National Rifle Association app offers users 100 points for posting a comment on its news feed and 200 points for telling their legislators, \u201cNo New Gun Control Today!\u201dThe Times tested several of the apps\u2019 privacy practices and found that, when a user invited a friend to join uCampaign\u2019s N.R.A. app, the app did not send the friend\u2019s information to itself or to other companies. But The Times found that a similar feature on WPA\u2019s Cruz app sent a friend\u2019s contact details to an AggregateIQ domain.Some political apps, including from uCampaign, also ask users who want to send friends campaign messages to share their contacts. If a user agrees, the app can try to match the contacts to profiles of likely voters, using information provided by a political campaign. As an example, Mr. Peters, the chief executive, described how the Trump app in 2016 was able to match 68 of his 900 contacts to voters in swing states.\u201cIt asked me to send a text to my mom in Michigan saying, \u2018Only Trump has a plan to repeal Obamacare,\u2019\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cBut it asked me to send an email to a friend in Florida saying that \u2018only Trump has a plan to build the wall.\u2019\u201dMr. Peters turned some of those features, like inviting friends, into a way for users to collect points and gain status within the group. He began incorporating gamelike features into his company\u2019s apps in 2014 as a way to get supporters to participate in political activities.In July, for instance, the N.R.A. app began offering users 100 points for tweeting a slogan urging their senators to support Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. The messages have since been have tweeted more than 13,300 times.The Cruz app similarly awards points to users for tweeting campaign messages, volunteering and taking part in other activities.\u201cThe Obama campaign proved, and Democrats continue to prove, the value of continuously engaging supporters via an app like this,\u201d said Mr. Wilson of WPA Intelligence, the company behind the Cruz app. \u201cIt is critical Republicans keep up with tools of our own.\u201dAaron Krolik and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.That much is right, and the president should be commended for abandoning his credulous repetitions of the denials of Saudi Arabia and its leaders. His next job must be to ensure that the consequences are, indeed, appropriate to the brutal murder of a self-exiled Saudi journalist living in Virginia whose only fault was to criticize the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Yet Mr. Trump still seemed unprepared to point a finger at the de facto Saudi ruler who had become a close ally of the president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. It\u2019s \u201ca little bit early\u201d to draw such conclusions, Mr. Trump told reporters from The Times on Thursday, suggesting that the time would most likely come.Because, first of all, that calculation cannot hold in a killing as vindictive, barbaric and needless as that of Jamal Khashoggi. It is in the DNA of America to speak out against atrocities, even if doing so carries a cost. Mr. Khashoggi was a gadfly, a nuisance, but hardly a threat to the House of Saud. And the very possibility that Prince Mohammed would order such an atrocity should raise serious questions about his stability and his value as an ally.Mr. Trump is right to be concerned for the future of America\u2019s relations with Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is an important ally in a volatile part of the world, a major purchaser of American weapons and a powerhouse in global oil politics.Yet now that the president has acknowledged that the Saudis crossed a red line, he must accept his obligation to tell them so and to demand that those responsible for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s heinous murder be held accountable, even if it includes the crown prince.And the House of Saud has no shortage of potential heirs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Congo\u2019s Ebola Outbreak, Experimental Treatments Are Proving Effective", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthMore than half of the patients who received treatment survived, scientists reported. NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Experimental new treatments for Ebola appear to be working effectively in the most recent outbreak in Central Africa, an expert reported at a medical conference here on Wednesday.The death rate was 43 percent among patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo who received one or more of four experimental treatments, said Dr. William A. Fischer II, an emergency care specialist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.If the count excluded Ebola patients who were within hours of death when they arrived at the hospital, the fatality rate would be 32 percent, he added. By contrast, about 68 percent of Ebola patients in hospitals before the new treatments were approved had died.Effective treatments, combined with a new vaccine, may revolutionize efforts to turn back Ebola, one of the world\u2019s deadliest plagues. The vaccine itself protects health care workers tending to patients, as well as family members and others who have been in contact with them and may be infected.\u201cI do think the tide is changing,\u201d said Dr. Fischer, as he presented preliminary data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. \u201cI do think we\u2019re in a new world.\u201dDr. Fischer has treated Ebola patients in Congo\u2019s current outbreak and in previous ones, including the epidemic in West Africa that began 2013 and ultimately killed about 11,000 people.Of the 276 known victims in Congo\u2019s outbreak, only 113 patients who reached hospitals after August 12 have received any of the new treatments. The results were very preliminary, Dr. Fisher acknowledged, and it is too early to draw firm conclusions about how well each of the four treatments works.In early animal trials, all four treatments worked 90 percent to 100 percent of the time in rhesus monkeys who received them up to five days after infection with Ebola.The four treatments are: remdesivir, an antiviral drug; mAb114, a human antibody cloned from a survivor of an outbreak years ago in Zaire; REGN-EB3, a cocktail of cloned human antibodies; and ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies made from a blend of human and mouse proteins.Remdesivir can be injected quickly, but must be given once daily for 10 days. ZMapp must be given for three days in infusions lasting up to five hours. The two others, mAb114 and REGN-EB3, are given in single infusions.Remdesivir works against all strains of Ebola. The others, as far as is known, work only against the Zaire strain of the virus. Depending on conditions, different treatments and combinations are used in different patients at the three treatment centers in Congo, Dr. Fischer said.Serious side effects appear to be few. Some patients receiving treatment have experienced headaches, fever and rapid heartbeats. Some of the experimental treatments need refrigeration, and not all are available at all sites. Moreover, there are not always enough medical workers on hand to oversee infusions, which must be given very slowly to avoid the risk of anaphylactic shock \u2014 an overwhelming immune reaction to foreign proteins.The North Kivu outbreak seems to have begun in April or May. On July 31, human samples tested positive for Ebola, and the outbreak was officially declared. Health officials in Congo approved all four treatments in August. All the approvals were \u201cinvestigational,\u201d meaning that the treatments are experimental but there is evidence they work in animals and are likely to be safe and effective in humans.An unusual number of children have been infected with Ebola in Congo, Dr. Fischer said. Local health workers suspect that many visited traditional healers for treatment of malaria and were infected with Ebola by other patients there. As word spreads that effective new treatments are available, he added, Congolese health officials hope that patients will turn first to medical clinics instead.Advertisement"}

And denial is hope on steroids.Mr. Roberts is an insurance executive.I\u2019ve been wrestling with a chronic problem we in the insurance industry haven\u2019t been able to crack for centuries.It\u2019s called denial.I\u2019m referring to the seemingly innate refusal of the human mind to appreciate the gravity of a potential disaster before actually experiencing one. As humans, our bias toward denial tempts us to roll the dice, buy scratch tickets, drive fast, jump off cliffs, eat fatty food, ignore our retirement funds and generally take too many chances.We let smoke detector batteries die. We build homes in the same flood plains where our last ones were destroyed. When a monster hurricane like Michael is bearing down, some of us ignore evacuation orders thinking our grit will enable us ride it out. It happens every time.You see denial on the macro level, too. Global companies rely on risky partners only to see their supply chains snap. Power blackouts endure for weeks because no one bothered to build a resilient infrastructure. Skyscrapers go up in flames because they have flammable cladding yet no automatic sprinklers.Generally, people don\u2019t respect the power of potential disasters, and they don\u2019t adequately plan for them.Let\u2019s face it. Denial is hope on steroids. We also outlined some other facets of denial: A person can worry about only so many things, so seemingly remote possibilities like natural disasters often fail to make the cut. Short-term pleasure is more appealing to consider than long-term consequences. It\u2019s easy, but wrong, to conflate the inevitability of a natural disaster with the supposed inevitability of life and property loss. People think insurance makes you whole. (If you think that, ask a disrupted business that lost its market share to resilient competitors if it was made whole.) And: Most people are followers, thus institutionalizing the practice of denial.So, are you worried now? Probably not. Thus, humans continue to take chances. And when they get away with them, they take more chances. Conversely, when they lose, they learn. Unfortunately, they usually learn only when they lose.Our visitors feel the heat from the fire. They cringe as a two-by-four hurtles across a room in a simulated hurricane. Their bodies absorb the concussion of an explosion. When they leave, they seem converted.We need to do this kind of education in a broader way that reaches people and businesses in vulnerable communities, places that face threats from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, flooding and wildfires.In schools, we need to weave disaster and denial stories into classes on physics, earth science psychology, engineering, finance, statistics and the building trades. We need to find ways to tell the stories of people who suffered because of their denial, and who survived because they took the right precautions and built in the proper safeguards. Communities at potential risk should bring in engineers and emergency workers to point out what could fail, wash away, freeze, rot, short-circuit, explode, shatter, cave in or burn up. \u201cSee these wedding photos?,\u201d they might say. \u201cMight as well toss them in the creek.\u201d Or: \u201cYour classic car? It will be a boat that doesn\u2019t float.\u201d Or, to a utility executive: \u201cYour power plant? Heaven forbid a storm surge comes your way.\u201dAnd governments and insurance companies should share more widely the eerily precise predictions we\u2019re getting from big data. At my company, we can, for example, pinpoint the single data center in a global company that is most likely to be underwater when a flood strikes.In other words, we should unleash the power of predictive analytics and bring it to the doorsteps of people who live in harm\u2019s way, even though they deny it. All of this education \u2014 this pre-experiencing disaster \u2014 would underscore the critical need to focus on prevention and building resilience against threats that are easier for people simply to deny. Those who have experienced a real-life disaster already understand how disruptive it can be to their lives, communities and businesses. They discover that the turmoil is usually worse than people imagine and lasts longer than they expect. They come to realize that vulnerability is a choice, as is building resilience against potential threats. Once enlightened, they choose to identify the risks they face and address them head-on.For others, the standard warnings may fall on deaf ears. But if they could pre-experience a catastrophe, perhaps they would listen up and take some precautions. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When to Open a Bottle: Aging Wine Without the Anxiety ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe notion of putting bottles away raises fears. How do you know when they are ready to open? Did I wait long enough? Too long? Relax.Aging wine is an act of hope and optimism, laced with fear and dread.You dearly want to be rewarded by a bottle that matures from awkward, inarticulate youth to expressive beauty and, eventually, elegant complexity. The fear is of waiting not long enough or too long, of storing it wrong and, ultimately, of missing out on what could have been, or what once was.Entwined with this anxiety is a misplaced conviction that bottles age toward a momentary peak, then drop away into oblivion. Opening a bottle at the wrong time, many believe, risks missing that special moment. Too often, I\u2019ve seen people unable to enjoy an otherwise delicious bottle of wine because they have convinced themselves that they missed the peak.Determining which bottles to age and when to open them is among the most puzzling aspects of wine. Misunderstandings can cause misery. The aging question just adds one more layer of doubt to a subject with a seemingly endless capacity to induce angst in otherwise confident people. Every day brings numerous possible pitfalls.Here is the good news about aging wine: Regardless of what many people assume, there is no single right time to open any particular bottle. Whenever you decide to drink a wine is the right time. If you go about it the right way, it\u2019s hard to make a mistake.First, it\u2019s important to understand that wine does not age toward an apogee of development, then drop off. Bottles that can improve with aging tend to move along a gentle arc, during which they will offer many delicious expressions, from youthful exuberance to middle-age complexity to eventual fragility.Which stage you prefer depends on the particular wine and, especially, your own taste.By contrast, the French were said to prefer Champagne young and lively, full of energy and primary flavors.These are broad generalizations, of course. The point is that the best time to open a bottle is subjective. The trick is getting to know your own preferences, which takes a bit of time and effort.If that had been my only bottle, I might have been despondent. Aging one bottle of a wine is a risky proposition, like putting all your money into a single stock. With multiple bottles, your bets are hedged. Opening one bottle too early becomes useful information rather than a source of despair.It was almost 10 years before I opened the second bottle, but wow, was it delicious, deep and complex yet still youthful. This wine has a long way to go, and I\u2019m delighted to have four bottles left.Most of us will have to survive with something less than ideal. Wine refrigerators are one solution. Good ones are worthwhile investments, though I have yet to meet anybody who believed that their refrigerator was big enough.If you have a cellar, but it doesn\u2019t keep the ideal 55 degrees year round, fear not. Temperature variation is not terrible, as long as it does not get too warm. Except for very old vintages, wine tends to be sturdier than we think.The evolutionary path a bottle will take varies, depending on the type of wine, the style of the producer and the conditions of the vintage.Wines like the finest Bordeaux, Burgundy and Barolo have a long arc of evolution. For their first 10 years, their potential for pleasure may be locked down underneath impenetrable tannins.But these famously long-lived bottles are not the only ones worthy of aging. For years, people have recommended drinking Beaujolais and Muscadet very young. These wines, it was said, had no capacity to age.This was the conventional wisdom, at least, when much of the Beaujolais and Muscadet was made cheaply for mass consumption. With all the processing these wines received, the wines\u2019 vital life forces were stripped away. Of course, they needed to be drunk young. With more time, they fell apart.We now know, however, that if made conscientiously with minimal manipulation, even those wines thought not to age can surprise with their capacity to evolve. The propulsive vivacity of young Muscadet turns broad and deep over the years, no longer as incisive but more complex.I don\u2019t dislike aged Muscadet: It can be wonderful, and some people like it better that way. But I\u2019ve concluded that I prefer it younger.I love young Beaujolais, too. But I recently opened a bottle of Daniel Bouland Morgon Vieilles Vignes 2005, and it was beautiful, silken and earthy, with an aroma of violets. I haven\u2019t had this wine in maybe 10 years, so I don\u2019t know what I missed along the way, but it sure is good now.One of the great joys of wine used to be well-aged white Burgundy. It was said often that white Burgundy aged better than red. But that was before the late 1990s, when bottles of white Burgundy began prematurely oxidizing on a regular basis. Countless white Burgundy fans have had the unpleasant experience of eagerly anticipating a great bottle, only to pour out a cider-colored oxidized disappointment.While strides have been taken, the problem has not been entirely eradicated. Far from every bottle is affected. But enough have been that I, like many other people, have cultivated a taste for fresh, young white Burgundy instead.In their youth, they can be vivacious and floral, with a pleasant mineral edge. When they are older, say, 10 years old for a St.-Joseph and 20 years for a Hermitage, they can be gorgeous and, in the case of Hermitage, transcendent. In between? Too often, I\u2019ve had white Rh\u00f4nes that just seemed dull, as if they were cocooned or hibernating.Other wines, eminently capable of aging \u2014 like the chenin blancs and cabernet francs of the Loire Valley, the reds of Mount Etna and blaufr\u00e4nkisches of the Burgenland, to say nothing of well-made ros\u00e9s and sherries \u2014 require more intuitive guidance.The structure, provided by tannins or acidity or both, and concentration, indicated by density of flavor, are the most obvious signs that a wine has what it takes to age. Yet just as important, if not more so, is balance, the sense that all the elements are there in proper proportion.The issue of balance can sometimes call into question the proclamations of experts, and the ultimate importance of aging.Certain vintages deemed great, like 2000 Bordeaux and 2005 Burgundy, have yet, in my estimation, to offer much pleasure. Both are concentrated and powerful, but a sense of equilibrium has often been missing in bottles I have tried.Meanwhile, the 2001 and 2008 Bordeaux vintages, and the 2007 Burgundy, thought to be lesser vintages, have been delightful. Will they still be good in 2050, by which time future generations may be astounded by the 2000 Bordeaux and the 2005 Burgundy? Perhaps.I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be around to judge. But I\u2019m pretty sure I will have had many happy experiences with so-called lesser vintages in the meantime.Knowing which wines to age is not always intuitive, but with a little experience (and a modest bit of research), you can identify good candidates.The very best way to determine which wines to age is trial and error. Have no fear. Do you like young gr\u00fcner veltliners? Put a couple of good bottles away for three or four years and see if you like the result. Try it with Beaujolais, too, or a good New York State cabernet franc. Experimentation is crucial, but sadly, time will not speed up for earlier results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Help Young Women in Prison, Try Dignity ", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesA program in Connecticut lets older inmates counsel their younger counterparts in how to prevent prison bars from becoming a revolving door in their lives. NIANTIC, Conn. \u2014 Despite their names, state \u201cdepartments of correction\u201d in the United States aren\u2019t known for correcting much. More than seven of every 10 prisoners, according to some studies, are arrested again less than four years after they are released. And while recent years have seen the beginning of a national decline in the number of male prisoners, the situation has not improved much for women, who remain incarcerated at stubbornly high levels.Connecticut is trying to push back by focusing on one group that is especially likely to return to prison: young women, ages 18 to 25.Mr. Semple was especially struck by a German prison for young adults, in which men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 were housed in a verdant compound that resembled a liberal arts college. They were given intensive therapy and training in trades like welding and farming.Neuroscience studies have shown that our brains keep developing well into our third decade, meaning people in their early 20s can still exhibit the impulsiveness and poor decision-making we associate with teenagers \u2014 ask any parent or insurance company about this \u2014 but are also especially receptive to help. With this in mind, the state of Washington has raised to 25 the age of considering an offender a juvenile for some crimes, while Chicago and San Francisco have created specialized young adult courts.The newest program, called Women Overcoming Recidivism Through Hard Work, or Worth for short, began in June 2018 at the York Correctional Institution, a women\u2019s prison in eastern Connecticut. There are currently 14 women who live with 10 older mentors, who are also serving time and are given wide latitude to develop the program themselves. The days are packed for the younger women with counseling, classes and addiction help, giving them a version of parenting they may have lacked.Officers are trained to talk to the women about their traumas and vulnerabilities. There is an emphasis on planning for a crime-free life after release: Everyone has a job inside, and they apply for a new one every two weeks, meaning they get frequent opportunities to interview and write r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.The Vera Institute of Justice, which has been helping prisons set up programs like these, pushes the administrators to ask the prisoners what kinds of assistance they need. The organization creates surveys for the staff and prisoners, and then holds meetings to discuss the results and design classes and routines. Even giving the prisoners a tiny bit of control can influence the way they think about themselves. When they were setting up Worth, \u201cthere was a heated debate about how they\u2019d do laundry,\u201d Alex Frank, a project director at Vera, said. \u201cDoes everyone do their own? Do we assign two people? It was very much self-governance.\u201d Inspirational quotes adorn walls covered in chalkboard paint, paper flowers sit atop meal tables and in the big outside yard, the women often play basketball with the officers, which is rare in other prisons.\u201cI\u2019m the president of the health and wellness committee here,\u201d Lauren Karpisz, 24, said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to have exercise classes a few times a week, and will post healthy recipes using food items from the commissary.\u201d She wants to organize a prison version of the cooking competition show \u201cChopped.\u201dMs. Karpisz is serving three years for her role in an assault on a 53-year-old man during a home invasion and attempted robbery in Waterbury. \u201cI\u2019m a drug addict,\u201d she said, matter-of -factly. \u201cI was on drugs, and seeking more drugs, and somebody was hurt.\u201d In the Worth program she began to explore how she\u2019d gotten there. She now explained that she had been prescribed medication for chronic pain from a young age, and had drifted toward heroin.It wasn\u2019t an excuse, but an explanation that could serve as the basis for change. All of the young women here are encouraged to articulate how circumstances and their own decisions combined to produce their crimes. They are given guidance on how to handle their emotions without reacting impulsively.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to hide behind our attitudes here,\u201d said Jazmine Ortiz, 20, who is in prison for a probation violation stemming from more serious crimes committed as a juvenile. \u201cWe have the opportunity to open up to the mentors. They know what to look for when we seem shy or isolated.\u201d When there is a disagreement, the women sit in a circle and \u201cwork through it like a family would.\u201dThis hasn\u2019t necessarily been comfortable for the officers, many of whom are used to an environment in which rules are ironclad and nobody is encouraged to share feelings or life histories. But a few have taken to their new role as quasi-therapists and social workers. When Lt. Russell Hanes learned that one young woman would get nervous when men were behind her \u2014 owing to earlier abuse in a relationship \u2014 he encouraged other officers to tell her when they were approaching. \u201cStaff had to give inmates a chance, but inmates had to give staff a chance, too,\u201d Jeffrey Zegarzewski, a deputy warden, said.Plenty of staff members and prisoners think the program is too permissive and unlikely to change the behavior of the young women. The corresponding program for young men has been in place for a year. It is credited with a reported drop in prison violence, but not enough have been released from any of these programs to indicate whether they will reduce recidivism. One study found that fewer than a half of Germans released from prison are convicted again within three years, though not for crimes serious enough to bring them back to prison. In the same time frame, more than two-thirds of Americans are arrested again. But scholars caution against direct comparisons, because the countries differ radically not only in prison conditions but also in sentencing practices and definitions of what constitutes crime.These new programs are expensive, too. At its current capacity, Worth will involve roughly six officers overseeing 60 women, while in other parts of the prison two officers may oversee 90. The department originally wanted to convert an entire prison for young male adults, but couldn\u2019t afford it. Connecticut officials have not issued a comparison of the cost per inmate between the new and old approaches.What\u2019s most striking about this program is hearing prison officials talk about a newfound sense of purpose. They no longer reduce success to statistics about arrests or disciplinary infractions. They tell stories of individuals gaining control of their lives and reconnecting with estranged family members. And they use the word \u201cdignity\u201d a lot, much like their counterparts in Europe. They take pride in the idea that they are truly a department of correction.\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m having a bad day, I hop in the car and visit one of these units,\u201d Mr. Semple said. \u201cCan you measure that? No, but you can feel it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The data was as specific as the last 15 people or things they had searched for on Facebook and the last 10 physical locations they had \u201cchecked into.\u201dOther personal details were also exposed, like gender, religious affiliation, telephone number, email addresses and the types of computing devices used to reach Facebook.Users\u2019 names and contact information like telephone numbers were stolen from an additional 15 million profiles, Facebook said. The security tokens of about one million other people were stolen, but hackers did not get their profile information, the company said.The hackers did not gain access to account passwords or credit card information, Facebook said.While Facebook has cautioned that the attack was not as large as it had originally anticipated \u2014 it forced 90 million users to log out so the security of their profiles would reset \u2014 the details of what was stolen worried security experts. The data can be used for all sorts of schemes by sophisticated hackers.\u201cHackers have some sort of a goal,\u201d said Oren J. Falkowitz, chief executive of the cybersecurity company Area 1 Security and a former National Security Agency official. \u201cIt\u2019s not that their motivation is to attack Facebook, but to use Facebook as a lily pad to conduct other attacks.\u201dAn attacker may use that information to conduct sophisticated \u201cphishing attacks,\u201d a method used to get into financial accounts, health records or other important personal databases, Mr. Falkowitz said.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve become a target, it never ends,\u201d he said.The breach was disclosed at the worst possible time for Facebook, which is grappling with a series of crises that have shaken user trust in the world\u2019s largest social network.Over the last year, Facebook has faced repeated criticism that it hasn\u2019t been doing enough to protect the personal information of its more than two billion regular users.Disinformation has had dire results outside the United States. In Sri Lanka, Myanmar and other countries, hundreds of people have been killed, partly because of the rampant spread of misinformation across social networks and other internet sites.Former employees have also taken to criticizing Facebook. Brian Acton, a co-founder of the Facebook-owned smartphone application WhatsApp, has called for people to delete their Facebook accounts.Facebook first found hints of suspicious activity across its network in early September when security engineers noticed a flurry of activity around the \u201cView As\u201d feature, a way for users to check on what information other people can see about them. It was built to give users move control over their privacy.More than a week later, Facebook determined that the activity was an attack on its systems, focused on three interconnected vulnerabilities in the company\u2019s software.Those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook\u2019s video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens \u2014 digital keys that allow access to an account.Facebook fixed the bugs and alerted users on Sept. 28 that the accounts of about 50 million users had been compromised.In the days since, Facebook has scrambled to figure out how things went wrong, who could be responsible for the attack and what the attackers planned to do with the information.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Rosen declined to answer who might be responsible for the attack or how the information could be used.Facebook engineers are working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the hack. F.B.I. officials have asked Facebook not to share details on the suspected identities of the attackers for fear of compromising the investigation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Need a Song for Your Commercial? Try These Campers", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingWhen Bose was trying to find the right song for a commercial promoting its latest wireless headphones in partnership with the National Football League last fall, it didn\u2019t dig through catalogs of blockbuster hits from big-name rock stars or hip-hop artists. Instead, it chose a newly written song \u2014 \u201cGet Loud for Me\u201d \u2014 by a little-known singer named Gizzle.\u201cWe had a good idea that it would probably do well in the sports space, but everything else was a pleasant surprise,\u201d said Gizzle, who wrote the song with Mike Sabath.And it was all thanks to a so-called sync camp.Gizzle, whose real name is Glenda Proby, had written songs for artists like Puff Daddy, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, but she wasn\u2019t known as a singer. At least, not until she penned the song at one of the camps, multiday gatherings put on twice a year by Sony/ATV Music. There, clients of the music publishing company gather to write songs for use in commercials, movie trailers, TV shows and video games.Gizzle\u2019s song accounts for one of about 300 signed deals involving music created in the camps, said Brian Monaco, the president and global chief marketing officer of Sony/ATV Music. Sony/ATV will share the publishing rights with the artist of any song that\u2019s written in the camps.The camps, which last three to four days, began in 2012 and have been held in cities like Los Angeles, Nashville and Toronto. Mr. Monaco prefers to hold the camps in a studio away from the main areas of a city so that the artists aren\u2019t distracted. It has to have at least six rooms that can be used for writing and producing, and a rehearsal space. For one Los Angeles camp, he chose Fonogenic Studios, which is in Van Nuys, Calif., and partly owned by a member of the Foo Fighters.\u201cI like it because it\u2019s a little off the beaten track, so people won\u2019t leave in the middle of a session to go to Starbucks, because there\u2019s nowhere to go,\u201d Mr. Monaco said. He also held a Los Angeles camp at Village Studios, where Bob Dylan, Lady Gaga and others have recorded.Sony/ATV invites 15 to 20 clients to each camp. On the night of their arrival, Mr. Monaco hosts a dinner so everyone can meet. The next morning, he divides them into groups of three to write songs. He will often make them aware of a brand that is looking for a particular type of song for a commercial or a film. Representatives of the brands sometimes attend as well.Each day, the attendees switch groups.There can sometimes be creative differences.\u201cThere have definitely been some disagreements, but never deal breakers, never any punches thrown,\u201d said Kevin Bard, a singer and songwriter who has attended all the camps. \u201cPeople disagree on music, but that\u2019s kind of what makes it great.\u201dMr. Monaco recalled one artist who persuaded his group that the song they were working on needed some salty language, forgetting that the music was aimed at a family-friendly commercial audience.\u201cI said: \u2018Why would you be cursing? There\u2019s no brand that\u2019s going to use this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Monaco said.After that, Sony started having one of its representatives sit in on the sessions. The representatives generally offer guidance if the writing is heading down the wrong path, but they try not to critique otherwise.\u201cIf you start making demands on people\u2019s creativity, I think it would ruin the process,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.The groups work from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., although some will keep working until late at night if they\u2019re trying to finish or improve a song. On the final day, everyone gets together to listen to all the songs created \u2014 usually 20 to 30.While Sony/ATV\u2019s camps are unique, other music companies, like Warner/Chappell, have teams of ad music experts that help brands connect with artists and custom-made music. Ron Broitman, executive vice president and head of synchronization at Warner/Chappell, said he had seen a surge in demand for top songwriters, producers and artists to create music for brands.\u201cMusic can make or break a campaign,\u201d said Denise Kohnke, founder of House United, a strategic marketing company.\u201cIt was quite a surreal feeling to see something you created on TV and to see the reaction it had with people, where they were tracking it down and leaving YouTube comments,\u201d he said of his work at the camps. \u201cIt opened all of our eyes to the power that TV and film holds.\u201dOne of the camp\u2019s big success stories is MoZella, whose real name is Maureen Anne McDonald. She wrote multiple songs for commercials before moving on to collaborations with major artists, including helping to write \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d for Miley Cyrus and \u201cLove So Soft\u201d for Kelly Clarkson.\u201cAfter that, touring picked up, and the awareness of what I\u2019m doing definitely increased,\u201d Mr. Scibilia said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Pretty astronomical difference.\u201dOnline, people would write, \u201cLove this song and found you through a Jeep commercial,\u201d he said. He has since had about 25 songs synced to commercials, TV shows and movie trailers.Mr. Scibilia said the camps had given him a chance to make a living writing songs and lifted his profile as a performer.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a portal for people to enter into your world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Here, in the year after the 1892 Homestead steel strike, Rosh Hashana services were conducted in the club room of the volunteer fire company\u2019s engine house down the street from where union activists and Pinkerton agents conducted one of the bloodiest labor battles in American history. Here, in 1885, the tensions between identity and assimilation took their form in perhaps the most important document of Reform Judaism, the Pittsburgh Platform.When, on this cursed Saturday morning, gunfire broke out in Tree of Life, just three blocks from my home, the Jewish rhythms that are a part of the city\u2019s beat seemed to take over the soundtrack of Pittsburgh. Hundreds gathered hours later at the corner of Murray and Forbes, where a clock tower with Hebrew letters has kept time for the Squirrel Hill neighborhood for a generation. There were, to be sure, rabbis in the crowd, but the vigil was dominated by the students from nearby Taylor Allderdice High School. For decades the few students in attendance in their school on Yom Kippur spent the day in study halls. There was no use teaching class during the High Holy Days.And during the day of Pittsburgh\u2019s suffering so many of us \u2014 not only Jews like me \u2014 wished for that cry, or any human sound, or perhaps even some shard of routine to ward off the certainty that the day was anything but routine. Now a confession on this time of surpassing sin: Amid it all I dropped by my home, within the sound of the sirens, and took the wet laundry out of the washer and placed it in the dryer. Something about cleanliness amid the sordidness made me need to do it.Later that night, my wife, a Polish Catholic from Buffalo, and I together put those clean sheets on the bed. Cindy Skrzycki went from the nuns at St. Matthew\u2019s School at East Ferry and Wyoming Streets in Buffalo to the daily Mass at Annunciation High School and finally to the tutelage of the Jesuits at Canisius College. In classic Pittsburgh style, her daughter \u2014 our youngest \u2014 is a year from ordination as a rabbi. She has asked for a special moment of silence Monday morning at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Our older daughter, Taylor Allderdice High School class of 2006 but now far away in San Francisco, sent this sober text: \u201cSleeping in my Pittsburgh shirt tonight.\u2019\u2019 We all slept in our Pittsburgh shirts Saturday night, for there had been no Shalom on Shabbat.David M. Shribman, a former reporter for The Times, is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Skywhale Returns to Australia\u2019s Skies, and Its Creator Braces for Impact", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe buxom hot-air balloon was widely condemned when it first appeared five years ago. The artist who created it is hoping for a warmer reception this time.SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 With a head like a turtle, a body like a giant cetacean and ten bulbous, hanging breasts, one thing is certain: It is hard to ignore the Skywhale. When the hot-air balloon debuted in May 2013, looming over Canberra for the Australian capital\u2019s centenary celebrations, critics said the \u201cfloating sculpture\u201d created by Patricia Piccinini did not represent the city. Some blushed at the scale of its udders and at its six-figure cost.Well get ready, Australia. It\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to just have her in the air because she\u2019s such a beautiful presence,\u201d Ms. Piccinini said of the Skywhale. Australia\u2019s initial rejection of the balloon sculpture has come to be seen by many as a telling example of the country\u2019s discomfort with the avant-garde, or even just the unconventional. What many Australians found cringe worthy, though, much of the world has since embraced. Since its Canberra debut, the Skywhale has appeared in Japan, Ireland and Brazil. But here in Australia, the Skywhale \u2014 now owned by Global Ballooning Australia, with Ms. Piccinini holding the intellectual property rights \u2014 is mostly known for being controversial. Canberra\u2019s political establishment in particular seemed flabbergasted when it first appeared. Jeremy Hanson, then the Australian Capital Territory\u2019s opposition leader, called it an \u201cembarrassing indulgence.\u201d Katy Gallagher, who was the territory\u2019s chief minister at the time, admitted that on seeing the designs, her eyes \u201cnearly fell out\u201d of her head. Much of the mockery has focused on the Skywhale\u2019s enormous, hanging udders. Ms. Piccinini, whose work takes a bracing look at motherhood, reproduction and fertility, still smarts at the recollection of public derision.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a very strong, maternal figure and in some ways I valorize maternal figures in my work, and the strength and beauty that they embody,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t see that; they see a more sexualized thing,\u201d she added. \u201cTen breasts are confronting. But at the same time, breasts are created to nurture the young.\u201d\u201cPolitically, no one will touch it,\u201d she said at the time.As such, November\u2019s outing is \u201ca pretty bold decision,\u201d said Kiff Saunders, director of Global Ballooning Australia.Yarra Ranges Tourism is the sponsor, paying several thousand dollars for the cost of the one-off flight, which includes a second balloon that will fly alongside and give a select group of Skywhale watchers a view from the air.Organizers hope the hard-to-miss artwork will promote an area known more for its natural beauty than for its cultural offerings.\u201cHaving the Skywhale in the region for us is a coup,\u201d said Brook Powell, marketing manager for Yarra Ranges Tourism. \u201cSome people have quite violent reactions to it, other people adore it. I\u2019d rather they hated it and loved it then didn\u2019t notice it.\u201dVictoria Lynn, director of the TarraWarra Museum of Art, doubts there will be much of a backlash this time.The initial outrage was because the Skywhale represented \u201ca political moment,\u201d she said, \u201cwhereas now she\u2019s just a free-floating personality.\u201dMs. Piccinini\u2019s work \u201cin general engenders strong emotions and I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s dealing with difficult topics,\u201d Ms. Lynn added.\u201cCelebration of the female form and of fecundity and reproduction is something that is age old in the history of art; it\u2019s just that Patricia has a contemporary expression on it,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. \u201cArt is there to challenge us, and Skywhale certainly does.\u201dFlying the balloon is its own challenge.Built by specialists in Bristol, England, the Skywhale is taller than a seven-story building. The registered aircraft takes a team of five to operate, and windy conditions can lead to surprising issues.\u201cWhen you\u2019re going down the pendulous breasts fly up like wings,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s really got a life to itself.\u201dA large inspiration for Ms. Piccinini is Mary Shelley\u2019s novel \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d which is observing its 200-year anniversary.Ms. Lynn, from the TarraWarra Museum, insisted that the main lesson from the book \u2014 to learn to love the monsters we create \u2014 is apt. The Skywhale, she said, presents us all with a vital question: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just love the imperfect?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson for Kavanaugh From Another Tarnished Supreme Court Justice", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHugo Black rose from his past in the Ku Klux Klan to become one of the great civil libertarians.Contributing Opinion Writer It\u2019s obvious why the parallel between the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination and that of Clarence Thomas 27 years earlier grabbed the public\u2019s attention. In both cases, late-breaking allegations threatened but failed to derail the confirmation process, and both nominees defended themselves with impassioned denials of wrongdoing.But history offers another, older parallel that in its way is even more compelling. The issue was not sex but racism. The bombshell burst not just before a confirmation vote, but just afterward, forcing a newly confirmed Supreme Court justice to take to the airwaves to defend himself against mounting calls for his resignation. I\u2019m referring to the experience of Hugo L. Black, the first Supreme Court nominee of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation, this nearly forgotten episode is worth resurrecting after 81 years.Black was a Democratic senator from Alabama, a populist and ardent supporter of the New Deal who had backed the president\u2019s failed plan to add additional justices to the Supreme Court who could outvote the conservatives who were invalidating major New Deal programs. The retirement of one of those conservatives, Willis Van Devanter, gave Roosevelt his first chance to make a dent in the Supreme Court.Black\u2019s nomination in the summer of 1937 was controversial, not only because it was a sharp stick in the eyes of the president\u2019s many political enemies, but because of Black\u2019s limited judicial experience \u2014 he was briefly a police court magistrate \u2014 and an education viewed as marginal for a Supreme Court justice. Although a graduate of the University of Alabama Law School, Black had never gone to college.Supreme Court nominees did not ordinarily appear at their confirmation hearings in those days, but Black\u2019s supporters said he had assured them that he had never joined the Klan. The full committee moved the nomination to the Senate floor. Black was confirmed by a vote of 63 to 16, and the new justice and his wife set sail for a European vacation.In mid-September, while Black was in Paris and the court was getting ready to open a new term, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published the first of six articles conclusively linking him to the Klan. Soon, the country was in an uproar. The Klan stood for violence not only against African-Americans but also against Catholics, who were prominent among Roosevelt\u2019s most loyal supporters. Catholic members of Congress demanded that Black step down. Senator David I. Walsh, a Democrat and a former governor of Massachusetts, charged that \u201cBlack obtained his nomination and confirmation by concealment and thereby deceived the president and his fellow senators, especially the latter.\u201d A Gallup poll found that 59 percent of the public believed Black should resign if the charge was true.On his return to the United States, Black gave a national radio address, as unusual then as Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appearance on Fox News was this month. Carried by 300 stations on three radio networks, the speech attracted the second-biggest audience of the decade, outdone only by the abdication speech of King Edward VIII. Black conceded that he had joined the Klan and said he had resigned before he became a senator. He neither explained his decisions nor apologized for his membership. In fact, in Professor Leuchtenberg\u2019s account, \u201cHe spent the first third of his remarks cautioning against the possibility of a revival of racial and religious hatred, but he warned that this might be brought about not by groups like the Klan but by those who questioned his right to be on the Supreme Court.\u201dThe national press excoriated the speech as thoroughly inadequate, but Roosevelt discerned accurately that \u201cit did the trick,\u201d as he told his confidant James Farley. A new Gallup Poll showed that a majority of Americans now believed that Black should not resign. He was on the bench when the new term opened three days after his speech, went on to serve for 34 years, one of the longest Supreme Court tenures, before retiring in 1971 at the age of 85.During Hugo Black\u2019s first days on the bench, Arthur Krock, a columnist for The New York Times, paid a visit to the Supreme Court to observe the new justice, much as journalists flocked to the court this week to watch Justice Kavanaugh. I find Krock\u2019s rendition of the scene, which appeared in The Times on Oct. 12, 1937, almost eerie in its current resonance:\u201cMr. Justice Black\u2019s courtroom demeanor provided material for interesting study. His face had gained color. His manner had acquired content. He looked benign instead of harried. But now and then, as the chief justice read the orders and Mr. Justice Black looked out upon the lawyers and spectators from the impregnable fortress of life tenure, an expression touched his face which is common to certain types of martyrs. It was a mixture of forgiveness and satisfaction, of pity for unreconstructed dissenters and sympathy for himself who had borne so much in comparative silence.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its representatives in Parliament have gone on to become attorneys general, opposition leaders and, most recently, prime minister. The upset has cost the current prime minister, Scott Morrison, his single-seat majority in Parliament. Now he will have to negotiate with independents and the opposition to pass every piece of legislation between now and the next federal election, which is expected in May, though Mr. Morrison can call one sooner.\u201cThis has been a David and Goliath struggle,\u201d Dr. Phelps said in her victory speech on Saturday night. She added: \u201cThis is a great moment for Australian democracy. This win tonight should signal a return of decency, integrity and humanity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just sick of this shuffling of prime ministers,\u201d said Sheridan Kennedy, 50, an artist voting in the Bondi area. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. Can we have some real leadership, please?\u201dBut having a minority government in Australia may also be part of a global trend, said Sam Roggeveen of the Lowy Institute in Sydney. \u201cAustralians are disconnected from politics as a whole, and that also reflects a broader trend in Western politics,\u201d Mr. Roggeveen said, adding that \u201ccenter-left and center-right parties were created out of social and economic conditions that just don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d Australia\u2019s opposition Labor Party, for instance, had its roots in organized labor, and \u201cpeople don\u2019t join unions anymore,\u201d Mr. Roggeveen said. From a conservative perspective, he said, \u201cif the union is no longer a threat, there\u2019s far less reason for Liberals to win support among that group of people.\u201d One result of such tectonic changes, Mr. Roggeveen argued, is that major parties become inward-looking and turn to cultural issues to attract voters.George Megalogenis, an author and political commentator, said that kind of disconnect could help explain Mr. Morrison\u2019s scattershot attempts to woo Wentworth\u2019s wavering Liberal voters in the weeks before the election. Mr. Morrison was \u201cthrowing haymakers, hoping something will connect,\u201d Mr. Megalogenis said. \u201cYou have to wonder what their instincts are, if they\u2019re in denial about the socioeconomic makeup of the society. You can\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d\u201cThey were all racing for the silver-bullet solution; the Jerusalem thing is classic craziness,\u201d Mr. Megalogenis said. The prime minister\u2019s statement upset the country\u2019s majority-Muslim neighbor Indonesia, which said it might reconsider a major trade agreement with Australia that it had been expected to sign later this year. On the day before the election, Mr. Morrison acknowledged that victory in Wentworth looked unlikely, but he expressed hope that the threat of a hung Parliament would persuade disaffected Liberal voters to stick with the party. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve got to get used to is we\u2019re going to get more and more minority governments with coalitions working together,\u201d said Mr. Roggeveen. \u201cIt can be done. Probably the biggest barrier to it being successful is whether the Liberal Party can hold itself together.\u201dMr. Megalogenis said the loss raised the possibility that Mr. Morrison could be the victim of yet another party coup before the national election. \u201cYou\u2019d think, this government is toast and he should know that. What\u2019s he going to change to bring it back into the contest?\u201d Mr. Megalogenis said. \u201cYou\u2019d think they wouldn\u2019t be crazy enough to roll him and get another leader. But somebody somewhere\u2019s going to ask the question of whether they should.\u201d Vicky Xiuzhong Xu contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misstated the first name of a candidate in the by-election in Wentworth, Australia.

{"Headline": "Save Us, Texas", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeto O\u2019Rourke offers hope in dark times.Opinion ColumnistOn Saturday night, at the end of a hideous week in American politics, there was an unfamiliar feeling in Austin, Tex.: hope. More than 50,000 people streamed into a city park to hear music legend Willie Nelson perform at a rally with Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic congressman from El Paso who is running a strikingly competitive race against oleaginous ghoul Ted Cruz. Many were young \u2014 Nelson\u2019s set started after 10 p.m. \u2014 wearing Beto T-shirts and waving Beto flags. Nearby, a packed restaurant advertised \u201cBeto beer.\u201d In the air was that slightly delirious energy you feel when a political campaign becomes a movement.If O\u2019Rourke wins \u2014 if power and joy are enough to oust a sneering right-wing demagogue like Cruz in a deep-red state \u2014 it will ratify a new theory of politics that\u2019s taken hold in Democratic circles since 2016. Like the gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, O\u2019Rourke is running a campaign based more on inspiration than persuasion. Rather than making narrowly targeted appeals to swing segments of the existing electorate, he seeks to turn out new voters, including young people and people of color.\u201cOur contention is that if no one\u2019s ever shown up, and listened to you, and incorporated your story into why they\u2019re campaigning, and the expectations that we\u2019re setting for one another, then I wouldn\u2019t expect you to vote either,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told Smith on Saturday.So instead of centrist triangulation, O\u2019Rourke \u2014 like Abrams and Gillum \u2014 is speaking to the aspirations of his base, and betting that other voters will be won over by his honesty. He defended the right of N.F.L. players to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police killings of unarmed African-Americans, supports \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d and slams Cruz for being in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. He\u2019s campaigning in a conservative state, but refusing to let the right set the terms of debate.It helps that he seems to have the support of legions of urban and suburban women who abhor Donald Trump, some of whom, said Allison, have only recently \u201ccome out of the Democratic closet.\u201d These women \u201cknow how to fund-raise,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing it for their fancy charities all their lives.\u201dWhether or not O\u2019Rourke wins, he\u2019s already come close enough to let us draw some preliminary lessons from his race, building on what we learned from Trump\u2019s awful victory. The most important is that you can\u2019t measure a candidate\u2019s viability by charting his or her ideology on a graph. We live in the age of analytics, but intangible things like charisma and authenticity still matter tremendously.There, in real time, he recorded a campaign spot responding to Republican attack ads, doing four takes as viewers offered their instant feedback. \u201cWe can be defined by our fears, or we can be known by our ambitions,\u201d he said, urging voters not to see one another as Democrats or Republicans, \u201cbut as Texans, Americans and human beings.\u201d I\u2019m not nearly as confident as O\u2019Rourke that our partisan hatreds can be transcended. But it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a campaign so optimistic and innovative that I\u2019ve wanted to put my cynicism aside. In fact, it\u2019s been exactly 10 years.Advertisement"}

Wells-Barnett, an idea championed by many people, including students and faculty members from the department of history as well as the school of journalism. Wells-Barnett\u2019s great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster, also approves of the idea. \u201cIt would be a fitting honor for the journalism school at the University of Mississippi to be renamed after my great-grandmother Ida B. Wells,\u201d she wrote on her website. The University of Mississippi stands at yet another crossroads where it can decide whether to perpetuate the bigotry of the past or move toward an inclusive future. In a time of hyper-partisanship, rampant racism and heartbreaking revelations of sexism and sexual assault, the nation needs a reminder that, while the past shapes the future, it but does not determine it. Born in Holly Springs, Miss., in 1862, Ms. Wells-Barnett exemplifies integrity in reporting. She constantly exposed the truth about injustice, often doing so despite intense personal danger. Nor can the sexist dimensions of this incident be overlooked. It is not coincidence that Mr. Meek\u2019s post depicted black women. They have always resided at the intersection of racism and sexism.In this time of the #MeToo movement, featuring Ida B. Wells-Barnett\u2019s name on the school of journalism communicates to black women that they are seen, they are welcomed and they matter.Many malign Mississippi for its extreme racism. While the symbols of racism may be more apparent here \u2014 it\u2019s the only state that still has the Confederate battle symbol in the canton of its flag \u2014 every section of this country features racism in one form or another.What happens next at the University of Mississippi offers a lesson for everyone. If the state\u2019s educational leaders refuse, it shows that the march of time does not always step in rhythm with the beat of justice.But if the College Board decides to authorize the name change and officials select Ida B.

Ms. Collins, our senator since 1996, has a reputation for being an independent; a moderate; even \u2014 what was the term? \u2014 oh yes, a maverick.But if Ms. Collins is a maverick, then I\u2019m an appaloosa.After that bill was passed, Ms. Collins said the promises to her were ironclad, and that if her conditions were not met, \u201cthere would be consequences.\u201d But the additional bills never got a vote, and a follow-up attempt to add her provisions to the omnibus spending bill in March was defeated, by other Republicans.Of course they were.We\u2019ve been represented by other mavericks in the last half-century. Senator William Cohen, another Republican, served as the secretary of defense for a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. George Mitchell, a former Senate majority leader, helped to bring about the Good Friday peace accords in Ireland, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. For eight years we had an independent governor, Angus King, who has gone on to represent our state as an independent in the Senate. (My wife and I are public supporters of, and have a long friendship with, the Kings.) Being independently minded is a tradition in Maine, as much a part of who we are as lobsters, moose hunting and whoopie pies.But there are different ways of being a maverick. For Smith, it meant taking a stand, opposing McCarthy at the apex of his power. For Arizonan John McCain, it meant voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, at least when no provisions had been made for the 20 million Americans who would have suddenly found themselves without health care.There\u2019s another kind of \u201cmaverick,\u201d though \u2014 the kind of centrist who wants to please everyone. For Ms. Collins, it\u2019s often meant voting with the most right-wing members of her party, even while attempting to occupy some imaginary moral high ground. It\u2019s hard to see what our senator got for her vote supporting the tax cut last fall. It\u2019s just as hard for me to see her vote for Judge Kavanaugh as anything other than a warm embrace of Donald Trump and everything he stands for, her 45-minute speech notwithstanding.And yet, at some of the most crucial moments of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, she has voted to empower him. In giving him a victory on Judge Kavanaugh, she has emboldened Mr. Trump to continue down the very path she claims to detest: denigrating women, bullying opponents, choosing the most combative approach to every disagreement. Based on the judge\u2019s snarling, partisan, bullying demeanor at his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh seems determined to be the kind of justice who is exactly the opposite of that legacy she once spoke of preserving.In so doing, she has proved herself, in the end, to stand for nothing.In her Declaration of Conscience speech, Margaret Chase Smith said that Joe McCarthy had debased the Senate to \u201cthe level of a forum of hate and character assassination.\u201dLast week, Donald Trump ridiculed the suffering of Christine Blasey Ford before a jeering, laughing crowd. Three days later, Ms. Collins voted to confirm his nominee, a man who has pledged to bring exactly the same variety of partisan venom to the Supreme Court.One can only wonder what Margaret Chase Smith would think of Ms. Collins now.Advertisement"}

Harnessing it has become a quest in the travel industry, where pretty pictures are staple sales tools. It may be impossible to assemble whales on demand, but travel businesses are otherwise reconfiguring their look and the experiences they offer with visual posts in mind.\u201cInstagram is figuratively and literally reshaping travel,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the president of Atmosphere Research Group. \u201cNow you see airports, airlines, cruise ships, hotels and points of interest designing or redesigning their interiors to be Instagram-friendly.\u201dInstagram still lags behind Facebook in terms of users and demographic diversity, according to Phocuswright, a travel industry research group.

{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}

Am I allowed to share my story?\u2019 \u201dBy Monday afternoon, the influential political editor of The Hindustan Times, Prashant Jha, had been stripped of his management role as the company investigated a former reporter\u2019s complaint that he had sexually harassed her. On the same day, seven women sent a letter to The Times of India, the flagship paper of the country\u2019s most powerful media company, accusing a top editor of years of unwanted touching, explicit messages and sexual propositions. The editor, K. R. Sreenivas, was put on leave amid promises of \u201ca speedy and fair inquiry.\u201dOther journalists are under investigation by their employers or have apologized for inappropriate behavior, and #MeToo accusations have begun spreading to other industries, including advertising and politics. At least four women have accused a government minister for external affairs, the former newspaper editor M. J. Akbar, of sexually harassing them when he was a journalist. Mr. Akbar was traveling overseas on Tuesday and has not made any comment about the allegations.The flurry of activity has created a commotion among the educated elite here, but it has had little immediate effect on the vast majority of women in India, a deeply patriarchal and traditional society in which women and girls often have little control over their lives and are frequently abused.Women\u2019s rights advocates said that for India, the events of the past week had been stunning, with the movement in the country gathering momentum.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a wave has come,\u201d said Vrinda Grover, a New Delhi lawyer and human rights activist who helped draft some of India\u2019s laws on sexual harassment and child abuse. \u201cUntil now, we have seen consequences only on the women who complained. This time, the consequences are for those who have committed the misconduct.\u201dSandhya Menon, a freelance writer who tweeted the first public complaints about Mr. Sreenivas and two other journalists on Friday, said her goal had been to improve men\u2019s behavior and push employers to hold harassers accountable.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this level of action,\u201d Ms. Menon said in an interview. (Mr. Sreenivas declined to comment beyond saying that he was cooperating with the newspaper\u2019s investigation.)\u201cThis behavior has to be shamed,\u201d the former reporter, Sonora Jha, now a professor of communication at Seattle University, said in an interview.Mr. Adhikari, who is retired and lives in the Washington area, said in an email that he did not recall the incidents described. \u201cI would sincerely apologize if I made anyone uncomfortable in my presence, but I deny sexually harassing anyone,\u201d he wrote. Nevertheless, citing the \u201cstain on his reputation,\u201d he resigned as a fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and said he would stop writing his column for The Times of India.Ms. Kukreja, the comedian, said that it had been cathartic to see so many women speak out now, but that it was also difficult to hear so many stories of men behaving badly. \u201cI had four days straight of panic attacks,\u201d she said, adding that she had found peace by performing a stand-up comedy set for 15 minutes each night.Speaking out has had its risks. The backlash on Twitter has been intense, with some commenters demanding evidence or suggesting that the women had encouraged the come-ons.Some of the women who shared their stories said that they had gone to their bosses or human resources departments, but that no action had been taken. India\u2019s court system is so glacial that a rape case against one prominent editor, Tarun Tejpal, is still pending five years after it was filed.The case of Ms. Dutta, the Bollywood actress, shows just how arduous it can be to pursue a sexual harassment claim.She first made the allegations against Mr. Patekar while they were working on a film in 2008. Ms. Dutta said Mr. Patekar pushed to change a dance routine to make it more physically intimate.She fled the set, and a mob surrounded her car, smashed the windshield and trapped her inside.She filed a police complaint against Mr. Patekar, who denied the allegations. And she spoke openly to the Indian news media, which covered the story extensively for several days. Then everyone moved on.Ms. Dutta, 34, a former Miss India who now lives in the United States, urged caution about characterizing this moment as anything like the conversation that has occurred in Hollywood.Still, India is evolving, she said. \u201cMaybe the evolution is slower compared to the West, but evolution is inevitable. It is happening in the remotest, darkest corners of our planet.\u201dFollow on Vindu Goel on Twitter: @vindugoel.Vindu Goel and Ayesha Venkataraman reported from Mumbai, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.

It is no longer about an ideology; it\u2019s about shining President Trump\u2019s shoes. And that is the fundamental issue hanging over the midterm elections.\u201cIt must pay a heavy price for its embrace of white nationalism and know-nothingism,\u201d Boot continues. \u201cOnly if the G.O.P. as currently constituted is burned to the ground will there be any chance to build a reasonable center-right political party out of the ashes.\u201dThough I have often disagreed with past Republican leaders, I also noted some great accomplishments, from the superb diplomacy of George H.W. Bush after the Cold War to the lifesaving AIDS program of George W. Bush in the 2000s.Historically, Republicans were associated with fiscal conservatism, free trade and standing up militarily to autocrats in Moscow. But what does the party stand for today?The most odious pirouette may involve deficit spending. During the height of the 2008-9 recession, not a single Republican House member voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy.It\u2019s difficult to explain the G.O.P.\u2019s resistance to a stimulus during the recession except as a willingness to let millions of Americans lose their jobs in hopes that President Barack Obama would get blamed. It can\u2019t have been about deficits, because Republicans then passed a tax cut for rich Americans that adds $1.4 trillion to deficits.The Republican turnabout on Russia is similar. Just a few years ago, Republicans denounced Democrats for being too trusting of Vladimir Putin \u2014 and they had a point \u2014 yet now they line up behind a president who gushes about Putin.But congressional Republicans have been spineless about a president who tears immigrant children from parents, declares his \u201clove\u201d for a North Korean leader who is still adding to his nuclear arsenal, and accepts large sums from the Saudi government in his hotel empire even as he downplays its torture-murder of a Washington Post journalist.Granted, a certain amount of hypocrisy is human. Democrats rage at evangelical Christians who embrace a philanderer, but they themselves denounce corruption while still supporting Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ambush on the Police: An Abundance of Grief, and a Lack of Answers", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deputies drove toward a cul-de-sac in Florence, S.C., on Wednesday afternoon poised to execute a warrant. It was the type of routine assignment that law enforcement officials carry out every day.Then, along a street of upscale homes with pools and circular driveways, came the crackle of gunfire, and the panic and pain of a rampage. Frantic calls on the police radio warned of the danger.A police sergeant was killed in the chaos that stretched into hours. Six other officers were wounded. Five civilians were hurt.And Florence, Mayor Stephen J. Wukela said Thursday, was left \u201cin the grips of emotions ranging from pain to anger and guilt.\u201d\u201cWe as a city have spent the last 24 hours only half-believing the stark reality of what has occurred,\u201d he said of the northeastern South Carolina city of about 37,000.Law enforcement officials offered few immediate answers about the shooting that left Sgt. Terrence Carraway, who would have celebrated his 31st year on the force later this month, as the first Florence officer to be killed in the line of duty in 29 years.A 74-year-old suspect who had posted on social media about his shooting prowess, Frederick T. Hopkins Jr., was in custody but had not yet been charged, and his status as a suspect was particularly striking given that two of his sons have worked in law enforcement.Florence County\u2019s grief was intertwined with a deepening investigation into what led to the eruption of violence along the northern edge of the Vintage Place subdivision. In a series of statements, the authorities said that over the course of hours on Wednesday, Ashton Drive had gone from a stately residential community to the scene of an ambush.The violence, the authorities said, began as county deputies sought to serve a search warrant at Mr. Hopkins\u2019s home. Although Mr. Hopkins was not the subject of the warrant, officials believe he opened fire with, according to State Senator Hugh K. Leatherman Sr., \u201ca high-powered rifle.\u201d The radio cry of shots fired stirred an immediate response, leading officers from the municipal police force to rush to a street where they, too, came under attack.Mr. Hopkins, officials said, was firing from an extended distance \u2014 perhaps several hundred yards \u2014 and Chief Allen Heidler of the Florence police said Thursday that the officers \u201cdidn\u2019t know the level of firepower that they were going into.\u201dAs Mr. Hopkins barricaded himself, the authorities had to use an armored vehicle to evacuate the wounded. Once they did, perhaps 30 minutes in, the chief estimated, they counted seven officers who had been shot, including one who had been wounded while still in a vehicle.Florence County officials said on Thursday that five civilians had also been taken to trauma centers after the episode, but did not elaborate on their injuries or identities.Sheriff Leon Lott of Richland County, whose department is leading the investigation, declined to discuss details of the episode.An explanation for the shooting remained a public mystery. \u201cNobody seems to know what the motive was,\u201d Mr. Leatherman, who represents part of Florence County and is the president pro tempore of the South Carolina Senate, said.Interviews and examinations of government records did not immediately turn up warning signs that Mr. Hopkins would someday be accused of a fatal burst of violence. But the review did suggest a man with a history of episodic trouble.Mr. Hopkins served in the military and was injured in the Vietnam War, according to a South Carolina Supreme Court ruling that was issued amid a dispute about child support with his former wife. He earned a law degree in 1980 after he left the military, but was disbarred about four years later.The State Supreme Court, in an order reflecting the discipline, wrote that Mr. Hopkins had been accused of wrongfully collecting money and held in contempt of court when he did not swiftly pay $18,000. By the time of his disbarment, just over a year after a divorce, Mr. Hopkins was married to another local lawyer, Cheryl Turner Hopkins.After his legal career ended, Mr. Hopkins worked a part-time job for the United States Postal Service for about five years.Court records showed that Mr. Hopkins had occasional encounters with the authorities, though apparently none that marked him as a potentially grave risk. In 2014, he was charged with disorderly conduct and paid $161 in fines and court costs. He had also been prosecuted for ordinance violations related to animal control.A son, Fred T. Hopkins III, worked until this summer for the Lexington County Sheriff\u2019s Department near Columbia, the state capital.Another son, Sean P. Hopkins, is a police officer in Orangeburg County, S.C.Neither son could be reached for comment on Thursday, but social media suggested that both had been in touch with the elder Mr. Hopkins within the last year or so. Their mother \u2014 who was divorced from Mr. Hopkins in 1983 \u2014 died in May. Her former lawyer did not respond to a message on Thursday.Mr. Hopkins\u2019s current wife practices family law in Florence. Although friends said the family had been involved in foster care, the South Carolina Department of Social Services said that no foster children had been at the home at the time of the shootings. The agency said confidentiality rules kept it from commenting further.As the authorities processed a crime scene that Sheriff Lott said was large and complex, and prepared to bring charges, a motorcade escorted Sergeant Carraway\u2019s body back to Florence from Charleston, where he had been taken after the shooting.Chief Heidler, who said that one of Florence\u2019s officers was in \u201cserious but stable\u201d condition on Thursday and that two others had been released, recalled that he had sat on the review board that hired Mr. Carraway about three decades ago. Sergeant Carraway, a fan of the Oakland Raiders who had retired from the Air Force as a technical sergeant, helped develop a summer program for children and was once a school resource officer.\u201cHe was the epitome of a community police officer,\u201d the chief said. \u201cHe loved this community. He gave it his all. With more than 30 years, he didn\u2019t have to do this job, but this was his life, and this was what he wanted to do.\u201dEarly on Thursday, hours before Sergeant Carraway was brought back to Florence and before an evening vigil that filled a church, Fred T. Hopkins III posted a tribute to law enforcement on Facebook.He had done much the same after five police officers died in Dallas in 2016. He did not betray what was different this time: that his father was the suspect.Chris Dixon contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Pitofsky, Champion of Consumer Protection, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Pitofsky, who as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the Clinton administration advocated stricter enforcement of competition and greater protection for consumers, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 88.The cause was complications of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his son David said.Mr. Pitofsky was a leading figure in competition law. An antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University law school, he wove in and out of government, private law practice and academia over his career.President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Pitofsky to head the Federal Trade Commission in 1995. At the time, it was a sleepy agency colloquially referred to as \u201cthe little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201dMr. Pitofsky soon sought to call attention to the growing threat of corporate consolidation, particularly with the rise of technology. During his tenure the agency would become the central watchdog for the internet and technology industries.Mr. Pitofsky won support from consumer groups that had pushed for greater scrutiny of mergers and stronger consumer protection in matters like deceptive advertising. But he was also criticized by some free-market conservatives and antitrust lawyers, who said he was trying to expand antitrust enforcement too far.Early on Mr. Pitofsky held public hearings to gather input on how the F.T.C. might look beyond traditional views of antitrust enforcement to better account for the modernization of the economy and the growth of technology.Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s push to update antitrust policy has echoes today, as the F.T.C. is again opening debate on how it approaches competition enforcement in the tech sector. Consumer groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns that a handful of companies, like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, have outsize influence on the economy even though they apparently do not violate antitrust laws.Last month, at the first of a series of F.T.C. hearings on antitrust at the Georgetown Law Center, Joe Simons, the current chairman, said he was modeling the hearings after those held by Mr. Pitofsky in 1995.Mr. Simons, who was a student of Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s at Georgetown, said in a statement this week that Mr. Pitofsky was \u201cone of the true giants of his field\u201d and that he had been \u201cinstrumental in establishing a strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy.\u201dAs F.T.C. chairman, Mr. Pitofsky sought to block nearly a dozen mergers, including that of the office-supply retailers Staples and Office Depot. The companies tried to merge again in 2015 but were again blocked.The agency under Mr. Pitofsky also filed to block the merger of BP Amoco with Atlantic Richfield, until BP agreed to sell off $7 billion worth of Arco\u2019s Alaska oil assets to Phillips Petroleum. In 2000, however, the agency ultimately agreed to approve Time Warner\u2019s $165 billion merger with AOL, with certain conditions.He pledged to make antitrust apolitical and to balance free-market interests with concerns that consolidation among corporations was threatening consumer welfare.Robert Pitofsky was born in Paterson, N.J., on Dec. 27, 1929, to Morris and Sadye Pitofsky. His father fixed textile looms, and his mother sold dresses.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature from New York University in 1951 and earned a law degree at Columbia Law School in 1954. He served in the Army for two years before joining the private law firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood in New York, where his first case was defending Eli Lilly against antitrust charges. In 1964 he began teaching law courses at New York University.Mr. Pitofsky joined Georgetown University\u2019s law school in 1973 as a professor and stayed until 1978, when he was appointed an F.T.C. commissioner. He returned to Georgetown Law in 1981 and became dean in 1983. He held that position until 1989.In addition to his son David, Mr. Pitofsky is survived by his wife, Sally Levy Pitofsky; another son, Alex; a daughter, Liz Pitofsky; and seven grandchildren.Mr. Pitofsky returned to teaching several times over the years. In addition to Mr. Simons, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the F.T.C., his students included Christine Varney, who was in charge of antitrust at the Justice Department during the Obama administration.In an interview with Washington Lawyer in 2002, Mr. Pitofsky said, \u201cI think a really good class is one of the great pleasures in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Agan\u2019s greatest challenge is helping women overcome the fear of being in a hospital.\u201cOne of the main problems there is the traditional belief that women don\u2019t see the hospital as a comfortable option,\u201d Ms. Scrilatti said.

Ms. Scrilatti said that she did not want to use \u201cpoverty as a filter.\u201d\u201cWe already have enough journalists who did Africa from this point of view,\u201d she said.One of her primary goals was to \u201cdestigmatize Africa, and African women in particular, which means trying to portray them not as victims but as real women.\u201d\u201cI realized it was not all about maternal maternity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was about women fighting a problem, dealing with gender equality and dealing with a patriarchal legacy.

In fact, the president said that the coverage of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s political leanings was a result of the news media trying to pin the attempted bombings on his politics.\u201cWe have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people.\u201dSenator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, also took the stage and thanked Mr. Trump for capturing \u201cthat animal who sent bombs,\u201d referring to Mr. Sayoc, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that in the United States.\u201dMost of the people and organizations on the receiving end of the packages have been targeted by Mr. Trump at his rallies.

He is planning at least 10 rallies in eight battleground states, including Florida, Montana, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee and West Virginia, according to a senior White House official not authorized to talk about the planning process.

It had nothing to do with the Islamic State, she said, and he intended harm to no one but himself.\u201cWhat this case is about is a young man \u2014 a deeply troubled, isolated young man \u2014 who wanted to take his own life,\u201d the defense lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, said in her opening statement.In contrast, a federal prosecutor, Rebekah Donaleski, said the evidence would show that Mr. Ullah not only embraced a radical and violent ideology and studied how terrorist groups like ISIS attack Americans, but he also researched how to build a bomb and use screws as shrapnel to maim and kill civilians.\u201cThe defendant chose Monday morning rush hour for one reason,\u201d Ms. Donaleski said. \u201cTo terrorize as many people as possible.\u201dIn the chaos, Mr. Ullah was subdued by Port Authority police officers and taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he waived his right to remain silent and said he had carried out the attack because of the United States government\u2019s policies in the Middle East, prosecutors have said.Ms. Donaleski told the jury that Mr. Ullah had reviewed online Islamic State propaganda videos, including one encouraging ISIS supporters who could not travel overseas to \u201ctake the fight to where you were, including here in America. The defendant did just that.\u201dMr. Ullah has been charged with providing material support to the Islamic State, using a weapon of mass destruction and other counts; if convicted, he could face life in prison.Ms. Donaleski meticulously described how Mr. Ullah, an electrician, built the bomb in his Brooklyn apartment, using a pipe, wires and screws he had taken from his workplace, a construction site a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal.He filled a metal pipe with screws and broken Christmas tree lights and mixed an explosive powder that included ground-up match heads, she said. Then he threaded wires into the pipe and used zip ties and duct tape to attach it to his chest, Ms. Donaleski explained. He slipped a wire from the bomb into a hole in his right pants pocket and connected the wire to a 9-volt battery, she said.While riding the A train to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, he posted a message on Facebook, which read, \u201cOh, Trump, you failed to protect your nation,\u201d she told the jury.In court, Mr. Ullah sat impassively at the defense table, even when prosecutors played a security video that showed the blast and him falling to the ground as commuters ducked and shielded their ears. Mr. Ullah seemed to watch more intently as the jurors passed around the jagged pipe recovered from the scene.Although no one was killed in the attack, one witness, David Wall, 65, of Hewitt, N.J., testified that he was left with shrapnel in his right leg and serious hearing problems.Mr. Wall said he was walking directly in front of Mr. Ullah. The force of the blast pushed Mr. Wall forward, and he clutched his ears.\u201cI was dizzy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy head was pounding.\u201d Then he felt a pain in his right calf, \u201clike a flame.\u201dAlmost a year later, Mr. Wall said he still had difficulty riding the subway.\u201cTrain after train goes by,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get on.

But academic feminism is right about the big thing.The big thing is that for thousands of years social thinking has been dominated by men \u2014 usually alpha men \u2014 who saw life as a place where warriors and traders went out and competed for wealth and power. These male writers were largely blind to the systems of care that undergirded everything else.When children are young, they grow up unaware of the tunnel. At age 9, girls are sophisticated and expressive about their own feelings. But then as they get into adolescence they become aware of the preferences around them. As Gilligan\u2019s work demonstrates, they conclude that if they expressed their real emotions nobody would want to be with them. They begin to hide themselves in order to fit in. \u201cI never utter my real feelings about anything,\u201d Anne Frank wrote in her diary. \u201cMy house is wallpapered with lies,\u201d a girl in a Harvard research group observed.But then in adolescence they have to earn their manhood. They do that by differentiating themselves from girls and from their young \u201cimmature\u201d selves. They often turn stoical, unemotional and tough. They seek to belong by being apathetic and independent.In other words, as the editors of the anthology put it, the culture teaches girls not to talk and boys not to feel. Girls begin to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Boys say, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d They\u2019ve been pushed away from honest sharing and deep connection. As one of the characters in \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d put it, \u201cWhen you grow up, your heart dies.\u201dAll of this was survivable when religion played a bigger role in national life, with its gospel of mercy, charity and love. But now we have an ethos of detachment and competition all the way down.This is raw carnage, caused by a culture that leads to self-isolation, conflict and a crisis of connection. What bothers me most on campus is not the assaults on free speech; it\u2019s that some students are brutal with one another. They play games of moral one-upsmanship that leave others feeling desolated.And if you think the crisis of connection is limited to campus, I invite you to the American political scene over the past two weeks, with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder lining up to present their pseudo-masculine, chest-thumping displays to show how much they hate the other side.They watch the infant try to crawl to something or reach for a toy. They are learning to put themselves in the mind of the baby, learning emotional literacy and learning what deep attachment looks like.In one class there was an eighth-grade boy who Gordon calls Darren who had watched his mother\u2019s murder when he was 4 and was put into foster care. He was bigger than everybody else since he was two grades behind. One day, to everybody\u2019s surprise, Darren wanted to hold the baby.The mother was nervous but let him, and Darren was great with the baby. He went over to a quiet corner and rocked the baby while the baby snuggled into his chest. Darren returned the baby to his mother and asked innocently, \u201cIf nobody has ever loved you, do you think you could still be a good father?\u201dThere it was, Gordon writes, even in traumatized soil, a bloom of empathy.Advertisement"}

Study and work hard. Lean in. Build the pipeline. Look to our daughters. The past year has shown that this wisdom is incomplete. To move forward, we have to excavate the past.The public accounts and conversations, even the ones that feel unsatisfying, hold hidden value because they draw out quieter ones. In the privacy of homes, in office cafeterias and bars, women and men have confided, argued, apologized and reconsidered their own histories in ways that will never be captured by investigative articles, distinguished panels or year-end lists. These exchanges, these collective adjustments of the line between what feels right and what feels wrong, can seem more immediate and impactful than any law.But are they? So far, the true rules of our society have barely budged. Federal law does not protect freelancers or employees of many small businesses from harassment. The criminal justice system does not come close to addressing sexual abuse, especially when the events lie far in the past. (Do not trust anyone who makes confident assertions about whether Harvey Weinstein will be convicted.) Beyond a scattering of new state legislation, shifts in social attitudes have not been locked in place by law.There\u2019s no agreement on which behaviors merit scrutiny, on where the boundaries lie. Some supporters of Brett Kavanaugh are outraged that his confirmation was questioned because of a high school-era allegation. For many on the other side, that was the power of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony: She told the country that a traumatic experience from the distant past still matters.For men (and women) who are accused, a general lack of accountability has given way to a lack of consensus over what kind of behavior merits warning, a firing, or career obliteration.Like the civil rights movement and the push for gay marriage, #MeToo is propelled by imperatives of decency, respect and equality. But those other movements challenged stark rules: No black person could sit at the front of the bus; no gay person could marry. The #MeToo movement is trying to address a more complex knot of law, private behavior and workplace conduct. And though organizations have formed and mobilized, money has been raised, and meetings have been held, it\u2019s not yet clear whether they will lead to an ambitious, disciplined, long-term strategy to reach once seemingly impossible goals.Whatever happens, we and our colleagues will be watching and reporting, reminding ourselves and others: Progress requires a correct accounting of what women have really faced.Advertisement"}

Bowers had been spewing his anger in post after post on the web, calling immigrants \u201cinvaders,\u201d distributing racist memes and asserting that Jews were the \u201cenemy of white people.\u201dThen, on Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue with an assault rifle and three handguns, he tapped out a final message: \u201cI can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201dThe authorities said Mr. Bowers, 46, then killed at least 11 people in and around the synagogue, Tree of Life, a spacious building with stained glass windows, a golden memorial tree and a Torah rescued from the Holocaust.It was the Sabbath, the synagogue\u2019s busiest day. The attack was one of the deadliest on the Jewish community in United States history.\u201cThe actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity,\u201d said Scott W. Brady, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \u201cPlease know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.\u201dThe police arrested Mr. Bowers, who had 21 guns registered to his name, according to Representative Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania. Officials said he was not known to law enforcement before the shooting, and a search of the Pennsylvania judiciary database shows only a 2015 traffic violation in his name.Mr. Bowers took to Gab, a social network that bills itself as a being dedicated to free speech and which is increasingly popular among alt-right activists and white nationalists. After opening an account on it in January, he had shared a stream of anti-Jewish slurs and conspiracy theories. It was on Gab where he found a like-minded community, reposting messages from Nazi supporters.\u201cJews are the children of Satan,\u201d read Mr. Bowers\u2019s biography.Mr. Bowers lived about a 25-minute drive south of the synagogue in a brick apartment complex on a dead-end street, where he was frequently spotted smoking cigarettes outside. A neighbor said she could not remember seeing him speak to anyone, not in the two years she\u2019d lived there.The shooting came a day after federal authorities arrested a man in Florida on charges of sending mail bombs to prominent Democrats. The man, Cesar Sayoc Jr., had also posted vitriolic and sometimes violent messages \u2014 both online and on stickers attached to the windows of his van. Political rage fueled Mr. Sayoc, who railed against liberals and immigrants and echoed the saber-rattling rhetoric of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, according to people who knew him.But Mr. Bowers\u2019s social media activity appeared to be much more extreme.Mr. Bowers frequently reposted anti-Semitic content that alleged Jews control the nation. On a doctored image of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the gate read: \u201cLies Make Money.\u201d Another post said: \u201cOpen you Eyes! It\u2019s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!\u201dMr. Bowers also extended his anger to the president, whom he accused of not going far enough to achieve the political goals Mr. Bowers wanted.Days before the shooting, he wrote: \u201cTrump is a globalist, not a nationalist. There is no #MAGA as long as there is a\u201d \u2014 he inserted a slur for Jews \u2014 \u201cinfestation.\u201dAnother doctored image showed the president in conversation with a man wearing a skullcap. Yet another post featured a suitcase of guns.On Saturday, in Mr. Bowers\u2019s modest neighborhood, a large truck from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives blocked the street. Some three dozen law enforcement officials milled around and neighbors came out to look, despite a cold steady rain.Nearby, a Halloween light display sat on the lawn flashing on and off. A sign in the window read \u201cBoo.\u201dOne man, who said he had lived nearby for more than 15 years, stood outside shaking his head. He noted that many immigrant families had moved into the neighborhood lately. Another woman said she had struggled to understand how the national epidemic of violent hate \u2014 so vivid and relentless on the media but in many ways still distant \u2014 had arrived at her doorstep.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it has spread out this far,\u201d she said.Kim Lyons, Adam Goldman and Ali Winston contributed reporting.

The dish \u2014 whose Thai name, khao man gai, translates word for word as \u201crice fat chicken\u201d \u2014 would be nothing without the oily slick that rises to the top of the poaching liquid and is skimmed off and reserved for cooking the rice. The grains are soaked in it, given a dose of sesame oil, then steamed in a suffusion of crushed ginger, garlic and cilantro.This is rich, and richer still when slaked with a heady sauce of raw smashed ginger, garlic and tao jeow (fermented yellow soybean paste), with competing vectors of vinegar, sugar and a low kindling of chiles. There are two other condiments on the table, a green slurry fueled by fish sauce and fire, like a swallowed shriek, and an inky syrup of sweet soy sauce teetering on caramel. (\u201cBack in Thailand, kids love this,\u201d the manager said.)The collagen-heavy chicken broth comes on the side, with winter melon in its depths, so translucent it\u2019s almost invisible. A spoonful is like drinking liquid fat: The broth stays on the tongue, thick and warm, making the flavors last.At this small, cheerful storefront, the two are making a more straightforward appeal to comfort and nostalgia. Food is presented without fuss, in compartmentalized cardboard bins, as red-mohawked chickens, arrayed on shelves, stand guard.Their plates are full of dark meat, all thigh and drumsticks. Here the chicken is submerged and simmered in a broth steeped with cilantro, garlic, ginger and pandan leaves, which lend a flavor that\u2019s half-fragrance, half-cloudy memory. Spongy panels of skin cling to the meat; the texture is intentionally slippery.I liked their grilled chicken better, the flesh rubbed with the same herbs from the pot and brightened by lemongrass, left overnight and then turned over flame until mottled and smoky. Buttermilk fried chicken is commendable, too, although it should be eaten immediately, before its armor wilts.But as at Eat\u2019s, the chicken is secondary to the rice, the grains plump from chicken broth. Here the rice is wetter and more aromatic, the flavors almost blooming on the tongue. The side of soup is milder, with daikon rather than winter melon and a rubble at the bottom: corn, added at the last minute so it remains sunny-sweet.Each version of chicken is paired with a condiment, the sugar content escalating from one to the next. Deep-fried chicken is tempered by a sticky sauce like unresolved candy, made of pickled garlic, tomato paste and defanged chiles. Grilled chicken gets a meld of tamarind and fish sauce, sprinkled with roasted rice powder for the faintest crackle.Poached chicken is the original, the one that sells out by early afternoon. Fortunately, you can still get a side of its accompanying sauce: tao jeow and crushed ginger, which I would happily eat over rice alone, the chicken entirely forgotten.Advertisement"}

The journalism school faculty held an emergency meeting at 7 a.m. the following day, and two public forums were scheduled for that night.Mr. Meek had donated $5.3 million to the journalism school, which was renamed the Meek School of Journalism and New Media in 2009.

Mr. Jones creates climate simulations for the nonprofit Climate Interactive.The world would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster than has ever been achieved, and do it everywhere, for 50 years. Northern European countries reduced emissions about 4 to 5 percent per year in the 1970s. We\u2019d need reductions of 6 to 9 percent. Every year, in every country, for half a century.We\u2019d need to spread the world\u2019s best climate practices globally \u2014 like electric cars in Norway, energy efficiency in California, land protection in Costa Rica, solar and wind power in China, vegetarianism in India, bicycle use in the Netherlands.We\u2019d face opposition the whole way. To have a prayer of 1.5 degrees Celsius, we would need to leave most of the remaining coal, oil and gas underground, compelling the Exxon Mobils and Saudi Aramcos to forgo anticipated revenues of over $33 trillion over the next 25 years.And while the air would almost immediately be cleaner and people healthier, the heartbreaking impacts of climate change \u2014 flooding in London, New York and Shanghai, as well as in Mumbai, India; Hanoi, Vietnam; Alexandria, Egypt; and Jakarta, Indonesia, to touch on just one consequence \u2014 would continue for decades, regardless of emissions cuts, because of the long life of man-made greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.Some cynical news headlines will certainly follow the report: \u201cScientists Agree \u2014 We\u2019re Cooked!\u201d The headline writers would have a point. Solving climate is going to be harder, and more improbable, than winning World War II, achieving civil rights, defeating bacterial infection and sending a man to the moon all together.So how do we engage in a possibly \u2014 but not probably \u2014 winnable struggle within a rigged system against great odds, the ultimate results of which we\u2019ll never see? Forget success, how do we even get out of bed in the morning?We could order in Chinese and lock ourselves in the closet, but we shouldn\u2019t. Because there\u2019s good news: We\u2019re perfect for the job. If the human species specializes in one thing, it\u2019s taking on the impossible.Historically, we\u2019ve tackled the biggest challenge \u2014 that of meaning, and the question of how to live a life \u2014 through the concept of \u201cpractice,\u201d in the form of religion, cultural tradition or disciplines like yoga or martial arts. Given the stark facts, this approach might be the most useful. Practice has value independent of outcome; it\u2019s a way of life, not a job with a clear payoff. A joyful habit. The right way to live.Maybe this approach doesn\u2019t seem as noble as, say, our memory of the civil rights movement. But that era\u2019s continuous, workmanlike grinding probably didn\u2019t feel all that glorious then, either. With history as our judge, though, it does. And we know what happens when enough people take up a cause as practice: Cultural norms change. Think gay marriage. Think the sharp decline in smoking in the United States.There should be no shortage of motivation. Solving climate change presents humanity with the opportunity to save civilization from collapse and create aspects of what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called \u201cthe beloved community.\u201d The work would endow our lives with some of the oldest and most numinous aspirations of humankind: leading a good life; treating our neighbors well; imbuing our short existence with timeless ideas like grace, dignity, respect, tolerance and love. The climate struggle embodies the essence of what it means to be human, which is that we strive for the divine.Perhaps the rewards of solving climate change are so compelling, so nurturing and so natural a piece of the human soul that we can\u2019t help but do it.Advertisement"}

What\u2019s a voter to do? Contributing Opinion WriterBrazilians are bracing for the end of a peculiar election period.Another candidate, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the front-runner in the polls \u2014 up until at least a month ago, when his eligibility was rejected by the Supreme Electoral Court \u2014 has been in prison since April. Mr. da Silva, one of the most popular politicians in Brazil\u2019s history, is serving a 12-year prison term for corruption and money laundering.The new front-runner in the polls is a former military officer, Jair Bolsonaro. He is a far-right candidate promising political renewal despite having served seven terms as a federal congressman. In 26 years, he wrote 171 bills, of which two became law. (He also proposed and won passage of a constitutional amendment requiring electronic voting machines to issue a paper receipt.)Despite his provocative rhetoric, it was startling when, on Sept. 6, Mr. Bolsonaro was stabbed during a campaign rally. The assailant claimed to be following the orders of God. The candidate suffered serious abdominal injuries and spent 23 days hospitalized. (The stabbing had little effect on polls.)Mr. Bolsonaro is nostalgic for the years when Brazil was a dictatorship; he\u2019s been crusading for a return to military rule for more than two decades. \u201cWe will never resolve serious national problems with this irresponsible democracy,\u201d he said back in 1993. A recent article in The Economist called him, accurately, \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d Last month, he made a live video from his hospital bed in which he cast doubt on Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system. \u201cIn the second round, the major worry is not losing the vote, but losing to fraud,\u201d he said. There is a concern that he might not accept the results of the election if he loses.Personally, I would love to vote for the 36-year-old social activist Guilherme Boulos, one of the main leaders of Brazil\u2019s Homeless Workers\u2019 Movement and a new force on the left. His priority is combating social inequality by enacting progressive tax reform while increasing public investment in infrastructure, housing, health care and education. His agenda is way more radical and less compromising than the one of the Workers\u2019 Party.But, according to polls, fewer Brazilians intend to vote for him than even the monastic Cabo Daciolo, with his concerns about the Freemasonry and the Illuminati. Under Brazilian election rules, there will be a second-round runoff between the two top candidates if no one wins a majority of votes on Sunday. So what is a social-justice-loving Brazilian who doesn\u2019t want to see her country set back by decades to do? At the moment, the best option for tactical voting is Mr. Andrade.I mean, Mr. Haddad.But it\u2019s a pity to see that, even in such an odd election contest, more people will still vote for delusions than leftist ideals.Ms. Barbara is an author and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paradise Threatened: Fiji\u2019s War Against Climate Change", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "The South Pacific nation faces major environmental challenges, from the destruction of coral reefs to rising sea levels. At least one resort is asking tourists to help.Supported byBetween the international airport in Nadi, Fiji, and the capital city of Suva, the coastal road on the island of Viti Levu is lined with resorts and clogged with tour buses. It\u2019s a route I took several times this spring when I visited friends in Suva, a bustling port city where cruise ships drop anchor year-round and deposit thousands of tourists.The steady stream of hulking ships is emblematic of Fiji\u2019s popularity, and a major source of income. But the country\u2019s reliance on tourism, combined with vigorous development and the effects of rising global temperatures, have conspired against Fiji\u2019s fragile environment.Walking around the grounds, which were built on a steep hill, the damage from Tropical Cyclone Keni, which had swept through the islands in mid-April, three weeks before our arrival, was obvious. Boats in the lagoon were out of commission. A pool that was under construction was a mess. A tree had fallen on top of the dive shop and hit one of the compressors. A path to a nearby village had disappeared in a landslide.FijiVanua LevuFIJINadiViti LevuSuvaOutrigger Fiji Beach ResortBeqaKadavuMatava40 milesBy The New York Times\u201cWe literally said, \u2018Let\u2019s build the pool because the cyclone season is over,\u2019 and then we got hit,\u201d Luke Kercheval, one of the owners of Matava, told me, adding that the storms had scared off visitors. \u201cWe got more rain in a week than some countries get in a year. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump might not agree, but it\u2019s 100 percent about climate change,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be a scientist to figure this out.\u201dA billboard I spotted captured the mood well: \u201cWe are all in the same canoe rising up against climate change.\u201dThe ever-present discussion about Fiji\u2019s fate gave me pause. Would Fiji\u2019s stunning islands look the same in a decade or two? The soft breezes and gentle sunsets and crystal blue water at Matava made it hard to muster alarm. It also made me recall a conversation I had a few days before with Dick Watling, the founder of Nature Fiji, an environmental conservation group.Mr. Watling arrived in Fiji about 35 years ago and was an astute observer of local politics and the issue of climate change. Over coffee at Cappuccino Republic in Suva, Mr. Watling said that Fiji\u2019s leaders, like those elsewhere in the Pacific region, have become expert at extracting donations from wealthier nations. So he was not surprised that many of Fiji\u2019s problems were being blamed on climate change because it might help attract foreign aid, while also letting lawmakers sidestep thornier issues like unbridled development and lax environmental regulations.Signs of eco-tourism were certainly evident in Fiji. At Matava, solar panels generated most of the electricity, including the lights and fans in our huts. The fruit and vegetables we ate were grown locally and the fish was caught nearby. The eggs came from the chickens at the resort. Bottles, cans and other recyclables were sent back to Viti Levu.Living off the land did little to protect against Cyclone Keni, though. One of the resort\u2019s boats had flipped upside down and its outboard motors were damaged. The chickens were swept away and the vegetable gardens were destroyed. Several workers at the resort lost their homes. The damage to the reefs made finding fish harder.I chatted with Maika O\u2019Conna, a boat captain who grew up on Kadavu who said traditional fishing grounds were under attack from poachers, too.Snorkels and masks on, we swam down to the grates and placed the cones in the openings. We saw dozens of other cones with healthy-looking coral stems already there. Together, they created a small reef where none had existed. Fish nipped at my legs, protective of their newly claimed territory. When the coral fingerlings were big enough, they were replanted in the natural reef elsewhere.\u201cThe reef was there for the taking, but it was also abused,\u201d Kinijoji \u201cKenny\u201d Sarai, Mr. Masi\u2019s boss, said over a lunch of Spanish mackerel marinated in coconut milk, lemon and vinegar. Overfishing by locals depleted the reefs\u2019 aquatic population, and forests cleared by developers led to more pollutants being dumped into rivers that flowed into the ocean, damaging the reefs. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring the coral back to life.\u201dMr. Sarai, who grew up in a nearby village, said the locals are concerned about the damage to the reef. Part of its restoration included helping the reef regenerate, and also trying to convince locals not to fish in reefs being repaired. Though they were reluctant to see restrictions on their fishing rights, many villagers work at the Outrigger and other resorts and recognized that restoring the reef was a key to attracting tourists and, ultimately, preserving their jobs.\u201cPeople in Fiji know tourism is the big money earner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a national conversation around eco-tourism.\u201d\u201cPeople protect what they understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to make change.\u201dMr. Katz took us to meet Filipe Kirikirikula, the 60-year-old head of the council of elders. We sat outside his home in the middle of the well-kept village by the beach. He supported Mr. Katz\u2019s mission, which he said required changing age-old habits. \u201cMost of the people just abuse the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to teach them about conservation. People here have their own freedom.\u201dThe days of going out on the reef with a spear to catch dinner were disappearing, he said. So he supported a plan to create an area to raise clams and fish that would be protected from poachers. It would also repopulate the reefs, which in turn would attract more divers who could be charged a fee, he said.Advertisement"}

The increase coincided with President Trump\u2019s first year in office, and was the largest uptick for a single year since the organization started tracking the data in 1979.\u201cThen to come home to this,\u201d Mr. Lesser said, referring to the Republican mailer. \u201cIt\u2019s resulted in difficult conversations about anti-Semitism with my family and my neighbors.

But when I saw it, I was shocked.\u201cThere have been a lot of mailers in this campaign,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the first time that my face has been grossly distorted in a way that seems to evoke centuries of imagery used to depict the Jewish people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the future of the internet is a tripartite cold war, Silicon Valley wants to be making money in all three of those worlds.Part of the rationalization is that whether or not American companies get in on the action, a homegrown company will readily enact the kind of censorship and surveillance that its government requires. (Indeed, if Google launches in China, it has an uphill battle to fight against Baidu, the entrenched, government-endorsed Chinese search engine.) What this future will bring for Europe and the United States is not clear. Mr. Gomes\u2019s leaked speech from inside Google sounded almost dystopian at times. \u201cThis is a world none of us have ever lived in before,\u201d Mr. Gomes told employees. \u201cAll I am saying, we have built a set of hacks, and we have kept them.\u201d He seemed to hint at scenarios the tech sector had never imagined before.

A chillier relationship with Europe and increasing hostilities with China spur on the trend toward Balkanization \u2014\u00a0and vice versa, creating a feedback loop.

It needed to be cleaned, then shaved, so Taylor could begin illustrating this city\u2019s most beloved visage: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.Two days later, the Missouri Department of Transportation tweeted an image reminding drivers to follow Mahomes: always pass on the left.Heading into Sunday night\u2019s game at New England, the Chiefs are 5-0, as they were last year, as they have been before, and yet the general sense here is that this season just feels \u2026 different. That\u2019s the word evoked most often, aside from didyoujustseethat. And compel a grown man to request Mahomes\u2019s curly mop be pierced into his skin for all eternity.\u201cWe got him first,\u201d said Gaskins, who lives in Belton, Mo. \u201cHe started here. In Kansas City. He didn\u2019t start in Green Bay, he didn\u2019t start in San Francisco, he didn\u2019t start in New York. My home, Kansas City.\u201dThe morning after Kansas City toppled Denver, Ashley Homan, a fifth-grade teacher in Smithville, Mo., told her students that they were now entering the Chiefs Kingdom \u2014 loud enough for the teacher across the hall, a Broncos fan, to hear. Cheryl Jensen, a regular tailgater in Lot D17 at Arrowhead Stadium, watched Drew Brees set the career passing yardage record Monday night and then told friends on Facebook that she couldn\u2019t wait for Mahomes to surpass him.\u201cEven if they go 5-11 the rest of the way and we\u2019re Detroit for the next 10 years, I still got to watch this guy,\u201d said Clint Ashlock, 38, the artistic director for the Kansas City Jazz Orchestra. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to go out and buy a jersey for anybody, but I did. I might get two.\u201dFar more than two jerseys adorn the walls of the basement of Bob Green\u2019s home here. It doubles as a Chiefs museum, containing everything from autographed receivers\u2019 gloves he won beating them in pool at their former training camp in River Falls, Wis., to a red-and-white painted brick of the Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson.The showpiece, though, is a mural of Green\u2019s favorite Royals and Chiefs, a crowd including Joe Montana, Tony Gonzalez and, as of Monday, Mahomes. It took Green\u2019s friend Chris Fleck about 70 hours to finish the mural, 12 devoted to Mahomes.\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the grocery store and the department store and the bank, all anybody asks is, \u2018Did you see what he did last night?\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to ask who \u2018he\u2019 is.\u201dBuffalo and Cleveland might have documentaries made about their football despair, but Kansas City\u2019s postseason ledger is devastating. One victory since the 1994 season. Six consecutive playoff defeats at Arrowhead. \u201cIt\u2019s traumatizing,\u201d Homan said. \u201cI mean, it makes you want to scream and cry every single time.\u201dCompounding the misery was the Chiefs\u2019 insistence on procuring potential starting quarterbacks through trades or free agency, not the draft: Steve DeBerg to Montana, Rich Gannon to Elvis Grbac, Trent Green to Alex Smith, who tutored Mahomes last season after the Chiefs traded up to take him 10th over all out of Texas Tech.To Patti DiPardo Livergood, Blackledge was the neighbor who kept letting his Rottweiler poop in her yard. To many others, he represented what could have been; he was the second quarterback taken in the fertile 1983 draft, ahead of Marino, Kelly and Ken O\u2019Brien. She views Mahomes as a singular star for this generation.At Raygun, a cheeky clothing store in the Crossroads district, Mahomes-themed paraphernalia greets visitors at the entrance \u2014 T-shirts that say, \u201cGo Big or Go Mahomes,\u201d and bibs that proclaim, \u201cI Wish Patrick Mahomes Was My Real Dad.\u201d After that Steelers win in Week 2, a man who bought a Mahomes shirt told an assistant manager, Mary Newman, that they better order more. In only the first six weeks of this season, Raygun's sales in Chiefs apparel have tripled from all of last season, and a shirt that reads, \"Patrick Is Mahomey,\" is the company's best-selling one.\u201cIt\u2019s highlights that, if you miss them, you\u2019re kind of going, \u2018Where was I?\u2019\u201d the ESPN analyst Louis Riddick said of Mahomes in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why you better watch the whole game.\u201dOr as Ashlock said of Mahomes, \u201cHe\u2019s not the equivalent of Angel Berroa.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep denying what you see and what you feel,\u201d said Harrison, the radio host.Lucas said, \u201cWhatever he regresses to is easily the best quarterback of my lifetime.\u201dLucas is 34, same as Gaskins, who clenched his fist and bit his lip as Taylor completed his Mahomes tattoo.\u201cWhen you see it, bro,\u201d Taylor told him, \u201cyou won\u2019t care.\u201dFinally, at 10:12 p.m., after 3 hours 37 minutes (with a few short breaks sprinkled in), Taylor told Gaskins to sit up. He glanced at the photo of Mahomes that had guided Taylor, then back at his tattoo, then back to the photo.Taking small steps, he tottered toward Taylor, who was sitting on a stool, and kissed him on the head. It was sincere thanks for a tattoo, whether Gaskins knew it or not, that he had been waiting three decades to get.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cesar Sayoc, Mail Bombing Suspect, Found an Identity in Political Rage and Resentment", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAVENTURA, Fla. \u2014 Cesar Sayoc Jr. was a volatile nobody desperate to become a somebody.He styled himself as a bodybuilder, entrepreneur, member of the Seminole tribe and exotic-dance promoter in the status-hungry beachfront world of South Florida. In reality, Mr. Sayoc, a fervent supporter of President Trump who has been charged with mailing pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, was a bankrupt loner who spewed anger and spent years living in and out of a van, according to court documents and interviews with people who knew him.He went on racist, anti-gay tirades at the Fort Lauderdale pizza shop where he worked as a night-shift deliveryman in 2017, telling his manager, a lesbian, that she and other gay people along with Democrats should all be put onto an island and then \u201cnuked.\u201d At a reunion event in 2015 with his college soccer team, he browbeat former team members with racist, sexist conspiracy theories.And when Mr. Sayoc\u2019s mother and sisters urged him to seek mental-health treatment, he furiously repelled their efforts and told his mother he hated her, said Ronald Lowy, a lawyer for the family who also represented Mr. Sayoc in a 2002 case in which he threatened to bomb an electric company during a dispute over a bill. He refused to even listen when his mother reminded Mr. Sayoc that he was Filipino and Italian, not Seminole, Mr. Lowy said.\u201cHe had tremendous anger slowly boiling up, and resentment, and felt \u2018less than,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lowy said. \u201cHe lacked an identity. He created a persona.\u201dWhen they first met, Mr. Lowy said, Mr. Sayoc brought in a scrapbook filled with notes and photographs he had collected from wrestlers, bodybuilders and strippers, table scraps from a world that he idolized.\u201cHe comes across like a 15-year-old,\u201d Mr. Lowy said. \u201cHe has a total lack of maturity.\u201dMr. Lowy said that Mr. Sayoc\u2019s family members were Democrats and that Mr. Sayoc seemed to have no outspoken partisan views during the 2002 case. But he said that Mr. Trump\u2019s angry rhetoric and his appeals to the \u201cforgotten man and woman\u201d during the 2016 campaign seemed to strike a deep chord with Mr. Sayoc, whose father had abandoned the family when he was a child.\u201cHe was looking for some type of parental figure and being a loner, being an outcast, being the kind of person Trump speaks to, I think he was attracted to Trump as a father figure,\u201d Mr. Lowy said.Mr. Sayoc registered as a Republican and posted photographs of himself wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again Hat\u201d at one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies.On Twitter and Facebook, he railed against former President Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey with misspelled racial epithets, threatened former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and praised President Trump and conservative causes. His social-media feeds were an electronic version of the white van carted away by law-enforcement officials on Friday morning, which was covered in stickers praising Mr. Trump, condemning liberals and putting cross hairs over an image of Hillary Clinton.While Mr. Sayoc\u2019s sisters are successful and his mother ran her own cosmetics business, Mr. Sayoc bumped between jobs, arrests, apartments and his van. He once lived in a comfortable neighborhood of single-story homes in the Coral Ridge Isles neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, but lost the home in a 2009 foreclosure.His finances deteriorated to the point that he filed for bankruptcy in 2012, saying that he had just $4,175 worth of assets. But he still struck an outward posture of success. During a 2014 deposition in a labor lawsuit between a DJ and the owners of a South Florida nightclub, Mr. Sayoc boasted that he had played professional soccer for A.C. Milan in Italy and arena football in Arizona. He also claimed he owned a dry-cleaning business and was studying to be a veterinarian.\u201cHe was the kind of guy who was maybe sweeping floors at Apple, but would tell you he and Jobs invented the computer together,\u201d said David M. McDonald, a lawyer in Miami who represented the nightclub owners in the labor dispute.Just a day before he was arrested, with a huge national manhunt closing in on him, Mr. Sayoc showed up on Thursday to work as a D.J. at Ultra, a strip club in West Palm Beach, said the club\u2019s manager, Stacy Saccal.Mr. Sayoc worked at the club for about two months, and Ms. Saccal said there had been no concerns about his performance or behavior. But Ms. Saccal had begun to notice that Mr. Sayoc might be in financial distress: On Monday, she started to suspect he might be living out of his van. A bartender told her Mr. Sayoc was cooking something that smelled like fish in the D.J. booth.Earlier in his life, he had pinged around the Midwest for a time. In 1995, he was charged with theft by swindle and possession of half a gram of crack cocaine in the Minneapolis area, according to a statement from prosecutors in Hennepin County.He had a short-lived marriage to a woman identified in court papers as Roberta Altieri that ended in divorce in Oklahoma City in 2004, according to court records. Billie Mode, the mother of his ex-wife, said the couple worked in strip clubs and were married just two months.\u201cThey were dancers,\u201d Ms. Mode said. \u201cThey went on the circuit together.\u201dMr. Sayoc also had a long criminal record that included multiple shoplifting and theft charges. Once he was arrested while carrying $19,000 worth of cash.In May 2015, he told the police that someone had broken into his van while he was working out at LA Fitness \u2014 where he had been showering \u2014 and stole about $45,000 worth of suits and costumes he needed for his business. It is unclear whether he actually had anything worth that much in the van, or whether he was making the report as pretext to make a false insurance claim.Even then, he had an affinity for Mr. Trump: The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office report notes that of the 139 pieces he said were taken, 11 were the president\u2019s clothing brand.Scott B. Saul, a defense lawyer who represented Mr. Sayoc when he wanted to loosen the terms of his probation several years ago, said Mr. Sayoc\u2019s behavior suggested something was amiss, recounting that \u201che came across passive, and with a sense of insecurity.\u201d\u201cHe appeared to be his own island,\u201d he said.People who encountered Mr. Sayoc in recent years said their interactions were often angry or uncomfortable.\u201cHe loved Adolf Hitler; he talked about Adolf Hitler a lot,\u201d said Debra Gureghian, 56, a manager at the Fort Lauderdale pizza shop where Mr. Sayoc worked for about a year in 2017. \u201cHe would say, \u2018I like his politics, we should have more people like him.\u2019\u201dMr. Sayoc went on paranoid, racist screeds, saying that blacks and Hispanics were taking over the world. He referred to Mr. Obama with a racist slur and said he was not a citizen. Years before he ran for office, Mr. Trump falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not an American citizen.Ms. Gureghian was familiar with Mr. Sayoc\u2019s white van, but she was not sure if he was living in it. Once when it was raining, she accepted his offer to drive her home although she was nervous, unsure if she was safe.Teresa Palmer, 48, another manager, said that she also recalled the van, and that Mr. Sayoc would say \u201cnasty things\u201d about minorities. She remembered him mentioning Mr. Trump, but only recalled him saying that Mr. Trump made a \u201cgreat\u201d president. Mr. Sayoc left the pizza shop in January, telling colleagues he was going to work in long-haul trucking.When Mr. Sayoc showed up to a dinner in 2015 honoring his soccer coach from Brevard College in North Carolina, other team members said they were glad to see him.But they said he quickly made clear he was a fanatical supporter of Mr. Trump, and bombarded them with racist and misogynist conspiracy theories.\u201cHe was like, \u2018America needs to be made great again, and I\u2019m working on the upcoming presidential campaign to make sure we get the right people in office,\u2019\u201d said Eddie Tadlock, who was at the event. Mr. Tadlock said the political invective was clearly out of place at an event where former teammates were reliving their glory days on the soccer pitch.\u201cIt was hateful stuff,\u201d Mr. Tadlock said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t resemble anything logical. He was saying things like, \u2018Build a wall to keep all the Mexicans out,\u2019 and it immediately turned me off.\u201d\u201cIf you want to have a dialogue about politics and policy, there\u2019s a way to go about it, but the way he took the conversation was completely off course,\u201d he added.A few days later, Mr. Sayoc sent Mr. Tadlock a friendly congratulatory message on Facebook, but soon started barraging Mr. Tadlock with sexist, racist messages that were \u201coff-the-charts crazy\u201d and said that Mr. Trump would be the savior of the United States.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m African-American, and he\u2019s sending me racist stuff? And sexist stuff, and misogynistic stuff \u2014 you name it. He was saying Trump is going to be \u2018The Godfather\u2019 who corrects all of it, and I was like, \u2018You\u2019re out of your freaking mind.\u2019 I unfriended him immediately.\u201dJust two weeks before the homemade bombs began showing up in the mail, Mr. Sayoc put on a three-piece suit, climbed out of a sticker-covered white van and walked into a West Palm Beach art galley to attend a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration, the gallery\u2019s owner, Rolando Chang Barrero said.It was 8:30 p.m. and most of the guests had already left, Mr. Barrero said. But Mr. Sayoc did not seem to mind. Ms. Miami International was there, as was the president of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Sayoc stayed to pose for pictures with them.Jack Healy reported from Aventura, Fla.; Julie Turkewitz from Denver; and Richard A.

In a field previously dominated by memoir and genre fiction (sci-fi, young adult), a number of first novels with more purely literary designs \u2014 including playing with genre \u2014 are getting attention. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see an emerging crop of trans-related fiction by trans people,\u201d said Meredith Talusan, a journalist who writes about L.G.B.T.Q. issues. \u201cIt takes a lot of mettle to tread narrative terrain without a real tradition and without a lot of cultural support.\u201dOn a rainy August afternoon, perched on a hardback chair in his upstairs quarters, wearing jeans and a loose flannel shirt revealing a dark plexus of tattoos on his chest and arms, Rosenberg intently fielded questions about \u201cConfessions of the Fox.\u201d \u201cI was doing research for a monograph on religious enthusiasm in the 18th century and became interested in these accounts of Sheppard,\u201d he said, glancing at some densely scrawled notes in his lap. \u201cOn one level he represented resistance to the development of capitalism and new kinds of legislation around stealing. But also a lot of the material describes Sheppard as this legendary sexy figure and kind of what we would now describe as gender queer \u2014 as effeminate and small, which was key to his ability to break out of prison.\u201dThe book is narrated by one R. Voth, a contemporary transgender scholar who is given to lengthy and unusually personal footnotes \u2014 and who, the author stressed, is not an alter ego. It tracks the academic\u2019s efforts to authenticate a \u201cmashed and mildewed\u201d manuscript chronicling the adventures of Sheppard and his lover, Edgeworth Bess, here a Spinoza-spouting prostitute, as they move through the queer subcultures of 18th-century London and clash with its corrupt police force. If the novel is a cunning metafiction, it\u2019s also a lusty picaresque and, ultimately, as the author braids Sheppard\u2019s and Voth\u2019s stories, an impassioned political proof.Regarding its mash-up of genres and influences, Rosenberg said he was primarily interested in writing a \u201cfaux 18th-century thriller.\u201d But he cited literary touchstones as diverse as Daniel Defoe\u2019s \u201cA Journal of the Plague Year,\u201d Marquis de Sade\u2019s \u201cPhilosophy in the Bedroom,\u201d and the novels of Thomas Pynchon. The book, whittled in half from an original draft of 800 pages, also happens to be steeped in queer theory \u2014 as popular on campuses today as deconstruction (from which it evolved) was a generation ago.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to talk about trans or queerness or sexuality in a vacuum,\u201d said Rosenberg, whose Facebook profile reads \u201cMarxist. Worrywart. Author.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also talking about the history of racialization, the history of class formation, the history of the ways capitalist forms of the law impinge upon the body.\u201dRosenberg said \u201cConfessions of the Fox\u201d did not owe any particular debt to earlier works with transgender themes \u2014 but pointed out that his housemate\u2019s book was shaped by their reading of \u201cOrlando,\u201d Virginia Woolf\u2019s novel about a poet who changes gender from male to female and lives through several centuries of English history.\u201cI read it in high school because it was on a list of books with something queer in them,\u201d said Lawlor, who came upstairs to discuss their novel \u2014 and who is as easygoing as Rosenberg is deliberate. \u201cIt was huge for me.\u201d\u201cPaul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl\u201d literally embodies the notion that gender is fluid rather than binary (an idea with enough currency that two acclaimed television series \u2014 \u201cPose\u201d and \u201cBillions\u201d \u2014 feature gender nonspecific characters). In the novel, Paul Polydoris changes his body and sex organs at will to attract \u201conly the sorts of attention he desired\u201d as he cruises a \u201cwomyn\u2019s festival\u201d in Michigan, Iowa City\u2019s punk scene, or off-season Provincetown in the age of mixtapes and Doc Martens.As fanciful as it is \u2014 and as difficult to quote in a family newspaper \u2014 the narrative is rooted in the author\u2019s experience. \u201cI came of age in the 90s,\u201d Lawlor said. \u201cEveryone was dying\u201d of AIDS. \u201cSo people were like, wait a minute, what about play and pleasure and performance?\u201dLike \u201cConfessions of the Fox,\u201d \u201cPaul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl,\u201d which took Lawlor 15 years to write, bends genre as well as gender. Short fables are sprinkled among the chapters, and the author makes use of pastiche, footnotes and other moves from the postmodern playbook. \u201cFor queer artists of a certain age we just assumed that to write was to experiment,\u201d Lawlor said.The two novelists are not unique among transgender writers in their magpie approach to literary tropes and genres. Kai Cheng Thom, a 27-year-old Chinese-Canadian transgender writer and performance artist, is the author of a recent \u201cfictional memoir\u201d titled \u201cFierce Femmes and Notorious Liars: A Dangerous Trans Girl\u2019s Confabulous Memoir\u201d \u2014 a novel that turns the memoir form on its head.\u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition of trans people being confined to memoir,\u201d said Thom in a recent interview. (The list of transgender memoirs stretches from Lili Elbe\u2019s 1933 autobiography, \u201cMan Into Woman\u201d to Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s \u201cThe Secrets of My Life,\u201d published in 2017 \u2014 and beyond). \u201cThis idea that we have to narrate our lives for the titillation of cis-gender readers \u2014 \u2018When I was a child I never fit in and then I wanted this other genitalia\u2019 \u2014 I thought it would be fun to take that on.\u201dHer novel, which follows the exploits of an Asian transgender girl who runs away from home and finds her true family in a vigilante gang of \u201cfierce, fabulous femmes\u201d known as the Lipstick Laceraters, blends fiction and nonfiction with dashes of magical realism, poetry and fairy tale. There\u2019s violence, too, but it\u2019s of the Tarantino variety \u2014 stylized and, in the context of real-life conditions for transgender women on the street, cathartic.Thom, a self-described anarchist and \u201cdrag-dance sensation\u201d who comes across as rather low-key online (oversized horn rim glasses, ruminative pauses), said that as a storyteller she found straight-up realism limiting. \u201cWhen you start out as one thing in life and become another you have to overcome this sort of real-life hero\u2019s journey to get there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat does lend itself to heightened narratives.\u201dFor some transgender writers, the labeling of books, by genre or otherwise, is as problematic as the typing of people. \u201cGenre, like gender, is a social construct,\u201d proclaims Rivers Solomon, an African-American writer, on the author\u2019s website. Solomon\u2019s first novel, \u201cAn Unkindness of Ghosts,\u201d about a gender neutral young person living aboard a starship eerily reminiscent of an antebellum plantation, generally lands on the science fiction shelves \u2014 but the book is \u201cliterary\u201d enough that Publishers Weekly described Solomon\u2019s writing as \u201cworldbuilding by poetry.\u201dIf transgender fiction leans to heightened narratives, it doesn\u2019t exclude kitchen-sink realism. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge the writers engaging in the specificities of actual trans experience,\u201d said Talusan, if only to counter a long cultural tradition of transgender people \u201ccast as the other or the villain\u201d (think \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d). Imogen Binnie, Casey Plett, and Torrey Peters are three novelists whose slice-of-trans-life fiction is published by small presses.This year Plett, a Canadian writer who is the author of the story collection \u201cA Safe Girl to Love,\u201d came out with her first novel, \u201cLittle Fish.\u201d The book opens with the discovery by a young Winnipeg transgender woman, Wendy Reimer, that her Mennonite grandfather may also have been transgender. But the novel\u2019s primary focus is the day-to-day struggles of Wendy and her circle of friends \u2014 with unemployment, with alcoholism, with sexual violence. Plett knows alienated transgender millennials the way Ann Beattie knows alienated cis-gender boomers.Toward the other end of the commercial spectrum, earlier this year Ecco/Harper Collins released \u201cThe House of Impossible Beauties,\u201d by Joseph Cassara, with a bullish first printing of 50,000. The book is as immediate as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u2014 not surprisingly, given that it was inspired by the documentary \u201cParis is Burning.\u201d Like the film, the novel tells the story of the House of Xtravaganza, the Latinx drag ball \u201cfamily\u201d of the 1980s, through the voices of Angel, Hector and its other larger-than-life gay and transgender members. There is much fabulousness until there isn\u2019t \u2014 racism, queer bashing and AIDS taking their inevitable toll.Cassara, a 28-year-old graduate of the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, is not transgender \u2014 and at least one reviewer deemed the transgender characters in his book less fully realized than the gay ones. In an interview he gave The Millions before the novel came out, the author addressed the hot button issue of who gets to tell whose stories. \u201cThe role of the novelist is to deeply inhabit the lives of characters who are different than ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cMy intent was to take each character and treat them as the beautiful, nuanced, complex human beings that they are.\u201dIn the view of most critics, \u201cThe House of Impossible Beauties\u201d manages to do just that. It also serves as a reminder that, for all the increase in transgender visibility, life on the ground for many transgender people hasn\u2019t necessarily changed much \u2014 particularly in a time of civil rights rollbacks. The novel opens with a quote from James Baldwin: \u201cPerhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.\u201d There\u2019s another, airier line from Baldwin that could serve as an epigraph in any of these books: \u201cIdentity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self: in which case, it is best the garment be loose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Road to Victory Winds Through Rural East Texas", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTYLER, Tex. \u2014 Barely a week from Election Day, Beto O\u2019Rourke is still down in the polls. President Trump just increased his Republican opponent\u2019s momentum at a hot-blooded rally in Houston. And despite Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s national star power and record-breaking fund-raising, his quest seems as daunting and as unlikely as ever \u2014 winning a Senate seat in Texas, something no Democrat has done since 1988.But ask Mr. O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic congressman trying to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, what his strategy is in the final days of his underdog campaign, and his answer comes quickly.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing it,\u201d he said.He was standing last week in a hallway of a Baptist church in the East Texas city of Tyler. Hundreds of supporters squeezed into the pews, sat on the green carpet or stood along the sides to hear the El Paso congressman\u2019s speech, delivered from the pulpit, as a phone on a tripod beamed it out live on Facebook. The pastor, the Rev. Mark Hood, said it was the biggest crowd he had ever seen in the Liberty Missionary Baptist Church sanctuary for any event, political, religious or otherwise.\u201cThis is a phenomenon,\u201d said Nancy Nichols, 63, a Tyler businesswoman who has volunteered for the O\u2019Rourke campaign in East Texas. \u201cThis is grass roots. And you know it\u2019s grass roots because there\u2019s one glitch after another. We\u2019re just real people.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke has what many view as a formidable \u2014 and downright impossible, some argue \u2014 task for a Democrat: knocking a Republican incumbent from his Senate seat in Texas. Strategists and current and former elected officials who have run Democratic statewide campaigns said that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke has a prayer, it gets partly answered here in East Texas.Mr. O\u2019Rourke, they said, must persuade voters who have voted reliably Republican in recent years to return to their Southern Democrat roots.That\u2019s not the only thing he must do. As a Spanish-speaking native of El Paso, Mr. O\u2019Rourke must ensure that Latinos around the state, including many of those who have never voted in their lives, go to the polls, a goal that strategists believe is the key to turning Texas from red to purple.And he must also get a sizable number of voters in the middle-class regions where blue urban Texas meets red suburban Texas. In 2016, Fort Bend County, a diverse and fast-growing area near Houston, was a hodgepodge of victory and defeat for both parties: Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump, but several congressional, State House and State Senate seats stayed in Republican hands.Mr. Cruz, for his part, is continuing his push to define his opponent as a pro-tax, pro-regulation liberal who is out of step with voters in the state.He and other Republicans have lately cast the Senate race as a battle for the soul of Texas. The Battle of the Alamo, the frontier mythos, the 1835 \u201cCome and Take It\u201d flag \u2014 all have been used to get out the Republican vote.\u201cOur state was formed by rugged frontiersmen and women risking everything,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters last week. \u201cThey\u2019re out on the Tennessee frontier. They decide it\u2019s not hard enough here, so they nail to the door \u2018G.T.T.\u2019 \u2014 Gone to Texas. I mean, that\u2019s who we are. That is the spirit, that\u2019s the DNA of Texas. That we value freedom. We want to be left alone and left to live our lives.\u201dLast week, the debate played out in an East Texas town a world away from the hipster neighborhoods of Austin and the melting pot of Houston \u2014 Tyler.Deep in the thickly forested Piney Woods region, Tyler is a Bible Belt city of 105,000, where, in 2015, a scheduled event with a local lesbian author at a public library was canceled after residents complained to city officials. Mr. Cruz beat the Democrat he was running against in 2012 by 42 percentage points in Smith County, where Tyler is the county seat. Greg Abbott beat another Democratic star, Wendy Davis, by 54 points here in the governor\u2019s race in 2014.\u201cFor the last 100 years, when the Democrats carried small-town Texas, it was a Democratic state, and the Republicans used to carry the big cities,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a Democrat and former Texas land commissioner who lost the 1998 governor\u2019s race to George W. Bush. \u201cWhen we started losing small-town Texas and carrying the big cities, they started winning. It\u2019s just that simple. You build up your majorities in those small towns.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s strategy has centered on being on the ground at rallies like the one in Tyler, firing up Democrats in places once written off as unwinnable and maintaining his populist and optimistic image.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a moment like this one, a year like 2018,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in an interview at the church. \u201cPeople, myself included, want to be part of something greater than themselves, greater than a political party, greater than our differences. From the first time we came to Tyler a year and a half ago, to every visit since then, it\u2019s been more of the same. That\u2019s what leaves me encouraged.\u201dBoth Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Mr. Cruz campaigned in Tyler on the same day last week, holding rallies just a few miles and a few hours apart. Mr. O\u2019Rourke drew about 1,000 to the church, while Mr. Cruz had more than 600 at a banquet hall.On Oct. 18, The Longview News-Journal \u2014 the major paper in Longview, one of the largest cities in East Texas \u2014 endorsed Mr. O\u2019Rourke, accusing Mr. Cruz of spending much of his time as the state\u2019s junior senator on his failed bid for president in 2016.The polls continue to underscore how unpredictable the race has become.In the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll of likely voters, Mr. Cruz held a narrow lead of six percentage points over Mr. O\u2019Rourke, with a margin of error of 3.22 percentage points. But the same poll showed other Texas Republicans with sizable leads over their Democratic opponents. Mr. Abbott had a 19-point advantage and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick held an 18-point lead. That poll and others like it suggest that Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a stronger campaign than other Texas Democrats and that support for Mr. Cruz is softer than for other Republicans on the ballot.\u201cWhen a Democrat hasn\u2019t won a Senate seat in Texas since 1988, you go into it knowing it\u2019s always an uphill battle,\u201d said State Representative Chris Turner, a Democrat who was the campaign manager during the final stretch of Ms. Davis\u2019s run for governor in 2014. \u201cBut Beto I think is better positioned than any Democratic candidate has been in easily a generation.\u201dRepublican strategists and Mr. Cruz\u2019s supporters said they remain concerned about the tight race. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has clearly won key campaign battles: He has raised more money than Mr. Cruz, and more of his signs and bumper stickers are visible throughout big-city and small-town Texas. But Republicans remain skeptical that he can win the overall war.\u201cI think that Texans are conservatives as a rule, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll vote for a guy that\u2019s for more taxes and gun control and open borders,\u201d said Kerry D. Pratt, a West Texas cotton farmer who is the chairman of the Republican Party in Floyd County, an agricultural community near Lubbock, where Mr. Cruz planned to campaign on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the free press because he\u2019s new. He\u2019s handsome. But nobody believes what he believes around here.\u201dMr. Cruz, who has been traveling the state in a sleek bus plastered with the slogan \u201cTough as Texas,\u201d has been as confident as ever. After the rally in Tyler last week, the senator was asked by reporters whether a Democrat can ever win statewide office in Texas.\u201cI hope not,\u201d he replied. But he added: \u201cWe know that the extreme left, they\u2019re really angry. They\u2019re filled with rage. They\u2019re filled, many of them, with hatred for the president. That means that the extreme left is going to show up in big numbers. The good news: In Texas, there are a whole lot more conservatives than there are liberals.\u201dTexas was a Democratic state longer than it has been a Republican one. From 1874 to 1979, the governor\u2019s office was occupied by conservative Democrats. In January 1979, Bill Clements became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Republican shift in local, state and federal offices unfolded slowly as Texas Democrats abandoned the party over a host of economic and social issues. One of the last regions to flip from Democratic to Republican was East Texas.Paul L. Sadler, the Democrat whom Mr. Cruz defeated in 2012 to win the Senate seat, believes that winning East Texas is essential for Democrats to break the spell that has haunted them for decades. No Democrat has won statewide office since November 1994, when a group of Democratic officials that included Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock were re-elected.\u201cThe greatest bloc of people over 65 that once voted Democrat that are voting Republican is sitting in East Texas,\u201d said Mr. Sadler, a lawyer and former state legislator who used to live in the region. \u201cThese people voted Democratic until 2003, 2005. What we saw in East Texas was the churches flipped. When the deacons of the church started handing out Republican voting cards at the back, I knew we were in trouble.\u201dAt the church in Tyler, there was even a contingent from Robert E. Lee High School \u2014 members of the school\u2019s Young Democrats Club. Chris Leatherwood, 33, a Tyler native and teacher who serves as the club\u2019s faculty sponsor, went to Robert E. Lee himself and graduated in 2004. He said he felt the political climate of East Texas changing.\u201cI knew enough to keep my mouth shut about what my views were,\u201d Mr. Leatherwood said of his youth. \u201cWe\u2019re part of the Bible Belt. Everybody\u2019s got their preconceived ideas. They were born in a conservative landscape. They were raised that way. For Texas to even be hinting at being purple \u2014 not even blue, just purple \u2014 is a big deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Civil War, Part II", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation is deeply divided, with each side seeing the other as \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Opinion ColumnistI began my journalism career covering a civil war in Lebanon. I never thought I\u2019d end my career covering a civil war in America. We may not be there yet, but if we don\u2019t turn around now, we will surely get where we\u2019re going \u2014 which was best described by Senator Jeff Flake on Monday: \u201cTribalism is ruining us. It is tearing our country apart. It is no way for sane adults to act.\u201d We can\u2019t find common ground on which to respectfully disagree; the other side is \u201cthe enemy.\u201d We shout at each other on television, unfollow each other on Facebook and fire verbal mortars at each other on Twitter \u2014 and now everyone is on the digital battlefield, not just politicians. And nothing is sacred. Brett Kavanaugh defended himself the other day with the kind of nasty partisan attacks and ugly conspiracy theories that you\u2019d expect only from a talk radio host \u2014 never from a would-be justice of the Supreme Court. Who can expect fairness from him now? And this fracturing is all happening with a soaring stock market and falling unemployment. Can you imagine what it will be like when we face the next recession?This also feels worse than the divisions over Vietnam and civil rights because there were three huge forces holding us together back then that are missing today: a growing middle class, the Cold War and a sane Republican Party. For much of the period after World War II, most Americans were sure that they\u2019d be in the middle class and that their kids would follow. Strong unions, a slower pace of technological change and only limited globalization meant an average worker, with middle skills, could be middle class. There was something called a \u201chigh-wage, middle-skilled job.\u201d Also, the fact that the Soviets held a nuclear gun to our heads meant we had to stick together to some degree. It made compromise in Washington a necessity, not a luxury, on many issues. But in the early 2000s, most high-wage, middle-skilled jobs disappeared. Now there is only a high-wage, high-skilled job and a low-wage, low-skilled job. And that has fractured the middle class and left a lot of people behind. The end of the Cold War has meant that no foreign enemy cements us together anymore, save for a brief period after 9/11. And the G.O.P. has lost its way. And not only have we lost the buffers and cushions we once had, but a generation of leaders has come along, led by Donald Trump, who have made fueling our divisions their business model. They did this even though that meant scuttling Obama\u2019s health care plan, which was based on Republican ideas, and even though that meant scuttling long-held G.O.P. principles \u2014 like fiscal discipline, a strong Atlantic alliance, distrust of Russian intentions and a balanced approach to immigration \u2014 to attract Trump\u2019s base. Flake, the departing Arizona Republican, called this out this week: \u201cWe Republicans have given in to the terrible tribal impulse that first mistakes our opponents for our enemies. And then we become seized with the conviction that we must destroy that enemy.\u201d In a speech in August 2016, McConnell boasted: \u201cOne of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, \u2018Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.\u2019\u201d That was a turning point. That was cheating. What McConnell did broke something very big. Now Democrats will surely be tempted to do the same when they get the power to do so, and that is how a great system of government, built on constitutional checks and balances, strong institutions and basic norms of decency, unravels. When I look at all the people today who are propelling their political careers and fattening their wallets by dividing us, I cannot help but wonder: Do these people go home at night to some offshore island where none of this matters? Do these people really think their kids aren\u2019t going to pay for the venom they sell and spread? Don\u2019t worry, I know the answer: They aren\u2019t thinking and they aren\u2019t going to stop it. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Long Journey of the Aleppo Pepper", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe signature Syrian spice, caught up in conflict, became scarce in the United States just as its popularity boomed. But importers and vendors are finding new ways to get it.The resulting Aleppo pepper shortage in the United States came just as the salty-sweet, mildly hot chile was becoming well-known among American chefs, restaurateurs, cookbook authors and spice merchants.When partly dried, the naturally oily peppers are coarsely ground and mixed with a bit of salt and olive oil, then left to dry completely. This produces ruby-red, slightly salty flakes that keep well in the freezer thanks to the oil and are distinctively Syrian, Ms. Matar wrote.Now, Mr. Sercarz and other spice importers and vendors are finding ways to get genuine Aleppo pepper back in stock. Some secure them through third-party Syrian connections; others, from suppliers in southern Turkey who grow the peppers from seeds obtained through seed banks or from fleeing refugees who carried the coveted seeds across the border.Some American growers and food vendors are sidestepping the challenges of importing Aleppo peppers altogether by producing them domestically, in commercial nurseries in Virginia, on the plains of the Midwest, and in sunny Southern California.In recent years, the Aleppo pepper\u2019s innate versatility has broadened its appeal among chefs.But there was no fooling the spice merchant, who grew up in a house with two Armenian grandmothers who did the cooking, which included liberal doses of Aleppo pepper from a bag in the cupboard.\u201cIt is Aleppo,\u201d Mr. Sahadi said. \u201cIt has the same taste and consistency.\u201dOther food vendors, like Mr. Lowcock, have turned to buying and producing the cultivar domestically.One of the company\u2019s best-selling products, said Mr. Bader, is his \u201cAleppo Pepper Sauce,\u201d a mildly spicy hot sauce, imbued with black pepper, fresh onion, garlic and lemon.

Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door. According to the police, Mr. Bowers exchanged gunfire with officers before retreating back inside and barricading himself inside a third-floor room. He eventually surrendered.Mr. Bowers, 46, was injured by gunfire, although the authorities said it was unclear whether those wounds were self-inflicted or whether the police had shot him. He was taken to Allegheny General Hospital.The authorities said that he had no previous criminal history.Though a bris, a ceremony to mark a child\u2019s birth, was among the ceremonies taking place Saturday, no children were among the casualties, law enforcement officials said. The wounded included a 70-year-old man who had been shot in the torso, and a 61-year-old woman with soft tissue wounds, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.The attack Saturday morning struck the heart of the city\u2019s vibrant Jewish community, in the leafy Squirrel Hill neighborhood that is home to several synagogues, kosher restaurants and bakeries. Hours later, hundreds gathered at three separate interfaith vigils on a cold, rainy evening to mourn the dead and pray for the wounded.The assault on the synagogue unfolded on a quiet, drizzly morning, and came amid a bitter, vitriolic midterm election season and against the backdrop of what appears to be a surge in hate-related speech and crimes across America. It also took place in the wake of the arrest Friday morning of a man who the authorities said sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to critics of Mr. Trump, including several high-profile Democrats.Calling it the \u201cmost horrific crime scene\u201d he had seen in 22 years with the F.B.I., Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a \u201cpeaceful service\u201d when congregants were gunned down and \u201cbrutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith.\u201d\u201cWe simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American life,\u201d said Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, speaking at a news conference Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh. \u201cThese senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Pennsylvanians and are not who we are as Americans.\u201dThe anguish of Saturday\u2019s massacre heightened a sense of national unease over increasingly hostile political rhetoric. Critics of President Trump have argued that he is partly to blame for recent acts of violence because he has been stirring the pot of nationalism, on Twitter and at his rallies, charges that Mr. Trump has denied.About Saturday\u2019s attack, Mr. Trump, addressing reporters at Joint Base Andrews, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing what\u2019s going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done.\u201d\u201cThe results are very devastating,\u201d he said, adding that if the temple \u201chad some kind of protection\u201d then \u201cit could have been a much different situation.\u201dLater, speaking to reporters as he got off Air Force One in Illinois, Mr. Trump said he planned to visit Pittsburgh but he did not say when.Leaders in the United States and across the world condemned the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he was \u201cheartbroken and appalled\u201d and that the \u201cthe entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead.\u201dAttorney General Jeff Sessions said that criminal charges by the Justice Department \u201ccould lead to the death penalty.\u201d\u201cHatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cEvery American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety.\u201dThe massacre Saturday was at least the third mass shooting in a house of worship in three years. Last November, a gunman killed 26 worshipers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine congregants in a church in Charleston, S.C.It came amid rising anxiety about illegal immigration and in a decade that has seen an uptick in hate crimes. According to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued earlier this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979.On Saturday, the Tree of Life Congregation was holding services for three separate congregations when the gunman stormed in with an AR-15-style assault rifle, a Glock, and two other handguns, and began shooting.Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 a.m., Mr. Jones of the F.B.I. said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later. Mr. Bowers had already shot and killed 11 people and was on his way out of the synagogue, Mr. Jones said, when he encountered police officers and shot at them.He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr. Jones said. He was in the synagogue for about 20 minutes, law enforcement officials said.Residents near the synagogue were told to stay inside their homes. Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue.\u201cThey chased my wife inside,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just said get in the house.\u201dOn Saturday night, the authorities were still piecing together a portrait of Mr. Bowers, and had searched his apartment with a robotic bomb detector and police dogs. His apartment is in a neighborhood dotted with mostly small to medium brick homes, about a 25-minute drive south of Pittsburgh in the suburb of Baldwin Borough.Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s 14th District, where the synagogue is, said that Mr. Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really knows this guy, other than he was a hateful anti-Semite who had posted anti-Semitic views,\u201d Mr. Doyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of numb, kind of in shock, it\u2019s not really something that happens much here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid to say that we may be at the beginning of what has happened to Europe, the consistent anti-Semitic attacks,\u201d said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of Simon Wiesenthal Center, who prayed at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. He spoke in a phone interview from Austria, where he was visiting the Mauthausen concentration camp.\u201cIf it is not nipped in the bud,\u201d he continued, \u201cI am afraid the worst is yet to come.\u201dAnti-Semitism appeared to run deep for Mr. Bowers. Before it was deleted Saturday morning, a social media account believed to belong to him was filled with anti-Jewish slurs and references to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.Several weeks ago, Mr. Bowers\u2019s account posted a link to the website of HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit organization, which was planning a shabbat ceremony for refugees in locations around the country. The caption read: \u201cWhy hello there HIAS! You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?\u201dAnd hours before the gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue, the account posted again: \u201cHIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201dHIAS said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cThere are no words to express how devastated we are by the events in Pittsburgh this morning.\u201d\u201cGab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,\u201d the statement read.The Tree of Life Congregation dates back to 1864, and was originally in downtown Pittsburgh, said Alvin K. Berkun, a former rabbi at Tree of Life and now rabbi emeritus, who stayed home from services on Saturday to tend to his sick wife.About 48 percent of Jewish children in greater Pittsburgh live in Squirrel Hill, according to the study, which was carried out on behalf of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.\u201cSquirrel Hill is really an amazing safe community,\u201d he said. It is the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh with kosher restaurants and bakeries and a Jewish Community Center. \u201cI lived for a while in Israel and I know what security can mean, but the truth is the two safest neighborhoods I know are Squirrel Hill and Jerusalem. I\u2019ve lived in both.\u201dOn the high holidays, when the sanctuary comes close to reaching its capacity of 1,450 congregants, there are security officers. But Saturday morning, he said, when there would be around 75 people, \u201ceverything would have been wide open.\u201dIn recent years, the congregation size had dwindled and so now three congregations meet on Saturday morning, in three different parts of the synagogue. \u201cIt\u2019s a very vibrant place on Saturday mornings,\u201d he said.Rabbi Berkun had heard that the gunman had barricaded himself at one point in his old study. Still, threats were something he had never really thought about, not here.As soon as he saw news of the shooting on social media, Zachary Weiss, 26, tried to get in touch with his father, Stephen Weiss, a longtime member of the Tree of Life Congregation.By that time the elder Mr. Weiss was already in action, carrying out the all-too-real protocols of the active shooter response training that congregants at Tree of Life had put into place the year before. Recounting what his father told him, the younger Mr. Weiss said that services had just been getting started when he heard a loud noise.\u201cThere was a loud sound and a couple of people investigating it heard a couple more loud sounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when my father and the rabbi discovered it was the sound of gunshots.\u201dThe rabbi instructed everyone to get to a safe place, and after the Tree of Life congregants had done so, his father considered the other congregations that meet in the building on Saturdays. The bris was taking place on a lower floor, and he checked first to make sure the people there were safe. They were.His father never saw the shooter, Mr. Weiss said, but, before evacuating, he was at one point close enough to see the shell casings.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long while for us as a community to grasp this,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated where the shooting suspect, Robert Bowers, received treatment.

{"Headline": "Scientists Catch Rare Glimpses of the Endangered Vaquita", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn expedition in the Gulf of California yielded photographs and video of a species nearing extinction. MEXICO CITY \u2014 Scientists working to prevent the extinction of an elusive porpoise called the vaquita put out to sea last month, anxious about what they would \u2014 or would not \u2014 find.\u201cEvery time I go to look for vaquitas, I worry it will be my last time to see them or that we may not even be able to find them,\u201d Barbara Taylor, a biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in an email.She was aboard the ship on Sept. 26 when a mother and calf surfaced at sea, a sight greeted with elation and relief.Later that day, expedition scientists spotted two more adults. And the following day, at least two additional pairs appeared, including what appeared to be another calf. (The expedition spotted the vaquitas from a distance, which made the count a bit uncertain.) The calf sightings were particularly important because they may provide the first evidence that vaquitas can produce one calf annually instead of one every two years, as scientists had believed.Observers spotted an adult vaquita last year and again this year, identified by distinctive markings on the dorsal fin. Presumably a female, she was accompanied by a calf last year and by a smaller calf this year. \u201cCalving every year doubles their growth rate and gives more hope for recovery,\u201d Dr. Taylor said.Distinguished by a rounded profile and dark patches around the mouth and lips that give it an almost childlike look, the vaquita was rare to begin with, inhabiting only the upper reaches of the Gulf of California.The porpoise has long been endangered by curtain-like gill nets set to catch shrimp, sierra and other fish. But it was the illegal trade in a fish called the totoaba that pushed the vaquita to the edge of extinction. Demand in China for the endangered totoaba\u2019s swim bladder, considered to be a delicacy, drives a far-flung criminal network.Scientists were confident that a few vaquitas survived, because marine acoustic monitors continue to registered the echolocation clicks they make to find food. Data from those monitors guided the five-day expedition aboard the 130-foot Narval, which was funded by Diego Ruiz Sabio, a businessman in Mexico City who founded the Whale Museum in La Paz, and accompanied by officers of the Mexican Navy. Aboard the boat were photographers and a video crew, who managed to capture rare images of the notoriously shy animals. The sightings show that \u201cthey are not destined for extinction\u201d if protected in time, said Armando Jaramillo Legorreta, a marine mammal expert at Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change, who leads the acoustic monitoring program. \u201cAt least, we have very clear information that the species continues there, that it continues to reproduce, that it\u2019s in good health,\u201d he added.The vaquita is \u201ca very resourceful animal,\u201d said Lorenzo Rojas Bracho, a marine mammal expert with Mexico\u2019s National Commission of Protected Natural Areas.Still, scientists are preparing to release a new population count early next year, and Dr. Rojas Bracho warned that it could show an unabated decline.Because of the vaquita\u2019s plight, a United States judge in July ordered the Trump administration to ban the import of seafood harvested with gill nets in the animal\u2019s Gulf of California habitat. The totoaba season begins at the end of the year, just as a new government comes to power in Mexico City. There is uncertainty over whether the incoming officials will commit uniformly to protecting the vaquita. \u201cIf this season they don\u2019t control the illegal fishing, I would say it is very likely catastrophic and puts the vaquita in a dire situation,\u201d Dr. Rojas Bracho said.

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Fears of the Supply Chain in China", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHello, everyone. I\u2019m Paul Mozur, a reporter based in Shanghai, and I have covered technology in Asia for eight years. Though lately the big story has been internet companies, hardware and the supply chain remains close to my heart. Maybe that\u2019s why the tech news bombshell a little over a week ago has been so fascinating to me.For years, China and the United States have squabbled over the supply chain, which sits mostly in China but is under the charge of companies from dozens of countries.The fact that the two sides share the same fears shows how difficult it can be to ensure security in a world in which the design, production and assembly of electronics occur across multiple countries.The American block on Huawei isn\u2019t completely effective against hypothetical supply chain hacks. That\u2019s because European and Japanese telecom equipment brands also have a good chunk of their supply chains in China. On the other hand, China\u2019s control of a huge portion of the supply chain doesn\u2019t ensure its security, because high-end design and production often happens elsewhere.Neither side is happy with this. Both China and the United States will probably continue to winnow their mutual tech reliance. It won\u2019t be easy. They are working against 40 years of economic integration and a tremendously complex web of big and small companies.A different approach would be to identify the key things that need to be protected. In a discussion I had the other day with Samm Sacks, a tech policy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, she put forward the idea of having a \u201csmall yard and a high fence.\u201dThe point is to identify key products that cannot be compromised and come up with solutions to protect them. Obviously, companies should always do their best to ensure security. But that doesn\u2019t have to lead to ripping apart the global supply chain.For example, regular Americans shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about buying Huawei phones. Senators and admirals, on the other hand, should probably stick with something more closely guarded. That could involve building small, secure supply chains closer to home or special audits of phones used by people who could be high-profile targets. Even if it\u2019s a bit expensive.Either way, it\u2019s worth remembering that even if a brand of electronics is from one country, what\u2019s inside it could come from six others. Country of origin also doesn\u2019t ensure security. It makes me glad I\u2019m a journalist and not in charge of The New York Times\u2019s cyber defenses.And now on to the other news of the week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democracy in Danger in Georgia", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe right is using voter suppression to rig the governor\u2019s race.Opinion ColumnistLast year, before Stacey Abrams captured the Democratic nomination for the Georgia governor\u2019s race, I asked her how a forthrightly progressive African-American woman could win in a Southern state that has been governed only by white men.Her response was twofold. First, she argued that Democrats\u2019 old strategy for winning in the South \u2014 running socially conservative white guys to try to lure former Democrats back to the party \u2014 has repeatedly failed.At the same time, she said, Georgia, which is less than 53 percent non-Hispanic white, is full of people who would be receptive to her message, but who don\u2019t vote, or don\u2019t vote regularly. \u201cThere are enough Georgians who are going to see themselves, and believe in my capacity, if I can talk to them,\u201d she told me. Among other things, she was putting resources into connecting with, and registering, rural African-Americans in the state\u2019s south.\u201cWe have to intentionally center voters of color from the beginning, because they are the majority of a Democratic coalition in the South, and they are certainly the majority of a Democratic coalition in Georgia,\u201d Abrams said. She believed that, by allying with white liberals, those voters could elect a government in the old Confederacy that is responsive to their priorities. This would be more than a partisan upset \u2014 it would be a kind of revolution.At the time, I thought it would take a miracle to realize Abrams\u2019s vision of a multiracial Southern progressive majority. But Abrams won her primary, and since then polls have showed her barely trailing the Republican nominee, Brian Kemp, the white, hard-right Georgia secretary of state. Last year, polo-shirted racists marched around Charlottesville, Va., chanting, \u201cYou will not replace us.\u201d This year, it began to seem that in Georgia, their worst fears might be thrillingly realized.That, however, would depend on Abrams\u2019s supporters being permitted to vote. Kemp knows this as well as anyone; four years ago, he warned a meeting of Republicans about the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams founded while serving as Democratic minority leader in the Georgia House. \u201cDemocrats are working hard, and all these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines, if they can do that, they can win these elections in November,\u201d he said.In part, this is because of an \u201cexact match\u201d voter verification program that Georgia\u2019s Republican-controlled government enacted last year, which flags registrations that have even minor discrepancies with official records, like a dropped hyphen in a last name. The A.P. reported that almost 70 percent of the registrations that are now on hold are for African-American voters. (Kemp has blamed sloppy work by the New Georgia Project for the holds. His office told The A.P. that voters whose registrations are in limbo can cast provisional ballots.)On Thursday, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a lawsuit against Kemp on behalf of a coalition of Georgia civil rights groups seeking an immediate end to the \u201cexact match\u201d program. Kristen Clarke, the group\u2019s president and executive director, told me that were the Voting Rights Law still intact, the program would have never been adopted. \u201cNone of these schemes or tactics or new policies would have passed the smell test,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhat we are seeing in Georgia is the clearest evidence that states in the South that were subject to the Voting Rights Act are moving quickly to turn the clock back in ways that harm minority voters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Maria, 89, Brazilian Singer Who Inspired a Generation, Dies", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAngela Maria, the Brazilian singer who became a national sensation in the 1950s and inspired a generation of artists with her piercing, sometimes hoarse, often melancholy voice, died on Sept. 29 in S\u00e3o Paulo. She was 89.Angela Maria had a wildly successful recording career and performed in sold-out halls well into her 80s, her voice still vibrant. She was equally at home performing tangos, cha-chas and boleros. She recorded more than 650 songs and appeared in 20 films.She was also the subject of intense tabloid scrutiny. At a time when divorce was frowned upon in Brazil, she broke a cultural taboo by marrying four times, most controversially to Mr. D\u2019Angelo, with whom she had moved in when she was 52 and he was 18.She once explained the popularity of her music by noting that it drew on the heartache of Brazilians, a people well acquainted with hardship. But its appeal was universal.Unlike other radio stars of her era, she retained a strong following during the bossa nova and tropic\u00e1lia eras in the late 1950s and 1960s. She was still performing frequently when samba made a comeback in the \u201970s and weathered changing styles into the \u201990s.\u201cAngela came out of the Italian bel canto tradition and had Latin American influence, especially the bolero,\u201d said Rodrigo Faour, who wrote a biography of her. \u201cHer voice is powerful, it\u2019s warm and mesmerizing, it\u2019s not music you can put on in the background. And it had an \u2018open sesame\u2019 effect. Every time she sang, doors opened.\u201dShe was born Abelim Maria da Cunha in Concei\u00e7\u00e3o de Macabu, Rio de Janeiro State, on May 13, 1929, the 10th child of Albertino Coutinho Cunha, a farmer who later became a pastor, and Julita Maria da Cunha. Because the family was very poor, Abelim spent part of her childhood living in other households, sometimes doing menial work.Her talent was first spotted when she sang in churches as a teenager. Eager to sing for larger audiences, she would sneak out of services against the wishes of her family to compete in amateur radio competitions, which she entered under what would ultimately become her stage name. The competitions yielded prizes, which she stashed in a shoe box at home. She soon began entertaining the idea of recording an album.As a young adult, she made a meager living working in a factory, where she dazzled colleagues by belting out semi-operatic songs like Gounod\u2019s \u201cAve Maria.\u201dAngela Maria became an instant hit when radio stations began playing her first records in the early 1950s. By the end of the decade, having won numerous awards and become the country\u2019s most well-paid singer, she began hosting live television shows. She maintained a punishing schedule, often shuttling between S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.Her music had an impact on many prominent Brazilian musicians, including Milton Nascimento, Maria Beth\u00e2nia and Djavan. The renowned singer Elis Regina said she had been \u201ctremendously influenced\u201d by Angela Maria.Ms. Miranda contacted her to request a meeting 14 years after leaving Brazil. \u201cShe was my idol,\u201d Angela Maria said. \u201cWhen I heard she wanted to see me I froze.\u201dAlong with Ms. Miranda and Dalva de Oliveira, Mr. Faour said, \u201cAngela became the matrix of Brazilian singers.\u201d He added, \u201cShe gave popular composers powerful, sophisticated renditions.\u201dAngela Maria married Mr. D\u2019Angelo on her birthday in 2012, after they had been together for 33 years. In addition to him, she is survived by four children.Angela Maria was sometimes chided for her over-the-top rendition of songs and her flashy dresses. She took the criticism as a compliment.\u201cIt makes me proud,\u201d she once said. \u201cBrazilians are gaudy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tyndall Air Force Base a \u2018Complete Loss\u2019 Amid Questions About Stealth Fighters", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting in the ruined airplane hangars of Tyndall Air Force Base, which was shredded on Wednesday when Hurricane Michael swept across the Florida Panhandle, may be some of the Air Force\u2019s most advanced \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 stealth fighter jets.Tyndall is home to 55 F-22 stealth fighters, which cost a dizzying $339 million each. Before the storm, the Air Force sent at least 33 of the fighters to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.Air Force officials have not disclosed the whereabouts of the remaining 22 planes, other than to say that a number of aircraft were left at the base because of maintenance or safety reasons.An Air Force spokeswoman, Maj. Malinda Singleton, would not confirm that any of the aircraft left behind were F-22s.All of the hangars at the base were damaged, Major Singleton said Friday. \u201cWe anticipate the aircraft parked inside may be damaged as well,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we won\u2019t know the extent until our crews can safely enter those hangars and make an assessment.\u201dHurricane Michael hit the base with unexpected force. Winds roaring up to 130 miles per hour broke the base\u2019s wind gauge. Hangars where Air Force jets have sheltered during past tropical storms began to groan and shudder before being ripped to ribbons.The eye of the storm cut directly over the base, which sits on a narrow spit of land that juts into the Gulf of Mexico, about a dozen miles south of Panama City. Trees bent in the howling wind, then splintered. Stormproof roofs only a few months old peeled like old paint and were scraped away by the gale. An F-15 fighter jet on display at the base entrance was ripped from its foundation and pitched onto its back amid twisted flagpoles and uprooted trees.When it was over, the base lay in ruins, amid what the Air Force called \u201cwidespread catastrophic damage.\u201d There were no reported injuries, in part because nearly all personnel had been ordered to leave in advance of the Category 4 hurricane\u2019s landfall. Commanders still sifting through mounds of wreckage Thursday could not say when evacuation orders would be lifted.[Follow our live updates on the aftermath of Hurricane Michael here]Planes from nearby Hurlburt Field and Eglin Air Force Base also fled inland in the days before the storm. Planes that could not make the flight inland were secured in hangars and a small \u201cride out element\u201d of airmen stayed behind during the hurricane.Its aftermath was both devastating and remarkable, with helicopter footage of the base Thursday morning showing hangars that had easily survived past storms now riddled with gaping holes. At least three twin-engine propeller planes owned by a contractor and used for training were buried in debris from the wreckage of the largest hangar, along with what appeared to be an F-22, and at least five QF-16 jets \u2014 retired fighters that have been stripped down and turned into drones and used as target practice.As the sun was setting Thursday, an Air Force special tactics team had cleared the base runway.The destruction of an air force base can only be matched in scope by the pounding that Hurricane Andrew gave Homestead Air Force Base, just south of Miami, in 1992. That Category 5 storm, with winds estimated at 150 m.p.h., smashed hangars and left battered fighter jets and mammoth cargo planes in pieces on the runway. Nearly all of the surviving planes and personnel were reassigned to other bases. Two years later, it reopened as a smaller, Air Force Reserve base.The Air Force was unable to say Thursday when Tyndall might resume operations. Other Air Force and Navy bases in the area, which were spared the brunt of the storm, reopened in a limited capacity Thursday.Tyndall, where about 3,600 airmen are stationed, sits on 29,000 acres that include undeveloped woods and beaches, as well as stores, restaurants, schools, a bowling alley and quiet, tree-lined streets with hundreds of homes for both active-duty and retired military. Video footage captured the ruin there, too: The high-powered storm skinned roofs, shattered windows, and tossed cars and trailers like toys, transforming the normally pristine base into a trash heap. Multistory barracks buildings stood open to the sky.The Air Force said Thursday that recovery teams conducted an initial assessment of portions of base housing and found widespread roof damage to nearly every home.\u201cAt this point, Tyndall residents and evacuated personnel should remain at their safe location,\u201d said Col. Brian Laidlaw, 325th Fighter Wing commander. \u201cWe are actively developing plans to reunite families and plan to provide safe passage back to base housing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t think we\u2019d see the same outcome in many sections of the country where Trump-like attitudes toward race and policing prevail. \u2014 Gary SanbornThis conviction sounds like good news. For too long children of color have been told to not run, to keep your hands where they can be seen, to be respectful when stopped by the police. As one who has lived through the civil rights era, I hope we are beginning to unpack the systems that prey on people of color. \u2014 Patt KauffmanI do not think it\u2019s a turning point, unfortunately. The climate in America is toxic. Oftentimes \u201cthey\u201d feel threatened, although in most cases we are unarmed and are not a threat to anyone.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Life Like After Depression? Surprisingly, Little Is Known", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindMost research on depression focuses on the afflicted, a new paper argues, overlooking a potentially informative group: people who have recovered.Today, the condition has been recast in the medical literature as a darker, more permanent figure, a monster in the basement poised to overtake the psyche. For decades, researchers have debated the various types of depression, from mild to severe to \u201cendogenous,\u201d a rare, near-paralyzing despair. Hundreds of studies have been conducted, looking for markers that might predict the course of depression and identify the best paths to recovery. But treatment largely remains a process of trial and error. A drug that helps one person can make another worse. The same goes for talk therapies: some patients do very well, others don\u2019t respond at all.\u201cIf you got a depression diagnosis, one of the most basic things you want to know is, what are the chances of my life returning to normal or becoming optimal afterward?\u201d said Jonathan Rottenberg, a professor of psychology at the University of South Florida. \u201cYou\u2019d assume we\u2019d have an answer to that question. I think it\u2019s embarrassing that we don\u2019t.\u201dIn a paper in the current issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Dr. Rottenberg and his colleagues argue that, in effect, the field has been looking for answers in the wrong place. In trying to understand how people with depression might escape their condition, scientists have focused almost entirely on the afflicted, overlooking a potentially informative group: people who once suffered from some form of depression but have more or less recovered.Indeed, while this cohort almost certainly exists \u2014 every psychiatrist and psychologist knows someone in it \u2014 it is so neglected that virtually nothing is known about its demographics, how well its members are faring and, fundamentally, how many individuals it contains.\u201cWe know that many people with bipolar disorder, for instance \u2014 a serious, lifetime condition \u2014 do very well after treatment, and end up in creative jobs,\u201d said Sheri Johnson, director of the mania program at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut we can\u2019t predict who. So it would be very important to have this kind of information, to know more about that group. Imagine if doctors could give you some sense of what\u2019s possible.\u201dIn the new paper, Dr. Rottenberg and his co-authors, Todd Kashdan and David Disabato of George Mason University, and Andrew Devendorf of the University of South Florida, argue that the effort to understand how people recover from depression is stunted by the kind of evidence available. Treatment trials typically last six to eight weeks, and they focus on reducing negative symptoms, such as feelings of worthlessness, fatigue and thoughts of suicide. What happens in the subsequent months and years \u2014 and which positive developments occur, and for whom \u2014 is largely unknown.\u201cI think it\u2019s fine \u2014 it\u2019s a good idea \u2014 to look at people who do well after a period of depression, over the longer term,\u201d said Dr. Nada Stotland, a psychiatrist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \u201cBut we might simply find that they\u2019re the people who were doing better in the first place.\u201dIn a forthcoming analysis, to be published in Clinical Psychological Science, the same team of psychologists make a rough estimate of the number of post-depression \u201cflourishers,\u201d using data from a periodic national survey called the Midlife Development in the United States. The survey includes more than 6,000 people between the ages of 25 and 75 and more than 500 who met criteria for depression. About half of the people who had received a diagnosis recovered afterward, meaning they had been symptom free for at least a year, the researchers found. One in five of those \u2014 10 percent of the total \u2014 were thriving a decade later. The research team based that judgment on an assessment that includes measures of how people feel, how well their relationships are going, and their work.That 10 percent number might look disappointingly low, or encouragingly high, depending on one\u2019s perspective. The best comparison is the portion of people who were rated as thriving who never had depression: 20 percent.\u201cThat is, having depression cuts in half your chances of ending up in this group\u201d at the high end of the well-being scale, Dr. Rottenberg said. He added: \u201cBut we really don\u2019t know for sure, until we have better evidence.\u201dTo gain that evidence, the ideal approach would be to follow a large cohort of people who had recovered from depression, over many years, to tease apart the differences between the 10 percent or so who thrived and those who did not. Such studies would be costly, the authors acknowledge, and likely would require collaboration among many large clinical centers.Still, individuals who\u2019ve routed what Winston Churchill called his \u201cblack dog\u201d and built a full life have a collective knowledge that others do not. And researchers can only speculate about what that vanquishing entailed until they ask, systematically and empirically.The answers won\u2019t necessarily fall into a straightforward pattern. Whereas some people who thrive after depression might swear by daily pills, others may depend on weekly talk therapy. Good friends, good opportunities, and good genes are likely to play a role. And there very well may be many people who have developed idiosyncratic methods of their own, a kind of daily self-therapy or routine not found in any manual, textbook or study.\u201cIf so, it would be exciting to find out what those are,\u201d Dr. Rottenberg said. \u201cYou\u2019d not only be giving people with depression some hope, by studying this group. You might also be able to give them something they could use.\u201dFor now, said Dr. Stotland, the Chicago psychiatrist, the fact that depression can be chronic, and recurrent, hardly means that people are doomed by the diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ve never told patients that,\u201d she said. \u201c I tell them they\u2019re likely to get better, and I suspect that most of my colleagues do the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Just the Third Time in 117 Years, a Woman Wins the Nobel Prize in Physics", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince 1901, when the annual Nobel Prize in Physics was first awarded, it has been given almost exclusively to men, year after year. Women had won the award exactly twice.That changed this week, when the number rose to three. Donna Strickland, a Canadian who is an associate professor of physics at the University of Waterloo, received the prize on Tuesday for her work on high-intensity laser pulses.Dr. Strickland, 59, shared the award with the French physicist G\u00e9rard Mourou, 74, with whom she was working as a graduate student when they published a groundbreaking scientific paper in 1985; and Arthur Ashkin, 96, an American scientist who pioneered a way of using light to manipulate physical objects.Dr. Ashkin will receive half of the monetary prize, worth about $1 million. Dr. Mourou and Dr. Strickland will split the remainder.That work resulted in Dr. Strickland\u2019s first published scientific paper in 1985, and she went on to base her doctoral dissertation on it.At the time, scientists had been trying to figure out how to amplify high-energy laser pulses without destroying the amplifiers. Dr. Strickland suggested stretching out the pulses in time, amplifying them and then compressing them again to the desired level of intensity.Dr. Strickland said that her work depended in part on the work of the two women who won the Nobel Prize in Physics before her.While women are generally underrepresented in fields like science and technology, the disparities in physics seem to be particularly pronounced, said Rachel Ivie, the director of the Statistical Research Center at the American Institute of Physics.She cited institutional issues that have made it more difficult for women to advance their careers, mentioning maternity leave, which can take women out of the workplace for months or years at a time, as one example.But Dr. Ivie added that there seemed to be cultural reasons for the disparities, too. That could explain why the change has been especially slow in physics even though women are increasingly represented in the field.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really caught up yet to the other fields,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think a lot of that is the cultural perception that this is a man\u2019s science, for whatever reason.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Echo of Flint, Mich., Water Crisis Now Hits Newark", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 For nearly a year and a half, top officials in Newark denied that their water system had a widespread lead problem, despite ample evidence that the city was facing a public health crisis that had echoes of the one in Flint, Mich.Even as the risk persisted in the spring, the officials in Newark, New Jersey\u2019s most populous city, took few precautionary measures, instead declaring on their website, \u201cNEWARK\u2019S WATER IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE TO DRINK.\u201dBut this month, facing results from a new study, the officials abruptly changed course, beginning an urgent giveaway of 40,000 water filters across the city of 285,000 people, targeting tens of thousands of residences.The revelation that Newark is facing a potentially widening public health crisis over tap water has angered many residents and raised questions about whether the city\u2019s negligence has placed young children at risk.Officials were finally compelled to act after an engineering study commissioned by the city found that measures to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water were failing at one of Newark\u2019s two treatment plants.State officials are warning that children under 6 in homes with lead pipes served by the plant should not drink unfiltered tap water.\u201cThe parallels to Flint are fairly clear: The city was denying a problem even though its own data was showing problems,\u201d said Erik Olson, a top official at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit against Newark in the summer, accusing it of violating federal safe drinking water laws. \u201cNewark is not as extreme as Flint but still a serious problem.\u201dBut Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, has defended the city\u2019s response even as the issue of lead in the water has attracted intense local media attention. \u201cWhen you make a statement that the drinking water is not safe, it is yelling fire in a crowded room,\u201d he told reporters at a recent news conference. \u201cIn fact, Newark has some of the best drinking water. The problem is that our infrastructure is not safe.\u201dSome residents are frustrated at how long it took the city to admit the problem. \u201cI applaud the city for now, finally, acknowledging the issue, but they first denied it,\u201d said Bishop Jethro C. James Jr., the senior pastor at Paradise Baptist Church. \u201cThe denial was an insult to the citizenry.\u201dCandice Grant, 25, an administrative assistant, did not even know there was a lead issue until she got an alert on her cellphone about the filter giveaway.\u201cWhoa, there\u2019s lead in the water?\u201d Ms. Grant remembered thinking.Her mind flashed to her 7-month-old son, and she immediately called her husband. \u201cI said, \u2018Get more bottled water because we\u2019re not giving the baby any more from the house.\u2019\u201dNo amount of lead exposure is known to be safe for children, whose mental and physical development can be impaired, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In adults, lead can increase risks of high blood pressure and kidney disease; it can cause complications, including miscarriage, for pregnant women.In Newark, about a quarter of the more than 14,000 children under 6 who were tested in 2016 had measurable levels of lead in their blood, according to an analysis by Advocates for Children of New Jersey of the most recent publicly available state data.\u201cThis suggests a pervasive problem throughout the city coming from a variety of sources, and water could easily be one of them,\u201d said Peter Chen, policy counsel at A.C.N.J.In 2016, months after lead was discovered in the city\u2019s schools and with the water crisis in Flint in the spotlight, the state announced that large water systems, including Newark\u2019s, would have to test drinking water for lead every six months.For Newark, the results were poor. In 2017, more than 22 percent of the samples from its water system tested during the first half of the year exceeded 15 parts per billion of lead, the federal threshold requiring action. Elevated levels have remained in the system for each of the ensuing six-month monitoring periods.The city relies on two reservoirs for its water, but only one of its two treatment plants was found to have problems with its treatment methods.When the state first alerted Newark about its high lead levels, city officials said the cause was about 15,000 lead service lines \u2014 pipes that connect the city\u2019s water main to plumbing systems in houses and buildings.The city said it was helping residents replace such lines, a process that could take as long as eight years.Even after the city announced the filter giveaway, some officials continued to play down the problem.\u201cThe city\u2019s water coming out of the reservoir is safe,\u201d said Kareem Adeem, the assistant director of Newark\u2019s Department of Water and Sewer Utilities. \u201cThe city\u2019s water leaving the treatment plant is safe; the city\u2019s water entering the city\u2019s distribution system, the city\u2019s water main, is safe. The only problem is when the city\u2019s water enters into those lead lines.\u201dBut the Natural Resources Defense Council argued that Newark failed to properly treat its water with chemical additives that prevent lead from leaching into the water once it enters the pipes. The city said it would now change how it treats water at the plant where the problem was identified.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have corrosion control measures that effectively reduce the amount of lead that\u2019s going into people\u2019s water before we change their lead service lines, we need to act,\u201d Mr. Baraka told reporters.Even as the city is mobilizing, community leaders and residents remain skeptical about its performance. Once the city\u2019s water exceeded the federal limit for lead, officials were required to notify the public. While the city mailed letters and held a town-hall-style event on Facebook, officials kept minimizing the problem.A robocall in April promoting the city\u2019s pipe replacement program claimed that the water was \u201csafe\u201d and that the issue was \u201cconfined to a limited number of homes.\u201d\u201cThe robocall incensed me,\u201d said Yvette Jordan, a Newark teacher and a member of the Newark Education Workers Caucus, which joined the Natural Resources Defense Council in suing the city. \u201cThe gist of it was that everything was fine.\u201dMs. Jordan said she waited weeks for the Water Department to test the water at her home, which was found to have lead levels of 42.2 parts per billion \u2014 nearly three times the federal action threshold.Residents are left making the best of the situation. Before the city took action, the Natural Resources Defense Council donated filters to community groups for distribution. Rashell Walker took advantage of a giveaway at Paradise Baptist Church after hearing about it from a neighbor in her building.Her apartment has mold, and recently, she said, the water has smelled funky, too. So, she stopped letting her three young children drink it.She did not know if her building\u2019s water has lead, but planned to install the filter anyway.\u201cWe already have mold, we don\u2019t need lead,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re getting sick. Nobody seems to care about us out here.\u201dMs. Grant had used only bottled water for her son\u2019s formula until his most recent checkup, when the doctor said he needed fluoride, which is often added to tap water.So, she started mixing a small amount with the formula.She said that she never received any notification by mail or phone about lead levels in the water, and that it was never mentioned during visits to a health clinic over the past year. After the city announced the filter giveaway, she picked one up.As she kissed the top of her son\u2019s head, Ms. Grant expressed relief that she had not used the tap for long before learning her water might have lead.\u201cLuckily, it was only three weeks,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gamble That Bourbon Can Grow Old Gracefully", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American whiskey usually peaks much earlier than long-aging liquors like Scotch. But Buffalo Trace hopes its new climate-controlled warehouse in Kentucky can change that.FRANKFORT, Ky. \u2014 Bourbon has been on a winning streak for years now. The quintessential American whiskey enjoys a global reputation for quality, with demand outstripping supply and prices steadily rising. But in one arena, it can\u2019t complete with world\u2019s other great whiskeys: age.Most celebrated bourbons made in Kentucky are between four and 12 years old, and many experts, both distillers and critics, believe that\u2019s where the whiskey\u2019s sweet spot lies. Additional time in the cask, given the warm climate and the new charred oak barrels that are required by federal law, usually results in astringent, woody flavors.But consumers are willing to pay big money for older whiskeys, so Buffalo Trace \u2014 producer of a host of renowned bourbons including W.L. Weller and Blanton\u2019s \u2014 is going to try to make them.The company already produces a few well-regarded older bourbons, including the sought-after Pappy Van Winkle, which comes in 20- and 23-year old versions (if you can find them). But Buffalo Trace now has a far more ambitious goal in mind: bourbons aged 35 to 50 years.\u201cConsumers think the older, the better, the more prestigious,\u201d said Mark Brown, chief executive of the Sazerac Company, which owns Buffalo Trace. \u201cWe want to get American whiskey on the same competitive footing as Scotch. As part of that goal, we have to conquer this aging thing. And we can\u2019t get there naturally.\u201dMr. Brown believes he has found a way to harness nature. It is called Warehouse P, and it stands on the Buffalo Trace distillery grounds here in the Kentucky capital. Inside is a second, smaller, temperature-controlled warehouse where the company stores barrels it doesn\u2019t plan to bottle for decades. Some won\u2019t see the light of day until 2068.Few warehouses \u2014 or rickhouses, as they\u2019re also called here \u2014 are climate controlled in bourbon country. Inside Warehouse P, it is always 45 degrees. The room functions like a large meat locker. \u201cIt\u2019s basically refrigeration technology,\u201d said Harlen Wheatley, Buffalo Trace\u2019s master distiller.The idea behind this deep freeze is to slow the aging process, which will theoretically retain more of the whiskey\u2019s fruit flavors while keeping at bay the unpleasant woody notes associated with over-aged bourbon.Whether it will work is another matter. Mr. Brown and Mr. Wheatley admit that they are in terra incognita here.\u201cWe\u2019re taking a giant crapshoot,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cYou are making a barrel today and setting it aside for 35 to 50 years.\u201d To emphasize his point, he slapped his hand against one of the 200 or so barrels stacked inside the room. It contained whiskey distilled in 1993; Mr. Brown calculated that the contents were potentially worth $1.3 million. (The barrels in the warehouse include whiskey Buffalo Trace has distilled in the last two years, and a variety of older stock drafted for the experiment.)If the liquid reacts badly to the unfamiliar, chilly atmosphere, the consequences would be substantial. \u201cWe could shock the hell out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could open this in 12 months time and it could be a total write-off.\u201dTo ward off catastrophe, the distillery plans to check regularly on the liquor\u2019s progress, comparing barrels in Warehouse P with those of similar age in regular rickhouses.Last Drop wanted to expand into American whiskey, but there was a problem. Fifty-year-old bourbons, at least ones that are drinkable, don\u2019t exist.In 2016, Sazerac acquired Last Drop with the intention of not only assisting in finding rare old spirits, but also laying down barrels of newly made bourbon and rye, as well as rum and single malt whiskey, for future releases. (Last Drop remains family run and autonomous.)While Buffalo Trace waits for 2068 to arrive, it must keep the Last Drop pipeline flowing. The first fruit of the collaboration, recently bottled, is a bourbon distilled in 1982 by Buffalo Trace (called George T. Stagg distillery at the time), and then moved after 20 years from barrel to a stainless steel tank. The contents filled only 44 bottles, which sell at $4,000 apiece; 25 are allotted for the United States. Given the long-term nature of the venture, Mr. Wheatley can\u2019t help but muse what the future will bring \u2014 not just for the whiskey, but for the people who, years from now, might buy it. \u201cI hope people will still be drinking whiskey in 50 years,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problem With Fixing WhatsApp? Human Nature Might Get in the Way", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtShould the world worry about WhatsApp? Has it become a virulent new force in global misinformation and political trickery?Or, rather, should the world rejoice about WhatsApp? After all, hasn\u2019t it provided a way for people everywhere to communicate securely with encrypted messages, beyond the reach of government surveillance?These are deep and complicated questions. But the answer to all of them is simple: Yes.WhatsApp said it was working to reduce the spread of misinformation on the service. Critics charge that it is not doing enough \u2014 and there is some merit to their claims. Yet the deeper you dig into the problems, the more intractable they can come to seem, even if the company were moving heaven and earth to fix them.Unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, WhatsApp isn\u2019t a social network. It is mostly a bare-bones texting app in which most conversations are private and unmediated by any kind of algorithm meant to amp up engagement. This design means WhatsApp has little control over what content takes off and what doesn\u2019t; in most cases, the company cannot even see what is happening on WhatsApp, because the service encrypts messages automatically.That means the real problem may be not so much WhatsApp the company or WhatsApp the product but something more fundamental \u2014 WhatsApp the idea.In this light, WhatsApp is a powerful and permanent new reality and its problems aren\u2019t likely to be solved as much as fitfully and sometimes unsatisfyingly managed. For better or worse, we are going to have to learn to live with it.\u201cBut what I learned is that the stories on WhatsApp are common to all the media here,\u201d she said.What sets WhatsApp apart is speed and reach, Ms. C\u00f3rdova said. In Brazil, more than 120 million people use the service, which is offered free as part of mobile internet plans (that is, using WhatsApp does not count against people\u2019s data rate). As it does in its other big markets \u2014 India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and much of Europe \u2014 WhatsApp functions in Brazil as an all-purpose communications tool. It is used for chatting and joking, for trading photos and memes, for news, for political activity and more.Because of that centrality, Ms. C\u00f3rdova argued that the problems on WhatsApp in Brazil were mainly a function of the country\u2019s broken political and media environment.\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t really have public libraries in Brazil,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of sources of what people would consider reliable information \u2014 and the lack of good sources of information reinforces their beliefs when they see something false on WhatsApp or Facebook.\u201dIn the past, people could freely forward a WhatsApp message to anyone. Now they are restricted to forwarding a message to 20 \u201cchats,\u201d distinct conversations with an individual or group of up to 256 people. (There are six people in the average group, WhatsApp said.) In India, WhatsApp has an even more restrictive forwarding limit: five chats.WhatsApp characterized the limits as an experiment. As the company learns more about how the limits affect users\u2019 behavior, a spokeswoman told me, it could introduce additional fine-grain limits.It is precisely WhatsApp\u2019s close-knit sensibility that makes rumors on the service so pernicious. Familiarity on WhatsApp breeds trust, which most of the time is a pretty great social good. But in fast-moving situations with high stakes \u2014 natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks or elections \u2014 trust on WhatsApp is turned on its head, becoming a key force behind viral falsity.Dr. Simon\u2019s study concerned the kidnapping, in the summer of 2014, of three Israeli teenagers who were hitchhiking in the West Bank. The kidnapping led to an enormous Israeli military incursion into the West Bank; the boys were found dead over two weeks later.The Israeli military had instituted a gag order on press reports of the kidnapping, but on WhatsApp, Israelis began circulating stories about \u201csomething\u201d being up. Through careful field research, Dr. Simon collected and sought to identify the source of many rumors that spread on WhatsApp in the earliest hours after the kidnapping.The rumors, Dr. Simon found, had a remarkable amount of detail. Several included the names of the kidnapped boys, which had not been made public. A few offered key facts about the search. And at least one of the rumors seemed deliberately intended to deceive \u2014 it said the boys had been rescued, and that the militants who kidnapped them were killed.Dr. Simon tracked down the rumors to a surprising source: journalists and other civilians who had been briefed on the operation, and who had used WhatsApp to leak details to their families or colleagues in small groups they assumed were private.The rumor that said the boys had been rescued was the most widely circulated. Of the people Dr. Simon interviewed, \u201ctwo shared it only with one family member, two shared it with their WhatsApp family group, one shared it with an I.D.F. officers\u2019 WhatsApp group, one first-responder shared it verbally with his colleagues during his shift and one refused to answer the question,\u201d he wrote, referring to the Israeli Defense Forces by the initials.The story here isn\u2019t of malicious and indiscriminate rumor-mongering, Dr. Simon told me. It is, rather, a story of a few people who trusted other people, who in turn trusted others, each passing along what he or she considered important and necessary information to friends and colleagues.It\u2019s a story of human nature. And that\u2019s why, beyond learning to inhibit our natural tendency to share, it\u2019s hard to know what can be done about false news on WhatsApp \u2014 other than bracing yourself for more.An earlier version of this article misstated WhatsApp\u2019s limits on how many people its users can forward messages to. The limit is 256 \u201cchats,\u201d each one a conversation among up to 256 people, and five chats in India, not 20 people and five people in India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Novel That Roiled India Is Now Translated Into English", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesFor months, he had been hounded by right-wing Hindu groups that had latched onto an old novel of his, \u201cOne Part Woman\u201d (2010), about a religious festival in which childless women were permitted to sleep with men other than their husbands, in the hope of becoming pregnant. There would be no stigma; for one night, all men were to be considered gods, and any child conceived semi-divine. Although Murugan insisted he found evidence of the practice in his home state of Tamil Nadu, fundamentalists organized an efficient campaign accusing him of dishonoring Hindu women. The book was torched in the streets, and there were calls for a ban. Officials coerced an apology from the author, who was eventually forced to flee his village altogether. He became, he said, \u201ca walking corpse.\u201dFor all the commotion it caused, it feels shockingly tame. Set about a century ago, this simple story with a powerful undertow centers on a couple, Kali and Ponna, living in a small farming community in the Kongu region in south India, where Murugan\u2019s books are usually set. Even after 12 years, they remain madly in love and erotically bound up in each other (much to the annoyance of their neighbors). \u201cPonna\u2019s body just dragged him into itself and presented him with whatever he needed,\u201d Kali thinks. \u201cIt even gave, volitionally, what he did not ask for, what he did not even know existed.\u201dBut they cannot have a child. They scan their family history for curses \u2014 was it that ancestor who so barbarously raped a young girl in a forest? Or another one who cheated in a village competition? The couple perform every act of expiation they can imagine, obey every superstition, worship at every shrine. No god seems to hear them. Years pass, and their isolation grows. Neighbors begin to taunt them and won\u2019t accept Ponna\u2019s help in the fields. \u201cThat barren woman ran up and down carrying seeds,\u201d one of them says. \u201cHow do you expect them to grow once she has touched them?\u201d Desperate measures are suggested by the couple\u2019s extended families: Will Kali consider taking another wife? Should Ponna participate in the temple ritual in which childless women sleep with strange men, understood to be deities?Jealousy arrives in their marriage. Sex turns violent and cruel. \u201cSeeking a life, we have pawned our lives,\u201d Ponna says.Murugan\u2019s extensive body of work (10 novels, 10 works of nonfiction, several collections of poetry and short stories) has always been inspired by social issues in his community. \u201cResolve\u201d addresses sex-selective abortions, \u201cPyre\u201d is the story of an intercaste marriage (like Murugan\u2019s own), \u201cThe Misanthropic Bird\u201d is about land and caste.But Murugan works his themes with a light hand; they always emanate from his characters, who are endowed with enough contradiction and mystery to keep from devolving into mouthpieces. Kali, in \u201cOne Part Woman,\u201d is a perfect example. He is a man who makes things grow \u2014 plants and small animals flourish around him. That is, of course, what he tells us. Murugan allows us to see what Kali cannot, how steeped he is in a world where other forms of brutality are common, even banal \u2014 his beloved uncle, for example, secures his right to land by threatening to rape his brothers\u2019 wives, a fact Kali reports to us rather serenely.If terror is bound up in customs, there are glories in the land. Murugan is the son of farmers; he grew up closely with his family\u2019s animals, especially the goats. \u201cI knew their birthing and growing rhythms as my own,\u201d he has said. Trees in the book are described with patience and gravity, treated as characters in their own right. Kali roamed every inch of the forest as a boy \u2014 he feels one with it; only as an adult does he even realize it is a separate entity.It\u2019s not just the physical world Murugan describes so vividly \u2014 the way a cow clears its throat, for example \u2014 but the rural community, a village of 20 huts and a thousand ancient resentments, where there is no privacy and your neighbor\u2019s suffering can serve as your evening\u2019s entertainment: \u201cThere are folks who go out of their way, first thing in the morning, to make sure they have a nice fight to watch.\u201d\u201cFolks\u201d is a bit jarring here, and just one of the tin-eared choices of the translator. At times, Vasudevan capably conveys the distinctiveness not only of Tamil but the language of a farming people \u2014 the insults (Ponna: \u201cLet her come. I will scoop the life out of her!\u201d) and the particular metaphors (Kali is a light sleeper \u2014 \u201chis was a chicken\u2019s sleep\u201d). But too often Vasudevan resorts to bland, anachronistic English clich\u00e9s \u2014 \u201ctesting the waters,\u201d \u201cleaving no stone unturned.\u201d To borrow a (stronger) expression from Murugan himself, it\u2019s like coming across a small stone in rice.To write about men, let alone gods, still seems too risky; the first novel he published after the controversy was the biography of a goat. I\u2019m hoping for a whole shelf of books from this writer, and to see him restored to his former spirit and sense of mission. In the court decision in Murugan\u2019s favor, the judge wrote: \u201cLet the author be resurrected to what he is best at. Write.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking to My Fianc\u00e9 About My New Girlfriend", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveAfter enjoying an open relationship, a couple decides to tie the knot. Just one question: Why must marriage require sexual fidelity for life?This wasn\u2019t the \u201990s when mix tapes were a popular medium for revealing a crush. Even mix CDs had come and gone. If you were going to use someone else\u2019s songwriting to convey your feelings, you did it with a Spotify playlist. I was charmed that Luke liked music and was obstinately analog about it.I had only recently started dating Luke. We were doing that casual, millennial thing that begins on Tinder and spreads into bar dates, sandwiched between bar dates with other people. I tended to be dating three people at a time \u2014 both men and women \u2014 and the life spans of my pseudo-relationships averaged two months or so. I liked it this way. A capital-R relationship seemed too big for my life, a concrete shape I had no room for.But when I listened to Luke\u2019s mix tape, I felt tricked. This was not a casual mix tape. It had folk songs about longing and soul music about feelings. It had \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d and something by Usher.Luke soon revealed himself to be good not only at making mix tapes but also vegetarian lentil stew and weekend travel plans to canoe through Lafayette to find armadillos. We approached and passed the two-month mark before I knew what had hit me.Two years later, we moved from New Orleans to Chicago and rented a one-bedroom apartment. We established a night to have family dinners. We got cats.But I never wanted to give up dating other people, and neither did Luke. In Chicago, we maintained our Tinder accounts and would lie side-by-side in bed swiping right, occasionally showing off our respective matches.Polyamory wasn\u2019t something my parents easily understood. My grandparents told me they felt \u201ctruly worried\u201d for me. But nothing about our arrangement ever felt unusual. Most people I knew in New Orleans were non-monogamous; being 20-something there implied that you kissed strangers at Mardi Gras.Before Luke, I had spent almost a decade building and prioritizing a close platonic friendship with my roommate, and she never minded that I went on dates with other people. Why should it be different with someone I slept with?In Chicago, we each dated only a few people. It\u2019s colder than New Orleans so leaving one\u2019s apartment is less appealing. Sometimes I got jealous; sometimes Luke did. We talked about our jealousy at length and afterward felt closer. Three years into our relationship, we kept dating other people, but we noticed that the jealousy just kind of stopped. In the spring, Luke filled our living room with yellow daisies and we got engaged.The next winter, at a party, I met Kat.She wore a skintight black dress with see-through keyholes on the sides. I couldn\u2019t stop staring. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in real life.She was there with her boyfriend, Brendan, who was visiting from Portland, Oregon, and they were also polyamorous. I liked Kat and I liked her boyfriend; we all exchanged numbers and said we would stay in touch.Months passed. I saw Kat at birthday parties and once at a gay rights rally. Over the summer, we ended up on the same camping trip with mutual friends along the Wisconsin River. At night, we laid on our backs with our shins to the bonfire. I moved close so our arms would touch. She took my hand. We waited for the stars to fall.I have always been scared of dating women. When attracted in the past, I have mostly gone emotionally limp, terrified of rejection. Women just seemed so untouchably beautiful; I was afraid they could see through my foundation-wearing, hair-dying tricks and know instantly that I was not a suitable lover.After the camping trip, when I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Kat, I drafted countless text messages to her that I never sent, until finally Luke told me I should ask her out.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her out?\u201d I said.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not the one who can\u2019t stop talking about her.\u201dI decided I would ask her out by writing her an actual letter and sending it. The letter had a long list of possible dates and times when we might hang out, and I drew cats on the front of it to indicate how whimsical and carefree I was.Three days later, Kat responded that yes, she was interested. I jumped around our apartment as if I had just gotten into my top college.Our first date was in my living room during a rainstorm. I tried on four outfits before settling on something that I decided would make it look like I had not tried on four outfits. I ordered enough Thai food for six, forgetting that on your first date you\u2019re usually too nervous to eat anything. Our conversation blissfully meandered; I tried not to look directly at her because I feared the depth of my crush was written all over my face.Luke got home as our date was winding down. He joined us in the living room for a few minutes before leaving us alone to say the kind of goodbyes that linger a little too long at the beginning of relationships.That night, I lay next to my fianc\u00e9 and told him about the woman I was falling for.People ask me why I\u2019m getting married, considering my open approach to sexual fidelity. It seems that marriage, for most, is a contract where you agree to give up having sex with anyone else for the rest of your life as a sacrifice to someone you love.Which is a beautiful concept that works well for a lot of people \u2014 approximately 50 percent of the couples that try it. But for me, commitment has little to do with physical intimacy.I\u2019m getting married because I want to promise, in front of my friends and family, that I am going to love Luke forever. I want to assure him that if he can\u2019t pay his rent, or when someone he loves gets sick, or if his car breaks down in an ice storm and he\u2019s stranded on the highway, that he can call me and I\u2019ll be there for him no matter what.I want to keep our family dinners going indefinitely. I want to co-parent our cats. More than anything, I want Luke to know that I will tell him the truth, and that when the truth is painful I will stop what I\u2019m doing and tend to him until he feels better.But I am not going to promise him that our love won\u2019t change, and neither will he promise that to me. The fact that love absolutely will change is one of my favorite things about love. Rather, as the love changes, I hope Luke and I will be able to hold each other with compassion; that we will stay curious and empathetic.One night, after a December evening out, Kat walked me to the train station. Under the overpass, she pulled me toward her and kissed me in a small, sweet way that threw my stomach into knots. Our glasses fogged; we both wore gloves so thick we couldn\u2019t feel each other\u2019s hands. It was one of those fleeting rom-com moments you want to hang onto.Talking with the love of my life about falling for Kat has been an incredible gift. Luke pets my hair and lets me wax poetic in a way that most of my friends can only tolerate for so long. And it goes both ways; I root for him when he goes on dates. Kat says she talks to her boyfriend about me, too.Right before Christmas, Luke and I went to Portland (my family lives there; we always head over for the holidays) and met up with Kat and Brendan. We all went on a date together. After it was over, Luke and I lay awake in my childhood bed, laughing about how sweet and strange and beautiful our lives were turning out.I know not everyone wants to love this way. I understand fear of loss, and I understand wanting to hold something still when it\u2019s good. Ultimately, this particular shape makes sense to me: love as a blob that can\u2019t be pinned down, as something alive, an animal that ventures from person to person but finds places to call home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Muscadet, Look Beyond the Obvious", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesThe melon de Bourgogne grape is often described as neutral, as its aromas and flavors are reticent. But it is most expressive in the realm of texture.It says something of a grape\u2019s character that what is most obvious about it is what is missing. Take the grape of Muscadet \u2014 melon de Bourgogne \u2014 as a prime example.Melon de Bourgogne is sometimes referred to condescendingly as a \u201cneutral grape.\u201dYet the melon grape\u2019s strength lies in its subtlety. It offers numerous qualities to which consumers, conditioned to judge wines by a grocery list of aromas and flavors, may not be attuned.These qualities \u2014 primarily texture, resonance (which is related to texture) and a stony flavor sensation that comes under the general term of minerality \u2014 are prerequisites for the greatest white wines in the world. Yet the absence of the more obvious attributes (flamboyant aromas and flavors) often cause Muscadet to be underestimated.History is partly to blame. As the name melon de Bourgogne suggests, the grape\u2019s origin was in eastern France, and it was common in a region once known as Franche-Comt\u00e9, which included parts of Burgundy and the Jura.The melon found a more welcoming home in the Pays de Nantais, the region around the city of Nantes on the Atlantic mouth of the Loire. From there, the wine developed into modern Muscadet.Though Muscadet is typically thought to be made for drinking young, with little to recommend it beyond a bracing freshness, wines from these producers have shown that it has far more going for it: that it is delicious when young, but can also age and evolve. It\u2019s especially enjoyable to consumers who can look beyond the obvious and tune in to its subtleties.The 2017 vintage had only recently begun to arrive on shelves when we held our tasting in mid-September. Since we buy all of our wines for our blind tastings at retail venues, this meant that we had access generally to the more straightforward cuv\u00e9es, but not to the more ambitious bottles to which producers want to devote additional aging.This did not deter us, as our aim was to taste a cross-section of wines to gain a sense of the vintage and the state of Muscadet, rather than offer a complete description of the entire production.The \u201917 vintage, like the 2016, was harmed by early frost. Though it was smaller than usual, the wines in general were excellent.\u201cThese were balanced, persistent, fresh and pleasing,\u201d Charles said. Marie said the rise in general quality was apparent. Still, as Florence said, \u201cMuscadet is a hard sell,\u201d referring to the public perception of Muscadet as a wine without a lot to offer.The texture and stony flavors resound, echoing back and forth, leaving lasting impressions long after the sip is gone. Aromas and flavors make themselves felt as well: lemon, lime, anise and other herbs, occasionally a chamomile or saline sensation. They are easier to describe than texture and resonance, for which words are difficult.Many Muscadets, including nine of our top 10, carry the notation \u201csur lie,\u201d meaning the wine was aged on the lees for a period ranging from fermentation until at least the following March but no longer than the following November. But some producers prefer to age their wines on the lees even longer, so don\u2019t use the notation, and some simply choose not to use it even if they do qualify.Our No. 2 wine was the rich and textured Domaine du Fief aux Dames, while at No. 3 was the fresh, minerally La P\u00e9pie from Domaine de la P\u00e9pi\u00e8re, one of the best Muscadet producers. La P\u00e9pie is an accessible bottle, delicious now, while the more structured Pepi\u00e8re cuv\u00e9es, like Briords, are at their best with a little more aging.Next came the savory, stony Domaine de la Bregeonnette from St\u00e9phane Orieux. We called this our best value at $13, but really, all of these wines are great values. Only two of our top 10 cost $20, and seven of them were $15 or under.Also well worth trying are the structured, deep La Louvetrie from Jo Landron; the lively, balanced Domaine Haute F\u00e9vrie from S\u00e9bastien Branger; the earthy yet delicate Domaine du Haut Bourg; and the subtle, deep Domaine de Bellevue from J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bretaudeau.The vast majority of the bottles in the United States come from the Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine appellation, but one bottle, the Haut Bourg, came from the rarely seen Muscadet C\u00f4tes de Grandlieu area south of Nante and closer to the Atlantic.Several top Muscadet producers were not in our tasting, like Andr\u00e9-Michel Br\u00e9geon, Domaine de l\u2019\u00c9cu, Pierre Luneau-Papin and Vincent Caill\u00e9. They are well worth seeking out.I realize that I\u2019ve gotten this far and have not even mentioned how transparent Muscadet can be in expressing differences in terroir. Many of the best producers, like \u00c9cu, Landron and P\u00e9piere, have long offered multiple cuv\u00e9es dedicated to the varied and complex geology of the region.It\u2019s great fun to compare and contrast. You can taste the difference between the softer, rounder wines grown on gneiss or amphibolite soils; sense the firmer minerality of a wine from orthogneiss; and feel the greater complexity, at least in my opinion, of the wines from granite and gabbro, a black, particularly hard form of granite.Try it yourself. At Muscadet prices, it\u2019s a party in the making.Tangy and energetic, with tightly wound acidity, herbal and citrus flavors, and the potential to age.

But those who live in Muscadet country around Nantes in Western France insist that their wine is more versatile than a mere raw-bar quaff. Other dishes Muscadet might accompany came to mind when I dined at Huertas, a Spanish restaurant with a Basque accent in the East Village. There we drank crisply refreshing txakoli, a white wine from Northern Spain, with everything we ordered, including mushrooms and chorizo. It set the stage for Muscadet. When the new cookbook from Huertas arrived on my desk, I looked for a suitable recipe to serve with the French white and came up with this paella-like dish of mushrooms and rice. It was an attractive fit, especially with its creamy aioli sauce and tangy finish. Though best served immediately, the rice can be loosely covered with foil to await a reheat. It\u2019s substantial enough to anchor a meal, though the owners of Huertas, Jonah Miller and Nate Adler, who wrote the cookbook, consider it a side dish. If you agree, serve it with grilled chicken, fish or sausages. FLORENCE FABRICANTAdvertisement"}

There are many ways to dig around for clues about such things \u2014 and this week we explored a few of them.Sometimes you get out in the streets... Their views on when government should intervene and when it should not are by no means universal, but the debate raises interesting questions about the way a local issue can feed into a sense of national and international identity.Does Sydney want to be a big global city like New York or Hong Kong where anything goes (at least in some places) and officialdom reacts to trouble as it emerges? Or does it want to prioritize prevention, safety and perhaps the calmer quality of life found in smaller cities?Sometimes you talk to officials...When I asked Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, what he thought Australians wanted their country to be in an interview this week, he had a quick answer: \u201cAustralians don\u2019t know what they want.\u201dHe argued that the country should embrace the status of becoming \u201ca creative middle power,\u201d meaning that it should aim to grow its population to around 50 million, and begin to see itself in the same category as the United Kingdom and France.\u201cThat brings responsibilities,\u201d he said.Would a Labor government become more externally focused? Is the country becoming more willing to play a larger role?Mr. Rudd mostly demurred, choosing instead to explain that Australia\u2019s national psyche was still wrapped up in a history defined by distance and reliable alliances with major powers \u2014 first Britain, then the United States.Breaking away from that position, even when the United States is becoming more unpredictable, is still a major challenge.\u201cAustralians don\u2019t take themselves seriously as a regional and global power,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t think anyone else would.\u201dSometimes you ask New York Times readers...Here\u2019s one thing we do know: Australians are extremely proud of their compulsory voting system and want the world to know about it.But I figured I\u2019d add a couplemore worthwhile responses from Australian readers about the compulsory voting system that didn\u2019t fit into the article.\u201cI don\u2019t see how a democracy can work without it. It is a good, good thing for our country. It gives us a sense of belonging and purpose. We all have to think about it, at least for that day.\u201d\u2014 Diane Smith\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. The compulsion is minor, but the effects of this policy are huge. Look at when our elections take place \u2014 on Saturdays, ensuring EVERYONE can vote. Look at where the voting booths are \u2014 neighbourhood schools, gyms, places where the most people can go. And look at the sense of community when we vote. We turn up, chat to locals, buy fundraising sausages in bread and home made jams (they\u2019re known as democracy sausages). And we all vote.\u201d\u2014 Stuart PageAustralians often talk about not wanting to self-promote or even celebrate their own accomplishments, but clearly there are areas where confidence comes easily and is well-deserved.As the country moves closer to a federal election, there will be more signals pointing to Australia\u2019s urges and mood \u2014 the vibe, as fans of \u201cThe Castle\u201d would say \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to try and put what\u2019s happening into context.Now here are a few other stories from The Times that you shouldn\u2019t miss, along with a recommendation.______Maybe it\u2019s also time for us to do something similar or more ambitious for cities in Australia.

{"Headline": "Hidden Stories of Chinese Migration and Culture Found in Giant Genetic Study", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesScientists reported an assortment of findings resulting from a sweeping and novel analysis of data from the prenatal tests of 141,431 participants.Lamb stew, hearty and fragrant, cooked until meat falls off the bone and served alongside thick, chewy noodles \u2014 this is the type of food that cuts through northern China\u2019s winter chill.Further south, warmer climates support more crops. Fresh, stir-fried greens might accompany dim sum in Guangdong or punctuate a spicy meal in Sichuan. Lychee, durian and other fruits ripen the air.The approach \u2014 a novel one using data from prenatal blood tests \u2014 came with a trade-off. Though researchers were able to cheaply sequence a large number of genomes, they had access to a small fraction of each person\u2019s genome, much less than what genome-wide studies typically look at.Nevertheless, the study suggests that simple clinical tests can be an effective resource for surveying the genetics of large populations and generating hypotheses for study, said Ekta Khurana, an assistant professor of computational genomics at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York who was not involved in the research.\u201cThis can be expanded to include not just mothers, but all different people,\u201d she said.The data set, which represented nearly every Chinese province and 37 out of 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, eclipsed many genome-wide studies, which often include only thousands, or tens of thousands, of participants.But the team\u2019s analysis covered a mere 10 percent or less of each person\u2019s genome, while most rigorous genome-wide studies cover 80 percent or more, said Anders Albrechtsen, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the study.To overcome this, the researchers relied on heavy computation and statistics, designing custom software that could infer missing DNA. They reported many preliminary but interesting insights.For instance, the Han \u2014 comprising 92 percent of China\u2019s population \u2014 were quite genetically homogeneous, mostly differing between the North and South.This likely reflects governmental policies and job opportunities since 1949, which have largely driven migration eastward or westward, said Siyang Liu, a senior research scientist at BGI and lead author of the paper.Minority ethnic groups showed more genetic divergence than the Han, particularly Uyghurs and Kazakhs in Xinjiang and Mongols in Inner Mongolia.This is noteworthy because sequencing studies are rarely done on ethnic minorities, even though findings can have important medical implications, said Charleston Chiang, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine who was not involved in the research.Last, to show that noninvasive pregnancy testing data can reveal associations between genes and specific traits, the scientists analyzed height and body mass index across their sample, finding 48 gene variants associated with height and 13 with body mass index. They also reported gene variants associated with maternal age and the likelihood of having twins.Some of these associations had been reported in previous studies with Europeans, but the team also discovered new links, which underscores the importance of doing research in non-European populations, Dr. Jin said.This study served as proof-of-concept, he added. His team is moving forward on evaluating prenatal testing data from more than 3.5 million Chinese people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018False Flag\u2019 Theory on Pipe Bombs Zooms From Right-Wing Fringe to Mainstream", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftJust hours after the news broke this week that explosive devices had been sent to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, a conspiracy theory began to take shape in certain corners of conservative media.The bombs, this theory went, were not actually part of a plot to harm Democrats, but were a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation concocted by leftists in order to paint conservatives as violent radicals ahead of the elections next month.Conspiratorial thinking has always been with us \u2014 the grassy knoll, the moon landing, the Freemasons. But it has been turbocharged in the Trump era, as cable news networks and pliant social media networks allow hastily assembled theories to spread to millions in an instant. Often, by the time the official, evidence-based explanation has taken shape, it has already been drowned out by a megaphonic chorus of cranks and attention-hungry partisans.\u201cThe process by which something gets called a false flag has accelerated,\u201d said Anna Merlan, the author of \u201cRepublic of Lies,\u201d a coming book about conspiracy theories. \u201cPeople who make a living conspiracy-peddling are in an arms race with each other, so there\u2019s a rush to stake out that territory and start spinning their narratives about what happened.\u201dWithin hours of the first bomb\u2019s discovery, conservative media figures were openly speculating about the true motives behind the campaign. Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage and other high-profile commentators flocked to an alternative narrative that could explain the targeted threats to top Democrats without blaming those Democrats\u2019 political opponents.Historically, \u201cfalse flag\u201d conspiracy theories \u2014 named for a naval maneuver in which a ship flies a different country\u2019s flag in order to trick enemies into retreating or to facilitate an escape \u2014 have remained on the edges of American discourse. Alex Jones, the conspiracy-theory-loving Infowars founder, was labeled a crank and worse for theorizing that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were an \u201cinside job,\u201d and suggesting that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was an elaborate hoax concocted in order to promote gun control.But his spirit lives on in the larger universe of pro-Trump media, which has fused the conspiratorial grandeur of Infowars with an unshakable faith in Mr. Trump\u2019s righteousness. Conspiracy theorists who might once have resorted to handing out subway pamphlets and shouting from street corners have found hungry, durable audiences on cable news shows and social networks. And false flag philosophy \u2014 the idea that powerful groups stage threats and tragic events to advance their agendas \u2014 is now a bizarrely common element of national news stories.\u201cThe reason we\u2019re seeing more false flag narratives is not that there are necessarily more of them, but that they\u2019re more visible,\u201d Ms. Merlan said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier for a casual news consumer to see them on Twitter.\u201dConspiracy theories most often rise around fast-moving news events, like mass shootings and bomb threats, in which fuzzy initial reports often give way to more accurate explanations later on. And sometimes, those questioning the most apparent motives turn out to be justified.There are structural reasons for the conspiracy theory boom. Social media platforms like YouTube, Reddit and Facebook have allowed fringe thinkers to bypass traditional gatekeepers and reach millions of people directly. In addition, the dominance of Fox News and other partisan media outlets has created a flourishing market for conspiracy-driven outrage. And a polarized electorate has eagerly lapped up explanations for major news events that conform to their views.The desire for politically convenient explanations is not contained to the right. Soon after the bombs were reported, and before key facts about them were known, liberals on Twitter adopted the term \u201cMAGAbomb\u201d to describe the campaign, referring both to the explosive devices and to Mr. Trump\u2019s signature rallying cry.\u201cWe have a president who pushes these ideas because he built a coalition that believes in conspiracy theories,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. \u201cHe has to continue pushing these ideas to keep his people motivated.\u201dConspiracy theories are not false news, exactly. They often rely on a speck of doubt, or a gap in the evidentiary trail, to make a bold claim, even if they ignore some of the other available proof. But they do travel over the same networks, and stand out from more accurate \u2014 if predictable \u2014 stories in much the same way.The real solution, of course, is likely to be cultural, rather than technological. A White House occupied by a conspiracist-in-chief is not likely to do much to quell the spread of implausible narratives, nor is a conservative media apparatus that profits from the popularity of these theories. As long as Mr. Trump is in office, conspiracy theorists will continue to raise the specter of false flags, and some in power will feel empowered to take them seriously.\u201cIf we had President Jeb Bush, we wouldn\u2019t be wondering if he believed these theories,\u201d Mr. Uscinski said.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.While Ms. Haley might not have gotten confused herself, she could at times present a confusing picture. She could talk as bluntly as the president himself about the failings of the United Nations system, and yet, more quietly, she proved a practitioner of multilateral diplomacy. While Mr. Trump\u2019s America First policy is a harsh rejection of multilateralism, many United Nations diplomats valued Ms. Haley as a pragmatic envoy who could explain the president to a world confused by the chaos in Washington. She also developed a good relationship with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, and helped avoid what could have been a breakdown between the United States and the United Nations.Ms. Haley quickly positioned herself as the equal of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Because of his tentative demeanor and rare public appearances, Mr. Tillerson essentially ceded his role as America\u2019s leading foreign policy voice to Ms. Haley.Once Mike Pompeo replaced Mr. Tillerson and John Bolton, a former United Nations envoy who detests the organization, became White House national security adviser, they asserted more influence. There have been conflicts reported between Ms. Haley and Mr. Bolton, in particular. Ms. Haley has navigated the political shoals of the Trump administration better than many of her colleagues, escaping the demeaning tweets the president meted out when his appointees broke ranks, as she sometimes did. And while the president was angered by her announcement about sensible sanctions over the use of chemical weapons by Russia\u2019s ally Syria, it turned out she was describing a decision that had been changed without anyone telling her.

{"Headline": "Mail Bombs and Other Threats Have the Wealthy Cranking Up Security", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent years, the unpredictability of terrorizing events has kept Americans on alert, wary of threats to their safety and well-being.Specific threats and a general sense of anxiety, security experts say, are causing more people to seek the services of private security firms; some are hiring bodyguards and drivers trained to protect them in case of peril.At Pinkerton, a private security and detective agency founded in 1850, requests for executive security have increased 20 to 30 percent annually over the last five years, said its vice chairman, Tim Williams. And people are looking for safeguards in all areas of their lives that pose risks, experts say, including information technology and social media.\u201cPeople are scared right now,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Kidnapping and terrorism are rare in the United States, and only the wealthiest Americans can afford to hire full-time protection. But because of a strong stock market and generous tax cuts, the universe of billionaires (and millionaires, for that matter) is expanding.\u201cMore people are able to afford this,\u201d said Tim Horner, a former captain in the New York Police Department who is now a senior managing director at Kroll, a private security firm. \u201cClearly, the perceived risk and real threat level has increased.\u201dAccording to Mr. Williams, a trained driver can cost from $2,000 to $10,000 a day, which may include an armored car, countersurveillance and armed guards. A full-time bodyguard from a well-established firm costs between $150,000 and $300,000 per year, said other industry executives.Employing a security detail does not guarantee safety, particularly for celebrities who make their whereabouts publicly known. Mr. Horner advises wealthy clients to limit their exposure on social media.\u201cIf you have a big profile, then you need to manage it and be careful what information gets out,\u201d he said.Many requests that security firms are getting from their wealthy clients are driven by threats that have already been made, but others are from general anxiety about what is in the news. \u201cOne of the problems with security is perception,\u201d said Christopher Falkenberg, president of Insite Risk Management and a former Secret Service officer. \u201cPeople focus on what is sexy now.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat people are concerned about is disruption.\u201dRobert Dodge, who oversees corporate risk services at security firm G4S, said he had seen an increase in mail screening among Silicon Valley\u2019s technorati even before the recent pipe bomb threats. He said some wealthy individuals have converted a discreet area on their property into a command center, where bodyguards in plainclothes keep watch. Some of the guards carry weapons.\u201cAs world events get more traumatic,\u201d he said, \u201creality is going to meet perception, and you are going to see even more people hiring security.\u201dSo what are nonmillionaires to do so they can feel safe? There are a variety of technological advances: apps to track travelers when they are abroad, and home security systems that can be monitored online. And a trend among corporations, experts said, is training employees how to respond if there is an active shooter or other threat at the office.\u201cThat same training can be used at home,\u201d Mr. Dodge said.But perhaps the best approach, he said, is to be vigilant and aware of one\u2019s surroundings. \u201cPut away your smartphone,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Among them were the page Right Wing News and left-wing outfits like Reverb Press.Facebook said this amounted to the most domestic pages and accounts it had ever removed related to influence campaigns. The company said it had discovered the activity as part of its broader effort to root out election interference. Also, the pages had become more aggressive in using tactics like fake accounts and multiple pages to make themselves appear more popular.Facebook said that the removed content violated its rules about online spam, and that it was likely making money for its publishers via ads. \u201cToday, sensational political content seems to be a more effective way for people to build an audience for their pages and drive traffic to their websites, which earn them money for every visitor to the site,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of security.A weaker renminbi has made Chinese goods more attractive despite the tariffs. But the surge may have been spurred by a rush of shipments from China before a wave of tariffs went into effect on Sept. 24.

The head of the S.E.C. says that\u2019s not likely, at least not anytime soon.But he added that he understands the concern: \u201cThe president did touch on a nerve, which is: Are people running their companies too much for the short term in response to pressures?\u201dThe U.S. economy is riding high.

And falling currencies may feed trade tensions. This week Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, warned China against \u201ccompetitive devaluations.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s belief in the harm caused by trade deficits is mistaken when growth is strong. But when demand is short, protectionism is a more tempting way to stimulate the economy.\u2022 Britain would remain in a temporary customs union with the E.U. with no agreed end date\u2022 Northern Ireland would remain part of the E.U.\u2019s single market for a transition period, avoiding a hard trade barrier in the middle of the Irish landmass.Several Conservative Party ministers are said to have concerns about the customs union proposal.

It\u2019s about justices who do not represent the will of the majority.Mr. Tomasky is editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas and a contributing opinion writer.Test your Supreme Court knowledge: In the entire history of the court, exactly one justice has been Who was it?If you\u2019re like me, your mind started leapfrogging back to the 19th century. After all, this sounds like one of those oddities that was far more likely to have happened when our democracy was still in formation.So let\u2019s see \u2026 John Quincy Adams lost the popular vote in 1824. Someone he named to the Court? Or Rutherford B. Hayes \u2014 lost to Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, then was named president by a rigged commission. Maybe him?It\u2019s neither of those.Then perhaps it\u2019s a trick question? George W. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000. Good try, but he didn\u2019t name a court nominee until his second term, when he won the popular vote.No \u2014 it turns out you don\u2019t have to go back very far at all. The answer is Neil Gorsuch.And consider this further point. Two more current members of the dominant conservative bloc, while nominated by presidents who did win the popular vote, were confirmed by senators who collectively won fewer popular votes than the senators who voted against them.They are Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed in 1991 by 52 senators who won just 48 percent of the popular vote, and Samuel Alito, confirmed in 2006 by 58 senators who garnered, again, 48 percent of the vote.If you believe Christine Blasey Ford over Judge Kavanaugh, and if you believed Anita Hill in 1991, you are understandably enraged over the fact that we are about to have two Supreme Court justices who made it to the bench under broad suspicion that they did so having lied about their sexual histories and their treatment of women.But I implore you to take a moment to be angry about all this, too. This is a severe legitimacy crisis for the Supreme Court.The court, as Professor McMahon notes, was intended never to stray far from the mainstream of American political life. The fact that justices represented that mainstream and were normally confirmed by lopsided votes gave the court\u2019s decisions their legitimacy. It\u2019s also why past chief justices worked to avoid 5-4 decisions on controversial matters: They wanted Americans to see that the court was unified when it laid down a major new precedent.But now, in an age of 5-4 partisan decisions, we\u2019re on the verge of having a five-member majority who figure to radically rewrite our nation\u2019s laws. And four of them will have been narrowly approved by senators representing minority will.How has this happened? Conservatives would look at the numbers I\u2019ve presented and say: \u201cLook, this shows that our side is more reasonable than the other side. Republicans vote for nominees they don\u2019t like in greater numbers than Democrats do. We\u2019re the civil ones.\u201dThe real explanation, of course, is quite different. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did not nominate jurists who had left paper trails of judicial extremism or dropped other hints that their jurisprudence would be radical.Republican presidents have. None more so than Mr. Trump, who seems to have outsourced the judicial-selection process to right-wing groups like the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and twice nominated judges with an eye cast largely toward how happy they would make conservative evangelicals.And so Republicans are doing to the Supreme Court what they have already accomplished in Congress. There, through aggressive gerrymandering, they\u2019ve muscled their way to a majority even as their candidates have sometimes received collectively fewer votes than Democrats. And now they\u2019re doing it to the court, by breaking the rules (Merrick Garland) and advancing nominees who are confirmed by legislators representing minority support.Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s alleged youthful behavior is a scandal, but this legitimacy crisis is one too, and with arguably greater consequences. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, may not care about them. But Chief Justice John Roberts, and for that matter Brett Kavanaugh, surely should.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Investors Shunned Juul, but Back Other Nicotine Start-Ups", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s investors have put their money in plenty of ethically dubious companies, including those that make addictive apps, surveillance technology or services that knowingly exploit legal gray areas.But an unusual thing happened when Juul, an electronic cigarette maker that has been widely criticized for marketing its products to teenagers, set out to raise more than $1 billion over the summer: Investors appeared to draw a moral line in the sand.Numerous prominent venture capitalists publicly criticized the company and its investors, a rarity in their cozy world. David Burke, chief executive of Makena Capital Management, posted an angry screed on his Facebook page. Om Malik, a partner with True Ventures, accused Juul\u2019s investors of \u201cpure greed\u201d in a blog post. Bradley Tusk, head of Tusk Ventures, a venture firm that specializes in regulatory challenges, said of the company, \u201cIt\u2019s just pretty odious.\u201dBut while Silicon Valley investors have shunned Juul, which is now under a federal investigation for its advertising practices, they have signed checks to other nicotine start-ups. Those include Lucy, a nicotine gum company, and Ro, a so-called cloud pharmacy company that sells nicotine gum as part of smoking cessation kits.The willingness to back some nicotine start-ups while condemning others illustrates the delicate ethical dance that investors are trying to perform. As technology \u2014 and Silicon Valley influence \u2014 spreads to every aspect of people\u2019s lives, investors must decide which technologies will help and which will cause more harm than good. They want to avoid sending an innocent-seeming check to a company that sets off outrage once it becomes large and powerful.The trick to getting Silicon Valley money for so-called \u201cvice\u201d products seems to be positioning them as health and wellness products, and getting investors to believe it. It has worked for Lucy and Ro, as well as for numerous cannabis companies.Jeremy Levine, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said his firm quickly dismissed the idea of investing in nicotine and vaping companies, but spent more time debating whether it should invest in cannabis-related companies.\u201cFor something like Juul, there is an opportunity to make lots and lots of money, but to what end?\u201d he said.Juul, which is based in San Francisco, easily raised the amount of money it was looking for: $1.25 billion, giving it a valuation of $16 billion. Silicon Valley venture firms avoided investing, or if they did invest, they kept it a secret. Instead, Juul received investments from hedge funds and mutual funds, like Fidelity Investments; Tao Capital, the investment arm of Nicholas Pritzker; and Tiger Global, a hedge fund.Matt David, head of communications at Juul, said the company\u2019s mission was to eliminate combustible cigarettes and noted that more than 50 percent of smokers who try Juul successfully switch to e-cigarettes.Mr. David said Juul had taken numerous actions to prevent and combat underage use of its product. It has changed its website and marketing to focus on smoking cessation, added a nicotine warning label and started an advertising campaign aimed at smokers. Tao Capital did not respond to a request for comment. Both Fidelity Investments and Tiger Global declined to comment.Lucy Nicotine, a nicotine gum start-up, generated investor attention in March, when it participated in Y Combinator, a start-up accelerator program, because two of its founders were well-known for their prior start-up, Soylent, a meal replacement drink. Lucy raised just under $5 million in venture funding led by Greycroft Partners and Refactor Capital.In early meetings with potential investors, the company\u2019s presentation included a slide outlining the benefits of nicotine, like energy and alertness. But the company quickly stopped promoting that aspect.Teddy Citrin, an investor at Greycroft Partners, said his firm was initially concerned about stigma and taboo of investing in a nicotine company, but was won over by the potential to help people quit smoking.\u201cSpending more time thinking about how many people die from smoking got us comfortable there,\u201d Mr. Citrin said.Lucy created a new formulation of nicotine gum, meant to be an improvement on the texture and taste of existing options like Nicorette. The gums come in mint and fruit flavors (the latter has \u201chints of pomegranate, berry and strawberry\u201d). The company\u2019s website features bright colors, pictures of young customers smiling, and a monthly subscription option.Despite its hip branding and fun flavors, David Renteln, the chief executive of Lucy, said he did not anticipate the company facing the same teenage adoption issues as Juul. Nicotine gum does not deliver the intense hit of nicotine that inhaling a vape pen does, so it produces less of a euphoric effect, he said.Mr. Citrin said that Lucy\u2019s founders were \u201cvery cognizant\u201d of the potential cool factor of the product among young people.\u201cThere\u2019s a balance between being ashamed to go into a drugstore and buy something that looks like you\u2019re an addict, versus something that you don\u2019t have to feel bad about, but is substantively helping you compared to what you were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of balance they\u2019re trying to strike.\u201dRo, a start-up that initially focused on selling generic drugs for erectile dysfunction, announced in September that it would begin selling a \u201cQuit Kit\u201d for smokers that includes nicotine gum. So far, the company has avoided some of the colorful marketing used by Lucy and formerly used by Juul \u2014 the kits come in black boxes and the product\u2019s name is Zero.The company raised $88 million in venture funding from venture capital firms, including FirstMark Capital for the expansion.Not all investors who declined to invest in nicotine start-ups did so because of ethical issues. Some passed because they didn\u2019t believe the market was large enough.In recent interviews with 40 venture capitalists, only two could identify someone among their peers who smoked, and the stigma was so intense that none was willing to speak publicly about it.Some of those same investors, though, were open-minded about investing in start-ups focused on cannabis, which is now legal in California for recreational use. Many companies are positioning marijuana and CBD, a related compound that does not have psychoactive effect, as a wellness product for relaxation, anxiety relief, and even post-workout recovery. Cannabis start-ups have raised $1.1 billion in funding so far this year, nearly double last year\u2019s total, according to CB Insights.Tusk Ventures, which opted out of working with vaping companies, invested in Eaze, a cannabis delivery start-up, for example. Mr. Tusk said he views cannabis-related tech as different from vaping start-ups, which he believes have purposely targeted young users.Saar Gur, an investor at Charles River Ventures, said he is spending time evaluating CBD companies because he believes the products have clinical benefits.He isn\u2019t interested in nicotine, he said, because \u201cthe problem they\u2019re solving is not inspirational enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s description of an event during which officials seized documents from Juul\u2019s office. It was a surprise inspection, not a surprise raid.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mishra is the author, most recently, of \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present.\u201dThe following year, The Atlantic Monthly hailed the shah as \u201can articulate and positive force,\u201d summing up the tone of the American press coverage of a ruthless usurper decades before politicians, investors and journalists in the United States began to praise another oil-rich potentate and American ally: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who now stands accused of unspeakable crimes including the murder and dismemberment with a bone saw of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Why do Western elites succumb again and again to this fantasy of a youthful reformer and top-down modernizer in the East?Doubtless, quasi-Westernized men and women from the exotic Orient flatter white self-images. These silver-tongued inheritors of wealth and power appear reassuringly familiar \u2014 suavely cosmopolitan folks who are au fait with the codes of bourgeois liberalism, unlike coarse nativists like Iran\u2019s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.The confident and courageous Westernizer was also the role that Syria\u2019s British-educated president, Bashar al-Assad, and his British-born wife Asma, were initially allotted in the Western press. The singer Sting as well as Secretary of State John Kerry socialized with Syria\u2019s glamorous first couple in Damascus. Just as the Arab Spring got underway in 2011, Vogue published a fawning profile of Ms. Assad, describing her as \u201cthe very freshest and most magnetic of first ladies.\u201dStrategic concerns, of course, also weigh on minds enchanted by the magnetic princes and princesses of the East. For many Beltway pundits as well as for President Trump, Prince Mohammed\u2019s loathing of Iran and tenderness for Israel override all other considerations. It is also true that oil needs to keep flowing in free markets, and, as with the Shah of Iran, there is much money to be made from selling things to the prince that his country doesn\u2019t need.As Sanjay\u2019s mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, suspended fundamental rights, more than six million men were sterilized in India in a year. Visiting a terrorized India in 1976, the World Bank\u2019s president, Robert McNamara, hailed the Gandhis\u2019 \u201cdisciplined, realistic approach\u201d and the general junking of \u201csocialist ideologies.\u201dAccordingly, successive American presidents have waged lawless wars in the East; poring over \u201ckill lists,\u201d they have ordered extrajudicial executions by drones. More recently, one of the region\u2019s richest countries, Saudi Arabia, has tried to starve near-destitute Yemen into submission, with the help of a cutting-edge arsenal supplied by some of the world\u2019s leading liberal democracies.Many fans of Prince Mohammed in the West are now scrambling to disavow him. But he cannot be so easily distinguished from his groupies in the American establishment. The prince is only the latest, if pitifully crude, exponent of shock-and-awe savagery that many Western elites have long deemed vital to the pacification of intransigent non-Westerners. And there is nothing exceptional, in the extensive moral squalor created by them abroad and deepened now by President Trump at home, about Prince Mohammed\u2019s own apparent response to a mild critic: exterminate the brute and mutilate his corpse.Pankaj Mishra is the author, most recently, of \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s as simple as that.Contributing Opinion Writer We know that outrage has a minimal shelf life in the Trump era. Our president can give despots a license to kill, claim that climate change is going to magically reverse itself, make up nonexistent riots \u2014 and it all passes in a blur.So it was last week, when the Mendacity Machine rolled into Montana for a rally on behalf of two of the least likable politicians in the Rocky Mountains. Trump praised one of those pols, Representative Greg Gianforte, a man with nouveau Gilded Age wealth and attitude to go with it, for committing criminal assault.But while the presidential thug plug dominated the news, a quieter, more telling campaign has been unfolding under the Big Sky \u2014 one that returns Democrats to a role as defender of average working people. Kathleen Williams, who has been crisscrossing Montana in her camper with her dog, is poised to knock off Gianforte with an old-fashioned campaign that should be a model for Dems mired in media-driven sideshows.Democrats used to be known for love of the Little Guy. Franklin Roosevelt won Texas, Oklahoma and Montana \u2014 for that matter, most of what is now Red State America \u2014 through four elections, while campaigning on behalf of \u201cthe forgotten man.\u201d This dandy from a Hudson River Valley estate connected words to a political revolution that changed millions of lives for the better.After attending the Democratic National Convention two years ago, Kellyanne Conway offered this summary of what she heard: \u201cTheir message is Donald Trump is bad, and we\u2019re not Donald Trump. The rest of the message was race, gender, L.G.B.T.\u201dA winning strategy is to go directly to the self-interest of a majority that is being hurt by Republican policies. The two biggest political thrusts of the Party of Trump \u2014 a tax cut for the rich that opened a tsunami of debt, and trying to take away health care from millions \u2014 are widely unpopular. This election should be no more complicated than that.That\u2019s exactly what Williams, who says she will not support Nancy Pelosi as House party leader, has figured out. While still a teenager, she lost her mother. And she later lost her husband, a Vietnam veteran, to early death as well. That gave her a sense of how life can throw a random punch to the gut.\u201cThe millionaires have lots of people helping them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because we need someone who will fight for us.\u201d In a state that Trump won by 20 points, she\u2019s polling about even with Gianforte.\u201cNot to be too dramatic about it, but Kathleen Williams is the congressional candidate Montana has been waiting for,\u201d wrote the Missoulian newspaper in a recent editorial endorsement.Gianforte, a tech magnate said to be worth about $600 million, favors tax cuts for people like himself and is against expanding health care for those at the other end. A Montana ballot measure that would raise tobacco taxes to provide health care for the working poor is well ahead in the polls. The key here is independent voters \u2014 around 44 percent of the electorate \u2014 who are willing to cut through the daily cable news fat in search of the real meat of politics.Advertisement"}

The world of politics has been pretty fraught lately, and today we\u2019re going to try to be cheery, and just talk about good old-fashioned weirdness and stupidity.Well, we would hope that all our candidates do a little bit of vetting when it comes to air safety. But the best thing about this story is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with Donald Trump. Who recently suggested that when we\u2019re contemplating the coming elections we should \u201cthink of it as the same thing as me.\u201dO.K., he\u2019s probably right. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t deserve a little political diversion.For instance, you\u2019ve probably heard about Representative Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, who is a heavy favorite for re-election even though he\u2019s been the subject of an attack ad made by six of his siblings.I am sorry to report that Florida Republicans have let us down and nominated a Spanish-language TV star, Maria Elvira Salazar, for Congress in a district where one of the other candidates was a businesswoman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included having been kidnapped by space aliens.Swift had in mind things like opposition to the Violence Against Women Act. But Blackburn lives on in my memory as the House member who once gave a vigorous denunciation of a bill raising energy efficiency standards for ceiling fans. In which speech, she appeared to paraphrase a famous Holocaust poem about fear and apathy. (\u201cFirst they came for our health care. Then they took away our light bulbs \u2026 now they are coming after our ceiling fans.\u201d)Celebrities endorsing candidates is not normally all that big a deal \u2014 Trump himself has a number of entertainers on his bandwagon, from Kanye West to Tila Tequila. It is a venerable tradition that dates back to 1920, when Al Jolson announced his support for Warren Harding.When Trump learned about the endorsement he announced he likes Taylor Swift \u201c25 percent less now.\u201d This was the most mystifying presidential remark of the week. Why not 100 percent? When Lisa Murkowski voted against the Kavanaugh nomination, Trump did not say he thought a quarter of her constituents would be really ticked off. No, he decreed that \u201cthe people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did.\u201d I would hate to think the difference is only about Murkowski not being a 28-year-old blond superstar.Trump is a Marsha Blackburn supporter \u2014 in fact, he was just in Tennessee for a rally in which she was actually permitted to come on stage and talk for three minutes. \u201cA vote for Marsha is really a vote for me,\u201d he told the crowd.See?

But it is not the main reason that voter turnout is so low.Opinion Columnist\u201cThis isn\u2019t really a 50-50 country. It\u2019s like a 60-40 country,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cDemocrats could and will do even better if every one of your listeners not only votes but makes sure that all your wishy-washy, excuse-making, Internet-surfing, TV-watching, grumbling-but-not-doing-nothing friends and family members get to the polls. Vote.\u201dI think that reaction is wrong. I think, to paraphrase Obama, it\u2019s a form of excuse-making. And it\u2019s not just factually wrong but politically damaging. It breeds nihilism.This kind of suppression certainly does depress turnout. But just as certainly, suppression is not the main reason that turnout remains so low. I\u2019m confident about that for two primary reasons:First, the Republicans\u2019 voter-suppression push has become far more intense in recent years. Following a Supreme Court ruling that threw out a central part of the Voting Rights Act, Southern states undertook a new suppression campaign. And yet if you look at the voter-turnout data, you don\u2019t see a big change after 2013.The second reason involves the group that is the main target of voter-suppression laws: African-Americans. If suppression were really the primary force driving turnout, then African-Americans would have the lowest turnout rates. But they don\u2019t \u2014 not even close.In 2016, the non-Hispanic black turnout rate was 59.9 percent, according to McDonald. That was below the non-Hispanic white turnout rate of 64.7 percent, but far above the Hispanic rate of 44.9 percent and the \u201cother\u201d (mostly Asian-American) rate of 46.3 rate. The black turnout rate was also well above the turnout rate for Americans aged 18 to 29: 43.4 percent.And these same broad patterns also held in 2014, 2010, 2004 and other years when Obama, the first black president, was not on the ballot.This is no time for nihilism.Advertisement"}

I wasn\u2019t there so I can\u2019t say what they were actually doing on the outside. But on the inside, I\u2019m pretty sure I know: They were crying.They were crying over the fact that the America they had come to know and respect over the last 70 years \u2014 and whose generosity and security order they had come to rely upon and even take advantage of at times \u2014 had left the building.It had been replaced by Trump\u2019s America, which is different in two fundamental ways. First, Trump\u2019s America does not see itself as the galvanizer and protector of the liberal global order that brought more peace, prosperity and democracy to more corners of the world over the last 70 years than at any time in history \u2014 defying the natural order of things, which is constant jungle-like conflict, protectionism and strongman rule.Second, Trump\u2019s America is unafraid to engage in the raw exercise of power against any foe or friend to gain economic or geopolitical advantage \u2014 no matter how big or small \u2014 and, at the same time, is ready to overlook any human rights abuse or killing by any country deemed friendly to Trump personally or not interesting to him geopolitically.It all depends just how far Trump goes with this. Will it be a mild departure from the approach of every other U.S. president of the postwar era \u2014 each of whom understood that we had an overall interest in being the overall steward of a democratizing global order \u2014 or a radical departure? I don\u2019t know yet, but if you look around, a lot of people are acting as if the cat\u2019s away so the mice can play.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has felt quite confident about poisoning ex-spies living in Britain. And how about that Russian investigative journalist who just happened to jump out a window? And how about China arresting the head of the global policing organization, Interpol, Meng Hongwei, a Chinese citizen, when he was home for a visit? He is now being investigated for corruption.The key pillars of this liberal world order, Kagan argued, were the conversion of Germany and Japan from aggressive dictatorships to pacifist democracies, the building of a global trading regime and the backing of it all with certain made-in-America norms and rules of commerce and geopolitics, buttressed by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Army.\u201cWe did not do all of this out of an abundance of generosity, or the post-World War II statesmen saying, \u2018Gosh, how do we make the world a better place?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt actually came from them saying: \u2018How do we prevent the world backsliding into the kind of world war we just survived?\u2019\u201d This was not charity for them, but cold, calculating self-interest. They knew any order they created would pay back a hundred times for the world\u2019s biggest economy.In other words, this liberal world order \u201cis not the product of human evolution\u201d \u2014 as if human beings have somehow learned to be more peaceful with one another, Kagan argued. It developed because the most powerful nation on the planet, the United States of America, \u201cwas born of Enlightenment principles,\u201d and, after being dragged into two world wars in the 20th century, it decided to use its power to spread and maintain those principles \u2014 not everywhere and always, but in many places a lot of the time.And when I say \u201cpower\u201d I don\u2019t just mean military power. I mean also convening power. When the U.N.\u2019s top climate body issues a report \u2014 as it just did \u2014 that says our weather, our ocean levels, our agriculture and our ecosystems are going to be disrupted, so much more than people realize, unless we take huge steps now to mitigate climate change, and the U.S. president ignores it, we are failing in our task to stabilize the liberal global order and are paving the way for disorder.\u201cEvery gardener understands that the forces of nature are always trying to overrun it with vines and weeds \u2014 and it is a constant struggle to keep the jungle back,\u201d said Kagan. Same in geopolitics. We are always tending toward tribalism and authoritarianism and great power conflict. That\u2019s the jungle always trying to return. And U.S. values backed by U.S. power have been what prevented that.So when Trump says that we are just going to look out for ourselves, he shows his ignorance of both history and economics. Trump is pursuing \u201ca great American fantasy,\u201d added Kagan. And it is not a fantasy that we can be \u201cisolationists\u201d and we\u2019ll be O.K. It\u2019s a fantasy that we can be \u201cirresponsible\u201d and we\u2019ll be O.K. The world will be far more threatened by too little American order-making than too much.\u201cIt will be springtime for thugs,\u201d Kagan concluded \u2014 and the signs of that are now multiplying.Advertisement"}

She calls this process delegating, and asks, \u201cWhat part of your job do you wish you could assign to someone else?\u201dMark Masuoka, director of the museum, called Dot \u201ca great way to connect people with art and each other. And she doesn\u2019t require prior knowledge of the artwork.\u201d He said the museum would analyze usage of the chatbot, which he said could help it make \u201cmore informed decisions about how we want to develop projects and exhibitions.\u201dThe Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro collaborated with IBM to develop an IRIS+ chatbot that uses IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence technology and was introduced last year.On arrival, museum visitors receive a card embedded with a chip to use IRIS+. When they finish touring the core exhibition, IRIS+ asks, via an iPad, \u201cAfter everything you learned in the main exhibition, what are your concerns in today\u2019s world?\u201dDuring the conversation that follows, the app exchanges data with IBM\u2019s cloud and suggests initiatives suited to the visitors\u2019 concerns, basing these, in part, on personal information the visitors are invited to provide, such as their date of birth and where they live.Visitors also are encouraged to take a selfie for a wall at the end of the core exhibition. This wall displays visitors\u2019 photographs, along with their first names and personal interests; the wall also tracks and graphically displays all visitors\u2019 top concerns.The Barnes Foundation used artificial intelligence when it introduced a new collection website last year, as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of its move to downtown Philadelphia.Emulating the criteria the museum\u2019s founder, Albert C. Barnes, used to display his art collection in ensembles, the new website lets visitors search the collection by visual properties, such as light, line, color and space, filtering images according to aesthetic similarities. More than 2,000 of the roughly 3,000 works in the Barnes\u2019s collection have been published on the site. The number of visitors going to the Barnes\u2019s website has tripled since the new collection display was introduced, according to Shelley Bernstein, the museum\u2019s consulting creative technologist.The Museum of Modern Art is using artificial intelligence to analyze visitors\u2019 comments, while The Broad in Los Angeles is using it to analyze visitors\u2019 behavior, such as ticket and gift shop purchases and website visits. Diana Pan, chief technology officer of MoMA, which is now undergoing expansion, said the data produced by artificial intelligence could help it determine new signage and navigation requirements. Heather Hart, director of information technology for The Broad, said the data it collects could not only help it improve ticket distribution and exhibition planning, but also possibly what it sells in its gift shop and publishes in its newsletter.Artificial intelligence has allowed the Art Institute of Chicago to track how long visitors stay in its galleries, leading it to offer more small exhibitions focusing on its permanent collection.And A.I. is aiding the conservation and attribution efforts of Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. He is developing tools that allow visitors to his museum\u2019s website \u2014 which contains over 300,000 digital photographs of objects in its collection \u2014 to use artificial intelligence when they try to make comparisons among these objects, exploring, for example, all works \u2014 beside the museum\u2019s famous Vermeer painting of a milkmaid \u2014 of women preparing food.Another possible application of artificial intelligence, according to Elizabeth Merritt, director of the American Alliance of Museums\u2019 Center for the Future of Museums, could be the ability of visitors to interact with historical figures at history museums, through chatbots developed using the figures\u2019 published writings and archives, as well as oral histories.Robert Stein, executive vice president and chief program officer of the American Alliance of Museums, warned that museums must be aware of privacy issues as they use artificial intelligence, for example, protecting whatever personal information their visitors provide.\u201cAny time you talk about an emerging technology, museums have an important role to play teaching the public about it. Artificial intelligence is going to be incredibly important in shaping the world we live in, in profound ways. We need to understand the technology and the issues it raises,\u201d added Ms. Merritt.Because of an editing error, a picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the name of an art museum.

As Hurricane Michael was bearing down on the Florida Panhandle, his mother, Kristine Wright, urged her son to get out before it was too late. \u201cI begged him,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease go to a shelter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m staying here,\u201d he told her.Six days after landfall, Ms. Wright still has not heard from him. She has gone on Facebook several times in recent days, pleading for help.\u201cMy son is still missing,\u201d she said in one post. \u201cToday is Day 6 with no word from my son,\u201d she wrote on Tuesday afternoon.Mr. Sines, 22, is among dozens of people still unaccounted for since Michael roared through Florida and surrounding states last week, knocking out power lines and cell towers and leaving a trail of wreckage still being searched by rescue crews.Many of those missing, in the moments before they lost communications with friends or relatives, had appeared to be in dire circumstances. Some talked about how their walls were caving in, or how they regretted staying for the storm. Others said the Category 4 hurricane\u2019s winds were peeling off their roofs or splintering the roads in front of them.But in a storm zone that stretches across hundreds of miles and thousands of battered structures and streets, word about their fates has been slow in coming. Cellular service remains spotty, rescue crews are making slow progress and grisly rumors are common.The death toll rose to at least 29 on Tuesday, including 19 in Florida, of whom at least 15 are here in Bay County; many believe the toll will surely increase again. In places like Mexico Beach, where the authorities have said up to 46 people are missing, families and emergency workers fear that more bodies are buried in the fields of split wood and twisted metal \u2014 or, just as likely, washed out into the Gulf by the storm surge that swept through town.And so families have often been left to post desperate pleas on Facebook, or to try to reach emergency officials by phone or by walking into offices and command posts. Although more news is coming each day, especially as electricity and phone service are gradually restored across the Panhandle, many continue to wait.\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping, I\u2019m not eating,\u201d said Ms. Wright, who has been trying to make the roughly 60-mile trip each day from her home in Freeport to the place on Northeast Avenue in Panama City where her son was last seen. \u201cAs his mother, my heart hurts.\u201dIn an interview on Tuesday, she described Mr. Sines \u2014 he is slightly over six feet tall, she said \u2014 and her voice broke.\u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d she said finally.The authorities insist that they have not given up on finding people alive, whether in a collapsed building or simply unaccounted for somewhere.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go as long as possible,\u201d said Dr. Jay M. Radtke, the medical examiner for the region that includes Bay County. \u201cIn a storm like this with a huge surge, it\u2019s always a possibility that some people may have been swept out to sea. But we\u2019re not going to go the easy way and just say that happened. We\u2019re going to try.\u201dDr. Radtke said most of the deaths in Bay County were what he described as \u201cmedical\u201d fatalities that were not caused by trauma but were nonetheless attributable to the storm, perhaps because of missed dialysis or a heart attack connected to yard cleanup. Just three bodies were unidentified.As far as when those missing might be declared dead, \u201cI think we\u2019re still a ways away, until we have a better idea of who is actually missing,\u201d Dr. Radtke said. \u201cMore and more people are popping up each day.\u201dThey are being found as cellphones sputter to life with restored service, or are found by volunteers like Eric Sherred and Erica Rodgers, a young couple who returned to Panama City Beach after evacuating to North Carolina during the storm and decided to help find missing residents.The couple, married last month, have been traveling around Bay County in their tangerine Honda Element, armed with a phone covered by AT&T, the provider everyone here seems to want these days. The phone is their virtual command post, a connection to worried relatives and urgent Facebook requests for \u201cwellness checks\u201d that send them to their next target.On Tuesday, they spent much of the afternoon sitting in stalled traffic with the air-conditioning running on high, then pulled into a neighborhood in Panama City, hard-hit by the storm, where a teenager named Hailey Hicks was supposed to be. The girl\u2019s aunt wanted to know whether she was safe.\u201cThis is not looking good,\u201d Ms. Rodgers said as she surveyed a landscape of ruin just a minute or two from the house. \u201cThis is feeling pretty bad. But they are all bad.\u201d\u201cWe just need the one house,\u201d Mr. Sherred said gently.Not all the houses, it turned out, were destroyed. Soon, they pulled up at a tidy home, having navigated a fallen tree and passed a warning sign, posted at another house, that said looters and vandals would be shot. Ms. Hicks, 17, appeared in the open doorway. Her father had just left to buy supplies, she said. They had been without phone service since the storm.But they were O.K.\u201cI feel relieved, knowing that people out there actually care about us,\u201d Ms. Hicks said, her grandmother at her side. Ms. Rodgers sent a Facebook update about the family\u2019s condition.They went next to another house on their list and found a cleared driveway and water bottles that appeared undamaged by the storm \u2014 signs, they surmised, that this family had also survived. Ms. Rodgers left a note on the door: \u201cLisa is worried about you and would love to know that you\u2019re O.K. Please contact her as soon as you\u2019re able and I hope you and your loved ones are all well!\u201dThey stopped at a cluster of mobile homes to look for someone thought to be living at Lot No. 7. He wasn\u2019t there, but a neighbor said she had seen him since the afternoon of the storm. They continued walking along sand-covered streets strewn with hurricane d\u00e9cor: shredded cans of Bud Light, an American flag lodged in a fallen tree\u2019s stump. Six days after the hurricane, the smell of ripped-apart pine somehow still lingered.Mr. Sherred mounted a rooftop to help someone put up a tarp. Before they left, a woman demanded that they pray together.It was, for the couple, a good day of searching, even though Mr. Sines\u2019s whereabouts remained a question as dusk \u2014 and the county\u2019s curfew \u2014 approached. They had looked for him on Monday and reported that someone in the neighborhood thought they had seen him. But there was no proof \u2014 no picture, no text message and most certainly no voice on the phone.\u201cWe\u2019re about 80 percent sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ms. Rodgers, who has been keeping in touch with Ms. Wright about her son. \u201cBut she\u2019s his mother. Eighty percent isn\u2019t good enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Living Beneath the Ground in an Australian Desert", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensFor about a century, residents of Coober Pedy have escaped the searing heat by building their homes underground. Tamara Merino captured life beneath the earth.The sandy red hills dotting the mining community of Coober Pedy stretch uninterrupted toward the horizon. \u201cGhost town\u201d was what the Chilean photographer Tamara Merino first thought when she and her partner stopped in town to fix their van\u2019s flat tire while crossing the vast Simpson Desert in South Australia.Ms. Merino, however, soon learned that the town was bustling with human life \u2014 but underneath their feet. \u201cBars and restaurants are underground, churches, all these children growing up living underground,\u201d Ms. Merino said in a telephone interview about the residents\u2019 social and private lives. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing different about them; they\u2019re not cave men. They\u2019re normal people choosing to live in a different way.\u201d \u201cPeople are starting to live underground, and it\u2019s related to different factors \u2014 economical, climatic, cultural,\u201d Ms. Merino said. \u201cI want to understand this human condition. How does a human being relate to the environment it chooses to live in?\u201d \u201cPeople started to pass the news that there was this stone,\u201d Ms. Merino said. \u201cAll of them were becoming really rich 100 years ago. They started bringing families. Children started being born there.\u201dBut the Outback is an unforgiving terrain. High temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and lows drop below freezing. Ms. Merino recalled enduring days of scorching temperatures of 120 degrees above ground until Gabriele Gouellain, a German miner, invited the pair into her dugout. Over the generations, locals have learned to escape painful temperatures and dust storms by building structures dozens of meters beneath the earth\u2019s surface, which provide constant, year-round temperatures in the mid-70s. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable to live above ground,\u201d Ms. Merino said. Through the locals, Ms. Merino captured an intimate connection to the land. In Ms. Gouellain\u2019s home, jagged sandstone walls enclose her kitchen and dining room, filled with wooden cabinets and a stainless steel toaster oven. Pious members of the Serbian Orthodox Church attend their local house of worship several meters underground, where they gaze upon glistening stained glass windows and biblical reliefs carved into the walls. Others gave the photographer an intimate look at their community\u2019s economic backbone. Miners spend weeks in tight, dark shafts, guided only by headlamps and the lingering glow from the outside world as they drill into the walls. At nightfall, \u201cnoodlers\u201d scavenge for less valuable shards of the gemstone left behind above ground. Both, however, hunger for a chance to uncover the kaleidoscopic glimmer of opals.\u201cLots of them living in Coober Pedy and they have not found anything in their whole life,\u201d Ms. Merino said. \u201cLots of people who have found opals became millionaires, and then lost everything, invested in new machineries, threw parties.\u201dIn this onetime boomtown, Ms. Merino said the tradition is dying, and with it the town. Teenagers and young adults want stable and safe employment, neither of which mining can guarantee. Still, many residents continue to reside underground, taking a chance on striking rich by searching for a single gemstone 30 meters below. \u201cWhen they are inside the mine for weeks, and they find this piece of colorful stone, you understand why they are looking are for this gem,\u201d Ms. Merino said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful stone.

Preventing refugees in the caravan from entering the U.S. has been a major talking point among both right-wing commentators and President Donald Trump, who has spoken about it in recent pre-midterm election stump speeches.\u201dThere is no way to separate Trump from the fulminating against the caravans.Therein lies the uneasy alliance: The white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right are energized by Trump\u2019s election, and yet many find his white power positioning falls short of their own.That doesn\u2019t mean that Trump doesn\u2019t court their support and defend their actions.After the alt-right staged its deadly march in Charlottesville, in which throngs of marchers with torches chanted \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d Trump insisted that there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the protest.\u201cAsked whether he considers Trump an ally, Spencer replied that while he didn\u2019t think of Trump as \u2018alt-right,\u2019 he considers the president to be \u2018the first true authentic nationalist in my lifetime.\u2019 \u201dIn an interview with Vice, Christopher Cantwell, who was also involved in the Charlottesville march, had this exchange with the interviewer over the issue of white violence:Cantwell: \u201cI\u2019m here to spread ideas, talk in the hopes that somebody more capable will come along and do that, somebody like Donald Trump who does not give his daughter to a Jew.\u201dInterviewer: \u201cSo Donald Trump, but like, more racist?\"Cantwell: \u201cA lot more racist than Donald Trump. I don\u2019t think that you could feel about race the way I do and watch that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl.\u201dThat of course was a reference to Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner.So these folks are emboldened by Trump, but now that they have an inch, they want a mile. Still there is clearly something happening on the ground that is undeniable. As The New York Times reported on Saturday:\u201cAccording to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued earlier this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979.\u201d2017, of course, was the first year of the Trump administration.As always, this cautionary note must be included: Homicidal maniacs are responsible for their own actions. It is almost impossible in most cases to attach the words of one person to the deeds of another.However, it must also be said that Trump has produced a toxic environment of intolerance in this country that is deep and wide. He has flirted with the deepest racists and Nazis and it has not gone unnoticed, least of all by them.Last week at a debate, Florida\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum said of his Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis: \u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201dI believe that the same could be said of Trump, although he engages in his own strain of racism.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Plays His Greatest Hits ", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president closes the 2018 campaign with a return to his 2016 strategy.Opinion ColumnistThe media-bashing part of the pitch comes from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed and his recent Montana rally, where he hailed the congressman who assaulted a journalist unprovoked as \u201cmy kind of guy.\u201d The middle-class populism is embodied in Trump\u2019s vaporous proposal to cut middle-class taxes by 10 percent, and his more credible plan to change the way Medicare pays for prescription drugs so that we aren\u2019t subsidizing the world. And the illegal-immigration gambits describe themselves.What unites these arguments is that they were all crucial to his pitch during the 2016 campaign, all part of what made Trump-the-candidate unlike a normal Republican nominee: He was hard-line on immigration in ways that included xenophobic flourishes like the Muslim ban, he was populist on economics in a way that placed him closer to the center than a Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, and whether in rally one-liners or retweets he winked at not only extremism but even vigilante violence.In his presidency the first two aspects of Trumpian exceptionalism have been blocked or limited \u2014 the courts and Congress have pushed back against his most restrictive immigration measures (narrowing the travel ban, forcing him to abandon the child separation policy), and congressional Republicans\u2019 preference for warmed-over supply-side economics has often won out over Trump\u2019s more populist promises.Still, it\u2019s not at all surprising that with the election almost here Trump would return to what seemed to work for him two years ago, and try to revive the mix of identitarian demagogy and policy heterodoxy that helped him achieve a partial Electoral College realignment while his party held both the House and Senate.The question is whether it will work again, and keep the House in Republican hands for two more years. If it doesn\u2019t, there will be two main explanations.First, the voters who were won over by Trump\u2019s economic populism when he was running against Hillary Clinton \u2014 especially the kind of Midwestern Democratic voters who flipped the Electoral College \u2014 now have almost two years of policymaking to assess, rather than just a campaign\u2019s worth or promises. And on the evidence of a lot of Midwestern polls they believe the G.O.P. under Trump is still more plutocratic than populist.This is a reasonable assessment. True, on trade and low-skilled immigration Trump can at least claim (however debatably) to be looking out for blue-collar workers more than past Republicans. But on taxes he delivered an unpopular tax cut for the rich, on health care he delivered a failed and hated Obamacare replacement, and on infrastructure, the big campaign promise, he delivered next to nothing.If an infrastructure bill or the things he\u2019s suddenly pitching \u2014 lower prescription drug prices and a tax cut for the middle class \u2014 had been central to his agenda in 2017 he might have been a much more politically formidable president. But bringing them up now would smack of political desperation even if voters were paying close attention to the new proposals \u2014 and they probably aren\u2019t, given the chaos of pre-election coverage.So the return to economic populism is likely to be less effective in 2018 than the same message was in 2016. And then at the same time the wink to the conspiratorial extremes, the japes about body-slams and punching protesters in the face, have met the thing most likely to make them a political liability: actual far-right violence.But the events of last week are still a strong reminder that the politics of vilification and the paranoid style work darkly in darkened minds, and that having a president embrace both is simple wickedness, not just the WWE-style game that Trump may believe himself to be playing with his rhetoric. And voters who decided to forgive Trump\u2019s demagogy in 2016, or treat it as performance art, have just been given a visceral reason to punish him for it instead.Given our vertiginous style of politics there is still time for some unexpected development, some last-minute midterm twist. But with a week to go the safest bet is that in returning to the same strategy he followed in 2016, Trump will earn \u2014 and deserve \u2014 a more disappointing political result. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Taylor Swift has nothing on Snapchat \u2014 at least when it comes to persuading people to register to vote.Snap, the company behind the popular social media service, said on Tuesday that it had helped more than 400,000 users register to vote during a recent two-week period. Much of the activity, the company said, was in key battleground states like Texas, Florida and Georgia.Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers and young adults, pushed people 18 and over to register by adding a button about doing so on each user\u2019s profile page. The company also sent video messages to all of those users urging them to register.The users were directed to a nonpartisan voter registration website, TurboVote.org. Once they answered a few questions about their potential eligibility as a voter, TurboVote directed them to state and local election boards to officially register.\u201cThere is no more powerful form of self-expression than the ability to vote,\u201d said Jennifer Stout, global head of public policy at Snap. \u201cThe numbers we\u2019ve seen have been fantastic and have shown us that our users have been some of the most engaged communities out there.\u201dIt appears that Snap may have had an even bigger effect, getting 418,000 people to register. Of that total, 79,148 registered in Texas, 29,044 in Florida, 22,649 in Georgia and 17,994 in Ohio. All those states have competitive races.Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Google have also pushed voter registration drives, by linking to sites like TurboVote, which work with companies in their voter drive, provide information on candidates and voter initiatives and send text and email reminders to users.Young Americans are historically among the least consistent voters. But there are signs that they are more engaged than usual in this year\u2019s elections, speaking up on issues like immigration, gun control and health care. And on social media, many young people have promoted their voter registrations and have pushed their peers to vote.\u201cFor young people, voting isn\u2019t as much a civic duty as it is an identity issue,\u201d said Brandon Naylor, a spokesman for Democracy Works, which runs the website TurboVote.Snapchat\u2019s younger demographic has attracted candidates to the service ahead of the midterm elections. In the hotly contested race for Senate in Texas, between Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent, and his Democratic challenger, Beto O\u2019Rourke, the candidates have used Snapchat to post stories on the trail. Both have appeared on Snapchat\u2019s political television show on the app, \u201cGood Luck America.\u201dStill, it is unclear how many young people will show up at polls on Nov. 6. In 2014, in the last midterm election, only 17.1 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted. And it would be too simplistic to attribute any uptick in young votes directly to the voter campaigns of social media outlets like Snap, Instagram and Facebook, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to forecast voter turnout,\u201d said Donald Green, a professor of political science at Columbia University. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to say any Taylor Swift-style surge will make a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The academic literature about the fate of the high school in crowd is quite clear. The Renate alumni do very, very well. The future has a name, and it is Squi.Perhaps the most imaginative paper to support this idea was published in 2001. The psychologist Jacquelynne Eccles and two colleagues asked 900 10th graders in Michigan to determine which of the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d characters they identified with the most: the Jock, the Brain, the Princess, the Basket Case or the Criminal. (A tad crude? Sure. But find me another study involving John Hughes that survived peer review.)\u201cWhether you\u2019re looking at popularity, athletic status or attractiveness \u2014 all of the data tell you the same thing,\u201d the sociologist Robert Crosnoe, president of the Society for Research on Adolescence, told me. \u201cYou carry forward into adulthood this legacy of how you operated when you were in high school. What better training ground to learn that you have power and wield it? And why wouldn\u2019t you think you\u2019re good enough to yell at senators on live television and be a Supreme Court justice 40 years later? You\u2019ve had 40 years of confirming evidence!\u201dCrosnoe himself published a book in 2013 about the enduring effects of high school, noting that men and women who were rated good-looking as teenagers made more money than their peers who were merely rated average, even 15 years later, regardless of how they looked in their 30s. He used a sample of thousands of people.(You might reasonably wonder how he knew if these kids were attractive. The answer, I learned, is that people who gather information for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health actually rate the looks of participating teenagers. At least they were doing so in the name of science, not yearbook trolling.)Does this mean that former geeks and outsiders don\u2019t stand a fighting chance in adult life? Of course not. The tech world is teeming with triumphant nerds, and in 2008 we saw the brilliant ascent of an outsider in politics. Barack Obama felt betwixt and between throughout his adolescence, at loose ends about his racial identity and his place in the world.

Kavanaugh and his defenders say his success is proof that he\u2019s outgrown his younger self. But the truth is, the data suggests just the opposite. That self predicted exactly who he\u2019d be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Hacking Is About to Get Much Worse", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe can no longer leave online security to the market. Mr. Schneier is a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School.The risks are about to get worse, because computers are being embedded into physical devices and will affect lives, not just our data. Security is not a problem the market will solve. The government needs to step in and regulate this increasingly dangerous space.The primary reason computers are insecure is that most buyers aren\u2019t willing to pay \u2014 in money, features, or time to market \u2014 for security to be built into the products and services they want. As a result, we are stuck with hackable internet protocols, computers that are riddled with vulnerabilities and networks that are easily penetrated. We have accepted this tenuous situation because, for a very long time, computer security has mostly been about data. Banking data stored by financial institutions might be important, but nobody dies when it\u2019s stolen. Facebook account data might be important, but again, nobody dies when it\u2019s stolen. Regardless of how bad these hacks are, it has historically been cheaper to accept the results than to fix the problems. But the nature of how we use computers is changing, and that comes with greater security risks. Many of today\u2019s new computers are not just screens that we stare at, but objects in our world with which we interact. A refrigerator is now a computer that keeps things cold; a car is now a computer with four wheels and an engine. These computers sense us and our environment, and they affect us and our environment. They talk to each other over networks, they are autonomous, and they have physical agency. They drive our cars, pilot our planes, and run our power plants. They control traffic, administer drugs into our bodies, and dispatch emergency services. These connected computers and the network that connects them \u2014 collectively known as \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 affect the world in a direct physical manner. These are problems that the market will not fix. Buyers can't differentiate between secure and insecure products, so sellers prefer to spend their money on features that buyers can see. The complexity of the internet and of our supply chains make it difficult to trace a particular vulnerability to a corresponding harm. The courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities. And, for most companies, it has generally been good business to skimp on security, rather than sell a product that costs more, does less, and is on the market a year later.Finally, we need to make it an overarching policy that security takes precedence over everything else. The internet is used globally, by everyone, and any improvements we make to security will necessarily help those we might prefer remain insecure: criminals, terrorists, rival governments. Here, we have no choice. The security we gain from making our computers less vulnerable far outweighs any security we might gain from leaving insecurities that we can exploit.Regulation is inevitable. Our choice is no longer between government regulation and no government regulation, but between smart government regulation and ill-advised government regulation. Government regulation is not something to fear. Regulation doesn\u2019t stifle innovation, and I suspect that well-written regulation will spur innovation by creating a market for security technologies. No industry has significantly improved the security or safety of its products without the government stepping in to help. Cars, airplanes, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, food, medical devices, workplaces, restaurants, and, most recently, financial products \u2014 all needed government regulation in order to become safe and secure.Getting internet safety and security right will depend on people: people who are willing to take the time and expense to do the right things; people who are determined to put the best possible law and policy into place. The internet is constantly growing and evolving; we still have time for our security to adapt, but we need to act quickly, before the next disaster strikes. It\u2019s time for the government to jump in and help. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, not when the next big technology company or government agency is hacked, but now.

{"Headline": "Plants Can\u2019t Talk. But Some Fruits Say \u2018Eat Me\u2019 to Animals.", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo national parks in Uganda and Madagascar presented researchers with a natural experiment to understand how plants have adapted to appeal to animals that spread their seeds.As the sun rises over Kibale National Park in Uganda, red berries and orange figs hang in the rain forest\u2019s canopy. They\u2019re waiting for monkeys, apes or birds to scan the foliage, eat the ripe fruit and either spit or defecate seeds far from their sources, spreading their next generation to a new location.Nearly 2,000 miles away, in the similarly mountainous rain forests of Madagascar\u2019s Ranomafana National Park, yellow berries or fragrant, green figs await lemurs, the frugivores of this jungle. They\u2019ll search the forest all night for their feast, later scattering the seeds.Over millions of years of natural selection, these plants have developed ways to communicate with animals through their fruits, new research suggests, saying something like \u201cchoose me.\u201d With traits evolved to match each animal\u2019s sensory capacities or physical abilities, fruits can signal dinner time in the jungle, and further their plant\u2019s survival as a species.For more than a century, biologists have wondered why fruits from closely-related plants have such different appearances, and how animals know which ones to eat.The prevailing hypothesis has been that animals could have influenced fruit traits \u2014 like shape, location on a tree, presentation on a branch or odor and color \u2014 through natural selection. The easier it is for fruit-eaters to identify ripe fruits, the better the chance for both to survive. The animal eats, and the parent plant reproduces \u2014 by using the animals as gardeners \u2014 without lifting a root.In a similar way, many flowers tailor their petal shape, color, texture or nectar\u2019s scent or flavor to attract often a single pollinating species. Scientists accept that these flower traits could result from coevolution, because the relationships are so specific.But they\u2019ve had questions about plants reproducing through seed dispersal. How can you pin a fruit\u2019s particular traits to an animal when many different animals, with their own evolutionary adaptations, interact with the same fruits?Though traits like shape are easier to study, without proper tools to measure color and odor, much research has relied on human perceptions and may have overlooked how other animals may experience the world.For the researchers, these parks in Uganda and Madagascar offered the perfect natural experiment. With similar landscapes and related plants bearing different-looking fruits that feed animals with very different sensory abilities, the researchers could reveal how animal senses may have influenced the contrasting colors of ripe fruits against foliage.The monkeys and apes in Uganda have tricolor vision like humans, and the birds have even better vision. But most lemurs in Madagascar can only see the blue-yellow spectrum \u2014 they\u2019re red-green colorblind, and rely more on their strong senses of smell for many behaviors.So the researchers collected ripe and unripe fruits and foliage and analyzed their colors with a spectrometer. With a model based on the visual capacities of the seed-dispersing animals, they also determined who was most likely to detect different fruit colors contrasting against an assortment of backgrounds.They found the colors of each fruit were optimized against their natural backdrops to meet the demands of the visual systems of their primary seed dispersers. In Uganda, fruits contrasting with foliage in colors on the red-green spectrum \u2014 say that red berry in a green cluster \u2014 popped for birds and monkeys whose eyes can see them.But in Madagascar, fruit with blue-yellow contrasts \u2014 like those yellow berries \u2014 could be best detected by red-green colorblind lemurs (and some birds, too).The researchers also know that lemurs dedicate large areas of the brain to olfaction, helping them communicate with one another and pick mates \u2014 often in the dark. To these excellent smellers, a fragrant brown fig might also stand out.In Dr. Nevo\u2019s scent study, his team collected hundreds of ripe and unripe fruits from Ranomafana \u2014 about a third dispersed solely by visually challenged lemurs and the rest by other lemurs and the park\u2019s few visually gifted birds. He suspected the lemur-eaten fruits would have a greater difference in odor after they ripened than the bird-eaten fruits.To find out, he extracted their odors using the \u201csemi-static headspace technique.\u201d Sealed in oven bags, chemical fruit odors built up and were then pumped out, trapped and analyzed.They confirmed that fruits dispersed solely by lemurs produced more chemicals and a greater assortment of compounds upon ripening. And in the wild, lemurs spent more time sniffing these same fruits with big differences in ripe versus unripe odors. To the researchers, this suggested the differences could signal, \u201cI\u2019m here. Eat me,\u201d to creatures otherwise possibly unable to see them.These results may only be extreme, localized cases supporting the hypothesis that plants and seed-dispersers evolve together. But the researchers see additional clues in a relationship between forest elephants in the Uganda park and Balanites wilsoniana, a tree that might not be able to survive without them.When ripe, Dr. Valenta said she could detect the \u201cfermented gym sock\u201d odor of the tree\u2019s large fruits for miles. Elephants \u2014 with huge noses and more olfactory receptor genes than any other known animal on Earth \u2014 gobble up the fallen fruits (they may make them feel tipsy too).Only elephants can swallow the fruits and defecate the equally large seeds whole. And this plant won\u2019t reproduce unless it passes through an elephant\u2019s gut, Dr. Valenta said. This type of mutual dependence is seen in well-established flower-pollinator relationships, but it\u2019s rare to find in fruit-seed-disperser relationships. Further study may offer additional evidence that animal senses influence fruit traits.The traveler\u2019s palm in Madagascar highlights another plant advertisement strategy targeted at animals.Aye-ayes and other lemurs are also pollinators, using their strength to open the palm\u2019s sturdy nectar packages, ensuring the plant can produce seeds in the first place.\u201cIf something happened to those lemurs, those trees, at least in the wild, would become extinct,\u201d Mr. Drori said.Interactions like these remind us that plants are active members of a complicated and fragile ecosystem \u2014 not just landscape.\u201cWe\u2019re only just beginning to understand how much plants and animals mean to one another,\u201d Dr. Valenta said, \u201cwhich to me is just a signal that it\u2019s more important to conserve the entire thing intact.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misattributed the source of a description about the visual capabilities of an aye-aye lemur. It was described by Kim Valenta, not Jonathan Drori. The article also mischaracterized Mr. Drori's description of the laxative effects of traveler's palm seeds on animals. He said the seeds of many fruits have that effect, not specifically those of the traveler's palm.A picture caption in an earlier version of this article, using information provided by a researcher, misstated the location of a chimpanzee eating figs. The chimpanzee was in Uganda's Budongo Forest, not Tai National Park in the Ivory Coast.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Is the Most Lucrative Moment in History to Catch Bass", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "A rivalry between two tournament fishing circuits has slapped the industry like a 10-pound largemouth to the face.Supported byOne Friday morning in August, even before the sun had risen over the St. Lawrence River, the docks in Waddington, N.Y., were aglow. Some of the artificial light came from a flotilla of sleek boats that drifted around the marina, kitted out with luminous fish-finder devices. The rest emanated from smartphones and video cameras, as dozens of professional anglers recorded social-media clips ahead of the last competition of the regular season.An avuncular 51-year-old from Kalamazoo, Mich., he is considered the best bass fisherman in history \u2014 and certainly the best compensated, with more than $6.4 million in BASS winnings. His sponsors \u2014 Toyota, GoPro, Oakley, Yeti coolers, to name a few \u2014 likely push his annual earnings into the seven figures.\u201cLast year, I won with 90 pounds,\u201d Mr. VanDam continued. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than that this year, for sure.\u201d Despite the predawn hour, motivational comments flooded in as he spoke. One urged: \u201cGo get \u2019em, KVD.\u201d Another wrote simply \u201cGOAT,\u201d for \u201cgreatest of all time.\u201dAt last count, Mr. VanDam and nearly 70 other BASS anglers have been lured away by the promise of more control over league decisions, a more TV-friendly competition format and bigger money. The Bass Pro Tour will have a total payout approaching $10 million.BASS has responded by lowering its entry fees and upping the prize money at a number of events. The one-upmanship means that right now is possibly the most lucrative moment in history to be a professional catcher of bass.In Waddington, as the sky turned pink and the clock neared the launch time of 6:15 a.m., Mr. VanDam and the other anglers wrapped up their Facebook and Instagram streaming, removed their caps and stood for the national anthem. Each of them was accompanied by a marshal, whose job it was to observe the rules and log estimated weights into an app called BASSTrakk. For one day, I acted as a marshal for Mr. VanDam.The boats were lined up next to the shore. Each vessel was decorated with the logos of the angler\u2019s top sponsors, giving them a similar look to the stock cars of Nascar. An M.C. announced each angler as he (they were all men, and nearly all white) launched into the river. Off went Casey Ashley, a South Carolinian and occasional country crooner, in his aqua-blue boat, sponsored by Costa sunglasses. Away sped the Texan Alton Jones, representing Miracle-Ear, a company that makes hearing aids. When it was Mr. VanDam\u2019s turn, he quickly brought his sparkly black-and-red Nitro to its cruising speed of 70 miles per hour.Bass boats were slower back when Ray Scott, an insurance salesman from Alabama, founded BASS in 1968. The idea for a tournament series had come to him the previous year during an outing in Jackson, Miss. As the creation myth goes, the day was rainy and the fish were elusive, so Mr. Scott retreated to his room at a Ramada Inn, took a hot shower and flicked on the TV. Watching basketball players bound across the screen, he thought: Why couldn\u2019t his favorite sport, bass fishing, be professionalized, too?A few months after what he called his \u201cbrainstorm in a rainstorm,\u201d Mr. Scott held the first modern bass fishing tournament on Beaver Lake in Arkansas, inviting 106 anglers to compete for cash prizes, a fully paid fishing trip to Acapulco and a plot of land on the lake. He also founded Bassmaster Magazine.\u201cIt is my plan that we lift bass fishing up to public par with golf, bowling and pocket billiards,\u201d he wrote in the first issue. \u201cIt\u2019s high time the public found out we exist.\u201dLately, interest has seemed to explode at the high school and college level. The number of BASS-affiliated college clubs has increased to 179, from 71 in 2012. And participation in high school clubs has boomed even more, to over 10,000 members from 793 in 2013. At least seven colleges now offer bass fishing scholarships.Professional bass fishing has appeared to be on the verge of breakthrough popularity before. ESPN purchased BASS in 2001, but sold the organization to a group of private investors less than a decade later. (Some competitions still air on ESPN\u2019s channels.)The sport\u2019s latest economic trend relates to social media, with sponsors encouraging competitors to become brands unto themselves. The biggest following belongs to Mr. VanDam, who has some 260,000 fans on Instagram in addition to his Facebook horde \u2014 nearly double the numbers of Patrick Reed, the golfer who won this year\u2019s Masters.On the St. Lawrence in August, Mr. VanDam\u2019s blue eyes darted between a fish finder mounted in his console and the waves on the river. Having zoomed along for 40 minutes after launch, he reached a spot he deemed promising.He cut the outboard engine, threw off his life jacket, leapt to the front of his boat, lowered his trolling motor and pitched out his first cast, all within a matter of seconds. Fishing as a cardio workout might sound laughable, but research published in 2008 found that professional anglers burn up to 4,300 calories during tournament days.Mr. VanDam is tall, with cherubic cheeks and a tendency toward zealous winking. To ward off the morning chill, he wore rain pants and a raincoat embroidered with the logos for Nitro, the company that made his boat, and Bass Pro Shops. On his feet he sported timeworn flip-flops that revealed the edges of an intense sandal tan.Most BASS tournaments are held in lakes and rivers dominated by largemouth bass \u2014 recognizable by mouths that extend beyond their eyes. In Waddington, however, Mr. VanDam was targeting smallmouth bass, which tend to fight fiercely once hooked.Within minutes he had his first bite. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice one,\u201d he said, letting out a bit of line. When the fish had tired itself out, Mr. VanDam reeled it in, tipping his rod down close enough to the water that he could scoop the bass up in a sun-tanned hand.It was about the size of a squished bread loaf, with a razor-sharp front dorsal fin and dark, tigrine stripes covering its shimmering bronze body. As Mr. VanDam transferred the creature to his livewell \u2014 a compartment behind the boat\u2019s seats that acts as an aerated swimming pool for captured fish \u2014 the smallmouth relieved itself on his foot.His day got worse from there. At one point, Mr. VanDam hooked a mammoth smallmouth only for it to break off. \u201cDang it!\u201d Mr. VanDam exclaimed, with the most bile his Midwestern manners would allow.Scott Rook, Mr. VanDam\u2019s frequent roommate during tournament travels, was fishing nearby. \u201cI just jumped off a giant,\u201d Mr. VanDam called out to him. After losing a second lunker a few minutes later, he turned to me and asked, \u201cYou ever think maybe you were bad luck?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a banana, do you?\u201d my husband responded when I texted him Mr. VanDam\u2019s comment.My angling-obsessed husband had neglected to mention this before I boarded Mr. VanDam\u2019s Nitro. Tucked into my lunchbox, which was stowed in the cool belly of the world\u2019s best fisherman\u2019s boat, were two ripe Chiquitas.\u201cI am not messing with you,\u201d my husband typed. \u201cYou can\u2019t let him see \u2026 Throw away.\u201d A few minutes later, I briefly jumped from Mr. Van Dam\u2019s boat to one reserved for members of the media. When Mr. VanDam turned his back, I grabbed my lunchbox, unzipped it, found the toxic fruits and gave them a secret river burial.Mr. VanDam\u2019s sustained success seems to dispel the notion that luck plays a significant role in fishing. He has finished in the money in 252 of the 313 BASS tournaments in which he has competed. His winnings in the organization exceed those of Skeet Reese, the next-most-successful active Bassmaster Elite Series fisherman, by more than $3 million.Mr. VanDam credits some of his success to growing up in Kalamazoo, which had many different types of water to explore. It taught him to think like a fish. Given the water temperature and current dynamics, what are bass likely to be eating? Are they hankering for baitfish, such as gobies and perch, or craving frog? What type of cast and lure movement might shock them into biting reflexively, even if they\u2019re not hungry?In the first six hours I rode with Mr. VanDam, he did not touch food or drink. Around noon he grabbed an unsliced peanut butter and jelly sandwich from his cooler and ate it using his left hand while steering his boat, moving at 65 m.p.h., with his right. He washed it down with a few glugs of Gatorade to forestall the cramps he had suffered the day before, when he forgot to consume a thing.Tournament days might last around eight hours \u2014 compare that with a basketball game\u2019s 48 minutes of hustle \u2014 and Mr. VanDam does not waste a second.\u201cYou can\u2019t pass anything up,\u201d he said, \u201cand you have to love it. If you don\u2019t,\u201d he added, the other anglers \u201cwill eat you alive.\u201dSince 1987, he said, the field has become far more skilled. \u201cReally, for the first half of my career, there were a lot of anglers that had other jobs and did other things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something they focused on 365 days a year.\u201dBass fishing is one of the few professional sports in which top-tier participants must pay to play. Entry fees for the Bassmaster Elite Series in 2018 totaled $43,000, and that\u2019s before the cost of travel, gear and gas. The BASS pro fishermen I spoke to in August and September estimated that their expenses totaled $65,000 to $80,000 per year.They complained that payouts had decreased over the past decade. But since word of the Bass Pro Tour broke in September, BASS has offered a number of new incentives \u2014 including $20,000 early-signing bonuses and a guarantee to pay $2,500 per tournament even to anglers who finish dead last.Despite the sweeteners, an early trickle of pros away from BASS quickly turned into a hemorrhage. Among the defectors are Mr. Ashley and Mr. Jones, as well as Mr. Reese and Edwin Evers, who have each earned more than $3 million with the organization.In an Instagram post, Mr. Evers wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for us to finally control our own destiny, and at the end of the day, you have to decide whether you want to be the bass or you want to be the shad. I want to be the bass.\u201dAnother angler abandoning BASS is Brandon Palaniuk, 30, who is considered one of the sport\u2019s most promising young competitors. After dropping out of college when his finals conflicted with an amateur tournament, he constructed logging roads in Idaho until qualifying for the Bassmaster Elite Series in 2011. He scraped together his entry fees by crowdfunding from bass fishing clubs and saved money by sleeping in the \u201cTundra Suites\u201d \u2014 his euphemism for the back of his Toyota Tundra pickup.Since he won an Elite Series tournament in 2012, Mr. Palaniuk\u2019s fortunes have risen. He was crowned Angler of the Year in 2017, and his annual sponsorship earnings have increased to the six figures, he said. He rarely checks into the Tundra Suites anymore, sleeping instead in a 43-foot camper he hauls from competition to competition with his girlfriend and their dog.Much of his success with sponsors derives from his social-media savvy. Mr. Palaniuk, who often fishes in flat-brimmed ball caps and hoodies, paid $73,000 last year for a cameraman and a boat driver to shadow him during every tournament he fished. He packaged the footage into dramatic videos set to electronic and hip-hop music, which he uploaded to YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. This year, Go RVing, a coalition of RV manufacturers, dealers and campgrounds, helped offset those costs for him.Some fishermen, like Ott DeFoe, Brandon Lester and Bradley Roy, pay companies such as Pro Fishing Management to consult on their social-media strategy and produce annual reports for sponsors, which list their social-media, television and print impressions and can exceed 140 pages.Other anglers depend on their spouses to manage their business affairs. The spouses maintain sponsor relationships, negotiate contracts, field media requests and often select what photos and videos to upload on social media.LeAnn Swindle, who is married to the 23-year BASS veteran Gerald Swindle, keeps a traveling office in her RV, complete with a scanner to keep documents from her husband\u2019s 19 sponsors straight.Becky Iaconelli, who is married to Mike Iaconelli, an angler known as Ike, is particularly busy. As her children, Stella, 6, and Vegas, 7, clambered over her, Mrs. Iaconelli explained how she balances the Ike Foundation, which encourages fishing and outdoor recreation in urban areas; the Bass University, an educational effort; and Mr. Iaconelli\u2019s social media accounts, for which she oversees strategy. With a team of 13, she also runs Professional Edge Fishing, a marketing agency that represents three anglers in addition to her husband.Everyone I spoke to in professional bass fishing agreed that BASS has a tough few years ahead of it, with dozens of its biggest personalities gone, but would ultimately survive. The organization is not only a pro tour; it has amateur competitions and membership rolls of some 500,000 people.In September, I reached Mr. VanDam in Missouri, a few days after he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. As far as he was concerned, he said, BASS would continue to be the \u201ckeeper of the culture.\u201dI never told him about the bananas.Advertisement"}

No charges have been filed against Michael Dunn, a city commissioner in Lakeland, which is about 35 miles east of Tampa. He took office in January.The Lakeland Police Department, which responded to the shooting, released the video after it received several inquiries.\u201cWe just felt that keeping it secret any longer did not benefit the investigation,\u201d Jacob Orr, an assistant state\u2019s attorney, said of the release of the video in an interview on Monday.According to the police, the shooting happened after Christobal Lopez, 50, entered the shop, an Army-Navy surplus store at 819 North Florida Avenue, on Oct. 3 with his father. Both were described by the police as transient and had been in Lakeland for about a month, Gary Gross, a public information officer for the police department, said on Monday.As Mr. Lopez\u2019s father was making a purchase, Mr. Dunn, 47, told the police, he saw Mr. Lopez take and conceal a hatchet. Mr. Dunn stopped Mr. Lopez and asked him if he was going to pay for the item, the police said.The surveillance video shows Mr. Dunn as he tried to stop Mr. Lopez from leaving the store, pulling at his shirt sleeve before shooting him.Mr. Dunn\u2019s lawyer, James Franklin, who goes by Rusty, confirmed that Mr. Dunn had shot Mr. Lopez with a Glock handgun, but refrained from making any additional comments until the investigation concludes.According to a police report, a call about the shooting came in a little after 2:30 p.m., and Mr. Lopez was declared dead less than 10 minutes later.In an interview on Monday, Mr. Hilton said he had been driving his car when a bullet hit his back seat and his elbow. He said he did not know Mr. Dunn at the time and they ended up settling a lawsuit. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him, he didn\u2019t know me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just was shooting.\u201dProsecutors, the police and Mr. Dunn\u2019s lawyer said they could not comment on the matter.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Taste of Marrakesh", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "Personal JourneysThe ancient Moroccan city is being reinvigorated by local entrepreneurs opening their own cafes, bars and riads, while embracing tradition.Supported byTwenty years after my first visit, some things about Marrakesh remain remarkably similar. The medina \u2014 the labyrinthine old part of the city \u2014 is still partly populated by stooped men in djellabas and the occasional donkey-led cart. The late afternoon light hits the high walls of its alleys in warming hues of yellow and orange. It still feels, at times, that everyone wants to sell you something.Around dusk, the Jemaa el Fna, the medina\u2019s main square, still goes through the same transformation: Juice vendors and the occasional snake charmer are replaced by a dizzying array of food stalls and circles of musicians.Perhaps the most transformative change: Twenty years ago, I struggled to connect, using my barely conversational French; now almost anyone under the age of 35 or 40 speaks English (and, often, not French).But I could never get Marrakesh and Morocco out of my head. Soon after my trip, I started working at The New York Times and, years later, as an editor in the Travel section. This time, I could return as a journalist.Since my first trip, Marrakesh has become Morocco\u2019s premier tourist city. For decades it has attracted travelers, though at a much smaller scale. \u201cEverybody knows everybody else in Marrakesh,\u201d wrote the English author Peter Mayne in his 1953 memoir, \u201cA Year in Marrakesh.\u201d \u201cAt least everybody knows everyone who lives here \u2014 the tourists who come in for a look at the city and a taste of its delights don\u2019t count, except to have francs taken off them.\u201dBut unlike cosmopolitan Casablanca, or Tangier, which, being a short ferry ride away from Spain, had the chaotic transience of a border town, Marrakesh has stayed both exciting and accessible for Western travelers.In Morocco\u2019s \u201cJewel of the South,\u201d the streets and bazaars spill over with artistry, whether it be in architecture, cuisine, crafts or fine art.Twenty years ago, I spent most of my time with nonnative travelers: a couple of strong-willed Italian women whom I met haggling in the medina; two Japanese women that we joined up with for a trek into the Sahara, the last part by camel; Spanish students on a budget even tighter than mine (one night we dined on canned tuna and r\u2019ghayef, Moroccan flatbread, on a medina sidewalk).This time around, I desperately wanted to connect with native Moroccans who were doing interesting, creative things. I discovered a vibrant cultural scene, one filled with men and women who care deeply about celebrating their city and country \u2014 but who are fighting an uphill battle against a lack of support from the Moroccan government and that influx of expats.Over tea and Moroccan pastries, I asked Mr. Ait Ben Abdallah, 56, who owns six riads around the medina (and another in Fez; he rents the Dar Cherifa space), if he was the exception or the rule as a native riad owner. The exception, he said, estimating that 90 to 95 percent are owned by foreigners. But that didn\u2019t exactly bother him.\u201cThirty years ago, Moroccans didn\u2019t want to live in the medina,\u201d he said in French, as Abdellah translated. The foreigners, he said, were helping support an infrastructure \u2014 and moreover, the very existence of the medina, where centuries-old properties were being destroyed. \u201cI would sell riads to the devil if it helped me get Moroccans to open their eyes to how the medina is being destroyed.\u201dMr. Ait Ben Abdallah was born outside the city and moved to his aunt\u2019s house in the medina at age 7. As a successful entrepreneur, he now wanted to give back, not just by renovating riads, but by educating children in his hometown, where he runs cultural events that provide arts education. He employs about 120 people at his properties, and at Dar Cherifa, he hosts free readings, a restaurant and exhibitions.\u201cWorking in heritage is important,\u201d he said, smiling broadly, \u201cbut creating jobs really matters more.\u201dA few of the women brought in a large tray, singing a joyful prayer as they did, and we sat down to a feast of couscous. We dug in as Ms. El Falahi, told us her tale.A decade ago, the village had been populated by drug users and delinquents. She called the authorities and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bulldozer and we\u2019re going to build a co-op.\u201d To everyone\u2019s astonishment, she did just that. She now employs 40 women (some of whom, in this traditional community, had previously not been allowed to even leave their homes), sent 30 of them to earn their degrees, and has opened 19 more cooperatives around the country. The co-op has since received funding from the National Initiative for Human Development; it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that they make a gluten-free couscous for the royal family.Barom\u00e8tre is the brainchild of two Marrakeshis, Hamza and Soufiane Hadni, brothers who opened the bar and restaurant in 2016. Soufiane, 34, is tall, with a ponytail and a pokerfaced expression. Hamza, 29, is shorter and a smooth talker. They both wore beards and the sort of structural glasses you might find on an architect.Before opening Barom\u00e8tre, neither had any experience at bars. \u201cWe had this dream of doing something together,\u201d Hamza said, as Abdellah and I surveyed the bar, which was stocked with syrups, infusions and garnishes. The dream had been accomplished: The place is popular with both locals and tourists.Both the menu and glassware (each glass paired to a specific cocktail) were elaborate almost to the point of absurdity. I chose the Churchill, an old-fashioned variation made with cognac, whiskey, thyme honey, orange, cinnamon and date-nut smoke, the last of which was created by torching the nuts, then lowering a glass to contain the smoke.I had to give the Hadni brothers points for passion and ambition, especially considering their limitations (every drink involving whiskey used Jack Daniel\u2019s; spirits are hard to come by in Morocco). But my inner cocktail snob couldn\u2019t help but note that spirits were measured with a jigger, while juices and infusions were not; and my Manhattan variation (with a syrup made from local carob) was not sufficiently diluted. There is also an impressive food menu \u2014 I had mhamsa (a type of Moroccan pasta) made risotto-style, with clams and a saffron emulsion \u2014 by the Marrakeshi chef, Badr Chguifi.Still, it was clear the brothers shared a quality with everyone I met on my trip. \u201cThe common thing among all these people,\u201d said Abdellah, between sips of a Casablanca beer, \u201ceveryone is passionate about what they do.\u201dI ducked into a courtyard that was whitewashed and pleasantly spartan, and was greeted by Laila Hida, 34, who founded the space in 2013. We sat down at a wooden table in the middle of the courtyard; pieces of art of various sorts \u2014 photographic, multimedia, sculptural \u2014 were scattered on the walls. Ms. Hida is taciturn in a thoughtful way, with long, dark hair and a mischievous smile.Le 18 had begun as a way to connect young artistic Marrakeshi. \u201cLittle by little the community got bigger,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cWithout choosing to become a cultural space, that\u2019s what we became.\u201d Within the first year, Le 18 hosted about 20 events \u2014 and now presents exhibitions, talks, performances and screenings. It has also just put out its first magazine, Chergui (named after a warm wind from the Sahara) \u2014 \u201cwithout anything, without money\u201d from the government, she added.\u201cNo one will help you from the state, from the ministries,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cThere is no place for organizations, for artists that are not within the voice that the states wants to bring up.\u201dStill, Ms. Hida and other creative types reflect the medina\u2019s energy, at turns frenetic and languid. \u201cIt\u2019s a great richness, being in the medina,\u201d she said, as we lunched on kefta tagine. \u201cIt\u2019s made us think about how to be humble.\u201dAfter my meeting with Ms. Hida, I headed back to the Jemaa el Fna for a final dinner. I watched as its daily transformation began: juice vendors making way for sellers of snail soup and sheep\u2019s head. The sun went down and the square swarmed with activity. It all felt surprisingly familiar.An earlier version of this article misstated Abdellatif Ait Ben Abdallah\u2019s relationship to the Marrakesh riad Dar Cherifa. He rents the space, he does not own it. (He does own seven other properties, six in Marrakesh and one in Fez.)Dan Saltzstein, a former editor in Travel, is interim editorial director for Special Projects at The Times.Advertisement"}

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Whitney Richardson, an events manager for The Times in London, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Q. What tech do you use to put together events?From my phone, I can share files with multiple clients with Google folders and I can manage my budget in Google sheets. I\u2019ve used Google forms to quickly collect feedback from attendees of events I produced. For presentations, I use Google slides (and begin brainstorming while on the commute to work).

What do you think will stick around?We are in a renaissance period of photography, when technology is ultimately changing the way humans relate to imagery. Photos are no longer used just as a way to capture a moment. They are an actual form of communication.What do you wish would go away?I want portable 360-degree video cameras to take a break until we can figure out how to scale them without completely compromising image resolution. I don\u2019t think they have found that sweet spot just yet.Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?In my daily life, I cannot live without my Bose wireless noise-canceling headphones. I hesitated getting them for a while, but my husband got them for me as a gift and I will never go back to normal earphones. (No more cords!) I also have several portable mirror sets with LED bulbs, which I pack when I am traveling to help with makeup application and general skin care.And when my husband and I travel, we love using Airbnb. We have actually gone on a vacation planned around an Airbnb location because we were interested in the living space and wanted to experience it. Like most new businesses in the gig economy, it is shaking up the hotel industry in a good way, I think, and allowing people alternative ways to experience new cities in unexpected ways.You\u2019re new to London.

He was so big, the nurse said, that he was going to become a football player.At that moment, Ms. Okobi, 44, said she knew she had to get out of America, a country in which being big and black often meant being at a greater risk of having a fatal encounter with law enforcement. \u201cThey\u2019re already talking about him as if he\u2019s big and intimidating,\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cI can\u2019t raise a black son in America. I don\u2019t have that kind of fortitude.\u201dMs. Okobi left for London four years ago with her husband and three children, finding a comfort she felt was elusive at home. But two weeks ago she received a call from her mother. Ms. Okobi\u2019s youngest brother, Chinedu Valentine Okobi, 36, had gotten into a struggle with police officers in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was hit with a stun gun, and died.\u201cThere was something about that call that felt inevitable, because it was something that I was running away from,\u201d Ms. Okobi said.As Ms. Okobi and her family prepare to bury and memorialize her brother on Tuesday, the case is drawing attention not only because it is yet another instance of a black man dying at the hands of the police, but also for its proximity to the Silicon Valley tech bubble.Ms. Okobi, whose parents are from Nigeria, is Facebook\u2019s public policy director for Africa. In the wake of her brother\u2019s killing, every senior leader at the company, including Mark Zuckerberg, has reached out to her to show support, she said. Current and former Facebook colleagues have used their connections to help spread her brother\u2019s story among activists and the news media.Much of what happened in the death of Mr. Okobi remains unclear. The encounter with the police on Oct. 3 started when a San Mateo County sheriff\u2019s deputy saw Mr. Okobi walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in Millbrae, Calif., said Stephen M. Wagstaffe, the San Mateo district attorney, whose office is investigating the case. When the deputy approached Mr. Okobi, he \u201cimmediately assaulted the deputy,\u201d according to a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office.At least five deputies were involved in a struggle with Mr. Okobi, who was hit with a Taser and died at the hospital, the authorities said. At least two deputies fired their Tasers with a total of four discharges between them, Mr. Wagstaffe said.It was not easy to determine what role the Tasers played in Mr. Okobi\u2019s death, Mr. Wagstaffe said. There is also a different standard for an officer pulling the trigger of a gun \u2014 for fear of life or great bodily injury \u2014 versus a Taser.\u201cA Taser is not defined in California law as lethal force,\u201d Mr. Wagstaffe said. \u201cThe reality is it\u2019s supposed to be the opposite. It\u2019s supposed to be nonlethal force.\u201dStill, an officer needs to have good reason to deploy a Taser, he said. \u201cIt has to be because he is seeking to gain control of a person who is physically resisting them,\u201d Mr. Wagstaffe said, rather than someone who is simply mouthing off.Mr. Wagstaffe said that in his roughly four decades as a San Mateo prosecutor, the office had investigated about four fatal instances of police use of Tasers, but never filed charges.John Burris, a lawyer for Mr. Okobi\u2019s family, questioned why the officers used force against Mr. Okobi in the first place when he did not appear to be committing any significant crimes. Mr. Burris said he was still trying to piece together the details of what happened, but a video that he said he received from a witness captured the later part of the police encounter.\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s on the ground, he\u2019s being Tased, he\u2019s shouting, \u2018What did I do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Burris said. \u201cHe ultimately gets away from that. He\u2019s running. He looks like he\u2019s running for his life.\u201dA dapper dresser with strong opinions and a knack for challenging norms, Mr. Okobi, who leaves behind a 12-year-old daughter, was very much a family man, his sister said. When their parents divorced when he was young, some of his older siblings did not keep in close touch with their father, but Mr. Okobi made it a point to maintain a close relationship.Mr. Okobi graduated from Morehouse College with a degree in business administration and had big ambitions. That changed about a decade ago, when he began struggling with mental health issues, Ms. Okobi said. He was able to manage his condition, but relatives feared that he had stopped taking his medication earlier this year.Ms. Okobi said that she hoped her brother\u2019s death would help make the issue of police killings more relevant to privileged people, including those in Silicon Valley who might feel distant from these issues.\u201cThere is nothing that will make my brother\u2019s death worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to the extent to which this can help people understand and feel connected to this as a problem, at least then we can try and find some meaning.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Follow John Eligon on Twitter: @jeligon.Advertisement"}

Each puzzle will focus on a different aspect of California life, covering everything from Silicon Valley to sauvignon blanc, and will come with the signature wit and sophistication you expect from the Times crossword.Proposition C proposes a tax increase on San Francisco\u2019s largest businesses in order to fund resources for the homeless.The fight pits tech executives who believe their businesses will be unfairly affected against other industry power players who think that tech has a duty to address the stark income inequality that it has contributed to in San Francisco.The result has been a weeklong Twitter feud between Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, who is spending more than $2 million to support Proposition C, and Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and the payments processor Square, who opposes the measure. Although Mr. Dorsey has been the most outspoken opponent in the tech industry of Proposition C, Visa and the payment start-up Stripe are also spending big on the opposition campaign.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time thinking of a precedent for multiple billionaire C.E.O.s to be publicly debating a ballot measure,\u201d said Evan Owski, a software engineer who is working on the Yes on C campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s forced a lot of people in the tech community who ordinarily wouldn\u2019t think about this issue to start thinking about what side they\u2019re on.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Benioff said that homelessness had become a crisis in San Francisco and that Proposition C, which would nearly double the city\u2019s budget for addressing the issue, was a necessary step. But Mr. Dorsey argued that the tax would unfairly affect payment companies like Square. He said the city needed to give its newly elected mayor, London Breed, a chance to deliver on her campaign promises to quell homelessness.Jess Montejano, a spokesman for the No on C campaign, said tech companies \u201cunderstand that more money alone is not the answer to our city\u2019s most pressing issue.\u201dA number of local politicians, including Ms. Breed, have publicly opposed the measure, although polling conducted by the No campaign in early September indicated voters favored Proposition C by a slim margin. If passed on Nov. 6, opponents say it would be the largest tax increase in the city\u2019s history.\u201cWe need to invest more in homelessness, and we may need to raise taxes to do that, but this is not the right way to do it,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a California state senator who opposes the measure. \u201cInstead of scapegoating one industry, we need to look in the mirror and say, \u2018What did we do to get here, and how do we make it better?\u2019\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)What would you do with $1.6 billion?The next Mega Millions drawing is Tuesday \u2014 and the jackpot may rise even more by then.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

You wouldn\u2019t know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table.Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant\u2019s service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square.Just how vast Mr. Johnson\u2019s scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called \u201cIt Was All a Dream,\u201d after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.)There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly.Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen.And as you\u2019re adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky pur\u00e9e of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea.Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it\u2019s going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample.Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls.Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago.Henry\u2019s shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic \u201cHarlem curry,\u201d informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough.The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican conc\u00f3n had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to.Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies.I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you\u2019d be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling.True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that\u2019s a rare trick.An earlier version of this review misstated the phone number for Henry at Life Hotel by JJ. It is 212-615-9910.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrant Caravan Driven by Hope but Uncertain of Success", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUIXTLA, Mexico \u2014 Soon after dawn on Tuesday, the mayor stood on the central plaza of his town here in southern Mexico and took stock.Thousands of migrants \u2014 men, women, entire families \u2014 had wandered into town the day before, many on foot, and turned the humble commercial district into a vast makeshift encampment. They had filled every square foot of the plaza, including its bandshell, and jammed the sidewalks and storefronts, sprawling on cardboard, blankets, plastic sheeting and spare clothes.\u201cThis is straight-up biblical,\u201d said Julio Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, 43, a Guatemalan traveling with his wife, their 1-year-old son and a cousin. They spent part of the night on sheets of cardboard in the central square.Nearby, two pairs of jeans had been hung to dry on the bust of Venustiano Carranza, a hero of the Mexican Revolution. Municipal trash cans were buried under mounds of garbage.But the town\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Laparra Calder\u00f3n, was upbeat, even cheerful.\u201cThese people are fleeing from the poverty of their countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are working people. They aren\u2019t bringing bombs. They want to improve their lives.\u201d He added, \u201cWe want to make their passage through here as agreeable for them as possible.\u201dTuesday was Day 12 of the migrant caravan, which began in Honduras and has grown in size and force like an avalanche, pushing north toward the United States.In cities and villages, along rural byways and in town squares, the migration has been propelled by an outpouring of support \u2014 from the local authorities, community groups and individuals who have handed out free food and water, secondhand clothes, diapers, blankets and loose change to help the procession move northward.The migrants, some wearing whatever they had on when they decided to leave behind Central America, many walking in flimsy shoes and flip-flops, are determined to make it to the border of the United States. Traveling in such a large group, they say, is much safer than braving the many dangers of the road alone.By some estimates, the caravan numbers more than 7,000; officials here in Huixtla estimated that about 5,000 had spent Monday night in their town.Some plan to apply for asylum in the United States, while others know that their only chance of entry is the illegal way. Still others haven\u2019t thought that far ahead, at least not in any detail.By now, most if not all have heard about President Trump\u2019s attacks on the caravan, his threats to militarize the border, and the difficulties of gaining legal access to the United States.But in interviews, scores of migrants seemed driven by a kind of blind faith, born of desperation, that this is their best chance to escape the poverty, violence and hardship they knew at home and to build better lives. The first thing they need to do, they say, is to get to the border.Josu\u00e9 Rosales, 28, from Honduras, said that he was unsure whether the caravan would make it all the way to the border and be able to cross into the United States. Still, he felt he had no choice but to try: In Honduras, he had no steady job and he\u2019d been robbed in the streets.\u201cIf God\u2019s willing, the president will give us permits to work in the United States,\u201d he said.Many of the caravan\u2019s participants seemed unaware that their migration had become a focal point in the American midterm elections. Many said they did not even know that the United States was voting in a matter of weeks, and that their trek north had become such a contentious part of the election.\u201cThe bottom line is, most people in Honduras frankly could not care less about elections in the U.S.,\u201d said Oscar Chac\u00f3n, the executive director of Alianza Americas, a Chicago-based network of American immigrant groups, who was meeting with advocates in Central America this week.\u201cWhen you are desperate, you believe in miracles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey truly hope that by making this show of collectiveness, by joining this caravan, somebody\u2019s heart will be touched and a miracle will happen.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out at the caravan, saying, \u201cWe cannot allow our country to be violated like this.\u201d But he also acknowledged that he had no proof for his earlier claim on Twitter that there were \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d in the caravan, though he then added that \u201cthere could very well could be.\u201d No government agency has confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim.Vice President Mike Pence said that the migrants had been organized \u201cby leftist groups\u201d and funded by Venezuela, and that \u201cit is inconceivable that there would not be individuals from the Middle East as part of this growing caravan.\u201dDespite their characterization, scores of interviews with the migrants showed them to be largely adults from Central America looking for work, including many traveling with family members. Many were apparently scraping by on what little money they brought from home or on handouts from strangers along the way, undercutting any suggestion of foreign funding for a mass migration.The caravan seems to have been spurred, if anything, by internal Honduran disputes. Only since then has it been swept into American politics, largely by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.The migrant caravan began as others had \u2014 as a small group, taking off early in the morning from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Oct. 12. Facebook messages and fliers disseminated by advocates and migrants got the word out weeks before the caravan was set to take off, priming others to join forces.But what began as a modest group quickly swelled. One Honduran pro-government television station began covering the migration, citing claims that a leftist opposition activist, Bartolo Fuentes, was paying for the food and transportation of migrants. The publicity, migrants said, encouraged many to join.Mr. Fuentes denies it. But he and at least one other leftist politician did indeed post messages denouncing conditions in Honduras and blaming their government. \u201cWe are not going because we want to,\u201d read one flier he shared on Facebook. \u201cThe violence and poverty expels us.\u201dMany participants joined the caravan on impulse.Ronald Borjas, a Honduran migrant, was staying with his mother when he heard about the caravan on television. \u201cI packed my backpack and hugged my mother and left,\u201d he recalled.Most, it appears, are heading to the United States for the first time, though a sizable contingent are deportees trying to get back. Many said the decision to leave their homeland, even if arrived at quickly, was aching.\u201cIt hurts me,\u201d said Kilber Martinez, 26, a Honduran migrant, riding in the back of a pickup truck, overpacked with more than two dozen young men. \u201cThe land where you were born is like the mother.\u201dAt the wheel of Mr. Martinez\u2019s truck was Andr\u00e9s Orozco, a primary-school teacher in Huixtla. After the school day had ended on Monday, he grabbed his brother-in-law\u2019s truck and headed out along the highway to ferry migrants into the town. He planned to shuttle back and forth \u201cuntil the gas ran out.\u201dDespite attempts by the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico to impede its progress, the caravan has continued, moving organically like this, without any apparent master plan or declared organizers, and slowed only by human frailty.When the exhausted migrants streamed into Huixtla on Monday afternoon, the town\u2019s officials directed them to a sprawling sports complex already stockpiled with bottled water, thousands of sandwiches, medical crews and security.A nurse said she treated people for blisters, sunburn and dehydration. One man, a diabetic, wanted to check his blood sugar level. But the most serious dangers of the trek became very real with the news that a migrant had died after falling off the back of a crowded truck.In the central plaza, migrants strung up plastic sheeting for shelter between trees and lamp posts, just in time for a light rain. Others prepared for the evening by seeking shelter in a covered outdoor basketball court, in a Catholic church and in the shuttered doorways of shops throughout the central commercial district.A group from a Christian radio station brought huge pots of spaghetti, beans and rice. A preacher showed up, and some migrants knelt around him.Rafael G\u00f3mez Borraz, the owner of Pao\u2019s Restaurant, distributed plates of rice and beans. In the 1990s he had worked in the United States, washing dishes and laying tile alongside Central Americans, he said. That made him more sympathetic to the plight of the caravan\u2019s members.\u201cPeople are afraid that gangs might have infiltrated the group,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these are good people.\u201dLater, a local cumbia band started playing and several migrants, somehow marshaling their energy after many days of grueling travel, danced.Some migrants bathed in a nearby river, including Kinzinyer Gabriela Hernandez, 17, a Honduran migrant who was traveling with her 2-year-old daughter and 16-year-old sister.\u201cMy husband knows that we\u2019re on our way, but not exactly where we are,\u201d said Ms. Hernandez, who said she was named after Henry Kissinger, the former United States secretary of state. \u201cGod gives me the faith to keep going.\u201dAzam Ahmed contributed reporting from Mexico City, Elisabeth Malkin from Guadalajara, and Katie Rogers from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mild Cauliflower Makes for an Easygoing Dinner Partner", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenThe classic mixture of anchovies, capers and olives add deep flavors to this cauliflower salad.One easy and delicious way to prepare cauliflower is to steam or boil it, then anoint it. Cook thick slices until just done and arrange them on a plate. Drizzle them with fruity extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. This is a subtle but satisfying option.But cauliflower, like many other vegetables, benefits from high heat, which brings out its sweet disposition. From a pan or hot oven, the heat allows the vegetable to caramelize and char.Then I whisked together a robust lemony dressing with the classic mixture of anchovies, capers and olives. With the cauliflower pieces well coated, I transferred the mixture to a baking dish and popped it, uncovered, into the oven.Twenty minutes was sufficient to intensify the seasoning, and to brown the cauliflower here and there, even letting it char a bit, for a rustic presentation with deep flavor.Mellow and gently charming, cauliflower pairs well with nearly everything, and this salad is no exception. Toss it with freshly cooked spaghetti, then shower it with grated pecorino and toasted bread crumbs. Try it as a warm almost-vegetarian main course, paired with rice pilaf, roasted sweet potatoes or saut\u00e9ed greens.Serve it hot or at room temperature. Make it a first course antipasto, finished with a flourish of extra-virgin olive oil. It could even grace a buffet table. It\u2019s also a simple make-ahead side dish to accompany a number of main courses, whether roast chicken, pork chops or fish fillets \u2014 a testament to its easygoing nature. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Faces Internal Backlash Over Handling of Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is struggling to contain a growing internal backlash over its handling of sexual harassment and its workplace culture.Google later said it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years; none received an exit package. Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai also issued apologies, with Mr. Pichai later saying his initial statement \u201cwasn\u2019t enough\u201d and apologizing again. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned on Tuesday and did not obtain an exit package.But employees\u2019 dissatisfaction has not subsided. On Thursday, more than 1,500 \u2014 most of them women \u2014 plan to walk out of almost two dozen company offices around the world to protest the treatment, organizers said.Google declined to comment.At a staff meeting last year, Google\u2019s founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, also struggled to answer a question about who their female role models were, said two employees who saw a video of the meeting.Mr. Brin tried to recall the name of a woman he had recently met at a company event who had impressed him, the people said. Mr. Page eventually reminded Mr. Brin that the woman\u2019s name was Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer. Mr. Page said his hero was Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google and Alphabet, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Last week, The Times reported that Google had paid Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile software, a $90 million exit package even after the company concluded that a harassment claim against him was credible. (Mr. Rubin has denied any misconduct and has said the report of his compensation is a \u201cwild exaggeration.\u201d) Google also paid millions of dollars in an exit package to another executive who was accused of harassment, and continued employing a third despite a harassment claim.\u201cI know this is really an exceptionally painful story for some of you, and I\u2019m really sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Page said at the time.The meeting did little to quell the anger. On Friday, Ms. Stapleton said, she created an internal mailing list to organize a walkout. More than 200 employees joined over the weekend, she said, and the numbers have since grown to more than 1,500.That same day, Mr. Pichai sent an apologetic email to employees saying he would support this week\u2019s protest. He said that some workers had already raised constructive ideas of how to improve policies around harassment and that he hoped to \u201cturn these ideas into action,\u201d according to the email, which was obtained by The Times.Employees organizing the walkout have called on Google to end the practice of private arbitration \u2014 which requires people to waive their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements \u2014 in cases of sexual assault and harassment. They also are demanding publication of a transparency report on instances of sexual harassment, more disclosure of salaries and compensation, an employee representative on the company\u2019s board and a chief diversity officer who could make recommendations directly to the board.Other employees said they were disappointed that senior executives such as David C. Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, who had a child with a female subordinate, and Mr. Brin, who had a public extramarital relationship with an employee, remained in influential positions. Some raised questions about whether it was appropriate for Eric Schmidt, the company\u2019s former chief executive and chairman, to remain on Alphabet\u2019s board after former and current employees said he had retained a mistress as a company consultant.Thursday\u2019s walkout is set to begin in Google\u2019s Tokyo office and then circle the globe, with employees leaving work around 11 a.m. in their time zones, Ms. Stapleton said. People can choose whether or not to return to work, she said.\u201cWhile Google has championed the language of diversity and inclusion, substantive actions to address systemic racism, increase equity and stop sexual harassment have been few and far between. ENOUGH,\u201d organizers of the walkout wrote on an internal website, which was viewed by The Times. \u201cTime\u2019s up at Google.\u201dKate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will There Be a Ban on Killer Robots?", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeaponsLONDON \u2014 An autonomous missile under development by the Pentagon uses software to choose between targets. An artificially intelligent drone from the British military identifies firing points on its own. Russia showcases tanks that don\u2019t need soldiers inside for combat.A.I. technology has for years led military leaders to ponder a future of warfare that needs little human involvement. But as capabilities have advanced, the idea of autonomous weapons reaching the battlefield is becoming less hypothetical.Without a nonproliferation agreement, some diplomats fear the world will plunge into an algorithm-driven arms race.In a speech at the start of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 25, Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres listed the technology as a global risk alongside climate change and growing income inequality.\u201cLet\u2019s call it as it is: The prospect of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is morally repugnant,\u201d Mr. Guterres said.Two weeks earlier, Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said the weapons \u201cimpact our collective security,\u201d and that decisions of life and death must remain in human hands.Twenty-six countries have called for an explicit ban that requires some form of human control in the use of force. But the prospects for an A.I. weapons ban are low. Several influential countries including the United States are unwilling to place limits while the technology is still in development.Diplomats have been unable to reach a consensus about how a global policy can be implemented or enforced. Some have called for a voluntary agreement, others want rules that are legally binding.A meeting of more than 70 countries organized by the United Nations in Geneva in August made little headway, as the United States and others said a better understanding of the technology was needed before sweeping restrictions can be made. Another round of talks are expected to be held later this year.Some have raised concerns that a ban will affect civilian research. Much of the most cutting-edge work in artificial intelligence and machine learning is from universities and companies such as Google and Facebook. But much of that technology can be adapted to military use.Major technical challenges remain before any robot weaponry reaches the battlefield. Maaike Verbruggen, a researcher at the Institute for European Studies who specializes in emerging military and security technology, said communication is still limited, making it hard for humans to understand why artificially intelligent machines make decisions. Better safeguards also are needed to ensure robots act as predicted, she said.But significant advancements will come in the next two decades, said Derrick Maple, an analyst who studies military spending for the market research firm Jane\u2019s by IHS Markit in London. As the technology changes, he said, any international agreement could be futile; countries will tear it apart in the event of war.\u201cYou cannot dictate the rules of engagement,\u201d Mr. Maple said. \u201cIf the enemy is going to do something, then you have to do something as well. No matter what rules you put in place, in a conflict situation the rules will go out the window.\u201dDefense contractors, identifying a new source of revenue, are eager to build the next-generation machinery. Last year, Boeing reorganized its defense business to include a division focused on drones and other unmanned weaponry. The company also bought Aurora Flight Sciences, a maker of autonomous aircrafts. Other defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems and Raytheon are making similar shifts.Mr. Maple, who has worked in the field for over four decades, estimates military spending on unmanned military vehicles such as drones and ships will top $120 billion over the next decade.No completely autonomous weapons are known to be currently deployed on the battlefield, but militaries have been using technology to automate for years. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air-defense system automatically detects and destroys incoming rockets. South Korea uses autonomous equipment to detect movements along the North Korean border.Mr. Maple expects more collaboration between humans and machines before there is an outright transfer of responsibility to robots. Researchers, for example, are studying how aircrafts and tanks can be backed by artificially intelligent fleets of drones.In 2016, the Pentagon highlighted its capabilities during a test in the Mojave Desert. More than 100 drones were dropped from a fighter jet in a disorganized heap, before quickly coming together to race toward and encircle a target. From a radar video shared by the Pentagon, the drones look like a flock of migrating starlings.There were no humans at the controls of the drones as they flew overhead, and the machines didn\u2019t look much different from those any person can buy from a consumer-electronics store. The drones were programmed to communicate with each other independently to collectively organize and reach the target.\u201cThey are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,\u201d William Roper, director of the Pentagon\u2019s strategic capabilities office, said at the time.To those fearful of the advancement of autonomous weapons, the implications were clear.\u201cYou\u2019re delegating the decision to kill to a machine,\u201d said Thomas Hajnoczi, the head of disarmament department for the Austrian government. \u201cA machine doesn\u2019t have any measure of moral judgment or mercy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterHealthy cells carry a surprising number of cancer-linked mutations, but they don\u2019t turn into tumors. What\u2019s holding them back?Cancer is a disease of mutations. Tumor cells are riddled with genetic mutations not found in healthy cells. Scientists estimate that it takes five to 10 key mutations for a healthy cell to become cancerous. Some of these mutations can be caused by assaults from the environment, such as ultraviolet rays and cigarette smoke. Others arise from harmful molecules produced by the cells themselves. In recent years, researchers have begun taking a closer look at these mutations, to try to understand how they arise in healthy cells, and what causes these cells to later erupt into full-blown cancer. The research has produced some major surprises. For instance, it turns out that a large portion of the cells in healthy people carry far more mutations than expected, including some mutations thought to be the prime drivers of cancer. These mutations make a cell grow faster than others, raising the question of why full-blown cancer isn\u2019t far more common. These lurking mutations went unnoticed for so long because the tools for examining DNA were too crude. If scientists wanted to sequence the entire genome of tumor cells, they had to gather millions of cells and analyze all of the DNA. A mutation, to be detectable, had to be very common.But as DNA sequencing grew more sophisticated, Dr. Martincorena and other researchers developed methods for detecting very rare mutations, and they began to wonder if those mutations might be found in healthy cells, hidden below the radar.Dr. Martincorena and his colleagues began their search in skin; its cells are battered daily by the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays, which trigger mutations. \u201cWe thought it was the lowest-hanging fruit,\u201d Dr. Martincorena said.In a study in 2015, he and his colleagues collected bits of skin left over from cosmetic surgeries to lift drooping eyelids. They examined 234 biopsies from four patients, each sample of skin about the size of a pinhead. They gently coaxed the top layers of cells, known as epithelial cells, from the underlying tissue.To find out, the researchers decided to study cells of the esophagus. The team gathered tissue samples from nine healthy organ donors who had died, then they sliced the tissue into dozens of tiny squares and examined the same 74 cancer-related genes. Dr. Martincorena and his colleagues found that new mutations arose more slowly in the esophagus than in skin. But once those mutations emerged, they caused the esophageal cells to multiply faster than normal esophageal cells. Over time, these rogue cells spread out across the esophagus, forming colonies of mutant cells, known as clones. Although these clones aren\u2019t cancer, they do exhibit one of cancer\u2019s hallmarks: rapid growth.By examining the mutations, the researchers were able to rule out external causes for them, like tobacco smoke or alcohol. Instead, the mutations seem to have arisen through ordinary aging. As the cells divided over and over again, their DNA sometimes was damaged. In other words, the rise of these mutations may just be an intrinsic part of getting older. \u201cIt seems that no matter how well one takes care of oneself by eating well, getting exercise and limiting certain vices, there\u2019s likely only so much one can do against the need of the body to replace its cells,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a cancer biologist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study.The study also raised questions about efforts to detect cancer at its earliest stages, when cancer cells are still rare, Dr. Kennedy said: \u201cJust because someone has mutations associated with cancer doesn\u2019t mean actually they have a malignancy.\u201dGiven the abundance of cancer mutations in healthy people, why isn\u2019t cancer more common? Dr. Martincorena speculated that a healthy body may be like an ecosystem: Perhaps clones with different mutations arise in it, compete for available space and resources, and keep each other in check.\u201cThere is no therapy being thought out in these terms now,\u201d said Dr. Martincorena. \u201cBut I think it opens up new avenues. I think knowledge is always a weapon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But there were almost none. I thought this was weird; I grew up in Miami, where for families like mine, who had fled Communist Cuba, putting up a yard sign declaring your political leanings was a privilege worth exercising.I asked about the lack of signage and was told it wasn\u2019t Nebraska Nice, meaning it\u2019s considered rude to talk bluntly about politics, and in Lincoln, that meant not displaying your voting preferences with a yard sign. You wouldn\u2019t want to offend your neighbors with a tangible demonstration of a strong opinion.In those months after the 2016 election, signs popped up around town that read, \u201cJesus, I Trust You\u201d \u2014 but I\u2019m positive no one named Jesus was on a ballot in Nebraska. I moved into my neighborhood in the spring of 2017. And this fall, the lawns aren\u2019t empty anymore. As we brace for the midterms, the citizens of Lincoln are working something out via their yard signs. I asked a born-and-raised Lincoln resident about the sign boom, about my sense that it was different from 2016. She said: \u201cThis is highly unusual for us. Something has definitely shifted.\u201dI have signs \u2014 yes, plural \u2014 in my yard. But I wasn\u2019t the first neighbor in the area to take a stand. That distinction goes to a resident who, in the days after the white supremacist rally last year in Charlottesville, Va., took down an American flag and replaced it with one that read \u201cTrump.\u201dAfter seeing the new flag while walking our dog, my partner and I ordered a sign, one that we hoped signaled our values in a mild way that would not irritate our new neighbors. It\u2019s a sign I consider pretty moderate by my standards, with statements like \u201cWater Is Life\u201d and \u201cLove Is Love\u201d and \u201cScience Is Real\u201d running down it.The sign was left pretty much undisturbed until just after 10 p.m. on the Fourth of July, when a middle-aged white man holding a red plastic Solo cup stepped into our yard and squatted in front of it. I looked out the window after hearing the man with him, who remained on the sidewalk, slur something \u2014 the sound of his voice made me stop folding laundry and raise the blinds. I could hear the squatting man reading the statements on the sign out loud and spitting after each one. When he got to \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d he said it like a question, and he jumped up and began kicking the sign.I turned on a few more lights to let him know someone in the house was watching. I yelled for my partner \u2014 who is, like me, a light-skinned Latino \u2014 and we watched for 30 seconds as this man continued to kick our sign, then stomp it and the flags down to the ground.My partner announced he\u2019d had enough, and he ran outside. The second the men saw him \u2014 shirtless and shouting, \u201cHey!\u201d\u2014 they ran away. So we went online and ordered a sign for Jane Raybould, her Democratic opponent, and waited for it to show up.Ours was the first Raybould sign to vanish. We woke to the bare metal posts sticking out of our lawn like downed branches. I joked online that our passive-aggressive sign war had just turned aggressive-aggressive. Within hours, I\u2019d replaced our stolen sign with three new ones. And I took a few others to houses in other neighborhoods whose residents said after I tweeted about the theft that they\u2019d take any extra ones off my hands.In every casual interaction over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve bucked Nebraska Nice \u2014 which never fit me to begin with \u2014 and I find a way to ask the people I\u2019m talking with if they\u2019re registered to vote. Some seem offended by the question, or maybe by the urgency with which I ask it. Even when they say yes, I ask: But are you sure? Can you double-check? It\u2019s not nice, and this time, that\u2019s absolutely necessary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Rocket Fails, and 2 Astronauts Make Safe Emergency Return", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs they hurtled toward space faster than a rifle bullet, an American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut were forced to make a harrowing but safe emergency landing on Thursday when the rocket carrying the two men and hundreds of tons of explosive fuel failed less than two minutes after liftoff.The Russian-built Soyuz capsule parachuted to Earth about 12 to 15 miles outside Zhezqazghan, a small city in central Kazakhstan. Neither of the crew members \u2014 Nick Hague of the United States or Aleksei Ovchinin of Russia \u2014 was injured, both the Russian and American space agencies said, and the two were rescued within an hour of their landing.The launch failure does not put the three astronauts aboard the International Space Station in any danger. They have plenty of food, water, air and other supplies. The station is a laboratory for science experiments that cannot be conducted in the pull of gravity, and NASA is using it as a testing ground for technologies for longer, farther voyages to the moon and Mars.But it could set off a sequence of events that leads in January to the station being emptied of all crew for the first time in 18 years.The launch mishap also occurred at a moment of transition in American-Russian space relations, and during the first visit of NASA\u2019s current administrator, Jim Bridenstine, with his Russian counterparts. With the United States contemplating an end to the space station\u2019s mission a decade from now, and some irritants arising in how the countries cooperate in orbit, both nations sought to emphasize that they would cooperate in investigating what caused the rocket to fail.According to a Russian space official cited by Interfax, \u201cthe emergency occurred 119 seconds into the flight, during the separation of the side boosters of the first stage from the central booster of the second stage.\u201d The second-stage booster rocket shut down.Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, anticipating a successful launch, had already posted a glowing description of the flight on its Facebook page when the problems occurred.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists in Moscow: \u201cThank God the cosmonauts are alive. This is the main thing.\u201dThe Russian space agency tweeted a picture of the two men sitting and speaking with Dmitri O. Rogozin, the head of the Russian agency.Soon after the incident, Russia announced that it was suspending missions to the International Space Station until the cause of the failure could be determined.The three astronauts currently on the space station \u2014 Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, Serena M. Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor of NASA and Sergey Prokopyev of Russia \u2014 arrived in June and had been scheduled to return in December. Their stay is now likely to be extended as the Soyuz is the only vehicle currently available to take people to and from space.But Soyuz capsules are rated to remain in orbit only about seven months. The one capsule docked now \u2014 and the crew\u2019s current ride home \u2014 has been there since June. Although the station is well stocked, the seven-month limitation means the astronauts would likely have to leave in early January.\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of margin on the other side of that,\u201d Kenneth Todd, the operations integration manager for the space station at NASA, said during a news conference. \u201cBut not a whole lot of margin.\u201dWithout a replacement crew, the station can be operated remotely from the ground. But an unlucky cascade of failures taking out a critical system and its backup could put it at risk.NASA was optimistic about the prospects, were such an event to occur.\u201cI feel very confident we could fly for a significant amount of time,\u201d Mr. Todd said. \u201cI\u2019m not too concerned about that as long as our systems continue to operate at the level they\u2019re at now.\u201dThe meeting of Mr. Rogozin and Mr. Bridenstine at the launch marked the start of talks on the future of the space relationship. The talks could culminate in a commitment for what NASA has proposed as a next step in human spaceflight, a station called Lunar Gateway to orbit the moon. Or it could end with the two countries headed in different directions.Mr. Rogozin, in an interview in late September, said Russia wants to continue the long partnership with the United States in space. But it could also turn to other emerging space nations like China.\u201cFor now, we discuss this very delicately,\u201d he said, of possibly working with China instead of the United States.\u201cBut if we don\u2019t get answers, or the answers are \u2018we will take our own road, thank you all, you are all free to go,\u2019 then, of course, we will quickly activate our contacts with China,\u201d he added.Soyuz rockets, in various versions, have been the mainstay of the Soviet and Russian space programs since the 1960s, and they have reliably carried astronauts into space with no fatal failures.In 1983, a Soyuz caught fire and exploded on the launchpad, but two astronauts were safely carried away by the spacecraft\u2019s escape system. Another Soyuz failed in flight in 1975, but as it did today, the escape system lifted the astronauts it carried to safety.Other Russian rockets ferrying goods aloft in recent years have had a checkered record, including the Progress, which is almost identical to the Soyuz rocket. In December 2016, a Progress carrying 2.6 tons of food, fuel and supplies \u2014 but no astronauts \u2014 to the space station failed to reach orbit and largely burned up in the atmosphere as it fell back down. In 2015, another Progress cargo ship spun out of control, and was also destroyed as it fell back to Earth.Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Who Will Teach Silicon Valley to Be Ethical?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome think chief ethics officers could help technology companies navigate political and social questions. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. I think we can all agree that Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision right about now.Is the solution for its companies to hire a chief ethics officer?While some tech companies like Google have top compliance officers and others turn to legal teams to police themselves, no big tech companies that I know of have yet taken this step. But a lot of them seem to be talking about it, and I\u2019ve discussed the idea with several chief executives recently. Why? Because slowly, then all at once, it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds.It\u2019s probably no surprise, considering the complex problems the tech industry faces. As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank\u2019s giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape \u2014 $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis\u2019 funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It\u2019s an ethical swamp out there.That\u2019s why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business \u2014 like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border.Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues. At a recent company event, he elaborated: \u201cWe can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.\u201d23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer. In an interview I did this week with its chief executive, Anne Wojcicki, she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates, but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues. She acknowledged that the collection of DNA data is rife with ethical considerations, but said, \u201cI think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set, rather than just hire one person to determine this.\u201dWhen asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics, some point out that legal or diversity/inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top \u2014 the chief executive.Also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or, worse, get steamrollered. And, if the person was bad at the job, of course, it could drag the whole thing down.How can an industry that, unlike other business sectors, persistently promotes itself as doing good, learn to do that in reality? Do you want to not do harm, or do you want to do good? These are two totally different things.And how do you put an official ethical system in place without it seeming like you\u2019re telling everyone how to behave? Who gets to decide those rules anyway, setting a moral path for the industry and \u2014 considering tech companies\u2019 enormous power \u2014 the world.Like I said, adult supervision. Or maybe, better still, Silicon Valley itself has to grow up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

But behind the drunken antics at the Deni Ute Muster, a network of friendship is lifting awareness of mental health issues.Supported byDENILIQUIN, Australia \u2014 It\u2019s been called the most debauched outdoor party in Australia: a wild, rollicking weekend where rural masculinity is on display and beer and banter flow endlessly.But for the Thompsons, the event carries more weight and meaning. They first went to the party, the Deni Ute Muster, three years ago, not long after losing their son, Bryan, to suicide.Bryan\u2019s mother, Lyn Thompson, 54, said she just knew it was his kind of festival. She pulled some faded pictures from her wallet, showing a son who had been eager to grow up, she said \u2014 a tall, 24-year-old bricklayer raising three children in small-town Australia with a heavy burden of responsibility.\u201cWhen we\u2019re here, he\u2019s with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re anywhere he\u2019s with us. But especially here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not just a music festival,\u201d said Vicky Lowry, the Deni Ute Muster\u2019s general manager. \u201cIt is a celebration of rural Australia, it brings it all together.\u201dThat Aussie ideal was on display even before the festivities officially started as young men arrived in utes crammed with camping gear and beer, honking, whooping and waving from the windows.By last Friday morning, the area was blanketed with dust as utes skidded around in circles, with judges awarding points for skill and crowd reaction. Among the fans was a group of young men and women from a rural part of the state of Victoria. They had made bets on how many children would be conceived at the muster. \u201cI was being nice and said a thousand this year,\u201d said Karly Mitchell, 20.Many of their fathers were prone to bottling their emotions, they said, but among themselves there was a greater awareness of mental health issues. And technology, they said, was essential in their support networks.For some, the kind of communication fostered by internet access is hard to come by. At a bull-riding pen where young cowboys in bright shirts and white hats greased their ropes, I met Kurt Jamison, 24, who said he lived at a remote, 1,600-acre cattle station where until recently, there was no Wi-Fi. Sometimes, he said, he would go two weeks without seeing another person.\u201cYou end up talking to yourself,\u201d he said, as he leaned on the white gate bordering the bullpen. \u201cYou talk to your dogs.\u201dFor a few months last year, he said his depression worsened and he began drinking to cope with loneliness. But he said he was used to hiding his feelings. \u201cEven at school I was the school clown \u2014 but inside I was hating it,\u201d he said.\u201cI just messaged him back saying, \u2018Mate, everything\u2019s going to be all right,\u2019\u201d he said, a beer in hand. He said he stayed in touch with the man, just to see how things are going.\u201cThey just think we\u2019re all ferals,\u201d he said, referring to people who saw the festival as nothing more than a rowdy beerfest. \u201cBut really, you come here, it\u2019s just a good atmosphere. It\u2019s lovely.\u201dThe festival\u2019s endurance may lie in its adaptability. In the last few years, it has leaned toward being more family focused, inviting a wider scope of musicians and providing more activities. It has also limited the amount of alcohol allowed in and is now working more closely with the local police.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to evolve and move with the times,\u201d said Ms. Lowry, the festival\u2019s general manager.Many of the farmers who attended looked pleased, though in some cases the openness seemed limited to the muster itself. Feelings of discontent were evident among the crowd, which was overwhelmingly white. More than a few people had tags on their hats with a pointed message: \u201cOur land, our country, our way.\u201d In some conversations, pride and struggle had a way of edging into populist nationalism.\u201cThis is the worst season of drought we\u2019ve had for a long time. How many nations overseas have offered aid to our farmers?\u201d said Jamie Heyde, an ex-serviceman with a bear tattoo on his arm and an Amazon Kindle on his thigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t sit there and help someone else out if your footing is crumbling beneath you,\u201d he added.Mr. Heyde, who said he voted for Senator Pauline Hanson \u2014 Australia\u2019s main right-wing populist politician \u2014 said that he does not have a problem with immigration. But immigrants should be aware that they are \u201cAustralian first and foremost,\u201d he said.Later that night, Ms. Underwood, the American country star, sang of cowboys, mothers, love and land. For those at the show, just being with so many people from similar backgrounds seemed to be a relief.There were no cows to be milked and no sheep to be shorn, no drought to worry over. Thousands of people roamed the ute paddock. Dozens of fires sent up black smoke as men revved their utes until they backfired.More quietly, men and women in scuffed jeans could be seen taking pictures of the sunset and offering each other beers. They cheered as a woman in a pink vest, who produced a pair of bagpipes, began playing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\u201cThis is my main family. This is a family section to me,\u201d Rhys Martini, 24, said hoarsely as he stood in front of his ute, which had a row of bras across the bumper. \u201cReal brothers and sisters here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They face highly motivated, well-resourced \u201cunion avoidance firms\u201d that deploy any means possible to prevent workers from organizing. This same billionaire class, including some of the very same funders behind the Federalist Society\u2019s list of judges handed to their populist front \u2014 the president \u2014 first perfected warfare against workplace democracy, i.e., unions. Billionaires unleashed these methods and machinery against American democracy in the midterms of 2010 and 2014, culminating in the 2016 national election.Because the very tactics long used against workers in workplace elections have now been exported to the broader electoral arena, it\u2019s important to understand three lessons about how to win by those of us who continue to achieve victory even when faced with a ruthless, break-all-the-rules, determined opposition.Second, you must build supermajority participation, because, as the election approaches, the opposition will succeed at stripping support from a key percentage of previous yes voters. All effort must be focused on what successful union organizers call \u201cgoing to the biggest-worst\u201d: spending all our time with workers who are undecided or leaning anti-union. The biggest mistake inexperienced union organizers make is spending precious time preaching to the choir, i.e., talking to pro-union activists.The activists, about a third of any work force, don\u2019t need attention. It\u2019s the workers who get misled by the consultant\u2019s lies who need focus and energy. These conversations are hard, so people avoid the urgent and instead do the easy (and lose). In hotly contested districts, building a supermajority means identifying the neighbor, congregant or family member who can help hold or move undecided or shaky voters (strangers simply can\u2019t do this) and making sure the conversations are happening. To win, forget wishful thinking and build to the number needed to win assuming you lose 10 points the days before the election.Third, to counteract the litany of outrageous lies from the employer\u2019s hired guns, it takes discipline to constantly connect the undecided and anti-union voters to the issues they themselves think matters most, like reasonable workload limits, on-the-job safety, putting sexually harassing managers in their place and the right to retire (to know this, you have to have asked them first). Union organizers help the voter realize that the union buster offers zero solutions. The most important aspect of defeating the avoidance specialists is to inoculate people against the opponents\u2019 lies before they start and throughout the campaign.Jane McAlevey is the author of, most recently, \u201cNo Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Seafloor Blob Became Mexico\u2019s \u2018Black Gold\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA frenzy for sea cucumbers, driven by demand in Asia, has brought their populations near collapse in the waters off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. R\u00cdO LAGARTOS, Mexico \u2014 It is not a glamorous creature.The sea cucumber, a relative of the starfish and sea urchin, isn\u2019t much more than a blob creeping across the ocean floor on tentacle-feet, munching on algae and plankton. The most interesting thing about the animal may be that some species defend themselves by ejecting respiratory tissues through the anus in the direction of the attacker.But here on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the un-charismatic sea cucumber has become so sought-after that the local populations of two species \u2014 Isostichopus badionotus and Holothuria floridana \u2014 have collapsed.The decline is largely the result of overfishing driven by high demand in Asia, where dried sea cucumbers are eaten as a delicacy and can sell for more than $300 a pound. Sea cucumbers are said to deter muscle aging, boost the immune system, and treat fatigue and arthritis.At least 16 species of sea cucumber worldwide are now threatened with extinction because of intense harvesting, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Another seven are endangered, and nine are vulnerable.Researchers say reduced numbers of sea cucumbers may lead to decreased nutrient recycling and biodiversity on the seafloor, and may interrupt the food chain.But while sea cucumber fisheries throughout the world have long been troubled, the Yucat\u00e1n offers one of the most vivid examples of the challenges facing the animal.She and others trace sea cucumber exploitation in the Yucat\u00e1n to around 2012, when hundreds of fishermen realized the value of the catch in Asia. With air compressors made from six-horsepower motors and beer kegs, divers began scouring the ocean floor for sea cucumbers. The divers used the sudden income to pay off debts, build new houses and fix up boats. But to keep the money flowing, they also took bigger risks. At least 40 divers from coastal communities in the Yucat\u00e1n have died after ascending to the surface too quickly or staying on the seafloor too long while harvesting sea cucumbers.Hundreds of others have been treated for decompression sickness \u2014 \u201cthe bends\u201d \u2014 and other injuries related to the sea cucumber harvest.\u201cI attended to one and then another and another,\u201d said Dr. Juan Tec, who works at the public hospital in Tizim\u00edn. Some days, he recalled, patients sprawled on the floor as they waited for their turn in a three-bed hyperbaric chamber. Others were rushed in immediately for life-threatening injuries.\u201cYou lose track of time,\u201d said Angel Gamboa, a diving fisherman who suffered spinal cord decompression after spending about three hours gathering sea cucumbers off the Yucat\u00e1n coast. \u201cThis never passed through my mind.\u201dBut even as the fishing frenzy was proving hazardous to divers, it was becoming equally threatening to the resource itself.In recent years, government regulations limited the sea cucumber harvesting period to 14 days, setting catch quotas at 250 kilograms per fishing boat.With limited oversight and enforcement, though, populations were given no time to grow and reproduce, leading to their near-total decline within just five years of authorized fishing.In retrospect, monitoring and enforcement systems should have been better, she said. The commission also issued too few harvesting permits, leaving unlicensed fishing crews with little incentive to follow the rules and limit catches.In April, Ms. Salazar said 594 boats were issued permits to collect sea cucumbers \u2014 among a population of roughly 10,000 Yucat\u00e1n fishermen.Others suggested that local fishing cooperatives themselves should be given a greater role in policies aimed at improving governance of the resource.To some experts, though, the lowly sea cucumber provides yet another example of the frequent obstacles to sustainable harvesting. \u201cIt\u2019s exemplary of the ways we kind of outrun ourselves and are left with a tragic situation,\u201d said Michael Schoon, an associate professor of sustainability at Arizona State University.Often, these loops are thought about in the context of enormous trends, such as climate change, he said. But the plight of the sea cucumber shows that even seemingly insignificant shifts can have a profound effect.In the town of R\u00edo Lagartos, there were hardly any sea cucumbers left to collect this year. According to Dr. Tec, no divers were killed, either. Advertisement"}

The dispute is the latest episode in an ongoing international debate over the pursuit of what is called dual-use research: technological discoveries that can be beneficial or pose threats to human welfare. As gene-editing tools become increasingly accessible, scientists, ethicists and policymakers are weighing the good pivotal discoveries could do for humanity against their nefarious potential.\u201cOnce you engineer a virus that spreads by insect, it is hard to imagine how you would ever control it,\u201d said Guy Reeves, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany, who contributed to the critique.\u201cYou haven\u2019t just released a transmissible virus \u2014 you\u2019ve released a disease,\u201d he added. \u201cThe United States knows better than to return to a biological arms race.\u201d\u201cWith any of these new technologies that are going to be revolutionary, there\u2019s some inherent dual-use potential there,\u201d said Blake Bextine, the research program\u2019s manager, in an interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in this program is be very open.\u201dResearchers at four institutions \u2014 Boyce Thompson Institute in New York, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University and the University of Texas-Austin \u2014 have since been experimenting with the targeted gene therapy they hope will help farmers face issues like frost and disease.But the critics said publishing the new research findings could establish \u201cpreliminary instruction manuals\u201d for developing offensive biological weapons. Beyond strengthening crops\u2019 resilience, insects could be easily engineered to carry viruses that destroy plants, Dr. Reeves said.He added that one of the main species targeted in the research is maize, a staple source of nutrition for hundreds of millions of people in Latin America and Africa.Foreign military programs are often \u201cdriven by perception of competitors\u2019 activities,\u201d the critics warn, and \u201cthe mere announcement of this program may motivate other countries to develop their own capabilities in this arena \u2014 indeed, it may have already done so.\u201dThe scholars suggested enhancing pre-existing methods of crop protection, such as aerial spraying, but Darpa program executives consider those tools expensive and imprecise. They also said the critique mischaracterized their research by suggesting that these viruses would permanently modify a plant\u2019s genome. That is not the case, Dr. Bextine said.\u201cIf you see a drought coming, you can deploy the system to sustain a period of difficulty, and then go back to a natural state,\u201d Dr. Bextine said. \u201cWe are developing tools that are futuristic, but they are based very much in reality. This is biology we understand very well.\u201dDr. Reeves was not satisfied.\u201cI think this project was decided down one quiet corridor \u2014 an agency with intentionally little oversight that comes up with slightly crazy ideas \u2014 and top people in the Pentagon will be as shocked as I was,\u201d he said.Darpa officers conceded that their agency\u2019s work often involves calculated risk. Still, they consider it core to their mission to consider the benefits.\u201cWe\u2019re glad people are asking questions,\u201d Dr. Bextine said. \u201cBut food security is national security.

Sayoc Jr., had been used, as early as July, to draft a list of targets and scour the internet for information on them.The new court papers were addressed to a judge in Miami where Mr. Sayoc, 56, is set to appear this week at a bail hearing. Prosecutors in Manhattan are expected to ask a judge to detain him pending trial, and, in the filing, asked that Mr. Sayoc be sent to New York City for prosecution and denied bail on the grounds that he posed a \u201csubstantial danger to the community and a significant risk of flight.\u201dAfter an intense, nationwide manhunt, Mr. Sayoc, an ardent fan of Mr. Trump, was taken into custody on Friday in a parking lot in Plantation, Fla., near a white van in which he had apparently been living.The van, which has been seized by the authorities, was plastered with pro-Trump stickers, some of which depicted Mr. Sayoc\u2019s intended victims, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, marked with red rifle cross hairs.\u201cPut simply,\u201d the papers said, \u201conly the defendant\u2019s arrest and incapacitation resulting from his detention were sufficient to stop his attack.\u201dProsecutors said that at least 15 devices had been found so far \u2014 all of them in similar manila envelopes and with printed labels bearing the misspelled name and return address of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat.Two central questions regarding the devices remain unanswered even five days after Mr. Sayoc\u2019s arrest. Were they constructed in a way that would allow them to detonate on their own? And, if not, was that because Mr. Sayoc lacked skills as a bombmaker or because the devices were intended only to sow terror and division?The new court papers reiterated what the authorities have already said: that the bombs, while crudely fashioned, were in fact dangerous. Prosecutors noted that many of them contained what they called \u201cenergetic material with explosive qualities\u201d and that others were also packed with shards of glass \u201cintended to maximize harm.\u201dCourt papers filed Oct. 30 regarding bail for the suspect in the pipe bombs sent to critics of President Trump. (PDF, 25 pages, 0.88 MB)The papers also indicated that Mr. Sayoc started hatching his campaign during the summer. On July 26, the papers said, he created a file on his laptop titled \u201cDebbie W.docx,\u201d which contained several copies of Ms. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s address in Sunrise, Fla., that eventually appeared on the envelopes. Other laptop files, created on Sept. 22, were used to print the mailing labels on the packages delivered to Mr. Sayoc\u2019s victims, the papers said.Prosecutors added that internet records found on Mr. Sayoc\u2019s laptop showed it had been used for month to conduct chilling research on several of his targets and their families. On July 15, the papers said, Mr. Sayoc searched for the words \u201chilary Clinton hime address.\u201d Two months later, he searched for the words \u201caddress for barack Obama.\u201dThere were further searches, the papers said, for \u201ceric holder wife and kids\u201d and \u201cjohn brennan wife and kids.\u201dMr. Sayoc also sent several threatening Facebook messages in April to Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democrat who is running for Senate, said his campaign spokesman, Chris Evans. Mr. Evans said the campaign reported the threats to the Capitol Police and then turned them over to the F.B.I.On Mr. Sayoc\u2019s phone, investigators also found photos downloaded from the internet of Mr. Soros, what appeared to be Mr. Obama\u2019s home and a driver\u2019s license belonging to Michelle Obama, the former first lady.Mr. Sayoc has already been charged in New York with illegally mailing explosives and four other counts.

Mr. Mildenberger and Ms. Stokes are assistant professors of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Whether the Democrats or the Republicans seize control of Congress after the midterms, you can be sure of one thing: They will have very little idea what laws the public actually wants them to act on.The current Republican-controlled Congress is a good example. Its signature accomplishment is a tax-cut bill that hardly anyone likes or asked for and that is estimated to add about $2 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.Congress doesn\u2019t know what policies Americans support. We know that because we asked the most senior staff members in Congress \u2014 the people who help their bosses decide what bills to pursue and support \u2014 what they believed public opinion was in their district or state on a range of issues.The same is true for the four other issues we looked at: regulating carbon emissions to address the climate crisis, repealing the Affordable Care Act, raising the federal minimum wage and investing in infrastructure. On climate change, the average aide thought only a minority of his or her district wanted action, when in truth a majority supported regulating carbon.Across the five issues, Democratic staff members tended to be more accurate than Republicans. Democrats guessed about 13 points closer to the truth on average than Republicans.Both Republican and Democratic congressional staffers underestimated \u2014 in some cases, wildly underestimated \u2014 their constituents\u2019 support for action on several prominent domestic issues.

By contrast, Democrats underestimated their constituents' support for A.C.A. repeal.By The New York Times | Source: Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, Matto Mildenberger, and Leah Stokes in the American Political Science ReviewAides usually assumed that the public agreed with their own policy views. If an aide did not personally support acting on climate change, he or she was less likely to think that constituents wanted action. This self-centered bias is common in other areas of life \u2014 we all tend to think that other people share our preferences. But we aren\u2019t all charged with understanding what the public wants to ensure democratic representation.Interest groups also played an important role in explaining congressional staffs\u2019 errors. Aides who reported meeting with groups representing big business \u2014 like the United States Chamber of Commerce or the American Petroleum Institute \u2014 were more likely to get their constituents\u2019 opinions wrong compared with staffers who reported meeting with mass membership groups that represented ordinary Americans, like the Sierra Club or labor unions. The same pattern holds for campaign contributions: The more that offices get support from fossil fuel companies over environmental groups, the more they underestimate state- or district-level support for climate action.Since most congressional offices cannot regularly field public opinion surveys of their constituents, staff members depend heavily on meetings and relationships with interest groups to piece together a picture of what their constituents want. And if offices hear from only deep-pocketed interest groups, they are likely to miss out on the opinions of ordinary Americans.The forthcoming midterm elections are an important opportunity for the public to make its policy choices clear to Congress. But political action can\u2019t end on Election Day. Citizens need to keep writing, calling and meeting with elected officials and their staffs long after the midterms. Otherwise, Congress will continue to misunderstand the public\u2019s preferences. And if Congress doesn\u2019t know what the public wants, it\u2019s hard to imagine it will do a good job representing all Americans.Advertisement"}

Mr. Sanders is a United States senator from Vermont. The likely assassination of the Saudi critic and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with Saudi Arabia, and to show that the Saudis do not have a blank check to continue violating human rights.One place we can start is by ending United States support for the war in Yemen. Not only has this war created a humanitarian disaster in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, but also American involvement in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.The United States is deeply engaged in this war. We are providing bombs the Saudi-led coalition is using, we are refueling their planes before they drop those bombs, and we are assisting with intelligence. The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by overstating Iranian support for the Houthi rebels. But the fact is that the relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only strengthened with the intensification of the war. The war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve.Above and beyond the catastrophe that this war has created, there is the fact that American engagement there has not been authorized by Congress, and is therefore unconstitutional. Article I of the Constitution clearly states that it is Congress, not the president, that has the power to declare war. Over many years, Congress has allowed that power to ebb. That must change.The Senate voted 55 to 44 to delay consideration of the resolution. Since then, this crisis has only worsened and our complicity become even greater.I very much hope that Congress will act, that we will finally take seriously our congressional duty, end our support for the carnage in Yemen, and send the message that human lives are worth more than profits for arms manufacturers.Bernie Sanders, an independent, is a United States senator from Vermont.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Getting Harder to Talk About God", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decline in our spiritual vocabulary has many real-world consequences.Mr. Merritt writes about the intersection of religion, culture and politics.More than 70 percent of Americans identify as Christian, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from listening to them. An overwhelming majority of people say that they don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking about faith, most of the time.During the Great Depression, the playwright Thornton Wilder remarked, \u201cThe revival in religion will be a rhetorical problem \u2014 new persuasive words for defaced or degraded ones.\u201d Wilder knew that during times of rapid social change, God-talk is often difficult to muster.We may have traded 1930s-level poverty and hunger for a resurgence in racism, sexism and environmental cataclysm, but our problems are no less serious \u2014 or spiritually disorienting. While many of our most visible leaders claim to be religious, their moral frameworks seem unrecognizable to masses of other believers. How do we speak about God in times like these when God is hard to spot?As a student of American Christianity and the son of a prominent megachurch pastor, I\u2019ve been sensing for some time that sacred speech and spiritual conversation are in decline. But this was only a hunch I had formed in response to anecdotal evidence and personal experience. I lacked the quantitative data needed to say for sure.So last year, I enlisted the Barna Group, a social research firm focused on religion and public life, to conduct a survey of 1,000 American adults. This study revealed that most Americans \u2014 more than three-quarters, actually \u2014 do not often have spiritual or religious conversations.More than one-fifth of respondents admit they have not had a spiritual conversation at all in the past year. Six in 10 say they had a spiritual conversation only on rare occasions \u2014 either \u201conce or twice\u201d (29 percent) or \u201cseveral times\u201d (29 percent) in the past year. A paltry 7 percent of Americans say they talk about spiritual matters regularly.But here\u2019s the real shocker: Practicing Christians who attend church regularly aren\u2019t faring much better. A mere 13 percent had a spiritual conversation around once a week.For those who practice Christianity, such trends are confounding. It is a religion that has always produced progeny through the combination of spiritual speech and good deeds. Nearly every New Testament author speaks about the power of spiritual speech, and Jesus final command to his disciples was to go into the world and spread his teachings. You cannot be a Christian in a vacuum.And yet even someone like me who has spent his entire life using God-talk knows how hard it has become. Five years ago, I moved from the Bible Belt to New York City and ran headfirst into an unexpected language barrier. Sure, I could still speak English as well as I always had. But I could no longer \u201cspeak God.\u201dBy this I mean that spiritual conversations, once a natural part of each day for me, suddenly became a struggle. Whether I spoke to a stranger or a friend, the exchange flowed freely so long as I stuck to small talk. But conversations stalled out the moment the subject turned spiritual.Before relocating, I worked as a part-time minister at a suburban congregation outside of Atlanta. Before that, I had attended a Christian college and seminary. All my life, I used religious language daily in my home and community, rarely pausing to think about the meaning of my words. But I was not in Georgia anymore.Whenever I used religious terms I considered common \u2014 like \u201cgospel\u201d and \u201csaved\u201d \u2014 my conversation partner often stopped me mid-thought to ask for a definition, please. I\u2019d try to rephrase those words in ordinary vernacular, but I couldn\u2019t seem to articulate their meanings. Some words, like \u201csin,\u201d now felt so negative that they lodged in my throat. Others, like \u201cgrace,\u201d I\u2019d spoken so often that I no longer knew what they meant.According to my survey, a range of internal conflicts is driving Americans from God-talk. Some said these types of conversations create tension or arguments (28 percent); others feel put off by how religion has been politicized (17 percent); others still report not wanting to appear religious (7 percent), sound weird (6 percent) or seem extremist (5 percent). Whatever the reason, for most of us in this majority-Christian nation, our conversations almost never address the spirituality we claim is important.A deeper look reveals that the decline in sacred speech is not a recent trend, though we are only now becoming fully aware of it. By searching the Google Ngram corpus \u2014 a collection of millions of books, newspapers, webpages and speeches published between 1500 and 2008 \u2014 we can now determine the frequency of word usage over the centuries. This data shows that most religious and spiritual words have been declining in the English-speaking world since the early 20th century.There is also a practical reason we need a revival in God-talk, specifically at this time in American history. Many people now avoid religious and spiritual language because they don\u2019t like the way it has been used, misused and abused by others. But when people stop speaking God because they don\u2019t like what these words have come to mean and the way they\u2019ve been used, those who are causing the problem get to hog the microphone.That toothy televangelist keeps using spiritual language to call for donations to buy a second jet. The politician keeps using spiritual language to push unjust legislation. The street preacher keeps using spiritual language to peddle the fear of a fiery hell. They can dominate the conversation because we\u2019ve stopped speaking God. In our effort to avoid contributing to the problem, we can actually worsen it.Christians in 21st-century America now face our own serious \u201crhetorical problem.\u201d We must work together to revive sacred speech and rekindle confidence in the vocabulary of faith. If we cannot rise to this occasion, sacred speech will continue its rapid decline \u2014 and the worst among us will continue to define what the word \u201cChristian\u201d means.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.D.A. Approves New Drug for Flu", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new drug, sold as Xofluza, is about as effective as Tamiflu in shortening flu symptoms, and is expected to work against drug-resistant strains.The first new flu drug in 20 years won approval Wednesday from the Food and Drug Administration.The new antiviral, generically known as baloxavir marboxil but sold under the brand name Xofluza, is a single dose treatment. It is for use only in those aged 12 or more, the F.D.A. said, and should be taken only in the first two days after symptoms like fever, aches and sniffles appear.The pill will cost $150, according to a spokeswoman for Genentech, which will sell Xofluza in this country. Genentech will offer coupons that lower the price to $30 for patients with health insurance and to about $90 for the uninsured.The new drug is no miracle cure and it is not approved for young children, who are one of the most vulnerable groups, so the C.D.C. still strongly recommends that every American over the age of six months get a flu shot as soon as possible.Several other anti-flu drugs exist \u2014 the best-known of which is oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu \u2014 but none cure the illness quickly. Also, the influenza virus mutates very rapidly and has split into many strains that circulate simultaneously each winter, and several have evolved resistance to older drugs.Xofluza works in a new way, by blocking an enzyme the virus needs to copy itself. So, at least in theory, circulating flu strains resistant to earlier drugs should not have any resistance to it. It has been shown to work against both A and B strains, which circulate each year, and it is expected to work against dangerous bird flus known to occasionally infect humans, such as the A strains of both H5N1 and A H7N9.However, it is virtually inevitable that resistance to Xofluza will evolve as more people use it. (To prevent that, doctors treat several diseases, including H.I.V. and tuberculosis, with cocktails of three or four different drugs, but that is not the norm for flu treatment.)Xofluza was invented by Shionogi, a Japanese company that also created the statin Crestor.It does not cure a bout of flu as rapidly as, for example, antibiotics clear susceptible bacterial infections. But it may alleviate some symptoms and shorten the time that patients feel sick, said Dr. Debra Birnkrant, the F.D.A.\u2019s director of antiviral products. Xofluza was approved after two clinical trials in 1,832 patients. In both trials, those treated with it recovered more quickly than those who got a placebo. In one trial, there was no difference between Xofluza and Tamiflu.Tamiflu, which is sold by Roche, Genentech\u2019s parent company, is now available cheaply as a generic drug.

You have them totally clean. They travel all the time. They\u2019re organized. They\u2019re fed.\u201dMr. MacArthur put his hands up.\u201cThat\u2019s more than I know,\u201d he said, dodging the unfounded theorizing, before attempting to strike a more conciliatory tone. \u201cThere is no shame in being both compassionate and having the rule of law. Those two things can exist at the same time.\u201dAs he seeks a third term, Mr. MacArthur embodies the challenge facing many suburban Republicans across the country who have remained staunch allies of the president. Their wealthy and once-reliably Republican districts have become battlegrounds since Mr. Trump\u2019s triumph in 2016 galvanized an angry Democratic electorate.Mr. MacArthur has been forced to walk a fine line in a polarized district. He helped lead an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has helped drive down or contain health care costs for many residents, and voted in favor of the federal tax plan, which imposed a limit on local tax deductions and is deeply unpopular in New Jersey. At the same time, Mr. MacArthur likes to tout his bipartisan record, citing his work on the opioid epidemic and his opposition to offshore drilling.Though Mr. Trump won the district, which stretches from the Jersey Shore toward the suburbs of Philadelphia, it has not translated into an advantage for Mr. MacArthur, who is trying to defend his seat against a well-financed challenge from his Democratic opponent, Andy Kim, who worked in the Obama administration on national security issues.\u201cTrump remains more of a motivating factor for his opponents than for his supporters in this particular race,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Poll.Mr. MacArthur acknowledges the challenge he faces and points to the layout of his district to illustrate the political dynamics at play.\u201cI try to remind people that I have to straddle the Pine Barrens,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe 1.1-million-acre Pine Barrens that runs through the middle of the state divides my district in half. On the one side is Ocean County, where Trump won by 93,000 votes. And on the other side is Burlington County where he lost by 16 percentage points. I have to straddle that.\u201dOn a swing through the heavily Republican oceanside town of Toms River, Mr. MacArthur interspersed his allegiance to the president with evidence that he is not simply a rubber stamp for Mr. Trump or the party.There was \u201csomething malign in the bosom of the Democratic Party,\u2019\u2019 Mr. MacArthur said starkly, while adding that nevertheless, \u201cI probably spend most of my time working with Democrats.\u201dMr. MacArthur voted in favor of a bill that required all states to recognize concealed-carry gun permits from other states. But, he explained, the legislation also contained a provision opposed by the National Rifle Association that requires a more rigorous background-check system. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that today,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat is more dangerous.\u201dAnd though he has supported much of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff policies, he said he successfully lobbied the administration to drop one tariff that would have harmed a chemical company in Burlington County.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that the president\u2019s popularity has no impact on my race,\u201d Mr. MacArthur said. \u201cOf course it does. But I can look people in the eye and say I work with the president when I can.\u201dMr. MacArthur seems exasperated at times with the anger directed at him for his willingness to side with Mr. Trump. But that anger is what has led to a tectonic shift in this district, which has been represented by Republicans since 1993 except for two years when a Democrat won by riding the coattails of Barack Obama\u2019s historic first victory.The recent Monmouth Poll found that an equal number of voters approve and disapprove of Mr. Trump, which differs from the picture statewide, where the president is intensely unpopular.\u201cTo the degree that hard-core Trump supporters are congregating anywhere in New Jersey, it\u2019s in Ocean County,\u201d said Benjamin Dworkin, a politics professor at Rowan University. \u201cSo MacArthur being as supportive of Trump as he is, it\u2019s as much a political necessity as anything else.\u201dBut Mr. MacArthur\u2019s votes, especially on health care, have been frequent targets of Mr. Kim on the campaign trail and in political advertisements. His vote on the federal tax plan not been as big an issue as it has been elsewhere because the cap deductions has less of an impact on the district.Mr. Kim has focused on an amendment to the Affordable Care act that Mr. MacArthur helped draft and that critics say would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cWhat the voters are concerned about is that my opponent is someone who stood alongside the president and his administration on gutting pre-existing condition protections, on essential benefit protections, and the tax bill,\u201d Mr. Kim said at a recent candidate forum.Mr. MacArthur has denied trying to erode safeguards for pre-existing conditions, one of the pillars of health care reform, but Mr. Kim\u2019s line of attack has resonated in the district, with surveys showing that health care is by far the most important issue.That is especially true in Ocean County, which has the largest population of older people of any county in the state.\u201cThe cost of medicine, Medicare, anything that has to do with health and well being of the senior citizens are my top issues,\u201d said Sandra Chmielewski, 74, who went to hear Mr. MacArthur\u2019s stance on health care. \u201cI have to hear more about it. I would like to be informed about things before I make a judgment call.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But students, faculty and community members have been surprised by how the episode was handled. Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter immediately condemned the post. The journalism school faculty held an emergency meeting at 7 a.m. the following day, and two public forums were scheduled for that night.Mr. Meek had donated $5.3 million to the journalism school, which was renamed the Meek School of Journalism and New Media in 2009. The school also denounced Mr. Meek\u2019s post. A letter was sent to the entire university community explaining the process of removing Mr. Meek\u2019s name from the building. A subsequent note explained that Mr. Vitter planned to expedite the process.Alexis Rhoden, a black journalism student, attended one of the campus forums. \u201cThey were literally looking us in the eyes and just listening to us,\u201d Ms. Rhoden said of the administrators. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018This is actually different, this could mean something.\u2019\u201d Mr. Payne, one of those who supported removing Mr. Meek\u2019s name from the journalism school, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just another day at Ole Miss.\u201dThe university received the students\u2019 message at the forums. \u201cAnytime there\u2019s anything that touches on a racial incident, we want to be sure that we can deal with it, or put our best face possible on it,\u201d said Curtis Wilkie, a professor at the journalism school.\u201cAnd I think that was what was behind some of the quickness of action on this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was just the sense we needed to disabuse the public that this major donor and this Facebook posting was not at all something that we approved of, so there was a very quick condemnation of it.\u201dSome who know Mr. Meek said the post was out of character. \u201cThose pictures should not have been posted, but it doesn\u2019t make him a racist,\u201d Nic Lott, a prominent black alumnus who works for the state\u2019s Republican governor, wrote in a Facebook post. (Mr. Meek did not respond to a message requesting comment.)Whether Mr. Meek\u2019s name will be removed from the journalism school remains unclear. A state board will make the final decision, and Mr. Wilkie observed that Mr. Meek is \u201cclose to the power brokers in this state, who are all Republicans and all very conservative.\u201dStudents are eagerly awaiting the university\u2019s next move.

{"Headline": "Before Arguing About DNA Tests, Learn the Science Behind Them", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur genetic code cannot be treated as a matter of simple fractions.Mr. Zimmer is a science journalist.People have always told stories about their ancestral origins. But now millions of people are looking at their DNA to see if those stories hold up. While genetic tests can indeed reveal some secrets about our family past, we can also jump to the wrong conclusions from their results. The reception of Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA results is a textbook case in this confusion.These numbers then began to ricochet around social media. They carried a clear implication: that Elizabeth Warren was no different in her Native American ancestry than a great many other white Americans.They both mistakenly treat DNA as a matter of simple fractions. We each have two parents, the thinking goes, so therefore we inherit half of each parent\u2019s DNA. From each grandparent we inherit precisely a quarter of our DNA, and so on by the powers of two back into the mists of time. This is how they came up with the 1/1024th figure \u2014 two parents, each with two parents, going back 10 generations.This misguided way of thinking has a history that extends far beyond the discovery of DNA. For centuries, people thought of ancestry in terms of blood, and fractions of it. People were pure-blooded or half-blooded. When the United States government set up rules for deciding who could be members of Native American tribes, it called the system \u201cblood quantum.\u201dSlavery, too, led to an obsession with increasingly tiny fractions of ancestral blood, reaching the absurd extreme of the \u201cone drop\u201d rule. A single black ancestor \u2014 no matter how far back in the family tree, no matter how tiny the mythical drop of blood he or she contributed \u2014 was enough to make a person black.But DNA is not a liquid that can be divided down into microscopic drops. It\u2019s a string-like molecule, arranged into 23 pairs of chromosomes, that gets passed down through the generations in a counterintuitive way.Eggs and sperm randomly end up with one copy of each chromosome, coming either from a person\u2019s mother or father. In the process, some DNA can shuffle from one chromosome to its partner. That means we inherit about a quarter of our DNA from each grandparent \u2014 but only on average. Any one person may inherit more DNA from one grandparent and less from another.Over generations, this randomness can lead to something remarkable. Look back far enough in your family tree, and you\u2019ll encounter ancestors from whom you inherit no DNA at all.The geneticist Graham Coop of the University of California, Davis, and his colleagues have studied how DNA disappears. If you pick one of your ancestors from 10 generations back, the odds are around 50 percent that you carry any DNA from him or her. The odds get even worse beyond that.To understand Senator Warren\u2019s ancestry, the geneticist Carlos Bustamante of Stanford University examined the sampling of DNA she inherited from some of her ancestors. He used software he and his colleagues have developed to compare stretches of DNA in one person to those in different populations.Dr. Bustamante\u2019s study had some clear limits. For example, Native Americans in the United States have not participated much yet in genetic studies, so he couldn\u2019t include them in his comparison.Dr. Bustamante\u2019s software is not designed to offer precise percentages of genetic ancestry. But it\u2019s safe to say that some fraction of 1 percent of Senator Warren\u2019s DNA comes from a Native American ancestor.How many European-Americans are like Senator Warren, with a small amount of Native American ancestry? Scientists can\u2019t say for sure. The best clues to date come from a 2014 study carried out by researchers at 23andMe. They looked at the DNA of 160,000 customers who described themselves as being of European, African or Latino ancestry. Across all the European-Americans in the study, the average amount of Native American ancestry was 0.18 percent.But once again, averages can be deceptive. The researchers found that 2.7 percent of their European customers had 1 percent or more Native American ancestry. The vast majority had no detectable Native American ancestry at all. It\u2019s impossible to directly compare Senator Warren\u2019s results to the 23andMe customers because they were produced with different software.What these results will mean to Senator Warren\u2019s sense of herself is for her to work out. For her part, she has said that she would not claim membership in any tribe based on these results. Everyone else getting ancestry tests also will have to decide what their results mean for themselves. But if we want to come to a full reckoning with our DNA, we have to get a lot more familiar with the science behind it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Drink Before Bed? There\u2019s Lots to Consider ", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new book explores the nightcap\u2019s many possibilities and asserts only a single rule: Keep it to one drink. On the face of it, the answer seems simple: A nightcap is that final drink of the evening. It caps the night, and comforts like the nightcaps that sleepers wore back in the 19th century when the custom took hold.But that explains only the timing. What type of drink should it be? Can anything be a nightcap? What is the drink\u2019s larger social function? The more questions Ms. Newman asked of bartenders, the less certain she felt. \u201cNo one ever said, \u2018This isn\u2019t a nightcap,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cEveryone is open to whatever it can be.\u201dShe was able to establish at least one solid rule. \u201cEveryone I talked to says, \u2018There is no \u2018s\u2019 in nightcap.\u201d (That is, you should have only one nightcap per night.)Ms. Newman does not believe that today\u2019s drinkers think much in terms of nightcaps; it was partly for that reason that she thought it would be an interesting school of drink to examine. \u201cIt just seems like an unsung category,\u201d she said.\u201cThey\u2019re just warming spirits and have these dessertlike flavors, caramel and vanilla and spice,\u201d said Ms. Newman, the spirits editor at Wine Enthusiast. \u201cIt\u2019s comforting and pleasing and calming. And, personally, I think it\u2019s something that is hard to drink quickly.\u201d Still, she is not opposed to a glass of smoky mezcal, if that\u2019s what someone prefers. And the Negroni, an aperitif cocktail typically drunk at the start of a night or before a meal, is also fair game in her opinion \u2014 though instead, she would recommend a Boulevardier, a Negroni made with bourbon instead of gin.What a nightcap is meant to accomplish is an equally complex question. It\u2019s not just about ending the evening; it\u2019s more about how you want the evening to end. So she has divided the recipes in the book (to be published on Oct. 16) into four categories: \u201cTo Send You Off to Sleep,\u201d which includes lighter drinks using fortified wines and vermouth; \u201cTo Keep the Conversation Going,\u201d composed of more strongly spirited cocktails; \u201cTo Aid Digestion,\u201d with drinks that contain stomach-settling amari; and \u201cTo Sweeten the Deal,\u201d with dessert drinks like the grasshopper and the brandy Alexander.But sometimes an intention is all that it takes for a drink to be crowned a nightcap. Though Ms. Newman said she didn\u2019t think a shooter could ever be a nightcap, she breaks that rule in her book by including Paper Plane Shots. The recipe takes the Paper Plane, a modern-classic cocktail (bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino and lemon juice), and divides it into four one-ounce shot glasses.She watched one night as a bartender served it as a customer send-off. \u201cIt violates all the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sour. It has an aperitivo in it. It\u2019s a shot.\u201dBut the nightcap, she explained, isn\u2019t so much a category as an occasion. \u201cHere you had four people. They toasted one another, had this civilized moment and went on their merry way. It felt like a punctuation.\u201dMs. Newman\u2019s preferred nightcap? A simple pour of Armagnac.When it was suggested that there\u2019s a world of difference between a glass of Armagnac and Paper Plane shots, she shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one kind of night,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But sometimes civic engagement is the best medicine. In the winter of 1847-48, a typhus epidemic raged through Upper Silesia.

Dr. Virchow would later achieve scientific sainthood for disposing of Hippocrates\u2019 idea that humors caused disease, solidifying the idea that cells were the basis of biology and coining terms like leukemia, spina bifida, thrombosis and embolism.

He was, however, able to identify the conditions that promulgated the disease \u2014 poor sanitation, terrible working conditions, inadequate housing, meager education and unhealthy diet. In other words, all the concerns of modern public health.\u201cThere cannot be any doubt,\u201d Dr. Virchow concluded, that the epidemic was a result of \u201cthe poverty and underdevelopment of Upper Silesia.\u201d The prescription, he stated, should be \u201cfree and unlimited democracy.\u201dA prescription for democracy \u2014 not something you get at your average doctor\u2019s visit \u2014 is increasingly on the minds of medical professionals these days.Suddenly, like Dr. Virchow, we are recognizing that our purview extends to the entire structure of our society and that politics is, as he put it, \u201cnothing else but medicine on a large scale.\u201d Political decisions that affect insurance coverage, access to medical care, housing, minimum wage, immigration law, water sources \u2014 just to name a few examples \u2014 exert medical effects that are comparable with those of major diseases. Just ask the people of Flint, Mich. Like many doctors and nurses, I became politically active for the first time during the summer of 2017, when Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I could see the direct risk to my patients \u2014 all of whom, inconveniently, had pre-existing conditions \u2014 and realized that protecting health care coverage was as critical as prescribing insulin.Now, as our society feels increasingly fractured, the health threats seem even more alarming. Growing income inequality, disregard of environmental hazards and the undermining of social safety nets all stand to harm our patients\u2019 health. Dr. Virchow\u2019s words from 170 years ago about the creep of religion into state affairs, the outsize power of the wealthy and the autocratic impulses of government feel unsettlingly contemporary. So is it time for doctors to pull out our prescription pads and, like Dr. Virchow, start prescribing democracy?This may seem like a radical extension of the medical mandate, but the poorer and the sicker our patients are, the more likely they are to be disenfranchised. Those with the most to lose are least likely to have their voices heard.Of course no one should be advocating political viewpoints in the exam room \u2014 patients need a neutral, nonjudgmental atmosphere to feel secure. But civic engagement is nonpartisan.When patients say they can\u2019t afford their medicine, fear being bankrupted by medical bills or struggle to find treatment for an addiction, we typically offer sympathy for these heartbreaking and seemingly intractable issues.But might it be our responsibility to point out that these problems are not just bad luck but also the result of political decisions? Instead of giving a kindly pat on the shoulder, perhaps we should inform our patients that they can call their elected officials to get answers. In addition to our medical counsel, perhaps we should also encourage them to vote.When patients are admitted to the hospital, they are asked about their tobacco use and their flu shots, their employment status and their religious affiliation. Why not ask if they are registered to vote? Just as hospitals and clinics help the uninsured obtain coverage, they should also help eligible voters register. Waiting rooms are filled with brochures \u2014 there\u2019s no reason voter registration materials can\u2019t be in the mix.Dr. Virchow wrote, \u201cIf you want to achieve anything, you have to be radical.\u201d Many of our now-standard medical treatments seemed radical at the time (even handwashing). He also said, \u201cYou must start by inciting the population.\u201d He returned to Berlin just in time for the March Revolution of 1848. He joined in and even helped construct street barricades.Doctors today don\u2019t necessarily have to be stacking gurneys in the streets, but we do have to recognize that the health of the community is part of our medical mission. Civic engagement is integral to that. When our patients ask what they can do to improve their health, in addition to sunscreen, exercise and five servings of fruits and vegetables, we should advise voting.This is one prescription that doesn\u2019t require prior authorization from the insurance company.Advertisement"}

In concrete terms, this means turning your attention away from the Supreme Court, for now, and toward the midterm elections. The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is over.

{"Headline": "The Rich White Civil War", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA smarter look at America\u2019s divide.Opinion ColumnistEvery few years one research group or another produces a typology of the electorate. The researchers conduct thousands of interviews and identify the different clusters American voters fall into.More in Common has just completed a large such typology. It\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve seen because it understands that American politics is no longer about what health care plan you support. It\u2019s about identity, psychology, moral foundations and the dynamics of tribal resentment.We sometimes think of this as a populist moment. But that\u2019s not true. My first big takeaway from \u201cHidden Tribes\u201d is that our political conflict is primarily a rich, white civil war. It\u2019s between privileged progressives and privileged conservatives.You could say that tribalism is the fruit of privilege. People with more stresses in their lives necessarily pay less attention to politics. People with college degrees are more likely to describe their ideology as central to their identity. They are much more likely to derive moral meaning from their label, more likely to affiliate with a herd based on their label and more likely to vote on the party line.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]My second big takeaway from the report is that ideas really do drive history. Progressive Activists and Devoted Conservatives organize around coherent philosophical narratives. These narratives aren\u2019t visions of a just society. They are narratives of menace \u2014 about who needs to be exorcised from society.Devoted Conservatives subscribe to a Hobbesian narrative. It\u2019s a dangerous world. Life is nasty, brutish and short. We need strict values and strong authority to keep us safe.Progressive Activists, on the other hand, subscribe to a darkened Rousseauian worldview. People may be inherently good, but the hierarchical structures of society are awful. The structures of inequality and oppression have to be dismantled.This philosophical dispute is not new. There have always been some people who thought we need hierarchical structures to keep us safe and others who thought we need to be emancipated from oppressive structures so we can be free.What is new is how cultish this dispute has become. The researchers asked a wide variety of questions, on everything from child-rearing to national anthem protests. In many cases, 97 to 99 percent of Progressive Activists said one thing and 93 to 95 percent of Dedicated Conservatives said the opposite. There\u2019s little evidence of individual thought, just cult conformity. The current situation really does begin to look like the religious wars that ripped through Europe after the invention of the printing press, except that our religions now wear pagan political garb.The good news is that once you get outside these two elite groups you find a lot more independent thinking and flexibility. This is not a 50-50 nation. It only appears that way when disenchanted voters are forced to choose between the two extreme cults.Roughly two-thirds of Americans, across four political types, fall into what the authors call \u201cthe exhausted majority.\u201d Sixty-one percent say people they agree with need to listen and compromise more. Eighty percent say political correctness is a problem, and 82 percent say the same about hate speech.Unfortunately, people in the exhausted majority have no narrative. They have no coherent philosophic worldview to organize their thinking and compel action. When they get one I suspect it will look totally unlike the two dominant narratives today. These narratives are threat narratives. But the people who make positive change usually focus on gifts, not deficits. They tell stories about the assets we have and how we can use them together.I don\u2019t know what the next political paradigm will look like, but I bet it will be based on abundance, not deficits; gifts, not fear; hope, not hatred.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Year as a Trump Ambassador", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome disorder is normal at the start of an administration. But it was extreme under Mr. Trump. Ms. Jacobson was the United States ambassador to Mexico until May. The back story of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to dismantle Nafta is not just about his obsession with one agreement. It is also a window into a chaotic decision-making style that has undermined America\u2019s diplomacy and national interests across the globe. I observed this disarray up close for more than a year as the ambassador to Mexico. It wasn\u2019t pretty.The first time White House officials told reporters that the president intended to rip up Nafta, in the spring of 2017, I was about to attend the Mexican air show, one of the most important commercial events involving Mexico and the United States.Billions of dollars in trade between the two countries are at stake during the show, where a host of American aerospace suppliers demonstrate their wares. As the ambassador to Mexico, I would have expected to have been told what the president intended to do about the most vital part of our relationship with Mexico.But this is not how things work in the Trump era.I learned about the draft one-page notification of our plan to exit Nafta from countless emails and phone calls from reporters and Mexican officials. Now I was going to spend a hot April afternoon with the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, without warning or instructions from Washington. What was I supposed to tell him?I had been a diplomat for over 30 years, serving under five presidents, with stints in Argentina and Peru, and as assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs. I had visited nearly every country in the Americas, mastered the bureaucratic skills needed to get things done and served on crisis task forces for hurricanes, earthquakes and coups. I had always relied on guidance from my State Department superiors, and the White House via the National Security Council. Such guidance was rare after Mr. Trump assumed office.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric vilifying Mexicans and focusing on a border wall, embassy officials and our Mexican partners felt after his inauguration that we would be able to continue working well together. But it quickly became impossible to know how to influence the mess in Washington.On that April afternoon in 2017, I knew that Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, didn\u2019t want to get involved in Nafta talks and rarely took calls from even a senior ambassador. So I talked to senior career colleagues from the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the Commerce Department, but they knew little more than I did.As President Pe\u00f1a Nieto joined diplomats and government and military officials on the reviewing stand, he paused to greet me and emphasized that it was imperative that we talk later. When we finally sat down alone, the president, unfailingly polite, was blunt: What the hell was going on? \u201cYour president is going to pull out of Nafta before we\u2019ve even had a chance to sit down and work on this?\u201d he said to me. \u201cThis would be a disaster \u2014 economically, politically.\u201dAll I could tell him was that I was continuing to speak with the White House and hoped cooler heads would prevail. I noted that this was coming just after a spate of negative articles about the first 100 days of the Trump administration. I was learning that critical news reports almost inevitably led the president to fall back on his standard refrains: Build the wall, or Nafta is the worst deal ever.The draft document to pull out of Nafta was never sent. Why? We\u2019re not really sure. Perhaps because the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, engineered a phone call between Presidents Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of agriculture showed him evidence that his rural, agricultural base would be hurt. Or because powerful Republicans in Congress weighed in against ruining an important trading relationship. I can only hope that the president and his team are beginning to recognize that we need our allies, most importantly Canada and Mexico, if we are to tackle some of our most difficult domestic problems. But I am not confident of that.I left Mexico on May 5 \u2014 Cinco de Mayo \u2014 exactly two years after I had been sworn in as ambassador, and retired from government service at the end of May. Believing deeply in the United States-Mexico relationship, I cannot pretend anything less than relief at no longer having to defend the indefensible. But I also feel glad to escape the disorder I witnessed for more than a year.Over the past three decades, successive American administrations have worked diligently to vanquish the anti-American DNA in Mexico. We were overcoming the suspicions that a history of invasion, territorial loss and imperial intent had bequeathed. That kind of trust is slow to build, and remarkably easy to destroy. It is being destroyed now.Roberta S. Jacobson, a Pritzker Fellow at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, resigned as the United States ambassador to Mexico in May after more than 30 years at the State Department.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fake News Is Poisoning Brazilian Politics. WhatsApp Can Stop It. ", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Tard\u00e1guila, Mr. Benevenuto and Mr. Ortellado are the authors of a new report on misinformation in Brazil.With just a few weeks before the runoff vote on Oct. 28 between the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro and his left-wing opponent Fernando Haddad, there is still time for WhatsApp to make temporary changes to the platform to reduce the poisoning of Brazilian political life. The company must be decisive before it is too late.But these efforts seem to have pushed dirty campaigns elsewhere, in particular to WhatsApp, where activity consists of encrypted personal conversations and chat groups involving up to 256 people. Such chat groups are much harder to monitor than the Facebook News Feed or Google\u2019s search results.It is difficult to establish to what extent these misinformation campaigns are affiliated with political parties or candidates, but their tactics are clear: They rely on a combined pyramid and network strategy in which producers create malicious content and broadcast it to regional and local activists, who then spread the messages widely to public and private groups. From there, the messages travel even further as they are forwarded on by believing individuals to their own contacts.From a sample of more than 100,000 political images that circulated in those 347 groups, we selected the 50 most widely shared. They were reviewed by Ag\u00eancia Lupa, which is Brazil\u2019s leading fact-checking platform. Eight of those 50 photos and images were considered completely false; 16 were real pictures but used out of their original context or related to distorted data; four were unsubstantiated claims, not based on a trustworthy public source. This means that 56 percent of the most-shared images were misleading. Only 8 percent of the 50 most widely shared images were considered fully truthful.The problem of false news in Brazil transcends ideological divides.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters shared several images describing politicians \u2014 including those from the center right \u2014 as \u201ccommunists.\u201d The most widely shared image from our sample was a black-and-white photo of Fidel Castro and a young woman. The description accompanying the picture claims the woman is former President Dilma Rousseff, and the text accompanying it suggests Ms. Rousseff was Castro\u2019s pupil, a \u201csocialist student.\u201d The young woman in the photo, however, is not Ms. Rousseff. The picture was taken in the United States in April 1959, when Ms. Rousseff was only 11. Yet such images are effective in smearing Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 of which Mr. Haddad is a member \u2014 in a country where there is much antipathy to communism among the middle class.The alarming flow of distorted information can be mitigated. If WhatsApp changes some of its settings in Brazil from now until Election Day, Oct. 28, it can reduce the spread of lies. Moreover, these simple changes can be made without impinging on freedom of expression or invading users\u2019 privacy.WhatsApp should undertake three measures immediately:We contacted WhatsApp this week and presented these suggestions. The company responded by saying that there was not enough time to implement the changes. We disagree: In India, it took only a few days for WhatsApp to start making adjustments. The same is possible in Brazil.Our country is in a decisive political moment. Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s extreme right-wing positions \u2014 including his contemptuous positions on human rights and his nostalgia for the military dictatorship \u2014 have led many voters to fear for the future of our country\u2019s democracy. Many other voters worry that Mr. Haddad seems to be following orders from Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president who is now in prison on corruption charges.With such high stakes and such a polarized debate, Brazilians should not be casting their votes on the basis of false or distorted information. None of our proposals would require WhatsApp to limit its operations or impede Brazilians\u2019 ability to communicate with friends and family. We are suggesting only that the company temporarily impose some restrictions to stop the spread of fake news and dangerous rumors ahead of a critical election.Cristina Tard\u00e1guila is the director of Ag\u00eancia Lupa, a fact-checking platform.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.There he goes again.With Republicans struggling to keep their grip on Congress, President Trump is dialing up the demagogy. At campaign rallies and on social media, he\u2019s spewing dark warnings about a Democratic mob clamoring to usher in an era of open borders, rampant crime, social chaos and economic radicalism.Such a shift has been in discussion among administration officials for more than a year, and the memo in question has been floating around since the spring. Health and Human Services is expected to present its official case to the Department of Justice by year\u2019s end. Yet, like Mr. Trump\u2019s prior reversals of Obama-era policies that expanded transgender rights, the news understandably sent a ripple of fear and anguish through the community of 1.4 million transgender Americans, their loved ones and anyone who cares about civil rights. Mr. Trump plays the polarization game because he enjoys it \u2014 he does love a brawl \u2014 and because he doesn\u2019t appear to care about much beyond his political and personal fortunes. And, more practically speaking, these days he doesn\u2019t have much else to talk about.It\u2019s not that this president has failed to achieve anything in his first couple of years in office. The economy is chugging along right now, and many Republican candidates would be happy for him to play that up on the campaign trail. Thus, as Mr. Trump moves to make the case for Republicans in the midterms, he has few options beyond revving up his base. Which might be motivating \u2014 possibly even energizing \u2014 for some die-hard partisans on both sides of the battle. But it is more than a little dispiriting for the millions of Americans already exhausted by seemingly endless outrage. And it is really bad for the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " The End of the Australian Miracle?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country needs to find ways to share prosperity with workers.CANBERRA, Australia \u2014 Ten years ago, when the world economy suffered its most severe slump since the Great Depression, Australia was the only advanced country to avoid a recession. While double-digit unemployment ravaged many nations, Australia\u2019s jobless rate stayed below 6 percent. The hit to our housing was minimal, and the impact on the Australian stock market was temporary. It took until 2013 for the United States to return to pre-Great Recession living standards, but Australia bounced back by 2010.But now Australia needs to focus its innovative policy approach on the economy and find ways to share prosperity with workers.In principle, stagnant wages for average workers could reflect poor productivity. But that isn\u2019t true here, with productivity growing at a healthy rate. A bigger problem for employees is that they have less bargaining power.There are many policy options to tilt the scales back toward employees. Ending the popular practice of hiring \u201cpermanent casual\u201d employees would provide greater certainty to workers who want to start a family or buy a home. Reversing the cut in Sunday pay rates would raise earnings for hundreds of thousands of low-paid restaurant and retail workers.Australia also faces a challenge from the rise of China, which is Australia\u2019s leading source of tourists, foreign students and imports, and its top export market. Few nations are as enmeshed with China\u2019s economy as Australia. Trade wars hurt everyone, but they pose a special risk for countries that are smaller and less diversified: Australia\u2019s economy would suffer badly from an escalation of conflict between America, our strongest security partner, and China, our most important economic partner.Ideally, the next round of Australian prosperity would come from reforms that spur both growth and equity.From beer to banking, many Australian markets are dominated by a few big firms. Slowing the pace of mergers and accelerating the pace of start-ups would be good for growth.Across advanced nations, health care systems are amazingly successful at saving people in emergency rooms, but not so good at addressing chronic problems such as obesity and inactivity. Something similar could be said about the Australian economy. Having dodged the worst of the downturn a decade ago, Australia must now grapple with the problems of equity and economic diversity. In a world of uncertainty and technological disruption, the country\u2019s prosperity now depends more on smart long-term reforms than savvy crisis management.Advertisement"}

Coming-of-age is a highly visual subject: You can tell a story about it without unnecessary words, focusing instead on image and sound. In this film, we found a story line where we could bring our assumptions onto the screen while also connecting to our childhood experiences.Ultimately, we decided to profile a young girl competing in equestrian vaulting, a sport in which success is based mainly on the visual impression a contestant makes on the public and the judges. Judges reward the level of perfection in movements, as well as the extent to which the participants, who are of different ages, coordinate in synchronization. Meeting the vaulting team Volteo, which we ultimately profiled in this film, transformed our perspective on maturation. The team has a strict hierarchy, where the role of each girl depends on her skills and age. As the girls grow, they take on new responsibilities, which generally grow less desirable with age. After they grow too large for the \u201cflying\u201d stage, where they are cast into the air, they must become the responsible vaulters occupying lower, less glamorous positions as the \u201cbase.\u201d This cycle seems very similar to life in general.By abandoning classic narration, we tried to portray the inner world of a young girl in a subtle way: suspended between the well-known world of childhood and the new and unfamiliar reality of a teenager. We wanted to remind the audience how fragile and stressful the time of maturation can be, not only because it is inevitable but also because it is essential for determining who we are for the rest of our lives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jamal Khashoggi and the Competing Visions of Islam ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The growing tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia after the murder of the Saudi journalist in Istanbul remind us of an older conflict between monarchical and republican Islam.Mr. Devji teaches history at the University of Oxford. The battle between monarchical and republican Islam goes back to the Cold War, when Arab monarchies backed by Western powers saw secular and sometimes socialist Muslim states as their main rivals. In those days both sides deployed the Islamists against one another. After the fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq and Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s Libya, both through Western intervention, Syria is now the last significant representative of secular dictatorship \u2014 a political form that had once dominated the Middle East and parts of North Africa.Itself drawing upon Cold War ideas about ideological states, Islamism enjoyed its greatest victory with the Iranian revolution in 1979 and took control of Sudan a decade later. While Islamism has since come to power electorally in Turkey and Tunisia, it also appears to have lost its way, allowing social conservatives a place in the public life of these countries while mutating into something barely recognizable with the Taliban in Afghanistan.As the remnant of a much larger struggle, the competition between Muslim republicans and monarchists represents a politics in terminal decline. Most of the region\u2019s royal houses are modern creations, encouraged if not implanted by colonial powers. They possess no worked-out political idea or theory to legitimize themselves, relying instead on a transactional mixture of privileges, payoffs and punishments to secure the allegiance of their subjects, much like corporations do with their workers, shareholders and boards. This is why Islam as a form of social control is so important to them.Having torn their religion from the grasp of its traditional authorities among both clerics and mystics, Islamists were themselves set aside by the rise of jihad movements in the 1990s, which reject their visions of electoral democracy or even revolutions to set up Islamic republics. And like the Islamists before them, these militant outfits are now used by the region\u2019s governments against one another even when they cannot be fully controlled.Islamism is so frequently invoked precisely because it is in decline, its supporters as well as opponents eager to enlist the Brotherhood and lend their rivalries some ideological meaning.Yet in the West, freedom of the press and human rights are advanced as reasons for concern about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s end, while in the Middle East the struggle is over the possibility of a regional relationship that does not involve Western powers or geopolitics.While all three deploy religion in their quest for dominance, its very universalization in these and other ways has made Islam increasingly recalcitrant to such uses, as it slowly comes to constitute nothing more than the national character of Muslim societies in the region.Faisal Devji is a professor of history and fellow of St. Antony\u2019s College, University of Oxford.Advertisement"}

Humidity falls to about 10 to 15 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s not quite Death Valley, but it\u2019s not quite far-off it,\u201d said Alan Wilson, a biologist whose research examined how the wildebeest cope with such an inhospitable environment. \u201cThey\u2019re on a physiological knife edge in terms of: How do they continue to survive?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d get to 50 miles,\u201d Dr. Wilson said, referring to humans.\u201cThey don\u2019t have the problem of overheating that they would have otherwise or having to use water to cool themselves,\u201d said Andrew Biewener, an expert in the biomechanics at Harvard University who was not involved in the research.Dr. Biewener said the study helps link muscle physiology and locomotion to the animals\u2019 behavior.Wildebeest are like very skinny cows, said Dr. Wilson, professor of locomotor biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College in London. \u201cThey\u2019re a wee bit shorter than a cow and an awful lot lighter,\u201d he added. A typical cow weighs about 700 kilograms (1540 pounds) and a wildebeest about 200 kilograms (roughly 440 pounds).The muscle efficiency measurements are a significant contribution to a field that hasn\u2019t calculated new species since mice were first measured in 1994, said Robyn Hetem, a senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.Climate change is expected to make Botswana\u2019s environment even more extreme, with significant temperature increases expected across southern Africa.But in protecting the cattle, the government blocked the wildebeest from traveling historic migration routes. That doesn\u2019t matter much during typical years, she said, but has led to mass die-offs during particularly dry ones, Dr. Hetem said. The wildebeest can probably cope with some rise in temperatures, Dr. Wilson said, but noted that \u201cit\u2019s a challenging environment for all the animals.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly translated a measurement from Celsius to Fahrenheit. To calculate the efficiency of animal muscle, researchers have to be able to distinguish very subtle differences in heat produced by that muscle -- to within .001 degrees Celsius, or .0018 degrees Fahrenheit, not 32 degrees Fahrenheit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Two Black Athletes Raised Their Fists During the Anthem", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York.A few hours earlier, it was far from certain that Tommie Smith and John Carlos would be on the medal stand at all. Smith, the favorite to win gold in the 200 meters at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, had strained his adductor muscle in a heat and was unsure he could run at full speed. Carlos, his friend and fellow American, had nearly been disqualified when he left his lane in a heat of his own. But the umpire missed it, and he too survived. When the final was run, it turned out to be the race of their lives. Smith smashed the world record, in 19.83 seconds, and Carlos came in third, a whisker behind Peter Norman, an Australian who came out of nowhere to take silver. No one would run under 20 seconds in the Olympics again until Carl Lewis in 1984.As they approached the medal stand, Smith and Carlos were holding their running shoes, wearing black socks, as if they had been awakened from a midafternoon nap. All three medalists, including Norman, wore large buttons that read, \u201cOlympic Project for Human Rights.\u201d That may have been hard to read on the TV screen, but the next scene was not. As the tinny sound of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d began to fill the Estadio Ol\u00edmpico, Smith and Carlos looked at the ground, and raised their right and left arms, respectively, in the air. Each was wearing a single black glove, covering a clenched fist: the black power salute.Snapchat was still decades away, but the athletes instantly created one of the iconic images of the 1960s, to be endlessly reproduced in retrospectives on a decade that continues to inform (and misinform) our politics. Yet the gesture was so misunderstood at the time, on all sides, that it is worth slowing down to review, like a slow-motion replay of the race itself.For Smith and Carlos, the anger had been building for a long time. They grew up on opposite coasts, in families that knew all too well that black and white America were \u201cseparate but unequal,\u201d in the words of the Kerner Commission report of 1968. Separately, they made their way to San Jose State University, a track powerhouse, where a lively conversation was taking place on a campus that was roiled, like so many others, over America\u2019s divisions. Hastily improvised classes on black studies were attracting hundreds of auditors; \u201cworkshops\u201d often spilled out from classrooms into large, spontaneous gatherings. Nearly every aspect of college life (including all-white fraternities) was held up to scrutiny as these young Americans tried to understand a country that seemed to be better at promising justice than delivering it. Smith and Carlos were growing quickly; stimulated by a sociology instructor, Harry Edwards, they were asking hard questions of their peers and of themselves.As much as they loved running, they felt ambivalent about their role in the commercialization of sports, at a time when huge amounts were spent on TV advertising but anti-poverty programs were foundering. In the months that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Poor People\u2019s Campaign that limped along after his death, they wanted to run for something more inclusive than an individual medal.Many leading black athletes were speaking out against racism and poverty that year, including Bill Russell, Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali, who threw his 1960 Olympic medal into the Ohio River after being refused service in a whites-only restaurant in his hometown, Louisville, Ky. Would it not restore some balance if these rising track stars could win medals of their own and at the same time give voice to the voiceless? African-Americans were almost entirely invisible in the televised version of America that was beamed out over the networks. Who else could speak for them, if not the athletes whose talents earned a few precious moments before a global audience?By even appearing at the Olympics, the athletes had avoided a mini-crisis of the year before, when a boycott had seriously been discussed as a protest against the way that black Americans were marginalized. In fact, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor) sat out the 1968 Olympics (the men\u2019s basketball team won gold anyway). Carlos and Smith decided to run, but one reason they had black gloves ready is they wanted to avoid shaking hands with Avery Brundage, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee.Brundage, a white American, was a former Olympian who had run alongside Jim Thorpe in 1912 and steadily made his way upward in a career in high-level sports administration. But he was dogged by rumors of racism and anti-Semitism: In 1936, the year of the Berlin Olympics, he had shown a notable enthusiasm for the Nazis, and in the years that followed, pursued extensive business interests with them. As war clouds gathered over Europe, he prominently supported the America First movement that opposed United States intervention in World War II. He had led the Olympic committee since 1952 and personified the Old World cluelessness that troubled the young athletes. If they wanted to hear nuanced discussions of poverty, they would have to look elsewhere.At the same time, Brundage had put all of his weight behind the brave decision to bring the Olympics to Mexico, an important step forward for the games. That in turn had attracted a significant number of new African nations, competing for the first time, and Brundage should get some credit for recognizing, in his way, that a new world was coming into existence. Mexico showed backbone when it refused to receive athletes from the apartheid regime of South Africa. These were to be the \u201cPeaceful Games,\u201d and displays of political tension were unwelcome. Or so the planners hoped.But that slogan became instantly obsolete with a horrific act of violence as the games were beginning. Youthful rebellions had rattled many nations in 1968 \u2014 France was still recovering from the student protests of the spring, and a parallel movement in Czechoslovakia had ended in August when Soviet tanks rolled in. Naturally, Mexican students were keenly aware of these developments, and they too wanted to stand up for democracy in a country where it was hardly an established fact. When young people began organizing mass rallies in Mexico City, just in advance of the Olympics, nervous officials overreacted and sent armed troops after them. On Oct. 2, only two weeks before the 200-meter race, hundreds of students were killed at a rally.That mindless violence did not quite derail the Olympics, but it added to the urgency of an act of conscience, on behalf of the young and disenfranchised. A huge TV audience in the United States was quick to rejoice when a courageous Czech gymnast, Vera Caslavska, turned her head away while the Soviet anthem played. They were far less excited when Tommie Smith and John Carlos acted out their own ritual of protest.If anyone could be counted upon to make a confusing situation worse, it was Avery Brundage. The same figure, so untroubled by Nazi salutes in 1936, was outraged by the clenched fists of his fellow Americans. By coincidence, clenched fists were historically linked to anti-fascism, but any sense of historical context was quickly lost as everyone got angry at everyone else. Brundage denounced Smith and Carlos for their \u201cwarped mentalities\u201d and complained loudly about the \u201cnasty demonstration against the American flag by Negroes,\u201d as if \u201cNegroes\u201d were not fully American. That was exactly the point Smith and Carlos were trying to make. But they were quickly booted out of the Olympic Village and sent packing.The hysteria that followed was fanned by the media. The sports commentator Brent Musberger was particularly adenoidal, comparing Smith and Carlos to \u201cdark-skinned storm-troopers\u201d as if they, and not Brundage, had Nazi skeletons in their closet. All points of subtlety were quickly overwhelmed by the tidal wave of racialized anger that swept over the country.But in fact, Smith and Carlos were more moderate than their gesture suggested. They were trying to raise awareness of suffering; they were not Black Panthers or separatists. They had no weapons stockpiled or manifestoes. Their hugely watched act was, in fact, mostly improvised. In his autobiography, Smith explained that he sought to make a \u201chuman rights salute,\u201d not a black power salute. \u201cWe were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout how Muhammad Ali got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to race in meets hosted by all-white track clubs.It should also be remembered that the protest came from three athletes, not two. Peter Norman stood on that medal stand, too, wearing his button, adding his perspective to a problem that was hardly unique to America. Australia had a long and vexed history of its own, as Norman knew well \u2014 he had grown up in a family strongly affected by the Salvation Army and its mission to the poor. The decision of this apprentice butcher to stand tall, in his own way, greatly broadened the meaning of the moment. In fact, it was his idea that Smith and Carlos each wear a single glove (Carlos had forgotten his pair). It would be difficult to find a more poignant example of the Olympic ideal that Brundage had spent decades promoting. These athletes were standing together for something larger than simply winning. Smith later described the scene on the medal stand as an \u201carch of unity.\u201dAll three suffered in different ways for their role in forming that arch, but with the passage of time, they were welcomed back into the Olympic fold, and into the larger embrace of history. When Norman died in 2006, still unfairly neglected, Smith and Carlos stood up one more time, as his pallbearers. Fifty years later, some of the details have shifted, but the gestures of athletes continue to reverberate in a nation that remains divided in most of the ways it was then. Future disputes over protests will surely get many of the details wrong in the heat of the moment, as so many extremists did in 1968. But taking the long view helps to restore a measure of calm inside an argument that shows no signs of ending soon.Ted Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Advertisement"}

I still can\u2019t. The film is a drug. It causes your pupils to dilate, your palms to sweat, and your mind to boggle. Even as you know that Honnold is going to make it to the top, you can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re seeing \u2014 a young man, millimeters from extinction, transforming the unthinkable into the sublime. \u201cFree Solo\u201d is 97 minutes long and if you could hold your breath the whole time you probably would.But the thrills of the movie turn out to be incidental to its real purpose, which is less about climbing than it is about living. Honnold, it turns out, isn\u2019t simply the most accomplished rock climber of our time. He also has a first-rate mind, capable of thinking through both the minute choreography of his moves across the wall as well as the basic questions of his time on earth.Questions like: Should long life be a goal of life? What about happiness? If not happiness, what about excellence? If excellence, what (if anything) should we sacrifice in its pursuit? Love? And when does the pursuit of excellence become mere recklessness?Honnold has plainly given the questions serious thought \u2014 appropriately, since by his own count he\u2019s climbed rope-free more than 1,000 times and free soloists have notoriously short lifespans. \u201cAnybody could conceivably die on any given day,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cSoloing just makes it feel much more immediate and present.\u201dIt is that presence and immediacy that makes free soloing so appealing to Honnold and his peers \u2014 not because it brings death so much nearer, but because it makes life so much more vivid and significant. Most of us have been told, at one point or another, to work, study or perform as if our lives depended on it. There just aren\u2019t many activities where it\u2019s literally true.Free soloing is one of them. Every move counts. Every motion is considered. No decision is inconsequential. There is no cushion, no second chance, no helping hand. The only route to safety is through the relentless disciplining of body, mind, uncertainty, and fear. In a world of B.S. artists \u2014 and in a country led by one \u2014 Honnold is modeling something else, a kind of radical truthfulness. Either he\u2019s going to get it exactly right, or he\u2019s going to die.How Honnold gets it exactly right is the real heart of \u201cFree Solo,\u201d and why the movie is worth studying. Honnold is not a thrill seeker. He\u2019s a perfectionist who understands that the achievement of one supreme thing depends on the mastery of a thousand small things. Much of the perfectionism seems to come from his mother, Dierdre Wolownick, a retired French professor for whom, as Honnold puts it, \u201cgood enough, isn\u2019t.\u201dBut it\u2019s his mother who also best understands why her son constantly puts his life at risk \u2014 and why she doesn\u2019t quarrel with the choice. \u201cWhen he\u2019s free soloing is when he feels the most alive, the most everything,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can you even think about taking that away from somebody?\u201dI\u2019m not sure there are many parents who would say the same thing. Why can\u2019t Honnold just be a lawyer or doctor or some other ostensibly respectable profession? Why can\u2019t he put life\u2019s normal fulfillments \u2014 his relationship with his lovely girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, for starters \u2014 ahead of his seemingly lunatic ambition to achieve something of no obvious utility? Isn\u2019t he merely selfish, and doesn\u2019t his fatalism about life make that selfishness worse?You can\u2019t watch \u201cFree Solo\u201d without wondering about all this. As a father, I doubt I could muster Wolownick\u2019s apparent sang-froid were my kids to take similar risks. Perhaps it\u2019s a function of my own deep selfishness, both emotional and biological, that I want my children to bury me, not the other way around.And yet.On June 3, 2017, Alex Honnold free soloed the Freerider route of El Capitan in three hours and 56 minutes. It wasn\u2019t an act of recklessness but of the kind of planning worthy of a moon landing. It wasn\u2019t an act of selfishness but an extraordinary gift to everyone who believes that the limit of human achievement is far from being reached. It wasn\u2019t a useless stunt but a reminder that utility alone is a poor way to measure the grandeur of one man\u2019s spirit.Go see the movie. You\u2019ll see what I mean. And you will be grateful that Alex Honnold is here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of Student Peer Leaders ", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesAn organization is using the influence that teenagers have on their contemporaries to help more students from low-income families gain college admission and student aid. Moises Urena is a junior at the State University of New York at Albany majoring in human development. He spends much of his spare time mentoring other students and plans to pursue a career in higher education administration.Four years ago, his future was far less clear. He had no plans for college. During his first two years attending high school in New York, he and his mother experienced periods of homelessness, and his home life was full of stress. He skipped class regularly. In his junior year, however, he became serious about his education. \u201cAfter I became homeless, I realized the only constant in my life had been school and that\u2019s something I should stick to,\u201d he said.\u201cMy teacher told me to try,\u201d Mr. Urena said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019 It actually changed my life.\u201dHe also gained confidence from \u201crap sessions\u201d led by youth facilitators. In those sessions, students spoke candidly about their fears, insecurities and family pressures, as well as their achievements. \u201cIt was the first time I ever told people my story of being homeless, growing up with just my mom, struggling not having a father,\u201d Mr. Urena said. \u201cI realized that telling my story could help improve the lives of others.\u201d Back at school, he and his team members led campaigns for the senior class and school. \u201cIt changed the whole atmosphere in the school and created this bonding,\u201d Mr. Urena said. That year, according to PeerForward\u2019s data, the class\u2019s Fafsa completion rate jumped to 65 percent from 24 percent (not all students are eligible for federal aid), and the college application rate increased to 95 percent, up from 69 percent.PeerForward began as an initiative of the organization College Summit, one of the groups selected by President Barack Obama to receive a portion of his Nobel Peace Prize winnings. Over two decades, College Summit had shown it could improve college-entry rates among low-income, minority students; its successes influenced many similarly focused organizations and helped inform education policies. Four years ago, College Summit renamed itself PeerForward and changed its program to focus on youth leadership, the core driver of success in College Summit\u2019s work.Keith Frome, a co-founder and chief executive of PeerForward, said, \u201cSchool reform movements and education innovations almost always lack the component of leveraging the power of peer influence.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe peer effect is like putting in a high speed computer chip. Anything you want to do with kids, if you leverage peer influence, it will go faster and better.\u201dPeerForward asks students to run campaigns to achieve three goals:The question, of course, is this: How effective are peer leaders?Anecdotally, schools using PeerForward\u2019s model, which costs schools $13,500 per year, also report benefits. Eight years ago, the college enrollment rate for Lake Wales High School, in central Florida, was 46 percent. More recently, it has hovered at 80 percent to 85 percent, according to Donna Dunson, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cNow kids come into the school believing that they are heading somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd college doesn\u2019t seem so alien for first-generation kids.\u201dMs. Dunson is quick to note that the gains come from many efforts, not just the peer leaders. \u201cBut it\u2019s critical that students are the ones driving this,\u201d she added. \u201cThen they take the ownership. I know that word is overused, but it fits. If you can create the atmosphere and get out of the way, the kids will take it from there. But you have to set the stage for this to happen.\u201dTeaching students and educators how to support youth leadership is the core function of PeerForward, Mr. Frome said: \u201cIt\u2019s about young people and adults partnering in a deep and equitable way. That has to be learned and taught and coached.\u201dPeerForward begins its interaction with schools by examining how student leadership resonates with the school\u2019s mission. It then invites schools to identify four rising seniors who teachers believe have the qualities to influence their peers.Those students attend a summer workshop. When they return to school in the fall, they recruit four juniors. Early in the year, teams meet with a PeerForward coach, and their principal and adviser, to discuss how campaign goals should align with school goals. They assign roles including captain, communications manager, social media manager, data manager, secretary, photographer or videographer, and then start planning campaigns.PeerForward provides a web-based scoreboard so that teams can track progress, including in Fafsa and college applications by students. PeerForward has a campaign playbook full of ideas for events and activities, broken down into steps. Throughout the year, coaches meet or call with teams and advisers at least once a month, and teams meet with their advisers at least twice a month. There are training camps in the fall and spring to refresh skills.Students have organized college fairs and job fairs. They bring in school alumni to share college stories. Some have created Fafsa lounges and dances, where the admission ticket is a completed aid form. They have to solve problems and come up with creative incentives. In one school, after parents failed to show up to a Fafsa night, students realized that they needed to provide on-site babysitting. In another school, students persuaded a utility company to offer credits for families that submitted their Fafsa forms by March 1.\u201cWhen you\u2019re able to tap into young people\u2019s passion, they lean into the experience,\u201d she added. \u201cWe want them to be partners \u2014 to tell us what they want to see in terms of education.\u201d\u201cAn adult can say to a student, \u2018You should go to college\u2019,\u201d Ruby Noboa, a peer leader at the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science in New York, said. \u201cBut if a student says to another student, \u2018Knowledge is power. We need higher education so we can overcome our oppression,\u2019 they\u2019re much more likely to listen.\u201d When problems arise, it\u2019s often because adults have trouble letting students lead, or a principal or adviser is not fully on board. \u201cA big challenge is the belief system,\u201d Ms. Figueroa said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in place in a lot of schools that young people can really effect positive change. When you have an adviser or principal who has that belief system, there will be a lot of challenges.\u201dThe idea that schools should do more to build youth leadership seems to be gaining traction. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more and more requests to use this methodology for other things, including college persistence,\u201d said Gary Z. Linnen, who went through College Summit\u2019s program as a student and is now PeerForward\u2019s managing director for program, operations and innovation.\u201cOne of the worst lessons that students get from school is that you win by yourself,\u201d Mr. Frome said. \u201cIn most aspects of life and work, you win and lose together. Students are not taught to think of everyone\u2019s success \u2014 our grade, our school.\u201dThat was the insight that Mr. Urena said changed his life. \u201cBeing in PeerForward made me realize that I was a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not in such a happy place before. But I feel very happy now. When I look back on it, the key element for me was finding my passion in helping others and seeing that I can have an impact on others\u2019 lives.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a previous version of this article misspelled the last name of a peer leader at the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science in New York.

{"Headline": "Apple Used to Know Exactly What People Wanted \u2014 Then It Made a Watch", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyApple opened a routine product-launch event last month with a gag. An establishing aerial shot of Apple\u2019s new circular headquarters set up a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it\u2019s an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple\u2019s depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 and it\u2019s not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation.The subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them,\u201d he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, \u201cthey would have said, \u2018Faster horses.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era.The company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn\u2019t succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They\u2019re for Instagram or Facebook; they\u2019re for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple\u2019s competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple\u2019s core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history\u2019s most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers.The Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch \u2014 with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting \u2014 was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself.Four years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn\u2019t yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process \u2014 and still in charge \u2014 of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It\u2019s a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious.During the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d \u2014 attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It\u2019s the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you\u2019re snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up \u2014 that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn\u2019t have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for.Over the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what\u2019s going on with, and inside, its wearers\u2019 bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device\u2019s body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won\u2019t be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer\u2019s heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance.For now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that \u2014 it\u2019s a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple\u2019s relative commitment to privacy \u2014 at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording.As Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple\u2019s stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple\u2019s devices and software.This is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple\u2019s latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry.There may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can\u2019t remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device \u2014 or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers.Advertisement"}

One of the things we have learned about our president over the last few years is that he never recognizes a bad plan.Do you think it\u2019s all a plot? Maybe whenever the White House desperately needs to distract the public from a new presidential mess, somebody says, \u201cHey, can you get the Big Guy to call somebody a dog?\u201dBut there is a horse connection. Back in the \u201980s, Trump acquired a 2-year-old racer named Alibi, which he cruelly renamed D.J. Trump.According to a former Trump casino official, the future president demanded that the colt be worked out despite the trainer\u2019s concerns that he might be sick. The trainer was right, the horse had to have part of his hooves amputated, and then Trump announced he was not going to pay for a defective horse. So Alibi/D.J. hobbled off into history.Pop quiz: Suppose you were a president trying to get past an embarrassing story about sex with a porn star named Stormy, and you finally get one tiny win in what will undoubtedly be litigation that runs longer than \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Would you:A) Pretend nothing is happening and confine all your public comments to that exciting new plan for across-the-board budget cuts.B) Take your wife on a vacation in which you will actually be seen spending time together.C) Launch a tweet vowing to \u201cgo after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer.\u201dWell, yeah, C.\u201cHe should not have said that,\u201d the soon-to-retire House Speaker Paul Ryan remarked during a morning news interview. The look on Ryan\u2019s face was somber, but somewhere in the back of his eyes you could see him setting off fireworks and yelling, \u201cI\u2019m out of here, suckers!\u201dIt was definitely an improvement over Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana\u2019s defensive: \u201cWe\u2019ve all done something like that before.\u201d To which Kennedy unhelpfully added that he believes the president \u201cgrows anxious when he has unexpressed thoughts.\u201dRepublicans who are trying to get elected in a year when women are the party\u2019s big problem were obviously not thrilled when the president reminded everyone of his animal-name-calling habit. Trump lost the women\u2019s vote in the last election, although he did win a narrow majority of white women. That was nearly two years and a lot of insults ago. We\u2019ll have to see how many of them have noticed that he reminds them of that kid in grade school who used to call girls \u201cFatso\u201d or \u201cBowlegs.\u201dNaturally there was a Stormy response. (\u201cIn addition to his \u2026 umm \u2026 shortcomings, he has demonstrated his incompetence, hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter AGAIN! And perhaps a penchant for bestiality. Game on, Tiny.\u201d)I believe I speak for all of America when I say that having Donald Trump as president is bad enough without having to think about his genitals. Really, this is way, way worse than previous revelations that Lyndon Johnson called his \u201cJumbo\u201d and Warren Harding\u2019s was \u201cJerry.\u201dAnd after all, Johnson at least gave us Medicare.

Hopelessness. Determination.The bruising battle to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may be over, but the reverberations for women who opposed him are not.As those who lost this battle try to figure out how and whether to gird for the next ones, many women who opposed Justice Kavanaugh are pulled both ways.\u201cI cried in the bathroom at work, I cried at home, I cried in the car, the whole time knowing that Brett Kavanaugh would inevitably end up on the Supreme Court,\u201d wrote Katelyn Sullivan, a 27-year-old graphic designer from Burlington, Vt. \u201cI waver between feeling the power of women\u2019s anger and feeling like meaningful change is out of reach.\u201dThe responses ran the political gamut, with many also writing to support Justice Kavanaugh.\u201cI think this became a political game with a lot of underhanded maneuvering,\u201d wrote Anne Abraham, who identified herself as a first-generation immigrant from India living in Maryland. She said Justice Kavanaugh would uphold the constitution, and she would vote Republican as she has in the past. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy for a nation to protest and voice their concerns. I think that it\u2019s become unsafe in this country to be a conservative \u2014 especially in our cities and in popular culture.\u201dBut after two heady years of marching, organizing and running for office, after once-invulnerable men were toppled by accusations of sexual harassment, many women who opposed the nomination are asking themselves how much has really changed \u2014 and how much still can.Many listed specific actions they plan to take in the aftermath: vote, canvass, protest, write public officials, donate money. One woman said if, as she expects, abortions are further restricted, she would open her California home to women who needed to travel to obtain them. Another said she would launch a social media campaign describing her own sexual assault and listing others.Susan Daily of Kansas City, Mo., who described herself as a mother of twin daughters and married to a conservative she persuaded not to vote for President Trump, said she turned her Facebook profile into an oozing volcano after the hearings. She said she plans to show up in courtrooms to support victims of assault. And she has not given up on reaching across the divide. \u201cI try to post uncomfortable truths to engage others who run across my newsfeed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI engage civilly with conservatives and naysayers online.\u201dBut many women said the hearings had reminded them of the formidable barriers to change posed by an entrenched political structure still controlled by older white men. And some who were rooting for Democrats to win back Congress in the elections could not shake a dread that once more their side would lose.\u201cI feel powerless to change anything, and I don\u2019t think my vote even counts due to the Electoral College, but I do vote anyway out of principle,\u201d wrote Ashley Silverthorne from Minnesota. \u201cMy foremothers fought for our right to vote and I\u2019ll exercise it any time I can even though I don\u2019t think it will change anything.\u201dLaura Stahl, of Los Angeles, said she is resolved to vote. \u201cBut I am so afraid that my voice does not matter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel as though I am screaming into the void. And yet I cannot be silent. I have to do something or else this hopelessness will paralyze me.\u201dFor these women, the hearings were a live, communal swing from jubilation that a female accuser was first seen as widely credible to disgust that male power once more ruled the day. They described feeling silenced and sidelined, not only by men, but in a singularly wrenching betrayal, by other women \u2014 those who voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and those who believed him over his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cI felt completely and utterly shut down,\u201d wrote Nicole Keefler, an American living in Canada who is casting an absentee ballot in the midterm elections. \u201cThat none of our experiences of sexual violence matter. Nobody cares \u2014 not the police, the courts, the politicians or the president.\u201dEven more, the hearings were a painful flashback to 2016, when Democratic women were shocked not only that Hillary Clinton lost, but that a man whose unapologetic embrace of swagger and sexual entitlement could be elected president.That explains a lingering intensity that has taken many of these women by surprise.\u201cI had no idea that these hearings would affect me so deeply,\u201d wrote Keirsten Hamilton, an attorney who said she was raised in a fairly conservative Christian home in small-town Texas, votes Republican in some local races but more often for Democrats. \u201cIt does feel, in many ways, like meaningful change is out of reach. But I\u2019ve never felt so enraged in my life. I refuse to let men keep telling this narrative that I know is wrong.\u201dAs with both sides in this intensely partisan moment, Sarah Orlando of Houston evoked an apocalyptic future: \u201cThis is the worst thing that\u2019s happened to women in my lifetime, I fear the worst is far from yet to come. I\u2019m not just worried for women though. I\u2019m worried for every marginalized community in America. When my son asked if everything was going to be O.K., I answered with my filter temporarily disengaged, \u2018Just be glad you\u2019re not a woman, honey.\u2019\u201dSome women reproached themselves as well as men in power, turning anger inward for somehow failing to do enough. \u201cHonestly this makes me realize how inactive I have been,\u201d wrote Raphaela Weissman of Seattle, who said she was voluble on social media but had not taken direct action. \u201cI did not call any senators before this vote, so in a way this is my fault, too.\u201dAllison Butz of Texas offered a vivid glimpse into modern-day juggling many women must navigate. She wrote that she had always voted, protested, written letters and volunteered for campaigns when she could. \u201cBut sweet Jesus, I\u2019m the underpaid director of a severely underfunded community food pantry in a service area that has some of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation. My husband and I own a print shop. I have two small children who are in school, in soccer, in other activities \u2026 and the birthday parties, constantly \u2026 and that doesn\u2019t even touch on how I manage to keep the plates spinning in every other aspect of my life.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t add another commitment beyond what I\u2019m already doing, and I feel like I\u2019m letting the entirety of society down as a result,\u201d she continued. \u201cMoral of the story? Right now is bad.\u201dYet for many who responded, the prospect of more women in office remains alluring and hopeful.Magaly Marques, who described herself as a manager, mother and immigrant, wrote: \u201cTo expect that all women will vote the same way is na\u00efve. But when women are in at least equal numbers in the Senate and their committees, the conversations will be different, the questions asked will be different, the ability to hear and not deflect will be there, the bullying tactics will be in check.\u201dLela Moore and Kelly Virella contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix Fake News", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneMs. Rini teaches philosophy at York University in Toronto.Technology spawned the problem of fake news, and it\u2019s tempting to think that technology can solve it, that we only need to find the right algorithm and code the problem away. But this approach ignores valuable lessons from epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with how we acquire knowledge. To solve this problem \u2014 or at least improve the situation \u2014 we need to establish stable testimonial norms, which allow us to hold each other accountable on social media. This requires cutting through the information deluge and keeping track of the trustworthiness of hundreds of social media contacts. Luckily, there\u2019s an app for that. Facebook already has features that support better testimonial norms. Most Facebook accounts are closely linked to users\u2019 real-life social networks. And, unlike anonymous web commenters, Facebook users can\u2019t just walk away from their identity when they\u2019re caught lying. Users have a reason to care about their epistemic reputation \u2014 or, at the very least, they would if others could keep tabs on the information that they shared. Instead of using this data to calculate a secret score, Facebook should display a simple reliability marker on every post and comment. Imagine a little colored dot next to the user\u2019s name, similar to the blue verification badges Facebook and Twitter give to trusted accounts: a green dot could indicate that the user hasn\u2019t chosen to share much disputed news, a yellow dot could indicate that they do it sometimes, and a red dot could indicate that they do it often. These reliability markers would allow anyone to see at a glance how reliable their friends are.There is no censorship in this proposal. Facebook needn\u2019t bend its algorithms to suppress posts from users with poor reliability markers: Every user could still post whatever they want, regardless of whether the facts of the stories they share are in dispute. People could choose to use social media the same way they do today, but now they\u2019d have a choice whenever they encounter new information. They might glance at the reliability marker before nodding along with a friend\u2019s provocative post, and they might think twice before passing on a weird story from a friend with a red reliability marker. Most important of all, a green reliability marker could become a valuable resource, something to put on the line only in extraordinary cases \u2014 just like a real-life reputation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Dilemma: Censuring M.B.S. and Not Halting Saudi Reforms ", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe have a national interest in Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s saga. Opinion ColumnistI have three thoughts on the Jamal Khashoggi saga.First, I can\u2019t shake the image of this big teddy bear of a man, who only wanted to see his government reform in a more inclusive, transparent way, being killed in some dark corner of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by a 15-man Saudi hit team reportedly armed with a bone saw. The depravity and cowardice of that is just disgusting.Second, I do not believe for a second that it was a rogue operation and that Saudi Arabia\u2019s effective ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is very hands-on, had no prior knowledge, if not more. And therefore, not as a journalist but as an American citizen, I am sickened to watch my own president and his secretary of state partnering with Saudi officials to concoct a cover story. The long-term ramifications of that for every journalist \u2014 or political critic in exile anywhere \u2014 are chilling. By the way, I don\u2019t think they will get away with it.This leads to my third point: How should America think about balancing our values and our interests going forward? The best way to answer that, for me, is to go back to the basics. I always knew that M.B.S.\u2019s reform agenda was a long shot to succeed, but I was rooting for its success \u2014 while urging the Trump administration to draw redlines around his dark side \u2014 for a very specific reason. It had nothing to do with M.B.S. personally. Personally, I don\u2019t care if Saudi Arabia is ruled by M.B.S., S.O.S. or K.F.C.By pure coincidence my first job as a foreign correspondent was in Beirut in 1979. The first two big stories I covered were the Iranian revolution and the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by an ultra-fundamentalist Saudi extremist preacher who claimed that the al-Saud family members were corrupt, womanizers and Westernizers.That Mecca takeover terrified the Saudi ruling family. So, to shore up its religious credentials and protect itself, it made a sharp religious right turn in 1979, letting clerics impose much tighter religious controls on the society and expand exports of their puritanical Salafi Sunni brand of Islam abroad \u2014 building mosques and schools from London to Indonesia and from Morocco to Kabul, funded by higher oil prices.This had a hugely negative effect on education and women\u2019s rights and political freedom throughout the Arab-Muslim world \u2014 and the most extreme version of this fundamentalism, Salafi jihadism, also inspired the hijackers of 9/11 and ISIS.I believe 9/11 was the worst thing to happen to America in my lifetime.We can debate what was the right response to the attacks \u2014 Afghanistan, Iraq, the global war on terrorism, the Department of Homeland Security, or metal detectors everywhere. But we cannot debate the costs.We have spent thousands of lives and some $2 trillion trying to defuse the threat of Muslim extremists \u2014 from Al Qaeda to ISIS \u2014 dollars that could have gone to so many other needs in our society.And I believe that the roots of 9/11 came from two terrible bargains. One was that bargain between the Saudi ruling family and the kingdom\u2019s religious establishment, where each blessed the other. The other was America\u2019s cynical bargain with the Saudis, which went like this: \u201cGuys, just keep your oil pumps open, your prices low and don\u2019t bother the Israelis too much, and you can do whatever you want out back \u2014 preach whatever hate you want in your mosques, print whatever conspiracy theories you want in your papers and treat your women however you want.\u201dOn 9/11 we got hit with the distilled essence of everything that was going on out back. Which is why this column, since 9/11, had been highly critical of Saudi leaders for not reforming their version of Islam, something that would require economic and social modernization as well. They would arrest religious extremists, but Saudi leaders almost never engaged them in a public war of ideas.And so what most caught my eye about M.B.S. and made me most hopeful was his tentative willingness to engage in a war of ideas with his religious hard-liners, declaring publicly: \u201cDo not write that we are \u2018reinterpreting\u2019 Islam \u2014 we are \u2018restoring\u2019 Islam to its origins.\u201d He argued publicly that Islam in its origins was tolerant of other faiths and empowering of women and open to new ideas.He seemed to be aiming to replace Saudi fundamentalist Islam, and its clerics, as the primary source of his regime\u2019s legitimacy with a more secular Saudi nationalism \u2014 one, to be sure, that had a strong anti-Iran and anti-Qatar tenor.Hey, maybe it was all just a fake to cover for a power grab and win Western support. But a lot of young Saudis I spoke to thought it was real and wanted more of it. On this question of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most toxic export that had affected America and the whole world \u2014 jihadi Islamism \u2014 M.B.S. was doing and saying stuff that had real promise.For starters, I believe that the promise of M.B.S., however much you did or did not think he could bring social, economic and religious reform, is finished. He\u2019s made himself radioactive \u2014 absent a credible, independent exoneration for Jamal\u2019s disappearance and apparent murder. M.B.S. may be able to hold onto power in Saudi Arabia, but his whole reform program required direct foreign investment \u2014 and money has been flowing out of Saudi Arabia for months, not in. Now it will get worse.Yes, I covered the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I know that money has a short memory. But Saudi Arabia is not China. There has been just way too much craziness coming out of the M.B.S. government for many investors to want to make long-term bets there today, which is too bad. It will weaken any hopes of future reform.And here\u2019s one more complication. Even if M.B.S. were pushed aside, if you think there are a 100 Saudi royals with the steel, cunning and ruthlessness he had to push through women driving, removing the Islamic police from the streets and reopening cinemas, you are wrong. There are not. All of these reforms had intense conservative opponents. This is not Denmark, and yet, without sweeping social, economic and religious reforms, Saudi Arabia could well become a huge failed state. Remember, one of ISIS\u2019 biggest sources of young recruits was Saudi Arabia.And by the way, if you think M.B.S. had a dark side, you ought to look under some rocks in the kingdom. You will find some people there with long beards who don\u2019t speak English who believe the most crazy stuff about Shiites, Jews, Christians, Hindus, America and the West. And right now, trust me, they are applauding Jamal\u2019s assumed murder.But you can\u2019t fix stupid. And when your ally does something as sick and as stupid as the Saudis apparently did in Istanbul, there is just no easy fix. But Trump might start by appointing an ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He has never had one \u2014 and it shows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Trees, Happier People", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "OpinionWhen cities grow, green space dies. Replanting it has been shown to lift the human spirit. Supported byContributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 The scene in a tiny pocket park outside Plaza Mariachi here on Nolensville Pike last Wednesday was like a tableau from a Norman Rockwell painting, 21st-century style. Surrounded by signs advertising the Hispanic Family Foundation, Dubai Jewelry, the Dominican Barber Shop and restaurants offering Peruvian, Chinese, Mediterranean and Indian food \u2014 as well as a Game Stop franchise and H&R Block \u2014 was a small sign that read, \u201cToday: Free trees.\u201dMany of these newly planted saplings will replace very large, very old trees that have been lost to Nashville\u2019s meteoric growth \u2014 a population increase of more than 45 percent since 2000. As the city has grown, the city\u2019s trees have fallen: deliberately felled by developers to make room for new construction or unintentionally killed as a side effect of nearby building. Just since 2008, the tree canopy in the urban core has dropped from 28 percent to 24 percent, a loss of roughly 9,000 trees a year.The Nashville Tree Foundation\u2019s giveaway program \u2014 which continues through Friday \u2014 is just one of the nonprofit organization\u2019s outreach efforts, each focused on planting trees in the poorer parts of town, which tend to have the least green space. \u201cWe\u2019re all working toward the same goal of 500,000 trees, and we want an equitable distribution of free trees in the county,\u201d said Ms. Sorenson. \u201cWe usually plant in areas where there\u2019s an intersection of low canopy and low income. We\u2019re trying to make a large impact over a short period of time.\u201dI learned about the tree giveaway the same way I learn about most other initiatives sponsored by nonprofits with a limited advertising budget: through social media. That\u2019s the same way \u2014 and on the same day \u2014 I heard Erica Ciccarone\u2019s story of the developer who cut down three ancient black walnut trees on the property line they share. What\u2019s going up next to Ms. Ciccarone\u2019s small house in the Wedgewood-Houston part of Nashville is a four-story duplex, and she wasn\u2019t surprised when the builder took out the old tree closest to the monstrous new structure under construction. But there was no reason at all to take down the trees in the back of the lot.As it happens, Ms. Ciccarone lives in an area where the tree canopy is well below its target density, but for her the loss of the black walnuts was personal. \u201cThey weren\u2019t majestic,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cTheir leaves were small and scraggly. But they provided shade for us and the chickens, housed songbirds, and they blocked the sight line from the alley into our yard and back porch.\u201dAn earlier experiment by Eugenia South, one of that study\u2019s authors, had found that merely walking past a newly planted lot in an urban neighborhood lowered the participants\u2019 heart rates. Smaller unrelated studies have found lower blood-pressure readings and lower cortisol levels among participants who spent time in nature.From an urban-planning perspective, trees do something of the same thing for densely occupied parts of the planet. They remove carbon, including greenhouse gas emissions, from the air. They cool the surrounding area, offsetting the heat impact of asphalt and combustion engines. They absorb and filter stormwater. They lower energy costs for nearby buildings. It\u2019s no wonder that so many people in Nashville are worried about their trees.When I left Plaza Mariachi last week, Ms. Sorenson was taking a photo of another family and the oak tree they had just selected for their yard. The father was holding the heavy tree, which was taller than his little girl\u2019s head. Dressed in \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d stripes, she was lifting her hands toward it anyway, reaching high, wanting to help.Advertisement"}

But they also tossed a political spark into the mix, blaming their right-wing government for the exodus: \u201cThe violence and poverty is expelling us.\u201dThey never expected it to ignite an international firestorm.Far from Honduras, the White House was busy grappling with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist whose death inside a Saudi consulate had tarnished Saudi Arabia, a vital ally of the Trump administration. And with the midterm elections in the United States only weeks away, President Trump was eager to change the script.The caravan gave him a new, politically advantageous story to tell. Stoking American anxieties about immigration had worked well as a cornerstone of his 2016 campaign. The president\u2019s top aides, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began briefing the president on the caravan\u2019s progress the week before last, senior White House officials said.Within days, the president began using Twitter to attack the migrants, putting the blame on Democrats and threatening to cut funding to Central American governments: \u201cWe are a great Sovereign Nation. We have Strong Borders and will never accept people coming into our Country illegally!\u201dWhat began as a domestic political dispute in Honduras \u2014 an effort to undermine newly re-elected President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and to call attention to the plight of migrants \u2014 quickly became an international row, a source of embarrassment in Honduras, consternation across the region, and political opportunism in the United States.Initially planned as a modest caravan of a few hundred people, it grew quickly to about 7,000 as desperation, local media coverage and a swirl of domestic and American politics combined to transform it into the largest movement of migrants north through Mexico in recent history. Even those who helped spur the mass movement never imagined it would expand so much, so fast.\u201cI never expected this to get so big,\u201d said Bartolo Fuentes, a migrant advocate and former lawmaker who helped promote the caravan, which started on Oct. 13. \"Maybe it would come to a thousand people. But this big? No way.\u201dFor leftist politicians like Mr. Fuentes and Luis Redondo, a congressman, the caravan offered a perfect way to encourage migrants to travel safely in a large group \u2014 and attack the government at the same time.After Honduras\u2019s divisive presidential election in November, which the Organization of American States found so problematic that it called for a new vote, people took to the streets in deadly protests against what they saw as a fraudulent vote count.Despite the controversy, the Trump administration gave its official support to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, a loyal ally who cooperated with Americans during his first term on issues like stopping the flow of drugs and migrants toward the border. With that, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez took office, but he remained a polarizing figure accused of corruption and amassing too much power.Determined to denounce Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s administration and support the migrants, members of the opposition started promoting the caravan as an example of what happens when a government fails its people. In Tegucigalpa, the capital, a prominent member of the opposition went to the Mexican Embassy and threatened to send out multiple caravans as long as the situation in Honduras remained the same, according to two senior Mexican officials.\u201cThis time it will be so big that when they see everyone walking, they should ask, \u2018Where are they coming from and who is responsible for so many people leaving Honduras?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Redondo in a Facebook post on Oct. 5 in which he shared the caravan poster. \u201cThis is a consequence of corruption, lack of security, impunity; those responsible are the corrupt and corrupters of the national party.\u201dOn that score, the government\u2019s opponents were successful. Mr. Trump demanded that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez stop the caravan, though by then the migrants were already in Guatemala, and it was unclear what Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez could do. Still, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off aid to the country if the caravan was not turned around.\u201cThe United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote last Monday. \u201cNo more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!\u201dIt seemed to panic the Honduran government. In what appeared to be an attempt to deflect responsibility, the Honduran ambassador to the United States, Marlon T\u00e1bora Mu\u00f1oz, sent Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, a video in which young men handed out single bills of currency to migrants standing in line.Mr. Mu\u00f1oz also said that George Soros, American nonprofit groups, or a drug cartel might be helping fund the caravan, said Mr. Gaetz, who posted the video to Twitter, adding: \u201cFootage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!\u201dThe ambassador declined to comment. But he was hardly the only person in the Honduran government looking to cast blame for the exodus on foreigners. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence said that Honduras\u2019s president had told him that Venezuela was providing funding to support the migrants, without offering evidence. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.The political fallout from the caravan has been disastrous for Honduras. But Republicans welcomed the pivot of Americans\u2019 attention away from the Khashoggi killing to a topic that has long gained traction with Mr. Trump\u2019s political base.Newt Gingrich, the former speaker and an occasional Trump adviser, was among the Republicans following news of the caravan, even as global coverage remained squarely focused on Mr. Khashoggi.Republicans hope that the increased coverage of the migrants will prompt certain voter groups, like white suburban women, to veer away from Democratic candidates, especially if Mr. Trump can stoke fears about gangs and drugs, Mr. Gingrich said.\u201cIt creates a safety factor\u201d for those voters, he said. \u201cIf the first 7,000 to 15,000 get in, what signal does that send?\u201dMr. Gingrich added, \u201cTrump understands in the current American political structure you have to win polarized campaigns.\u201dMr. Fuentes and others had aimed to embarrass their government by portraying the caravan as a powerful statement on the cost of failed domestic politics. But they accidentally overshot the mark, precipitating a regional crisis.The coverage of the migrants and the political blowback \u2014 in Honduras and in the United States \u2014 has been intense. After following the migrants into Guatemala, Mr. Fuentes was detained and sent back to Honduras, where he has stayed away from the spotlight, afraid the government will retaliate against him.Mr. Fuentes said he was opposed to this government and wanted Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez out of office. But he helped spread the word about the caravan because the road north is dangerous, he said.\u201cIf you leave in a small group, you\u2019re heading for disaster,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said, adding that most of the migrants simply joined on their own.Indeed, if he helped light the match, many others, including Mr. Trump and the pro-government news media in Honduras, fanned the flames.The flier and private WhatsApp groups that sprang up across the country were most likely the initial sources of information for many who joined the caravan. But interviews with several dozen migrants on the trail credited a pro-government television station with sounding the media megaphone.The day before the caravan started, a popular program on HCH News dedicated more than an hour to discussing the caravan. The coverage was geared in part toward embarrassing the organizers and spreading disinformation about how Mr. Fuentes was paying for the migrants\u2019 food and transportation (an allegation he later denied on the program).But the effort backfired. Far from delegitimizing the caravan by convincing the public it had political roots, the hosts inadvertently presented many Hondurans who wanted to flee with the perfect opportunity to do so.Between 200 and 300 people on average leave Honduras every day, risking the journey north in search of a future away from the poverty and violence that make daily life a struggle. Since the last caravan in the spring, a devastating drought has forced even more people to ponder the uncertainty of migrating.Olvin Alexander Mart\u00ednez, 21, who worked with his brother and father at a palm oil company in Trujillo, said this year\u2019s yield \u201cwas not enough,\u201d costing family members their jobs and him a large part of his salary.Mr. Mart\u00ednez decided to join the caravan, which now includes Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Mexicans.Franklin Barahona, 26, a Honduran migrant from La Ceiba, said he joined the caravan at the beginning, then spread the word over WhatsApp and Facebook.Mr. Barahona and his travel companion, Flavio Williams, also 26, had seen news reports that suggested members of the caravan had been paid by Honduran politicians and that their march was motivated by politics.\u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s false, it\u2019s totally false,\u201d Mr. Williams said of the accusations.\u201cFive thousand, 7,000 people aren\u2019t going to come risk their lives just because of politics, much less their children\u2019s, their wives\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re not going to do it because of politics,\u201d he added.Annie Correal contributed reporting from Huixtla, Mexico, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Student, Barred From Israel Over Boycott, Goes to Court", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 As a student at the University of Florida, Lara Alqasem served a recent stint as president of the tiny local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.Ms. Alqasem arrived at Ben Gurion Airport last week with plans to enroll at an Israeli university, and has been held there since while she appeals a deportation order. On Tuesday, the Israeli government presented her with a choice: Apologize and renounce her support for the boycott movement, or give up on her plan to study in Israel and be placed on a plane back to the United States.One of the Israeli lawyers representing Ms. Alqasem, Leora Bechor, described the case as \u201cegregious.\u201d\u201cThis is a 22-year-old who definitely cannot be in support of an academic boycott,\u201d Ms. Bechor said. \u201cShe wants to study here.\u201dAmid a heated internal debate over the character of Israeli democracy, and who should be allowed into the country, Ms. Alqasem\u2019s case has been testing the system. Her supporters accuse the government of an overzealous border policy that is based on flimsy evidence and is likely to do more damage to Israel and its image abroad than any student\u2019s boycott call.Ms. Alqasem\u2019s credentials as an anti-Israel activist are far from clear-cut.After graduating, Ms. Alqasem, who has Palestinian grandparents, decided to study for a master\u2019s in human rights law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She landed on the night of Oct. 2 with a one-year student visa issued by the Israeli Consulate in Miami.In an extraordinary step, the Hebrew University has asked to join Ms. Alqasem\u2019s legal appeal against deportation.\u201cTo be clear, we strongly oppose the boycott campaign against Israel, and Israel has to fight it,\u201d Barak Medina, the rector of Hebrew University, said by telephone on Tuesday. \u201cBut to deny entry to every person who has expressed support for a boycott is counterproductive.\u201dProfessor Medina said that he had not been able to meet Ms. Alqasem yet, but that he would like to.Ms. Alqasem\u2019s former Hebrew teacher, Dror Abend-David, described her as \u201ca delightful young woman, an outstanding student, curious, with an open mind, and someone who very much wanted to study international relations in Israel to develop her own opinion on the conflict.\u201dMr. Erdan, the public security minister, said that Ms. Alqasem was not being detained against her will and that she was free to leave the country anytime.Critics are increasingly asking what the exact criteria are for barring people from the country. In the past, Israeli officials have said the 2017 entry law would not penalize people for their political opinions alone, and would apply only to major figures in the boycott movement.After arriving and being denied entry, Ms. Alqasem appealed to a tribunal at the Tel Aviv district court. At the request of a judge, she formally declared that she would not participate in any boycott activities while in Israel and that she had no intention of visiting the Palestinian territories, according to her lawyers, Ms. Bechor and Yotam Ben-Hillel.The appeal was rejected, but Ms. Alqasem was granted an extension so that she could pursue her case further. Another hearing is set for the coming days.Ms. Bechor said there was no evidence directly linking Ms. Alqasem to anti-Israeli activity.Ms. Bechor said the government was now engaged in a \u201cfrantic effort to back down.\u201dBen Moore, an adviser to Mr. Erdan, acknowledged that the ministry\u2019s information about Ms. Alqasem came from public sources online, including the Canary Mission. He said Ms. Alqasem had deleted her social media accounts before coming to Israel, which he said \u201cseemed dubious at best.\u201dBy late Tuesday, it appeared that both sides were trying to find a compromise, in the wording of a statement, that would allow Ms. Alqasem to stay.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Misfits, Stalkers and Kiddie Sociopaths: The Latest Thrillers", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROUNDUPIt\u2019s been 30 years since the publication of Thomas Harris\u2019s \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d the suspense novel that pitted the F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling against the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, showcased them as they bored into each other\u2019s psyches and did more to change the genre than any novel until Gillian Flynn\u2019s \u201cGone Girl\u201d a generation later. To revisit \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d today is to encounter a story that shows its age \u2014 not just because of the of-its-era language in which transgender issues are discussed, but because it is something that too few thrillers dare to be in 2018: strictly linear.Harris\u2019s book gets its title from Lecter\u2019s remorseless probing of a terrifying, and personality-shaping, experience from Starling\u2019s childhood \u2014 the night she awoke to hear the cries of spring lambs being slaughtered and realized she was powerless to help them. Lecter forces this disclosure as part of a deal: He\u2019ll offer clues about a current killer if Clarice provides information about the childhood vulnerabilities that still drive her as an adult. It\u2019s unnerving, it\u2019s effective and, most transgressively, it\u2019s chronological. Harris tells his story with nary a flashback, just unremitting forward momentum right up to the final chapter\u2019s climactic taunt \u2014 \u201cWell, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming?\u201dIn its way, \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d is a novel about early trauma \u2014 the thing that Lecter, the evil genius, is acute enough to perceive through all of Starling\u2019s careful presentational concealment. But it casts only brief, fierce sidelong glances at the past. If it were written today, Clarice\u2019s early years would almost certainly get about 100 more pages of play, in chapters that alternate with the present-day case and slow-walk readers through her youth until reaching the incident that is meant to explain everything about who she is now.Ours is an era in which we are all becoming fluent in the language of trauma, post-traumatic stress, recovery and survival, but what is good for humanity may be bad for thrillers. A great suspense novel should be, on some level, destabilizing; at least once, even as the narrative propels you onward, you should want to go back to reread a passage that\u2019s been completely recontextualized by something you just learned. But today, trauma as a universal motivator has worked its way so deeply into the architecture of many novels that it threatens to become mundane. No matter how many skeletons are unearthed, if the sole purpose of revealing them is to vanquish the darkness with explanatory lucidity, the result is distinctly unthrilling, as if the entirety of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho\u201d were now narrated by the loquacious shrink who pops up at the end of the movie.Split timelines \u2014 the bad past that explains the bad present \u2014 are a genre staple, and the emergence of something awful and long-suppressed is such a consistent motif that it has turned many novels into waiting games: \u201cWhat exactly happened back then? Tell!\u201d Readers speed ahead not because they\u2019re gripped but because they\u2019re impatient with so much calculated withholding. If these books become efficient conveyor belts that trundle along with the promise of a tidy little gift bag of answers and rationales right out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, you may well feel relieved, but you are unlikely to feel disturbed. For a thriller, disturbed is better.Gran makes this fragmentation, in which no single story line ever becomes central, feel organic to her main character, who also seems constructed out of jagged shards, and is as dangerous as you\u2019d imagine someone fitting that description might be. She steals cars, pulls knives on people who get in her way and cold-cocks others when they double-cross her, scrawling \u201cCLAIRE DEWITT ALWAYS WINS\u201d on their walls as a flourish. She views life experience as an \u201cinfinite blacktop of things you\u2019d regret not knowing later\u201d and her future as \u201ca long series of empty moments that took me down a \u2026 highway to nowhere in particular.\u201d We don\u2019t know why she\u2019s like this; she doesn\u2019t either. In fact, nobody in this cold, hard-core, genre-blurring novel can be understood except in analogical terms; even a murderer finds himself bewildered to be \u201csomeone who DID things. Someone like the people in detective novels.\u201d In \u201cThe Infinite Blacktop,\u201d all that brings characters together is that they dissociate on the same frequency.For good measure, Gran throws in excerpts from a detection manual that has special meaning for Claire, and a long chunk of a teen-sleuth saga as well. The last quarter of her book takes a plunge into metafiction that is likely to be polarizing. (Note scribbled in the margin: \u201cWhat IS this?\u201d) But it helps that Gran has an engagingly sardonic voice and a sure grip of storytelling basics, even those she is manifestly interested in ignoring or transcending; in particular, the 1999 sections work as a satisfying whodunit/whydunit of which Ross Macdonald probably would have approved. \u201cThe Infinite Blacktop\u201d is droll, savage and healthily unsettling, even at moments when it verges on becoming an essay about its own construction.The kiddie sociopath with the thousand-yard glower may be somewhat too easy a go-to in thrillers, but anyone who grew up on mass-market paperbacks for which the cover art was some forbidding version of a blood-spattered, blankly staring broken doll will feel an almost nostalgic connection to this novel. The intrigue of \u201cThe Lies We Told\u201d is, at least initially, how and when these two plotlines \u2014 the demon seed from 30 years back and the possibly kidnapped boyfriend from right now \u2014 are going to knit together. If the answer seems slightly inevitable just from that description, at least Way throws in three or four other questions that become suspenseful in their own right, all of which come under the general heading of \u201cHow well do you really know your boyfriend/daughter/son/ mother/neighbor?\u201d The writing isn\u2019t dazzling, but the construction and pacing are solid, staying just far enough ahead of the reader to be fun, and offering, in the last quarter, a buffet table of twists \u2014 if you don\u2019t like one, just stick around for 10 pages \u2014 and an open door to a sequel. More than one of the women in this novel is a monster, more than one of the men is an easily manipulated dolt or lech, and its view of mental illness is antediluvian. But nobody ever said thrillers have to play nice as long as they play fair. Fuller, a skilled stylist, is very good at letting you get to know Frances by degrees and at describing a setting in which the ordinary rules of life feel suspended. She conveys the exoticism of a temporary new home and the eroticism of a temporary new attachment. You can taste the wine, smell the musty fabrics and the overripe fruit, hear the hum of lazy insects and track the teasing suggestion that something will eventually go terribly wrong. She keeps the suspense at such a low simmer \u2014 as if Anita Brookner had decided to try her hand at a potboiler \u2014 that you might be forgiven for wondering if, at times, the flame has gone out altogether.What tension there is rests on whether the rupture \u2014 the thing that will make that summer describable as \u201cfateful\u201d \u2014 will arrive because Frances is unequipped to deal with this couple, or because they\u2019re sinister and somehow using her as a pawn. But the very fact that Frances is narrating the story in a second, decades-later timeline lowers the stakes by removing one possibility: Whatever happens, you know that she lives to tell the tale. Too much of \u201cBitter Orange\u201d consists of two interesting, dramatic people doling out selective information to their undramatic listener; even as the noose tightens (and it does), you sense you could still slip out of it. It\u2019s a tribute to Fuller\u2019s abilities that even when her plot feels slight, the atmosphere she conjures creates its own choking sense of dread.She also holds the cards she\u2019s planning to play very tightly. Sixty pages in, \u201cCross Her Heart\u201d still feels less like a thriller than like one of those books with a drearily earnest set of reader\u2019s guide questions at the end: \u201cWhat did you think of Lisa\u2019s choices? Do you think Lisa and Ava have more in common than they realize?\u201d But stick with it, because when Pinborough unveils her first surprise about a third of the way in, it\u2019s a good one, so good that even the legally mandated device that kicks in with it \u2014 chapters headed \u201cNow,\u201d \u201cAfter\u201d and (for a big 1989 section) \u201cBefore\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t slow her novel\u2019s momentum.None of the plot points here are entirely new \u2014 they involve the requisite terrible teenage incident, multiple identities, the internet, the possibility of false memory, at least one total psycho, a decades-long game of revenge and a climax (one of many) about which one character, not inappropriately, remarks, \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re in one of those terrible straight-to-DVD thrillers!\u201d But what feels fresh is the dispatch with which Pinborough throws every one of them into a single novel. The mechanics aren\u2019t deftly concealed here, but the machine itself works, motoring toward about five different endings. \u201cCross Her Heart\u201d also has a welcome sisterhood-is-powerful vibe; it\u2019s a novel that defines women by their relationships with one another, even as their creator is ruthlessly shoving them into position for the next twist.When \u201cFind Me Gone\u201d pries itself away from its unconvincing glimpse of Downtown Manhattan\u2019s publishing-and-parties demimonde, it becomes a stranger and darker novel than its beginning suggests. The Belgium sections, about a dreadful kidnapping and the shaky romantic friendship between two girls on the cusp of puberty, are believable, and then Agatha Christie and Virginia Woolf show up as characters in chapters of their own. They\u2019re part of the book Hannah is writing, about writers who \u201cfought their battles, swam against the current and then disappeared one day. Just like the 12-year-old girl who vanished from a Belgian village,\u201d a connection it would have been better to allow readers to make. Showing one\u2019s hand like that doesn\u2019t help a thriller, nor does leaning on \u201cWhere is this all going?\u201d for as long as \u201cFind Me Gone\u201d does. Hannah\u2019s journey is persuasively grim and not without surprises; ultimately, it becomes a meditation on the possibility that a woman can create her identity by controlling the terms of her own disappearance. But I couldn\u2019t help wondering if that magazine job was still available.Mark Harris\u2019s most recent book is \u201cFive Came Back.\u201d He is currently working on a biography of Mike Nichols.Advertisement"}

Within each groundcherry casing is a small, tart, edible fruit, similar in appearance to a cherry tomato, that is sometimes sold at farmer\u2019s markets.The fruit might be more common in supermarkets were it not so difficult to grow in large quantities. Groundcherry bushes sprawl untidily and can drop their fruits early, and the plants possess other undesirable traits. Diminishing these traits through selective breeding would take years.Using Crispr, the team removed a small portion of SP from the groundcherry genome. The resulting plants, when they grew, arranged themselves into more compact bushes. The team performed similar experiments with genes that influence flower number and fruit size. \u201cSure enough, when we got those fruit off, they were larger than the parent groundcherry,\u201d Dr. Van Eck said. \u201cClose to 25 percent more weight in the fruit.\u201dHeartened by these successes, the researchers are working to see whether they can control the shape of groundcherry bushes with more precision. They are also keen to find a solution to the problem of fruit dropping off the bush.\u201cThat can really complicate harvesting,\u201d Dr. Van Eck said.Tomatoes are known to carry a gene that influences the formation of a weak point on the stem of the fruit. Perhaps modulating this gene in the groundcherry will make possible a variety that keeps a firmer grip on its fruits. It took around two years to complete the experiments. In the future, changes could take less time, or more, depending on how much work is necessary to adjust a given trait.Still, Dr. Van Eck estimates that with conventional breeding techniques, addressing such traits can often take at least five years. And that\u2019s if the trait breeders want to encourage is already present in some plants. If the trait isn\u2019t readily available, then they face a much more difficult task of trying to track it down, then beginning the breeding process.Because this application of Crispr involves only the removal of DNA, not the addition of new material, the resulting produce isn\u2019t considered a genetically modified organism in the U.S. or Canada, Dr. Van Eck said.The researchers suggest that this technique could be helpful in bringing plants that aren\u2019t grown widely into greater circulation. The groundcherry, with its unusual look and enticing taste, could be a good first candidate.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s popcorn, minus the explosion into fluff \u2014 a worthwhile trade-off, sacrificing lightness for meatiness and crunch.In Ecuador, this snack of roasted dried corn is called tostado. A generous handful of kernels, dusted with salt, is offered at the start of a meal at Rinc\u00f3n Melania, which opened in January in a onetime dry cleaner\u2019s on the border of Long Island City and Sunnyside, Queens.The menu roams Ecuador, from coast to highlands.

The elder Ms. Dutan grew up in the small town of Bibli\u00e1n in the southern province of Ca\u00f1ar, at an altitude close to 9,000 feet. Her roots are in the indigenous Ca\u00f1ari tribe, who lived in the Andes for thousand of years, following the lunar calendar and building temples to the moon, before the sun-worshipping Incas arrived in the late 15th century.She and her former husband, Luis Nestor Dutan, were among many Ecuadorean immigrants who came to New York in the 1980s from Ca\u00f1ar and neighboring Azuay Province after the price of oil \u2014 Ecuador\u2019s largest export \u2014 fell.

{"Headline": "\u2018Don\u2019t Get Too Excited\u2019 About Medicare for All", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisMore and more politicians are calling for single-payer health care. Is it just talk?Dr. Rosenthal was an emergency room doctor before becoming a journalist. Ms. Luthra is a correspondent for Kaiser Health News.After decades in the political wilderness, \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and single-payer health care are suddenly popular. The words appear in political advertisements and are cheered at campaign rallies \u2014 even in deep-red states. They are promoted by a growing number of high-profile Democratic candidates, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas.It is not that. But what exactly these proposals mean to many of the people who say they support them remains unclear. For every candidate with a clear proposal in mind, another uses the phrases as a proxy for voter frustration. The risk, some critics say, is that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d could become a Democratic version of the Republican \u201crepeal and replace\u201d slogan \u2014 a vote-getter that does not translate to political action because there is neither agreement about what it means nor a viable plan.\u201cIf you\u2019re on the left, you have to have something on health care to say at town halls,\u201d said David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cSo you say this and move on. That\u2019s part of the motivation.\u201d Dr. Carol Paris, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program, an advocacy group, said she has fielded a number of calls from candidates asking for tutorials on Medicare for all.\u201cI\u2019m heartened, but not persuaded\u201d that all the high-profile talk will result in any action, she said. She worries about what she called \u201cfaux \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 plans\u201d that don\u2019t live up to the mantra.Polling highlights health care as a top voter concern, and pressure is building for politicians to take meaningful action that could redress the pain caused by personal health care costs that continue to rise faster than inflation. Maybe that action would be negotiating lower drug prices or fixing flaws in the insurance system that allow for surprise medical bills and high out-of-pocket costs. Republican candidates mostly continue to bad-mouth \u201cObamacare\u201d as the root of all problems in American health care (of course, it\u2019s not), and some still push to repeal it. They tend to offer only vague assurances that, for example, they will guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions can find affordable insurance \u2014 proposals that do not withstand expert scrutiny.But more and more voters seem to think the country needs more radical change.The broader goal \u2014 affordable, universal health care \u2014 could be achieved by a range of strategies. For models, we can look to nations that have generally achieved better health outcomes, for less money, than the United States. Canada and Britain come particularly close to true single-payer. Their governments pay medical bills with money raised through taxes and have monopolistic negotiating power over prices. But after that, the systems differ.In Canada, which is Mr. Sanders\u2019s inspiration, the government provides health insurance for most medical needs, with no out-of-pocket costs. People can, and often do, buy a second, private plan for any unmet health needs, such as prescription drugs.Britain goes a step further. Its government owns hospitals and employs many specialists via the National Health Service. A small private system exists, catering mainly to wealthier people seeking faster access to elective procedures.Other countries achieve universal health care (or nearly so), but without single-payer. France and Germany have kept an insurance system intact but heavily regulate health care, including by setting the prices for medical procedures and drugs, and requiring all citizens to purchase coverage.There\u2019s also the thorny issue of how Medicare for all would affect the thousands of jobs at private insurers. \u201cWe have an insurance industry in Omaha, and people say, \u2018I worry about those jobs,\u2019\u201d said Kara Eastman, a Democrat running on Medicare for all in Nebraska\u2019s Second District. She suggested people could be retrained, saying there would have to be \u201crepurposing of positions.\u201dCritics of Medicare for all, on the other hand, tend to exaggerate the costs of single-payer: \u201cDenmark\u2019s top tax bracket is nearly 60 percent!\u201d (True, although that\u2019s largely not because of health care.) \u201cDoctors\u2019 incomes will drop 40 percent!\u201d (True, specialists in private practice would probably see pay cuts, but primary care doctors could well see an increase.)Canadians generally pay higher taxes than Americans do \u2014 specifically a goods and services tax, and higher taxes on the wealthy. In Germany, working people pay 7.5 percent of income as a contribution toward comprehensive insurance.Some candidates do have clear proposals in mind. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for example, running for the House from New York\u2019s 14th District, is firm: a single, government-run health plan that covers everyone with no co-payments or deductibles and perhaps allows Americans to buy supplemental private coverage. It\u2019s the Canadian approach, textbook single-payer.Mr. O\u2019Rourke casts Medicare for all as a starting point for discussion. But he said that what matters most is \u201chigh-quality, guaranteed universal health care.\u201d Getting there, he added, \u201cwill inevitably require some compromise\u201d \u2014 like a public option. Notably, he has not signed on as a co-sponsor of the Medicare for all bill because that plan does not allow for-profit providers to participate.Jared Golden, a Democratic House candidate from Maine\u2019s Second District, says in his campaign materials that he favors \u201csomething like Medicare for all,\u201d but he clarified that at least initially, he would argue to lower the Medicare eligibility age, a change that wonks often call \u201cMedicare for more.\u201dAnd the Wisconsin Democrat Randy Bryce, who is running to replace Speaker Paul Ryan in the House, said he would support a public option or lowering the eligibility age for Medicare. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that there\u2019s only one way to go about it,\u201d Mr. Bryce said.But many other candidates \u2014 both for Congress and for governorships \u2014 who are talking \u201cMedicare for all\u201d on the campaign trail either did not acknowledge or declined multiple requests to be interviewed on the subject. They include Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor in Florida; Gina Ortiz Jones of the Texas 23rd; the California candidate for governor Gavin Newsom; the Massachusetts Seventh candidate Ayanna Pressley; and the Pennsylvania First District candidate Scott Wallace. Ms. Lake, the pollster, suggested that policy details simply aren\u2019t as relevant in a midterm year and that for now we shouldn\u2019t expect a candidate\u2019s support for Medicare for all to be anything more than a way to signal his or her values. But she suggested that will change in the run-up to 2020, adding, \u201cWhen we head into the presidential election, people will probably be pickier and want more details.\u201dThat gives politicians and voters a few years to decide what they mean and what they want when they say they support Medicare for all or single-payer health care. For now, it\u2019s hard to read too much into promises.Dr. Paris, who lives in Nashville, said she was surprised and excited to hear that her representative, Jim Cooper, a Blue Dog Democrat, had signed up as a co-sponsor of the Medicare for all bill.\u201cI told him, \u2018I\u2019m dumbfounded,\u2019\u201d she recalled.His answer? \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited.\u201dElisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the author of \u201cAn American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back\u201d and editor in chief of Kaiser Health News.

Are there forums where the neighborhood can tell its collective story?Thinking in neighborhood terms means radical transformation in how change is done. It means escaping the tyranny of randomized controlled experiments in which one donor funds one program that tries to isolate one leverage point to have \u201cimpact.\u201dIt means adjusting the structures of the state so that the neighborhood is an important structure of self-government, rather than imposing blanket programs willy-nilly across neighborhood lines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fate Worse Than Slavery, Unearthed in Sugar Land", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBodies of sugar cane workers recently discovered in Texas reveal gruesome details about the convict leasing system.Mr. Staples is a member of the editorial board.Against this backdrop, archaeologists, who are constructing an increasingly detailed portrait of the injuries and illnesses suffered by these inmates, have opened a window onto the murderous nature of sugar cultivation, an industry that earned its reputation as the slaughterhouse of the trans-Atlantic slave trade by killing more people more rapidly than any other kind of agriculture. Northup writes: \u201cThe hands are not allowed to sit down long enough to eat their dinners. Carts filled with corn cake, cooked at the kitchen, are driven into the field at noon. The cake is distributed by the drivers, and must be eaten with the least possible delay.\u201d The harvesters worked relentlessly in blistering heat, hacking down 10-foot cane with machete-like knives and transporting it to the plantation mill to be processed, until they passed out from what appeared to be heat stroke. Then, Northup tells us, they were dragged into the shade, doused with buckets of water and ordered back into their places in the cane.Taken together, haste and fatigue and lengthening work hours heightened the risk of accident already endemic on the plantations. Unlike cane workers today, who wear heavy, protective clothing, the enslaved workers were vulnerable to being gouged and cut by the lacerating leaves of the plant.Bone-tired slaves \u2014\u00a0who fed the cane stalks into the mechanical rollers that pressed them into juice \u2014\u00a0lost hands or were pulled into the rollers and dismembered. This outcome was common enough that a slave was often stationed nearby with a sword to sever the mill feeder\u2019s arm before she could be pulled to her death in the rollers. The death rates on such plantations were compounded by malnutrition and disease, and were so obscenely high that the ranks of the enslaved needed constant replenishment.The Texas sugar plantations were profitable because they depended on slave labor. Abolition crushed the industry, but the convict leasing system resurrected it in a form that can legitimately be seen as more pernicious than slavery: Slave masters had at least a nominal interest in keeping alive people whom they owned and in whom they held an economic stake. Prison records show relatively young people succumbing to edema, heart failure and symptoms that indicate sun stroke and extreme dehydration, also documented by Solomon Northup in his Louisiana memoir. Beyond that, researchers have turned up bone infections, healed breaks, bones contorted by heavy labor and muscles torn away from the bone.When the forensic report is finished, Texans will have a clearer vantage point on how the sugar barons enriched themselves by systematically working people to death.

Mr. Kohn is an author and lecturer who specializes in human behavior and education.Psychologists often distinguish between intrinsic motivation (wanting to do something for its own sake) and extrinsic motivation (for example, doing something in order to snag a goody). The first is the best predictor of high-quality achievement, and it can actually be undermined by the second. Moreover, when you promise people a reward, they often perform more poorly as a result.I began tracking, and trying to explain, these lines of research back in the late 1980s. This year I reviewed as many studies as I could find that had been conducted since then. The conclusions that rewards frequently kill both interest and excellence have, if anything, grown more solid in the intervening decades.There was one aspect of the California study, however, that wasn\u2019t already settled science. The researchers tried offering students a reward unexpectedly, after the fact, and this tactic turned out to be even more damaging than telling the students about the reward in advance. Earlier studies were mixed on this question, with some showing that unexpected rewards, while unhelpful, at least weren't damaging. But that was only in contrived, one-shot lab studies. If you get an unexpected reward in the real world, you\u2019re likely to expect another one next time. Then you may feel resentful if you don\u2019t get one \u2014 and manipulated if you do.By now it should be clear that the trouble doesn\u2019t lie with the type of reward, the schedule on which it\u2019s presented, or any other detail of how it\u2019s done. The problem is the outdated theory of motivation underlying the whole idea of treating people like pets \u2014 that is, saying: Do this, and you\u2019ll get that.The best that carrots \u2014 or sticks \u2014 can do is change people\u2019s behavior temporarily. They can never create a lasting commitment to an action or a value, and often they have exactly the opposite effect \u2026 contrary to hypothesis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamal Khashoggi Body Double Created False Trail in Turkey, Surveillance Images Suggest", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe team of Saudi agents that killed the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul brought a body double who resembled Mr. Khashoggi and wore his clothes as part of a cover-up, Turkish and Saudi officials said Monday.Turkey leaked security camera video footage on Monday showing the look-alike strolling the streets of Istanbul shortly after Mr. Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate.The impostor was easily recognizable in part because he wore different-colored shoes than Mr. Khashoggi was when he entered the consulate. A Saudi official as well as another Saudi briefed on the kingdom\u2019s investigation into the killing confirmed the ruse.The inclusion of a body double in the squad is the latest indication that the death of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist last seen on Oct. 2, occurred during a premeditated plot by the Saudis to abduct or kill him and hide what they did.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has promised that on Tuesday he will reveal for the first time the truth \u201cin full nakedness,\u201d in the face of what his aides have called a Saudi cover-up. Turkish officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said they have recordings and other evidence showing that Mr. Khashoggi was murdered and then dismembered on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi royal court.On Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers admitted for the first time that their agents had killed Mr. Khashoggi. In their new version of events, they said he was accidentally strangled during a brawl that broke out in the consulate as the Saudi agents tried to persuade him to return to the kingdom.The Saudi officials have also said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler of the kingdom, had no knowledge of the mission and that he learned of the killing only two weeks later.Asked why a team that had not intended to harm Mr. Khashoggi had employed a look-alike to try to fool security cameras, a Saudi official briefed on the matter said it had been a spur-of-the moment improvisation after the agents realized they had killed him.\u201cThey panicked after he died, and in order to make it appear he left the consulate, they decided to impersonate him,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Turkish officials, however, noted that the look-alike\u2019s background also raised questions about why he was sent to Istanbul in the first place.Officials of the kingdom have acknowledged that a team of 15 Saudis flew into Istanbul on Oct. 2 for the Khashoggi mission, and Turkish officials have disclosed the names of 15 Saudis who were almost all young men with obvious ties to the security services.Other details and disputes continued to emerge. Even as they acknowledge that Mr. Khashoggi was killed, Saudi officials have insisted that they have no information about the location of his remains. They have said the agents handed the remains to a local accomplice whose identity remains undisclosed.On Monday, the official who discussed the body double added a new detail to the Saudi account of the body\u2019s disposal: The agents, the official said, rolled Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s body in a rug before handing it over.Turkish officials have said that audio recordings and other evidence show that the team moved to kill and dismember Mr. Khashoggi almost immediately after he entered the consulate, during an appointment to pick up a document. The Saudi team included a doctor who was perhaps the foremost expert on autopsies in the kingdom, and, according to Turkish officials, he brought a bone saw for use in disposing of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s remains.On Monday, a person close to Mr. Erdogan and briefed on the Turkish evidence added new specificity to the Turkish claims about the speed with which Mr. Khashoggi was killed, and said it also showed premeditation.Mr. Khashoggi came under attack within two minutes of entering the consulate, this person said, was dead within seven minutes, and was dismembered within 22 minutes. Turkish officials briefed on the investigation have previously said that the team had finished its work and left the consulate within less than two hours.Amid the escalating doubts about Saudi Arabia\u2019s new explanation for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, a growing number of current and former Western government officials with extensive experience in Saudi Arabia have now said publicly that they believe Crown Prince Mohammed must have ordered the killing.Mr. Erdogan has long publicly treated the crown prince as a respected ally to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia, an important regional power. But it was an open secret that the two men were bitter rivals in a feud over Arab democracy and political Islam that has divided the region.Evidently sensing Saudi weakness after the skeptical reception that greeted the latest claims from the kingdom, Mr. Erdogan over the last two days has gone on the attack.Mr. Erdogan has promised to reveal a truth \u201cin full nakedness\u201d in a political speech on Tuesday. A political ally close to him said the Turkish president planned to ask pointed questions implicitly or indirectly blaming the royal court for the killing.But the same ally tamped down expectations, saying Mr. Erdogan does not intend to disclose the specific evidence other officials have cited. Some of that evidence may have been obtained through audio surveillance of the consulate in violation of international agreements. Mr. Erdogan is instead expected to postpone further revelations pending a report on the case by a Turkish prosecutor.But he remains determined to try to assign the blame for the killing to the upper reaches of the Saudi royal court, as close as possible to the crown prince, the ally said. Turkey also sees an added benefit to deferring full disclosure: It could prolong international attention to the mystery of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate, compounding the damage to the prince\u2019s reputation.Mr. Erdogan, the person close to him said, recounted that a Saudi envoy, Prince Khaled bin Faisal, had offered a package of inducements for Turkey to drop the case \u2014 including financial aid and investments to help Turkey\u2019s struggling economy, and an end to a Saudi embargo on Qatar, a Turkish ally. Mr. Erdogan has told associates that he angrily rejected the offer as \u201ca political bribe,\u201d this person said.In the meantime the international backlash against Saudi Arabia has widened.Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the disclosures so far about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death a \u201cshocking violation\u201d of international conventions and norms of consular behavior.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, has been placed under police protection, a Turkish official said on Monday. The official said the measure had been taken not because of any specific threat, but because Ms. Cengiz, who was to marry Mr. Khashoggi the day after he went to the Saudi Consulate, had been the target of online abuse.Reporting was contributed by Malachy Browne, Christiaan Triebert, Matthew Rosenberg and Alissa J.

End Trump\u2019s Draconian Policies.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration created this crisis.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The Trump administration has struggled for solutions as the 100 or so shelters that house minors who\u2019ve crossed the border without parents have filled to capacity. More children stuck in immigration limbo for increasing periods of time have strained the system that manages such kids. (As The Times reported, officials feared that the children being taken to Texas \u2014\u00a0among 13,000 being detained nationwide \u2014 would run off if they were told ahead of time, or moved them during waking hours.)How to best handle the cases of unaccompanied minors has perplexed authorities since the Obama administration. But the current crowding is not a result of some sharp increase in children stealing across the border \u2014 the influx is no greater now than it has been for the past two years. Images of young children who were taken from their parents this summer prompted a widespread public outcry, leading the Trump White House and immigration officials to reverse course. The long-lasting trauma of extended detention, however, is harder to capture on film. Proponents of the current system insist that the restrictions on sponsors were put into place for the children\u2019s protection. But it\u2019s hard to see how any of the new policies could possibly do more good than harm.Given that dozens of prospective sponsors have already been arrested, and that a vast majority have committed no other crimes, it seems that the true purpose of the new sponsor requirements is to find and deport as many undocumented immigrants as possible. Meanwhile, thousands of children languish. They\u2019d be in the homes of friends and relatives if the administration ended the crackdown. These arrangements can also be imperfect, but in most cases, they are far better than an indefinite stay in desert tents at taxpayers\u2019 expense.Long-term solutions to America\u2019s immigration challenges will come only with political compromise and a comprehensive reordering of official policies. But further traumatizing children whose lives have already been upended, and detaining them indefinitely, serves only to deepen the shame of this country\u2019s treatment of vulnerable brown-skinned children, many of whom will spend a lifetime recovering from our failures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Insidious and Contagious American Presidency", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump believes that judges should be agents of those who appoint them. That would be the end of the rule of law.Opinion ColumnistInsidious is the man. Insidious is his pollution of the F.B.I., whose former director, James Comey, he fired after Comey refused to show \u201cloyalty.\u201d Loyalty in this instance meant willingness to shelve, at Trump\u2019s demand, an investigation into dealings between his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Russia.Contagious is the man. Contagious is Trump\u2019s view that judges should be agents of those who appoint them rather than the independent guarantors of America\u2019s constitutional democracy. Trump wants loyalty from Kavanaugh, too, and the angry, emotional testimony that the judge provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee carried this subliminal message: \u201cI am one of yours.\u201d It was right out of the Trump playbook.The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the rule of law. It was conceived as a critical part of the political system, not as just another venue for ordinary, ugly, polarized politics. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation would be the capstone to a shift in that direction. Courts were meant to be America\u2019s great levelers, not their great dividers and inciters.\u201cKavanaugh\u2019s statements were so partisan and suggested so strongly an inability to be independent on any sort of issue salient to contemporary politics that his confirmation would put at serious risk the rule of law,\u201d Stephen Burbank, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said. Imagine a Justice Kavanaugh on political gerrymandering.Poisonous is the man. Poisonous is Trump\u2019s inability to abandon mob incitement as his mode of political operation. Meanness is how this man gets his kicks. Always was, always will be.It has become axiomatic to regret the tribal division of the United States \u2014 the inability to build bridges or even hold conversations across ideological divides, the sharpening national fracture into algorithm-consolidated political silos \u2014 and, of course, the Kavanaugh hearings now constitute Exhibit A in this unraveling.There\u2019s something pathetic about these laments. No call for civility or the capacity for civilized disagreement (the sign of any healthy society) has any weight when, from the highest office in the land, there emanates a stream of partisan vilification. The Oval Office either ennobles Americans or befouls them. There is no escape from the current poison, other than to vote Trump out.In the end, the Kavanaugh hearings have been about the pursuit of truth \u2014 the truth of this Jekyll-and-Hyde man, the truth of whether he assaulted Dr. Blasey, the truth of his words. I believe he failed the test of truth in ways that disqualify him from confirmation.But the meaning of honesty is not something Americans can agree on any more. So the hearings have been about everything but that: white privilege, the #MeToo movement and, of course, Donald Trump.Corrosive is the man. Corrosive is the pollution of the F.B.I. that now seems about to be extended to the Supreme Court. Other pillars of the Republic, including a free press, are in Trump\u2019s sights. Behind the scattershot outbursts, there is a consistent pattern. It conforms to all we know about a president whose sympathies lie with the autocrats of the world, from Moscow to Manila, rather than with democratic leaders.Free societies do not die overnight. The growth of a climate of intellectual fear is one sign of their weakening. So are the development of a personality cult, the stripping of meaning from language and the spread of disorientation.Infectious is the man. Infectious is Trump\u2019s hard work to bring the whole country down to his level. A spineless Republican Party folds into the Trump Party. Uncle Sam wants you in his indecent reality show. If, as now seems likely, Kavanaugh is confirmed, Trump will be confirmed; and the damage this president has done will look more irreparable in the age of the judge-agent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Sturdy Love Is What You Need", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveThere is the often facile social media narrative of overcoming adversity in marriage. And then there is the reality. I clicked and then winced as I took in a photo of an icy Montana highway, a pickup with the hood smashed in, and a blue Subaru Outback that had been cut cleanly in half. Skimming, I learned that the woman \u2014 a former high school classmate, Deirdre \u2014 was expected to survive and her daughter, 3, had been airlifted to a hospital.Three years earlier, my husband, Eric, and I had lost our 22-month-old son, Seamus, when they were struck in a crosswalk by a careless driver. I disappeared from Facebook afterward, emerging only when I became pregnant 16 months later, a tidy ending for my social media world. I let others write the story of my marriage as one that survived tragedy and emerged even stronger.In reality, we were more like a ship that had weathered a bad storm \u2014 grateful and relieved to be afloat, but the damage was extensive.The implication from my friend who tagged me was that I should do something. But I hadn\u2019t seen Deirdre in 20 years. How would it feel to hear from someone whose experience included the worst outcome?I grabbed my raincoat and headed out. It was drizzly and cold in downtown Portland, the streets bustling with Christmas shoppers. My son and daughter \u2014 twins born two years after Seamus died \u2014 had just turned 1, and this was the first year in recent memory I approached the holiday with something other than dread. I had even dug out our Christmas decorations, a disorganized time capsule of tangled light strings, Seamus\u2019s stocking and random ornaments.Now all the merriment seemed ridiculous. I headed from the mall toward the Willamette River, wondering about Deirdre\u2019s holiday plans. Would they celebrate at home or in a hospital? Would they celebrate at all?Along the river the crowd thinned, reduced to the occasional jogger or cyclist. I was tempted to yell, \u201cChildren aren\u2019t supposed to die!\u201d just to feel a little less alone. Surely they would agree.But grief is a solitary journey, even when you\u2019re married and the deceased is a child you loved in equal measure. When we returned from the hospital without Seamus, Eric retreated to the nursery, howling with pain. I avoided Seamus\u2019s room, instead sitting on the couch he had christened with a Sharpie just a few days earlier, my body vibrating with shock as I received a steady stream of tearful visitors.As the weeks wore on, I sought solace from friends and therapy while Eric turned inward, comforted only by the thought of having another child. I wanted another baby, too, but I also wanted to travel, sell our house, start over \u2014 all things Eric resisted.If we stayed together, it was mostly in proximity, necessitated by our shared goal of becoming parents again. We spent a year having sad, purposeful sex. Then, as I approached my 36th birthday, we sought help from a fertility specialist, who pronounced us infertile, refusing to treat us unless we used an egg donor. Then a second doctor agreed to a Hail Mary round of in vitro fertilization for $18,000.When we learned I was pregnant with twins, our community \u2014 most of whom knew nothing of our struggle to become pregnant \u2014 celebrated with us, using words like \u201cmiracle.\u201d Meanwhile, I surveyed the damage.Having more children did not reduce the sadness that had become the identifying feature of our marriage, but it did force our hearts to expand to accommodate other, happier emotions. My life acquired a richness that did not exist before Seamus died, as if it had switched from black-and-white television to high definition color. I was surprised by the way ordinary pleasures \u2014 birds on our feeder, the sticky grasp of toddler fingers or a sip of water after a run \u2014 counterweighed the sorrow.If Deirdre\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t make it, this is what I would want to tell her: that grief is exactly as painful as you think it will be, but with time you will learn to love your sadness because of the tiny shoots of joy and gratitude that sprout around it, like new growth on scorched earth.Rounding the corner to my office, I brought my thoughts back to the present, where an afternoon meeting and an evening of toddler wrangling awaited. I told myself there was nothing I could do, that Deirdre\u2019s daughter would make a full recovery, probably.Two weeks later, I received another Facebook message letting me know that Deirdre\u2019s daughter had died. This time, there was no stuffing my feelings. I came home from work and raced through a blur of food-smeared trays, double baths, lullabies and feeble cleanup efforts before collapsing with Eric on the couch, where we cried together, replaying those first awful days in our heads.One afternoon while our children napped, I ventured into our basement to retrieve a wicker basket of cards we had received after Seamus died, feeling a sudden camaraderie with the writers, despite the common phrases that kept appearing: \u201cThere are no words.\u201d \u201cYou are in our hearts.\u201d \u201cI cannot imagine your pain.\u201dNo one can think of the perfect thing to say at such times. I couldn\u2019t either.But remembering the comfort the notes had brought, I decided to send Deirdre a card anyway. To my surprise, she replied by email, and soon we were exchanging text messages. I told her I had a trip to Montana planned in April, and we arranged to meet.On the drive to her house, I clutched a small moonstone my grief counselor had given me. Its smooth surface calmed me as I navigated a two-lane highway that threaded through a Montana landscape of grazing cattle and snow-dusted hills.Inching my car toward a cozy cabin at the end of a long driveway, I felt young Zoe\u2019s absence press against my chest. I wondered if horses in the nearby pasture noticed the way world around them had been altered. It was a stillness I knew well.Deirdre greeted me with a hug, apologizing as her new puppy, Chief, mauled me with wet dog kisses. Tall and slender, her brown hair cut into a bob, she had no visible signs of injury. With the exception of a few strands of gray hair, she looked much as she had two decades before. We went for a walk through the winding streets of her subdivision, the Beartooth Mountains towering in the distance and Chief running in circles, entertaining us with his puppy energy.There was no small talk. We discussed watching our children die, moving easily between medical terms and mother terms. At one point, one of Deirdre\u2019s neighbors drove by in a black pickup. She rolled down her window and Deirdre introduced me, then they chatted for a few minutes.As the woman drove away, Deirdre said, \u201cThat\u2019s Chief\u2019s veterinarian. She also lost a son, years ago.\u201dI marveled at the three of us talking about the weather and the dog, our shattered hearts somehow still beating.I asked Deirdre how her marriage was holding up, and she told me her husband was struggling over having made the decision to withdraw care for Zoe. I found myself saying, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d even though I could and had imagined that scenario with Seamus many times.\u201cBy the time doctors declared Seamus\u2019s time of death,\u201d I said, \u201cthere was no room for doubt.\u201d I then said something about being \u201clucky,\u201d and we both laughed. I told her my marriage had suffered \u2014 Eric\u2019s near-total reliance on me for emotional support was suffocating at times, and I often felt I had to choose between caring for him and caring for myself. But people didn\u2019t want to hear that because it countered the preferred narrative of healing and recovery.Deirdre said she loved her husband but wasn\u2019t sure what would become of her marriage. I was glad to give her space to voice something that was obviously true.During our conversation, we discovered that both Seamus and Zoe loved the moon, so before I left, I handed Deirdre the moonstone my counselor had given me, and we promised to keep in touch.Two hours after I arrived, as the sun set in fiery streaks over the mountains, I drove back to my family. When a farmer waved at me from inside a beat-up pickup, I thought about the comfort of sturdy, unglamorous things, my marriage among them.Ours may not be a great love story, but set against a backdrop of cruel nature and boundless beauty, I didn\u2019t need it to be.Advertisement"}

It has zero appeal. Why would I do that?\u201dMs. Jinich (HEEN-itch), 46, lives in a large, lovely home decorated with Mexican art and surrounded by hydrangeas in a historic part of Chevy Chase, Md.Ms. Jinich shares the house with her husband, Daniel Jinich, 53, who manages a venture capital fund. They met on a blind date in Mexico City. Like hers, his background is both Mexican and Jewish.They moved to Dallas 20 years ago for his career. She wasn\u2019t a cook then, but she started because she was a wife and a young mother and homesick. \u201cWe have a very Latin marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe woman does the school and the health and the house.\u201dMs. Jinich, usually so contagiously upbeat it can be exhausting, could barely contain her sadness in front of the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing, but I am happy for him, of course,\u201d she said during the drive to Taco Bell. \u201cIn Mexico, you stay at home until you\u2019re married or can afford your own place.\u201d \u201cI have the best Mexican food at home,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I don\u2019t need to go to Taco Bell.\u201dShe dreaded going to work, except for the part where she got to think about lunch. One day, she was asked to compare the transitions to democracy in Peru and Mexico, but instead went deep researching the differences between Peruvian and Mexican ceviche.Cooking didn\u2019t come naturally to her, although her three older sisters are in the business and her father, Moises Drijanski, is a larger-than-life kind of guy who ran two restaurants in Mexico City. He would sneak jam and caviar home in his suitcase, and once fed the family so much fettuccine at Alfredo\u2019s in Rome that the chef came out to see who was eating it all.Many in the family were surprised that the youngest child \u2014 the studious, serious one \u2014 would become a food star. But not her dad.Her father teased her about how much money she must be making. She rolled her eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s very Jewish,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so is giving food. How can I show you love? I will give you food.\u201dBoth sets of her grandparents immigrated to Mexico from Eastern Europe to escape the pogroms. Some landed in Mexico City. A great-aunt who survived Auschwitz settled in Acapulco and opened an Austrian-style bakery.Now, she estimates that more than a third of her work is at live events or on other people\u2019s radio or television shows. She is so busy she can teach only four classes a year. Tickets cost $115, and they sell out fast.Both were nonstarters for her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m the owner of Latin America and cook food I don\u2019t know anything about,\u201d she said.The only downside is securing sponsors. She finds it grueling, even though she manages to raise $1.2 million each season. She didn\u2019t have that kind of money when she started, and her first producers had little experience making cooking shows. Even though the company owners were Latino, they dressed her the way they thought Americans might want to see a Mexican woman cook, with big hoop earrings, lots of makeup and colorful clothes.A few years ago, she switched to a production company that \u201cisn\u2019t all jalape\u00f1os and painted plates and a donkey in your living room.\u201d\u201cHer ability to go between what her kids love, that wonky dimension of history, etymology and what food says about the Mexican outlook on life is remarkable,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cShe is just a natural ambassador.\u201dNow, Ms. Jinich says, she wants to expand that role and tackle substantial topics. \u201cThrow me the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move more into politics.\u201dIn the program\u2019s seventh season, which began in September, she travels to the Baja Peninsula and takes on the border wall that was a centerpiece of President Trump\u2019s campaign.Mexican food, she said, is more popular than ever \u2014 a bridge between her two countries that people on both sides of the political divide can unite over.\u201cI have so many followers and fans that I look at their profile and they\u2019re MAGA,\u201d she said. \u201cMexican food is that soft power.\u201dShe feels pressure from purists to assert that pre-colonial, indigenous dishes are the only real Mexican food.\u201cOther people tell me if it\u2019s north of the border, it\u2019s not Mexican,\u201d she said. \u201cI think both are totally false. Immigration makes the culture more vibrant and more alive on both sides of the border.\u201dMs. Jinich, he said, belongs to a generation of Mexican cooks who are true to their culture and proud of Mexico\u2019s food, but see the value in showcasing it for Americans. \u201cShe\u2019s a smart Mexican woman who doesn\u2019t have to cha-cha-cha her way through a screen to teach people about Mexicans,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows that dismissing restaurants because they are serving food you don\u2019t like isn\u2019t going to do much good.\u201dHe wished her good luck with Taco Bell, though.She walked in armed with a list of 19 items to try, all suggestions from her fans. Her order filled four trays. Her first bite: a ground beef taco in a soft flour tortilla. She squinted. She shrugged.Maybe salsa would help? She tasted each of the four options, squeezed from plastic packets. \u201cThe association I have with salsa has nothing to do with this salsa,\u201d she said.A chicken chalupa was marginally better: \u201cI can see being super-hungry and eating it, but I don\u2019t think you really want to see everything that\u2019s in it.\u201dIn the end, the Dorito Locos Tacos Supreme was her favorite, even though it took her a minute to understand that the \u201csupreme\u201d part simply meant an upgrade of sour cream and chopped tomatoes.Later that night, Juju had a terrible stomachache, and Ms. Jinich\u2019s cheery thoughts about Taco Bell as a gateway to Mexican culture had turned to sadness. \u201cThey have a responsibility to do better,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have all these resources. They need to step up to the plate.\u201dAnd who better to help than Mexicans?\u201cThere are millions of Mexicans in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should ask one.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Pati Jinich left the think tank Inter-American Dialogue to begin her culinary career.

Now the bitter rivals may fight for investors in their initial public offerings.Uber has received proposals from the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that say the technology giant could be worth as much as $120 billion in an I.P.O., two people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to discuss it publicly said on Tuesday.At $120 billion, Uber\u2019s debut on Wall Street would be the biggest since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.The market for tech I.P.O.s has surged in 2018. Nearly 200 companies have raised more than $53 billion in initial public offerings in American markets, making it the busiest year for tech newcomers to Wall Street since 2014, according to data from Dealogic.But a blockbuster public offering for Uber, which has burned through billions of dollars since it was founded in 2009 and does not appear to be close to sustained profitability, would mark a significant increase in risk-taking for investors in publicly traded companies.The banks also suggested that Uber could list its shares for trading on the stock market earlier than its original plans for late 2019. That would put pressure on the company\u2019s main rival in the United States, Lyft, which recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its own initial public offering, said two other people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.This year, Lyft\u2019s latest fund-raising round valued the company at $15 billion. It had been planning to go public in the spring, putting distance between its I.P.O. and Uber\u2019s.Now the companies could find themselves in a race to the public markets, courting investors eager for a piece of two prominent tech industry darlings. The company that goes first is expected to have an advantage and could demand a higher price for its shares.\u201cThe first ride-sharing I.P.O. will get a lot of attention, so I think there\u2019s some marketing value to being the first one out of the gate,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides research and manages funds.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. is likely to be among the biggest financial events on Wall Street next year. At $120 billion, it would rival the total value of Facebook when it went public in 2012 with a market capitalization of $104 billion, Ms. Smith said.As a privately held company, Uber is not required to publicly disclose its quarterly results. But for some time it has revealed basic financial information to give investors a better sense of its health.At the time, Uber was struggling to overcome a range of management issues, and the SoftBank investment was a steep discount from earlier rounds, which priced the company as high as $70 billion.A $500 million investment made by Toyota in August valued Uber at $76 billion.The San Francisco company is aggressively trying to increase business for UberEats, its food delivery business, and is expanding into rentals of electric bikes and scooters, as well as bookings for freight shipments.Lyft said revenue for 2017 was $1 billion \u2014 a 168 percent increase from the year before \u2014 but did not disclose its profits or losses for the year. Financial analysts assume Lyft, like Uber, has burned through significant amounts of cash.Uber and Lyft are both working on autonomous vehicles. Executives believe that driverless cars could eliminate one of their biggest expenses \u2014 human drivers. But the technology is, for the moment, prohibitively expensive and far from wide commercial use.A lack of profits is unlikely to scare off investors. Much as it did during the dot-com boom nearly 20 years ago, Wall Street is cozying up to tech companies that are growing fast but burning through cash.\u201cI think investors are going to be comfortable with Uber,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe issue is going to be at what price.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting in New York.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistYes, Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court. Rue the day. Rend your garments.Then, step back, view the entirety of the battle in which you are engaged, and understand that Kavanaugh is just one part of a much larger plan by conservatives to fundamentally change the American political structure so that it enshrines and protects white male power even after America\u2019s changing demographics and mores move away from that power.This, for them, is not simply a game about political passion and political principles. This is a game of power, pure and simple, and it\u2019s about whether the people who have long held that power will be able to retain it.For them, Trump is just a useful idiot, a temporary anomaly.They are thinking generationally, not in terms of the next election cycle but in terms of the next epoch.Liberals can get so high-minded that they lose sight of the ground war. Yes, next month it is important to prove to the rest of Americans, and indeed the world, that Trump and the Republicans who promote and protect him are at odds with American values and with the American majority.On one level this would provide relief and release for a pent-up demand by most Americans to be heard and to calm some of the chaos. But, catharsis is an emotional response and an emotional remedy.Liberals have to look beyond emotions, beyond reactionary electoral enthusiasm, beyond needing to fall in love with candidates in order to vote for them, beyond the coming election and toward the coming showdown.For instance, the constant pining about justices who will interpret the \u201coriginal intent\u201d of the Constitution feels far bigger than single issues like gun control.\u201cAny Supreme Court confirmation is transformative. This is a court that is often equally divided. At the end of the day, I think what\u2019s really important to remember is that there\u2019s been a movement on the court toward being more originalist and textualist. In other words, the idea that law means something, it has determinate meaning. And that\u2019s the trend that I think this president wants to continue.\u201dBut, when I think of originalism, I think this: Many of the founders owned slaves; in the Constitution they viewed black people as less than fully human; they didn\u2019t want women or poor white men to vote. The founders, a bunch of rich, powerful white men, didn\u2019t want true democracy in this country, and in fact were dreadfully afraid of it.Now, a bunch of rich, powerful white men want to return us to this sensibility, wrapped in a populist \u201cfollow the Constitution\u201d rallying cry and disguised as the ultimate form of patriotism.We have to learn to see everything around us, all that is happening on the political front, through that lens. This is what the extreme measures on illegal immigration and even the efforts to dramatically slash legal immigration are all about.The effort to demonize the lottery program is an effort to preserve America\u2019s white majority, against the statistical eventuality, for as long as possible.And that is also what voter disenfranchisement and Citizens United are about. That is why conservatives cheer the moves by young liberals to densely populated cities. The move weakens conservative votes in the places they move to and strengthens it in places they move from.But probably the biggest, gutsiest move is the call for a constitutional convention.There are two ways that amendments to the Constitution can be proposed: One is by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the other is by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the states. The second method has never been used, but is now gathering steam among Republicans.Pierce continued: \u201cIf the convention is called, the disunion that has become a faith in some conservative quarters will run amok. Economic oligarchy will be established in law, and any political check on the powers of business likely will be eviscerated.\u201dFolks, Kavanaugh is only one soldier, albeit an important one, in a larger battle.

Any day you go, the menu is a tease of what might have been.Fortunately, the steam table at the back of the dining room is stocked daily with pollo guisado, chicken stew stained black from sugar thrown in the pan at the start and brought within seconds of a burn. Other regulars are fried sea bass under a drape of coconut milk and sofrito, orange from achiote; and barbecue pork ribs like smoked candy, with meat that gives and gives.Enver Perez and his younger brother, Jeudy Perez, opened Ajo y Or\u00e9gano last October.

Food is presented in aluminum pots sized for little hands, the kind that the Reynoso sisters learned to cook with when they were young. But the contents are hardly dainty, and what look like small portions prove to be more than enough.Not on the menu but worth asking for is mofongo, plantains fried and broken down in a wooden pil\u00f3n (mortar), then molded by hand into a giant cup. Once filled, it\u2019s a caldron, aswamp in melted cheese and either mayo-ketchup or garlicky b\u00e9chamel, with your choice of meat in the depths. Smaller mofonguitos, shaped with a lemon squeezer, fit demurely in ramekins, perhaps a better idea if you don\u2019t want to stagger home.Spanish is the language and the electric current at Ajo y Or\u00e9gano, where forks clank over a low throb of salsa, merengue and bachata from two decades past. The walls of the dining room are as green as palms and mounted with crockery and hot pink shutters. Bills come in shoeshine boxes painted with island scenes, of tin-roofed houses slumbering under flamboyant trees.But the space is too small, which for the crowd growing restive on the porch is a problem. By the end of November, the Perez brothers plan to open a second Ajo y Or\u00e9gano in Belmont, by the Bronx Zoo. Milqueya will oversee the new kitchen, while Jackeline holds down the fort here.As it happens, both aunts worked with Enver in the White Plains Road storefront\u2019s previous incarnation as a healthy meal-preparation service.

Mr. Bennett is a documentary filmmaker. We were on a road trip across Canada and had planned to stop in at the farm, something I don\u2019t get to do often enough, and decided to shoot a little footage. A few days later, we had a full-fledged short documentary on our hands, with our subjects \u2014 my mom, Joan, and my Aunt Neanie \u2014 ready to recall their memories of growing up in this special, remote place. I grew up in the suburbs of Vancouver, British Columbia, so my mom\u2019s accounts of daily life on the farm always seemed a little foreign. Once she told me about how when she was a child in the 1960s, her family turned a small bedroom upstairs into a bathroom. The new bathroom was a big deal: They didn\u2019t have to go outside to the outhouse anymore. If you had visited them then, they would have proudly given you a tour of the first indoor plumbing in their house. As she told me the story, you could tell that disappointing my grandpa still mattered, even though he was no longer with us. Even though the bathtub was now covered in dust and dead insects. And even though the farmhouse was slowly sinking into the dirt basement, taking that old blue tub and all the memories it contains with it. I remember my grandpa only as a quiet man with a sweet smile. A constant supplier of hugs and loonies (our Canadian coins). I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t think much about that chip in subsequent years, but his children still feel the guilt. Most of us carry things like this with us, the ways we shaped our home and, sometimes, disappointed our parents, alongside the fonder memories of childhood. My mom and aunt conjure some of those happier glimpses of home in this film: the sound of cattle, strong winds, laughter and friends, and the resonant hum of frozen telephone lines. If you\u2019re among the work-obsessed, perhaps you could also take note of my grandpa\u2019s late-in-life realization about priorities.

{"Headline": "How Compulsory Voting Works: Australians Explain", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur readers from Australia shared their thoughts about being required to vote and helped explain the ins and outs of the process. This story was updated on Nov. 5, 2018. The dirty work of democracy is often compared to the making of sausages, but Australians almost take that maxim literally \u2014 turning Election Day into a countrywide barbecue, in which the grilling of hot dogs is optional but voting is compulsory.More than 96 percent of eligible Australians are enrolled to vote. Of those, more than 90 percent typically turn out to cast ballots for a federal election, far more than the 55 percent of eligible Americans who participated in the 2016 presidential election. Australians are induced to vote with both sticks and carrots. Shirkers can be fined up to nearly 80 Australian dollars if they fail to show at the polls. But voting, which always takes place on a Saturday, is also made easy and efficient, and is often accompanied by a community barbecue that includes eating what locals affectionately call \u201cdemocracy sausages.\u201d As Americans prepare to vote in the midterm elections on Nov. 6, we asked our readers in Australia to share their experiences and feelings about compulsory voting and explain the ins and outs of the process. Since 1924, Australian citizens over the age of 18 have been required to vote in federal elections, by-elections and referendums. (It was only in 1984, however, that voting became compulsory for Indigenous Australians.) In the decades since, overall voter turnout has never dipped below 90 percent, although there has been a slight downward trend in recent years. \u201cVoting in Australia is like a party. There\u2019s a BBQ at the local school. Everyone turns up. Everyone votes. There\u2019s a sense that: We\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re all affected by the decision we make today.\u201d \u2014 Neil Ennis, Lawnton, Queensland Other countries that require citizens to vote include Argentina, Egypt, Singapore, Switzerland (in one canton only) and Turkey. Unlike in the United States, where voters must cram in a trip to the polls on a workday, federal elections and by-elections in Australia are always held on a Saturday. There are also plenty of ways to vote if you cannot make it to your polling place, including postal ballots and overseas embassies. Voting is a legal requirement and failure to do so comes with a penalty.  Fines range from 20 Australian dollars for missing a federal election, up to 79 Australian dollars for skipping a state poll. Voters, however, are allowed to appeal a fine and explain why they failed to participate.\u201cI once accidentally missed a local election. I was sent a letter asking me what I didn\u2019t vote. I wrote back, explaining I was commuting out of town for work and missed the local ads, and they didn\u2019t fine me.\u201d \u2014 Heather Pate from Perth, Western AustraliaSome Americans view a refusal to participate in the polls as a protest and therefore a kind of vote in itself. Australian critics of compulsory voting argue that as free citizens they should be allowed to choose whether to participate. Others argue that forcing apathetic or uneducated citizens to vote steers the nation\u2019s political destiny toward populism. But according to political scientists, the opposite is more likely true: Forcing people to engage in the process increases their knowledge of the issues and candidates. Voters are compelled to appear at the polls, but they can cast a blank or marred ballot as a protest, which doesn\u2019t count. Some apathetic voters simply number the boxes in the order the candidates appear, which does count and is known as a \u201cdonkey vote.\u201d \u201cI was 18 and feeling very anti-government, didn\u2019t want to cast a vote for either major party, so wrote some anarchist song lyrics on my ballot instead. Looking back I feel ashamed of doing it, because I should have informed myself enough to vote for minor parties and also should have realized that voting in a democracy is a privilege that not everyone has so I shouldn\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d \u2014 Hayley Palumbo, Melbourne, Victoria Many of the Australian readers who responded to our questions professed their love for a tradition that goes hand in hand with voting: democracy sausages. Local community groups often raise money by setting up a grill at polling places to sell sausages wrapped in a slice of bread. One voter, Sophie Kunze from Penrith, New South Wales, shared her biggest gripe with the Australian system: \u201cMore vegetarian options at the sausage sizzles,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDemocracy sausages are for everyone.\u201dMarie Tae McDermott contributed research.Advertisement"}

They aren\u2019t seriously trying to engage with the reality of climate change or the economics of reduced emissions; their goal is to keep polluters free to pollute as long as possible, and they\u2019ll grab onto anything serving that goal.Still, it\u2019s worth pointing out how thoroughly all their arguments have collapsed in recent years.Think about that. Decades ago experts predicted, based on fundamental science, that emissions would raise global temperatures. People like Trump scoffed. Now the experts\u2019 prediction has come true. And the deniers insist that emissions aren\u2019t the culprit, that something else must be driving the change, and it\u2019s all a conspiracy. Come on.In short, while the arguments of climate deniers were always weak, they\u2019ve gotten much weaker. Even if you were genuinely persuaded by the deniers five or 10 years ago, subsequent developments should have made you reconsider.In reality, of course, climate denial has never had much to do with either logic or evidence; as I said, deniers are clearly arguing in bad faith. They don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying. They\u2019re just looking for excuses that will let people like the Koch brothers keep making money. Besides, liberals want to limit emissions, and modern conservatism is largely about owning the libs.One way to think about what\u2019s happening here is that it\u2019s the ultimate example of Trumpian corruption. We have good reason to believe that Trump and his associates are selling out America for the sake of personal gain.

The social network said it would instead focus more on different mediums like ephemeral messaging, private chats and video \u2014 even though none of those make as much money as the News Feed does.\u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors. \u201cIt will take some time, and our revenue growth will be slower.\u201d\u201cThe fact that problems keep emerging reinforces our view that the company is not as in control of its business as it needs to be,\u201d Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said in a note to clients about Facebook.Facebook also said its daily active users increased 9 percent to 1.49 billion from a year earlier, down from 11 percent growth in the previous quarter. Its monthly active users reached 2.27 billion.The company\u2019s slowdown stems from more than just the scandals it has grappled with. Facebook has also almost fully saturated some of its most important markets, including the United States and Europe. In the European Union over the third quarter, Facebook lost one million daily users, partly because of tough new data privacy regulations that were put into place, said Dave Wehner, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Another challenge is that people are moving away from public sharing on the News Feed and other public arenas, Facebook said. Instead, people are shifting more toward private messaging services.\u201cPeople feel more comfortable being themselves when they know their content will be seen by a smaller group, and when they know it won\u2019t stick around forever,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPublic sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately, too.\u201dYet Facebook does not charge as much for advertisers to run ads on \u201cStories\u201d as it does in the News Feed, so shifting to ephemeral messaging may not be as lucrative, the company said. That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was also looking more toward some of the properties it already owned, such as messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger, which together have more than two billion users. It is also building a stable of original programming on Facebook Watch, its video service, to engage users, as well as working on efforts like an e-commerce marketplace, a jobs service and a dating service, he said.\u201cThis is a journey that\u2019s going to take years, not quarters,\u201d Mr. Wehner said in the call with investors. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning \u201cisland of many hills,\u201d but without the second \u201ca\u201d the name just looks incomplete. It\u2019s like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building\u2019s main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s.When you get out of the elevator \u2014 it goes to just one floor, the top \u2014 a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn\u2019t been rented out for parties and sealed off, it\u2019s busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom.You can\u2019t blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn\u2019t quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be.At their best, Manhatta\u2019s better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see.A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus.Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese.Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn\u2019t the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that\u2019s roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it\u2019s hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier\u2019s day, a vanilla souffl\u00e9 with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn\u2019t taste salty.Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canel\u00e9s that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I\u2019d had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one.Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district\u2019s unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we\u2019ve come to recognize from \u201cMargin Call\u201d and \u201cBillions.\u201d At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta\u2019s building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase \u2014 a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it\u2019s still too soon for revolving dance floors.An earlier version of this review misstated the surname of a pastry chef.

{"Headline": "Brazil Election: How Jair Bolsonaro Turned Crisis Into Opportunity", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Had the blade slashed a bit more of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s abdomen, the evangelical preacher who came to see him in the hospital might have had to prepare a eulogy about his friend\u2019s presidential hopes being dashed by the same plague of violence that fueled his stunning rise.Instead, when he saw Mr. Bolsonaro in intensive care last month, the preacher, Silas Malafaia, who is enormously popular in Brazil, saw fit to crack a joke.\u201cLook what God did!\u201d Mr. Malafaia recalls telling the candidate, who was dazed after undergoing numerous procedures to stitch up his intestinal tract and other organs. \u201cYou were stabbed, and now all the other candidates are complaining about all the television coverage you\u2019re getting.\u201dBut far from blunting his rise, the near-fatal stabbing crystallized Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction that only he could straighten out a country reeling from years of economic trouble, corruption scandals and a record-high wave of bloodshed, the pastor said.\u201cI think it gave him a greater sense of purpose,\u201d Mr. Malafaia said. \u201cHe said, \u2018More than ever, my will to help these people, to rescue our nation, has increased.\u2019\u201d\u201cElections won\u2019t change anything in this country,\u201d he said during one of his seven terms in Congress. \u201cUnfortunately, it will only change the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn\u2019t do, killing 30,000. If some innocent people die, that\u2019s fine. In every war, innocent people die. I will even be happy if I die as long as 30,000 go.\u201dFar from disqualifying him, his incendiary remarks over the years and throughout the campaign made Mr. Bolsonaro appealing to millions of Brazilians. Many see in him the kind of disruptive, status quo-breaking potential that propelled President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016.On Sunday, Mr. Bolsonaro said during his victory speech that his government would uphold the constitution and democratic principles.While his rivals ran conventional campaigns, Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, channeled the wrath and exasperation many Brazilians feel over rising crime and unemployment \u2014 problems that they increasingly believe the endemically corrupt governing class is powerless to tackle.He became enthralled by the idea of joining the armed forces in the early 1970s when soldiers descended on an area near Campinas, his hometown in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, hunting down a communist guerrilla leader.After graduating from a military academy in 1977, Mr. Bolsonaro rose to the rank of captain in an artillery unit. But his time in uniform came to an end just as democracy was being restored. In an act of insubordination, Mr. Bolsonaro published an essay in the newsmagazine Veja in 1986 titled \u201cThe Salaries Are Low,\u201d in which he took his superiors to task over military pay.He was briefly jailed after publishing the article, and soon came under investigation over a more serious allegation: that he was part of a plan to set off explosives in military bases as a means to pressure government officials to pay soldiers more. Mr. Bolsonaro has denied he participated in such a plot, which was not carried out.But, again, instead of ruining his prospects, the controversies made him something of a folk hero in military circles. Mr. Bolsonaro leveraged the attention into a successful run for City Council in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. Then, in 1990, he ran for a seat in Congress and won with robust backing from military supporters.Mr. Bolsonaro became a polarizing figure soon after arriving in Bras\u00edlia in the early 1990s, when the nation\u2019s newly elected leaders were slowly rebuilding democratic institutions.\u201cI am in favor of a dictatorship,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro thundered. \u201cWe will never resolve serious national problems with this irresponsible democracy.\u201dHe said people across the country were pining for the return of the military. \u201cThey ask, \u2018When are you coming back?\u2019\u201dMr. Bolsonaro was highly visible and frequently brash as a lawmaker in Bras\u00edlia. But he was not prolific at passing laws. And he was not regarded as a consensus-builder in a highly fractured Congress.Only two of the dozens of bills and amendments he introduced over 27 years in Congress became law. The legislation he championed showed that he was most passionate about supporting the police and the armed forces, and weighing in on social issues like abortion and gay rights, which he has adamantly opposed.In 2011, he told Playboy magazine that he would \u201crather his son die in a car accident\u201d than be gay.\u201cIf a gay couple came to live in my building, my property will lose value,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they walk around holding hands, kissing, it will lose value! No one says that out of fear of being pinned as homophobe.\u201dChico Alencar, a member of Congress who has followed Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s career since the two became city lawmakers in Rio de Janeiro at the same time, said Mr. Bolsonaro was seen as an outlier who focused zealously on a handful of issues, including communism and homosexuality.\u201cI have never seen him participating in debates about the electricity grid, the environment, education, health, urban mobility, housing,\u201d said Mr. Alencar, who belongs to the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party. \u201cHe\u2019s mono-thematic. Everything is about a communist threat. He hasn\u2019t left the Cold War era yet.\u201dMr. Alencar recalled how Mr. Bolsonaro took aim at educational materials in 2011 that sought to raise awareness about homophobia and denounced them as an incitement for children to become sexually active and question their gender identities.\u201cHe is obsessed with the issue of homosexuality,\u201d Mr. Alencar said. \u201cWhenever there was a public hearing about gay rights, he would go, and get extremely worked up.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s conservative views on issues like gay rights and abortion have endeared him to some in Brazil\u2019s evangelical caucus, which has grown steadily in recent years.But he mainly became known for his angry outbursts, perhaps most notably in 2003, when he shoved a leftist colleague, Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Nunes, on camera after telling her she was not worthy of being raped.Now Ms. Nunes, a former human rights minister, said she fears that Mr. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has threatened to banish political opponents and make it easier for the police to kill suspected criminals \u2014 will be a ruthless leader.\u201cHe is incapable of producing a consensus, an agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no dialogue with him.\u201dIn early 2013, Mr. Bolsonaro began confiding in a handful of friends that he harbored presidential ambitions.\u201cMan, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d Mr. Malafaia remembers saying when Mr. Bolsonaro broke the news to him moments before the pastor officiated at Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s third marriage, in March 2013. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it.\u201dMr. Malafaia said Mr. Bolsonaro told him he wanted to fight \u201cthe criminals from the left,\u201d referring to the Workers\u2019 Party, which was in power at the time.In the following months, as hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest poor public services and corruption, Mr. Bolsonaro ran the idea by a trusted colleague in Congress.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you aim for the Senate?\u201d Alberto Fraga, a fellow congressman who knew Mr. Bolsonaro from their days at the military academy, recalled responding with bewilderment.Mr. Fraga recounted that Mr. Bolsonaro acknowledged facing long odds.\u201c\u2018Look, if I get to 10 percent, I\u2019d be very satisfied,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fraga recalled his saying.In 2014, after Mr. Bolsonaro was re-elected to Congress with 464,000 votes, almost four times more than he got in 2010, he began traveling the country, holding rallies and presenting himself as a tough-talking disrupter of politics as usual.Breaking with the political playbook for presidential hopefuls, Mr. Bolsonaro often used curse words during unscripted addresses. Hand-pistol signs became ubiquitous everywhere he went \u2014 an allusion to the candidate\u2019s draconian proposals to curb violent crime by making it easier for the police to gun down suspected criminals. Soon, supporters started calling him \u201cmito,\u201d or the legend.Supporters began using yellow T-shirts with the slogan \u201cBrazil is my party\u201d that resemble the soccer jerseys Brazilians have worn in the past as a symbol of pride and national unity.Many seasoned politicians and analysts expected Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s candidacy to fizzle as voters took a harder look at his long history of incendiary remarks against women and people of color.But what many assumed would be a liability turned out to be an asset for an electorate fed up with a governing class widely regarded as duplicitous and dishonest, said Joice Hasselmann, who was elected to Congress this month by tying her candidacy to Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s.\u201cJair has no filter,\u201d Ms. Hasselmann said. \u201cThere\u2019s a direct link between what he thinks and what he says.\u201dAfter the stabbing, Mr. Bolsonaro remained largely confined to a hospital room and later his beachfront home in Rio. He has done few probing interviews and declined to take part in debates.But in the near-daily videos he has broadcast on Facebook, where he has more than eight million followers, Mr. Bolsonaro, often accompanied by one of his sons, holds forth, jumping from one issue to the next, often toggling between agitation and sarcasm.During a recent one, he lifted his shirt to show his colostomy bag and a large scar from the stabbing.As his standing in the polls rose, veteran Brazilian political operators marveled at how a campaign strategy that seemed so haphazard was beating everyone else\u2019s. If it looked messy and improvisational from the outside, Mr. Malafaia said, it\u2019s because it was.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to say something, and you can laugh,\u201d Mr. Malafaia said, adding that Mr. Bolsonaro and his campaign \u201chad no real strategy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And in the shallow waters, reduced by a long heat wave, she came across something astonishing.With her family, Saga, 8, who is Swedish-American, took the sword to the local Jonkoping county museum, which confirmed that it dated to the 5th or 6th century, before the time of the Vikings.The find was made on July 15, according to Mr. Vanecek\u2019s Facebook post, but the museum asked Saga and her family to keep the discovery secret, so that archaeologists could search the Vidostern lake where she uncovered the sword before treasure-hunters made off with any other historical artifacts that might be hidden there.

Leaning independents have both the preferences and the interest to be reliable party supporters, but they are repulsed from doing so by the very idea of government as a battleground.The independent as a disaffected partisan poses a challenge for parties. If leaning independents are former partisans who have become dissatisfied with politics, then winning their votes means appealing to partisan interests without engaging in an endless partisan war. Rallying strong partisan supporters may seem like a safe strategy for the 2018 midterms, but it may be shortsighted: The types of messages that are likely to please strong partisans may push more people into \u201cleaning,\u201d diminishing the number of voters who will reliably take actions \u2014 like vote \u2014 in support of the party in the future.When asked about the midterm elections, independents reported feeling worried, frustrated and indifferent.Leaning independents are people who could be \u2014 and likely once were \u2014 a reliable set of voters for their preferred political party, except they have been pushed away by partisan vitriol. Media coverage of political disagreement discourages these people from wearing campaign stickers, from discussing candidates with friends and co-workers, and even from socializing with the partisans they agree with. When we asked a large sample of voters how to make the worst impression upon meeting someone new, the consensus was that identifying as a strong partisan would do the trick.This election-year survey measures whether people consider themselves to be partisans or independents.

Relying on conflict to mobilize, however, is likely to leave parties with an increasingly shrinking pool of reliable voters.This business-as-usual approach might rally the extremes, but it will likely alienate independents from their parties.In turn, their retreat from partisanship leaves the political arena increasingly in the hands of the polarized. Perhaps partisans in Washington view independents as a worthwhile sacrifice in their quest to enrage and engage their base, but campaigns should consider just how many voters they might lose in the long run.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Khashoggi Case Raises Tensions Between Saudi Prince and Turkish President", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has long cast himself as a champion of the Arab Spring uprisings and the political Islamists who once seemed poised to ride them to power.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia anchors the opposite camp in an ideological battle raging across the Middle East: the anti-Islamist strongmen who quashed the revolts.Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly challenged Saudi Arabia to explain Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, while Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence proving he was killed, and have unleashed a stream of leaks suggesting that the royal court ordered it. The crown prince and his spokesmen have insisted, without providing evidence, that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, professing that they, too, are worried about him.Turkish investigators are looking into the case of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and vanished.The dispute pits two staunch, headstrong nationalists against each other \u2014 both with ambitions to reshape their region. They also share an aversion to public criticism and a history of refusing to back down from a fight.\u201cThese are two people who each think he is the most important person in the Muslim world,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies both countries. \u201cEgo is a factor on both sides.\u201dOn Thursday, there were signs that the two leaders were looking for a way out. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office announced that he had agreed to a Saudi request to form a joint \u201cworking group\u201d that will examine Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Certainly, each man has much to lose.Mr. Erdogan is struggling to manage a teetering economy and his entanglement in war-torn Syria. He can ill afford a new battle with a deep-pocketed regional power like Saudi Arabia.For Prince Mohammed, the affair threatens to severely damage the image of moderate reformer that he has worked for years to cultivate. Eager to diversify the Saudi economy before it runs out of oil, he has courted Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood with promises to open up and modernize the kingdom.Internationally, it is already undermining his courtship of Western visitors and investors. Several participants said Thursday that they were dropping out of an investment conference known as Davos in the Desert that the prince is hosting this month in Riyadh.\u201cHis credibility in the West and in the U.S. is at stake,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. \u201cThe credibility gap is going to be huge, and the Saudi boosters in D.C. are going to find it extremely difficult to portray the image that they were generally quite successful in trying to push.\u201dWith lawmakers from both parties in Washington now threatening to seek sanctions over the case, Saudi leaders appear surprised by the magnitude of the international reaction. Prince Mohammed has canceled or postponed meetings with diplomats and other foreign visitors, and Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir has been unusually quiet.Mr. Erdogan, for his part, has almost taunted the crown prince with questions, testing how close he can come to blaming Saudi Arabia for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance without explicitly doing so.\u201cIs it possible that there is no camera system at a consulate, an embassy?\u201d he said, according to Turkish news reports. \u201cIs it possible there was no camera system in the Saudi Arabian Consulate where this incident happened? I mean, if a bird flies from here, a mosquito flies, those systems would capture it. And they have the most advanced ones.\u201d\u201cIt is not possible for us to remain silent about such an incident happening in our country,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s greatest concern is not foreign but domestic: borrowing taken on during his 15-year drive to build up the Turkish economy has left its corporate sector sagging under the weight of more than $200 billion in foreign debt. That has dragged down the value of Turkish currency, spurring high inflation.Although Saudi Arabia is hardly its biggest investor, Turkish officials have boasted that their country did $8 billion a year in business with the kingdom. Wealthy Saudi holidaymakers are a staple of Istanbul\u2019s tourist industry.\u201cThe stakes are very high, and that is why Erdogan will be very restrained,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \u201cTurkey is going through hard economic times, and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have the ability to tip the balance of Turkey\u2019s economy.\u201dThe disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi also threatens something less tangible: the prestige Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Turkey has enjoyed around the region as a refuge for Arab politicians and thinkers under pressure from their own governments.\u201cBecause Turkey has become such a haven for Arabs who no longer feel safe in their own countries, there is a lot of reputational damage for Erdogan,\u201d said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former State Department official.Several analysts said they already saw hints that Mr. Erdogan might be exploring a face-saving retreat for both sides \u2014 for example, by allowing the crown prince to acknowledge Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death but pin the blame on some rogue element in his government.The announcement of the joint working group in the case added to the speculation. But how that cooperation might work, given the Turkish allegations against the Saudis, remains to be seen.Over the years, Mr. Erdogan and Prince Mohammed have worked to suppress their differences.When the Turkish leader cracked down after a failed military coup two years ago, Saudi Arabia was quick to help him, extraditing a Turkish military attach\u00e9 suspected of playing a role in the plot. Mr. Erdogan singled out the kingdom for special thanks, and Prince Mohammed reciprocated by joining his father, King Salman, in congratulating Mr. Erdogan on his survival.When Egyptian newspapers recently quoted Prince Mohammed calling Turkey part of an \u201cevil\u201d alliance in the region, he hastened to deny it, issuing a statement that he was criticizing the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood, not the government of Turkey.But tensions between them still rose.Mr. Erdogan remains close to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia considers a national security threat and has branded as a terrorist organization. Turkey has also remained close to Qatar, another regional friend to the Brotherhood.As he has consolidated power, Prince Mohammed has become increasingly bold. At age 33, he has charmed younger Saudis and many in the West by promising to diversify the Saudi economy and weaken the kingdom\u2019s religious authorities. He has let women drive and allowed concerts and movie theaters \u2014 all novelties for the kingdom.On a tour of the United States this year, Prince Mohammed was welcomed as a statesman. He met with President Trump; dined with Rupert Murdoch; had his picture taken with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Bill Gates, and Tim Cook of Apple; and hung out with the actor known as The Rock.But many of his actions have backfired.His military intervention in Yemen has so far produced only a stalemate and humanitarian crisis. His detention of the prime minister of Lebanon was ultimately ineffectual. And his imprisonment without due process of hundreds of wealthy businessmen, including several of his royal cousins, unnerved many of the investors he had set out to woo.And now there are the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi.Ms. Wittes, the Brookings scholar, said that if the Saudis \u201care willing to assassinate a journalist on foreign soil because he was mildly critical, these international partners are going to be much less likely to send their students, researchers and experts to the kingdom or to set up long-term partnerships with the kingdom.\u201dBeing seen in the eyes of the world as responsible for such a grisly assassination might once have been enough to disqualify a crown prince from succession to the Saudi throne. But Prince Mohammed, who is known as MBS, appears to have amassed more control than any leader in decades over the sources of hard power in the kingdom \u2014 the military, the national guard and the Interior Ministry \u2014 as well as the oil ministry.Many analysts say there is almost no one left to challenge him \u2014 provided he maintains the good will of his elderly father.\u201cThere is no real coalition that can mobilize against MBS,\u201d said Mr. Ulrichsen, the Middle East fellow. \u201cHe seems to be secure in his position.

{"Headline": "Apple News\u2019s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.One morning in late August, Apple News\u2019s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company\u2019s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\u201cWe put so much care and thought into our curation,\u201d said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.\u201dThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.Their work has complicated the debate about whether Silicon Valley giants are media or technology companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter have long insisted they are tech entities and not arbiters of the truth. The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and others have bet heavily on artificial intelligence to help them sort through false news and fact-based information. Yet Apple has unabashedly gone the other direction with its human-led approach, showing that a more media-like sensibility may be able to coexist within a technology company.Apple\u2019s strategy is risky. While the company has long used people to curate its App Store, the news is far more contentious. The famously secretive company has also provided little transparency on who is picking the stories for Apple News and how those people avoid bias.For the first time recently \u2014 and after extensive negotiations on the terms of the interviews \u2014 Apple agreed to let a Times reporter in on how it operates Apple News.There are ambitious plans for the product. Apple lets publishers run ads in its app and it helps some sign up new subscribers, taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Soon, the company aims to bundle access to dozens of magazines in its app for a flat monthly fee, sort of like Netflix for news, according to people familiar with the plans, who declined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Apple also hopes to package access to a few daily-news publications, like The Times, The Post and The Wall Street Journal, into the app, the people said.Apple\u2019s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. \u201cThere is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,\u201d Ms. Kern said.But there are early signs that Apple is not the industry\u2019s savior. Many publishers have made little on ads in Apple News, and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of subscriptions it helps sell does not help. Having experienced Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s disruption of their industry, many publications are wary of Apple, according to conversations with executives from nine news organizations, many of whom declined to comment on the record for fear of upsetting the trillion-dollar corporation. Some were optimistic that Apple could be a better partner than other tech giants, but were leery of making the company the portal to their readers.\u201cWhat Apple giveth, Apple can taketh away,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Journal, Bloomberg and other publications. Once readers are trained to get their news from Apple, he said, news organizations will realize: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of Apple.\u201dFor decades, newspapers had one of industry\u2019s most direct relationships with customers: Broadsheets and tabloids reported the news, printed it and delivered it to your door.Then the internet arrived, and Google and Facebook became the middlemen between publishers and their readers, while leveraging that position to dominate digital advertising and decimate newspapers\u2019 advertising business model.The rise of Google and Facebook in news was partly driven by algorithms that provided enormous scale, enabling them to surface millions of articles from thousands of sources to their billions of users. The algorithms were largely designed to keep users engaged and clicking, meaning they tended to promote posts that drew clicks and shares, which often meant the sensational. That elevated fringe and partisan sites that produced intentionally misleading, highly partisan or downright false content.(A Google spokeswoman said the company aimed to avoid misinformation by screening publishers before letting them into Google News. She added that Google this year began helping news organizations sell subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company helps publishers reach more readers, earn ad revenue and sell subscriptions. She said Facebook\u2019s algorithm recently decreased the visibility of pages that share clickbait.)Into that environment came Apple. In late 2015, the iPhone maker released a free news app to match users with publications they liked. People selected their interests and favorite publications, and the app returned a feed of relevant stories.The announcement attracted little fanfare. Three months later, Apple announced an unusual new feature: humans would pick the app\u2019s top stories, not algorithms.Apple said it remained convinced of the benefits of people.\u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s chief of apps and Ms. Kern\u2019s boss, said about Apple News. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to let it be a total crazy land.\u201dTo create its newsroom, Apple needed journalists. Starting in 2015, it poached editors from The Times, The Journal, CNN and Bleacher Report, among other publications. To lead them all, an Apple recruiter found Ms. Kern, a rising star in the New York magazine world.\u201cYou don\u2019t generally have the whole package, but she did,\u201d Adam Moss, New York Magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said of Ms. Kern\u2019s news judgment, story ideas and work ethic.Last year, Mr. Moss said, Ms. Kern came into his office with the news that Apple had approached her about a job.\u201cI said to her, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Moss. \u201cWith the literary skills and the artistic skills Lauren had, to go into a company that was really dominated by engineers was a recipe for enormous frustration.\u201dMs. Kern said it was an opportunity to help journalism from the other side. Going to tech also came with a raise; she would not say how much. She moved from Brooklyn to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes, where she bought a car for the first time in 13 years, a golden retriever named Leo for her son, and a spacious house with chicken coops in the back. (She plans to leave the coops empty.)In interviews, Ms. Kern was lighthearted but matter of fact. Friends and former colleagues described her as fiercely dedicated to two things: her son and her job.\u201cShe has an executive\u2019s brain. Most places I work, journalists are such poor managers,\u201d said Noreen Malone, a former colleague at New York Magazine. \u201cIt was always clear Lauren was going to run something.\u201dNow Ms. Kern leads roughly 30 former journalists in Sydney, London, New York and Silicon Valley. They spend their days consuming news across the internet, fielding 100 to 200 pitches a day from publishers, and debating which stories get the top spots.Ultimately, they select five stories to lead the app, with the top two also displayed in a prominent window to the left of the iPhone home screen. They also curate a magazine-style section of feature stories. The lineup typically shifts five or more times a day, depending on the news. A single editor in London typically chooses the first mix of stories for the East Coast\u2019s morning commute before editors in New York and then Cupertino step in.Ms. Kern said she and her team did not run the story because they didn\u2019t trust it. Why? It\u2019s not a formula that can be baked into an algorithm, she said.\u201cI mean, you read a story and it doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test,\u201d she said.Ms. Kern criticized the argument that algorithms are the sole way to avoid prejudice because bias can be baked into the algorithm\u2019s code, such as whether it labels news organizations liberal or conservative. She argued that humans \u2014 with all their biases \u2014 are the only way to avoid bias.\u201cWe\u2019re so much more subtly following the news cycle and what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only legitimate way to do it at this point.\u201dApple executives said they are convinced that Apple News is not only a cure for the ills of how people consume news in the internet era, but also a lifeline for journalism \u2014 and democracy.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tim said we have a responsibility to help the news industry,\u201d said Mr. Rosner, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to democracy.\u201dIn actual newsrooms, there is skepticism that a tech giant will rescue the industry.Daniel Hallac, chief product officer for New York Magazine, said traffic from Apple News has doubled since December to now account for nearly 12 percent of visits to the magazine\u2019s website. Traffic from Facebook has dropped about a third, to 8 percent of visits, while Google\u2019s share has increased slightly to nearly half of the site\u2019s traffic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Apple News,\u201d he said.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees its services push, said publishers can run their own ads alongside their stories in Apple News and keep all of the revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d he said. He noted most major publishers take advantage of that feature. Apple also places ads for publishers for a 30 percent cut.But news publishers said selling ads for Apple News is complicated, and that advertisers\u2019 interest was limited because of the lack of customer data. Slate also attributed its issues to minuscule revenue from the ads Apple placed. Apple recently made it easier for publishers to place their own ads, but Mr. Cue conceded Apple is not terribly good \u2014 or interested \u2014 in advertising.Another potential issue is that Apple News mostly helps a small coterie of publishers. In July, Florida\u2019s largest newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times, received 79 percent of its outside web traffic from Google and 20 percent from Facebook, said Conan Gallaty, the paper\u2019s digital chief. Apple accounted for 1 percent, he said.\u201cOf the major three \u2014 Facebook, Google and Apple \u2014 Apple probably kept the furthest distance in engaging with regional and local publishers,\u201d he said.Mr. Cue said Apple is most interested in helping publishers sell subscriptions. Apple News now enables people to subscribe at the tap of a finger, leveraging many iPhone owners\u2019 preloaded credit cards.But there is concern here, too. Apple nabs 30 percent of subscription revenues the first year and 15 percent each subsequent year. In contrast, Google takes a 5 percent cut; Facebook takes nothing. Apple also owns the customer relationship, unlike Google or Facebook, refusing to pass along even subscribers\u2019 email addresses.Given those terms, some news executives said Apple News could cannibalize future subscribers, leaving news organizations with less revenue and less data per customer.Mr. Cue said Apple primarily delivers customers who wouldn\u2019t have subscribed otherwise and that its revenue share was \u201ca relatively small cut,\u201d in part to offset its costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge moneymaking business,\u201d he said.In April, Apple bought Texture, an app that lets readers pay $10 a month for access to about 200 magazines. It now plans to incorporate the service into Apple News, drastically expanding its reach, according to people familiar with its plans.Given Apple\u2019s ambitions and growing team of former journalists, will it ever start producing the news and not just aggregating it?\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future plans, but that\u2019s certainly not what we set out to do,\u201d said Mr. Rosner.So there\u2019s a chance?\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Circus", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIt is a scene that has become all too common, and dare I say dangerously close to becoming mundane: Donald Trump said something outrageous at one of his political rallies and his supporters, those hopelessly beguiled by the bully, cheered.This week, Trump trekked to Southaven, Miss., where he took the degenerate step of mocking Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.Thirty-six years ago this happened. I had one beer, right? I had one beer \u2026 How did you get home? I don\u2019t remember. How\u2019d you get there? I don\u2019t remember. Where is the place? I don\u2019t remember. How many years ago was it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. What neighborhood was it in? I don\u2019t know. Where\u2019s the house? I don\u2019t know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don\u2019t know. But I had one beer. That\u2019s the only thing I remember.It was a repulsively grotesque spectacle, and yet from the assemblage of thousands came applause and roars of approval for Trump.It is at moments like these that I try to step back from the particulars, to create some distance, so that I can ask myself the larger, more profound questions. How did we as a country arrive at the point where this is even possible? And how are there so many Americans willing to accept Trump\u2019s corrosion of our culture and our discourse, to gleefully follow him as he plumbs the depths, probing for a bottom of acceptability that, in his world, seems to have been obliterated?But I believe there are two other explanations that are much more base: entertainment and ownership.First, the entire Trump presidency is a show, and many Americans find it quite entertaining, viewing Trump as its antihero.He is brash, unconventional, emotional, sometimes raging and sometimes funny.His rock-and-rage rallies (he has held nearly two dozen since being elected) are simply an extension of that, only more raw and raucous. Trump brings the big show and the big media with their big cameras to places and people who feel forgotten and isolated, looked over by the bustling coasts and the urban centers.He is their entree to power, a personification and articulation of anger and anti-intellectualism, a way to wrap their hatreds in humor.The rallies are part tent revival, part circus, part call-and-response game show. Like-minded people with look-alike faces populate them. They are orgies of sameness in which crowd dynamics produce and escalate a tornado of affirmation and acceptance until it is perfectly admissible to surrender any remaining morality to the mob.It is a religious experience of conversion and immersion, a born-again baptism in which people emerge bound to one another and bound to Trump.When the entire political world mocked Trump, they supported him. When everyone said that Trump didn\u2019t stand a chance of winning, they supported him. When everyone said that Trump was boorish, scandal-ridden and inexperienced, they supported him. And in the end, Trump became the president.For them, Trump represents the most improbable of all ascensions, one fueled by their undying loyalty, and he represents their personal sentiments about society: a thumbing of the nose at the establishment, a rebuke of the authorities and the intellectuals, a disdain for inclusion and multiculturalism, and a willingness to fight for white power and its privileges and purity.There is nowhere that Trump goes, in policy or rhetoric, that they won\u2019t follow, because they have no way back from how far they\u2019ve already gone. They\u2019ve burned all the bridges they\u2019ve crossed.Trump\u2019s supporters are now part of his circus: nomads on the political landscape, having abandoned the traditional right as we knew it for the fickle, ever-wavering, never-stable tent of Trumpism.In this world, the aberrant and the monstrous don\u2019t offend but entertain.Advertisement"}

An investigation showed that Mr. Jarrell, who had a firearm and ammunition in his car, had threatened to cause a school shooting, and the authorities deemed the threat \u201cvalid and imminent,\u201d court documents said.Two days earlier, Ms. Bull had logged on to Facebook from her home in New Jersey and found the messages from Mr. Jarrell.\u201cThere is no such thing as white privileged,\u201d said the message. \u201cI hope your black children gets hung for you being so stupid,\u201d he went on.Ms. Bull\u2019s three children are biracial and can be seen in her Facebook profile picture. Worried for their safety, Ms. Bull reached out to local authorities and contacted the Kentucky State Police.Mr. Jarrell was arrested a day later while backing out of his driveway, according to Sgt. Josh Lawson, a spokesman for the Kentucky State Police. The authorities found a rifle, over 200 rounds of ammunition and a Kevlar vest in his car.Mr. Jarrell admitted to the authorities that he had sent Ms. Bull the message on Facebook, and that he had threatened a local school with a shooting, according to court records.Mr. Jarrell had used his cellphone to search for instructions on how to successfully carry out a school shooting, Sergeant Lawson said.

Many Survivors Did Not.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "PHOTOGRAPHS BY ZACKARY CANEPARIOCT. 1, 2018Dana Stout-Wilson was shot in the legs.Jason McMillan was struck in the spine.Jennifer Campas was wounded in the head.The clatter of dishes as they\u2019re being washed still puts Janie Scott in a tailspin. Her anxiety goes up, her heart starts pounding, and she has to leave the kitchen because the clink of metal reminds her of the sound the bullets made as they hit the festival ground pavement around her.Oct. 1 marks one year since the Las Vegas massacre, in which a gunman perched in a hotel above a country music festival killed 58 people, wounded hundreds and linked more than 20,000 music fans together on a night that they will never forget.It was the worst shooting in modern American history \u2014 and for those who survived, the last 12 months have been about finding a new normal, about building lives that can accommodate wheelchairs, flashbacks and a painful sense of fragility.The last year has also involved watching the rest of the nation move on.Jennifer Campas was in her front yard in Whittier, Calif., on a recent evening when her son Leo left the house, slapping his flip-flops on the pavement.\u201cAy, mi hijo!\u201d she said, whipping around to find the source of the noise. \u201cYou scared me.\u201dWhen the gunman opened fire last year, one of his bullets struck Ms. Campas, 41, in the forehead. When she woke from a coma, she had to learn to breathe again, to talk again, to walk again. She is now blind in one eye, and bullet fragments remain in her nose and neck. At night, she dreams about being shot.She wears a single angel wing around her neck.In May, she went back to work as the head nurse at an assisted living home. But she is slower now, less able to multitask. In her kitchen recently, she said she was thinking about stepping down and taking a lower position. Leo, 16, looked on.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m doubting myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to be able to not carry it out, to fail. At this time in my life, do I really want to be so overwhelmed with work? I just kind of want to \u2014 maybe \u2014 live more.\u201dMore people were killed or wounded in the Las Vegas attack than in any other mass shooting in modern American history.Hundreds more sustained bruises, cuts, torn ligaments and broken bones in the scramble to flee the venue.While the scale of the violence was unprecedented, detailed information on the hundreds of people who were wounded is not available in the official reports documenting the tragedy.The New York Times reached out to Abraham Watkins, a law firm in Houston that is representing survivors, to understand the scale of the impact of the shooting on survivors. The firm described a range of injuries sustained by 50 victims who were wounded by the gunfire.Of those 50 people \u2026Because the gunman used high-velocity bullets, many of the victims had small entrance wounds but tremendous internal damage or exit wounds.\u201cNormally your jaw is pretty resilient, but it just shatters like glass when it\u2019s hit by a high-velocity bullet,\u201d said Dr. Steven Saxe, a Las Vegas-based oral surgeon who treated seven patients after the shooting. \u201cThe actual injury only takes fractions of a second to occur, but it\u2019s a lifetime of rehabilitation.\u201dAt her home in Beaumont, Calif., Karen Smerber lifted her shirt to display the red scar running down her stomach, jagged as a map\u2019s edge. \u201cI\u2019m the same size, technically,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not the same shape.\u201dMs. Smerber, 48, a produce buyer at Stater Bros., was shot in the hip. The bullet pierced her intestine, and her husband, a retired fire captain named Matt, spent six weeks stuffing an incision in her side with gauze, then pulling out the infected material a few hours later.\u201cI don\u2019t even know how he could still love me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just something else, poor guy.\u201dHer stomach has taken on an uneven shape, and she feels like there is a hard shoe stuck inside. On her back patio, she winced as her dog leapt onto her lap and hit her stomach. It is difficult to sit, she said. She has started taking Zoloft, and she has returned to work part-time.She can even line dance, a bit.But the hardest thing is looking in the mirror. \u201cMy friends are so good,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always reassure me that I\u2019m beautiful and such. It\u2019s just, people don\u2019t realize that I feel bad about myself. And so then I feel \u2014 like with Matt \u2014 I feel disgusting most of the time.\u201dNearly all of the 50 survivors documented by Abraham Watkins reported depression, anxiety, insomnia, fear of crowds and loud noises \u2014 hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder.On a recent day, Dana Stout-Wilson, 54, stood on the blacktop at her middle school, her P.E. students in gym shorts in front of her. \u201cTwo laps, go!\u201d\u201cThese itch constantly,\u201d she said, scratching at the purple bullet wounds on the back of her leg.Ms. Wilson is back at work, the word \u201csurvivor\u201d now inked on her arm. But the shooting is a perpetual shadow. She has nightmares; she is scared of sirens and helicopters.The field where she teaches is a particular anxiety. It is frequently filled with children. It is also surrounded by hills and homes. She is constantly scanning for snipers.The school is just miles from the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., and already the staff has turned it into a fortress.\u201cYou wonder when you\u2019re going to be normal again,\u201d she said. \u201cI always feel like I'm going to break, like I\u2019m going to fall apart.\u201dCountry music fans from almost every state attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Most people returned to their homes to face recovery far from the festival grounds, the memorials and other survivors.Many have connected and found support online. Connie Long, 42, a probation officer, runs a support group on Facebook under the motto \u201chappy, healthy, and healing.\u201dIt has more than 4,500 members from all over. \u201cWe have Switzerland and England.

A lot. \u201cIt\u2019s put me in a big mom role,\u201d she said.These days, Mr. McMillan is trying to walk. In November, he was able to move a toe. Then he could flex a thigh.

Make sure I stay level to my hips. Keep my hips under my shoulders.\u201dWhen he tries to stand alone, his knees often buckle, and he falls to his rear, he said. At the end of therapy, he is exhausted.Some people have found comfort in Route 91 support groups. But Mr. McMillan mostly stays away. He cannot take the physically fit people crying in front of him. \u201cI try not to think about the chaos that went on that night,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be mean to these people or anything like that, but they\u2019re standing in front of me telling me how much it ruined their lives \u2014 and I\u2019m sitting in a wheelchair.\u201dBilly Bob Mason carried a plastic-covered wedding dress across his driveway in Bodfish, Calif. \u201cThe dress is in,\u201d he yelled, laying it in his truck cab.He\u2019d already packed up his brown leather boots, the ones with the bullet hole in the left toe.Like others at the concert, Mr. Mason and his fianc\u00e9e, Regina Harris, fled the Route 91 festival in a panic.

{"Headline": "The Materialist Party", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Democrats fail to take on Trumpism.Opinion ColumnistDonald Trump and the other populists around the world have transformed politics in three gigantic ways. First, they told a different narrative. Their central story is that the good, decent people of the heartland are being threatened by immigrants, foreigners and other outsiders while corrupt elites do nothing.Second, Trump and the other populists have overturned the traditional moral standards for how leaders are supposed to behave. He\u2019s challenged basic norms of honesty, decency, compassion and moral conduct. He unabashedly exploits rifts in American society.Third, they have ushered in a new conversation. In the 20th century the big debate was big government versus small government. Now, as many have noticed, the core debate is open versus closed. Do you favor basic openness, diversity and pluralism, or do you favor closed ethnic nationalism?Along the way Trump has challenged America\u2019s basic identity as a nation of immigrants. He\u2019s challenged the American-led postwar international order.In short, Trump and the other populists have transformed the G.O.P. and thrown down a cultural, moral and ideological gauntlet.This election is the Democrats\u2019 first opportunity to push back against a thoroughly Trumpified Republican Party. It is a remarkable opportunity to realign the electorate, since polls continually show the percentage of the country that buys Trump\u2019s ethnic nationalism is in the low 40s.So how, at this crucial moment in history, have the Democrats responded?\u201cThe top three issues this year are health care, health care and health care,\u201d J.B. Poersch, of the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC, told CNN.Democratic candidates like Senator Claire McCaskill are hammering home the same point in debates. Republicans tried to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions.In normal times, there\u2019s good reason to run on this issue. Millions of families are plagued by inadequate insurance coverage. If you\u2019re trying to win a swing voter in Arizona, it\u2019s a bread-and-butter issue that has appeal.But the Democratic campaign is inadequate to the current moment. It offers no counternarrative to Trump, little moral case against his behavior, no unifying argument against ethnic nationalism. In politics you can\u2019t beat something with nothing. Democrats missed the Trumpian upsurge because while society was dividing into cultural tribes, they spent 2008 through 2016 focusing on health care. Now that the upsurge has happened, they are still pinioned to health care.Worse, the Democratic strategy simply revives the old 1980-2008 playbook. It\u2019s Democratic spending promises versus Republican tax cuts. This familiar, orthodox argument pushes left and right back into their normal categories. It destroys any possibility of a realignment.Second, we\u2019ve learned that when Democrats do raise a moral argument, it tends to be of the social justice warrior variety. The core argument in this mode is that the oppressive structures of society marginalize women, minorities and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. communities. It turns out that if your basic logic is that distinct identity groups are under threat from an oppressive society, it\u2019s very hard to then turn around and defend that society from authoritarian attack, or to articulate any notion of what even unites that society. You can appeal to women as women and to ethnic groups as ethnic groups, but it\u2019s very hard to make a universal appeal to Americans as Americans, or defend the basic American norms that Trump calls into question. It\u2019s a messaging vulnerability that Democrats have imposed upon themselves.It has now become evident that Republicans are better at politicizing cultural issues and Democrats are better at offering economic benefits to those who are struggling. If you think voting behavior is primarily motivated by material appeals, the Democratic strategy is fine. But if you think it\u2019s motivated by cultural identity, a desire for respect, a sense of what\u2019s right, loyalty to a common story, the Democratic strategy leaves a lot to be desired.These days, culture is more important than economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Count Me Among the Mob", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it means people who stand in opposition to Trump\u2019s degradation of the country. Opinion ColumnistOne thing that I find profoundly disappointing about modern liberalism, particularly as it now stands in opposition to Trumpism, is the degree to which it is reactive, governed by what is being done to it rather than its own positive vision.It is true that Donald Trump is not only antithetical to liberal values, he is antithetical to most American values, and as such limiting his power and limiting the duration of his tenure are of paramount concern and absolute urgency.Therefore, resisting what Trump represents becomes a central point of moral rectitude and ultimate patriotism. Resistance is a reaction to Trump.But that can\u2019t be the sum total of one\u2019s statement of principles. You must be driven toward a concept of what you want this country to become, and not just driven by a fear of what the country could descend into.Liberal enthusiasm can\u2019t hinge solely on prospects for overwhelming victory due to conservative lethargy. Enthusiasm can be a highly fluctuant variable in a political cycle. The only enthusiasm you can control is your own.All campaigns are to some degree an act of public manipulation, hopefully to the good, but often to the ill. There are two ways to drive turnout: excitement or incitement. Voters can either be animated by hope or fear, optimism or angst.Trump\u2019s default position is the use of fear. Scared about his prospects should Democrats take control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump is campaigning like crazy, trying desperately to stir his base to action, and he knows that the easiest way to do that is to stoke its anger, to appeal to the same misogyny, racism, nationalism and insecurity that carried him to the White House.First, the defense and championing of Justice Brett Kavanaugh after publicly attacking, discrediting and diminishing the women who accused him of sexual assault is to me a clear expression of misogyny. Trump has a habit of not believing the women who accuse powerful men of sexual assault, a position that probably comes naturally to him because he was accused himself.This is an easy target for Trump and his base because it encapsulates a sentiment without expressly articulating it: America is being invaded and overrun by people who are not white and not European, which risks the maintenance of American heritage, which is white heritage. White people\u2019s control of this country is in danger and under assault and must be defended and protected at all costs.Make no mistake: Trump\u2019s strategy will work. He now knows the people who support him very well. He has never stopped playing to them and campaigning for them. They are family. They feast together on hatred and intolerance.But none of that should dampen liberal enthusiasm or soften liberal resolve. What we want this country to be cannot be subject to the whims of Trump and his base.This election and indeed all that follow it must no longer be about reactions, but about realignment.We must conceive of the country we want and drive relentlessly toward it, not because we are thunderstruck by the sheer immorality that has risen to the pinnacle of power, but because we know that power is in fact a possession of the people in a democracy and we can both harness it and assert it.Trump is going to be Trump. Stop playing by his rules. Don\u2019t allow him to dictate the terms of the debate. Let him call you whatever he likes. If he says you are part of a mob, so be it.Stay focused on the future. It belongs to an America that looks absolutely nothing like Trump\u2019s America. Vote!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tears, Fury or Action: How Do You Express Anger? ", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders discussed their struggles expressing rage and suggest turning anger into action. Ms. Harris is a senior editorial assistant in the Opinion section. Readers debated the topic of anger in more than a thousand comments, and offered testimonies of their own struggles with restrained or unleashed rage and suggestions for women about channeling those emotions into pushing policy changes. \u201cAs women, we need to feel our anger freely and then choose the most effective way to act on it,\u201d Ms. Buck continued. \u201cSometimes that will take the form of calm composure; other times it\u2019ll be better to let it rip.\u201d Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher were white hot with righteous rage when they confronted Senator Jeff Flake. Suddenly, Flake was all the men who have ever treated women as disposable and expendable, who thought they could treat women\u2019s suffering as a momentary inconvenience to be placated and then maneuvered out of the way. I\u2019ve been furious since I had my children. It really opened my eyes to the way women are totally disrespected in this society. The most precious moment of my life ushered in an era where strangers suddenly felt entitled to criticize me for any little decision I made. Professionally, my stock plummeted, and despite having an academic record not so different than Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s, rather than screaming about Supreme Court seats to which I\u2019m entitled, I had to demurely beg to keep a decent job. I\u2019m old enough to have taken part in the first wave of the modern feminist movement in the \u201960s and let me tell you, there was outspoken anger, fury and long pent-up rage. It was wonderful. We needed to feel it, to allow ourselves to feel it and to know we were capable of feeling it, even if our parents and boyfriends thought we had gone insane. Frankly, it was good for them to learn what we were capable of. I cannot disagree that there is a clear double standard at work, and I take no issue with women who get furious in public. The news on some days leaves me wondering how women can get through a day without experiencing some degree of rage. Rage on! Mindless fury is what has helped make the post-Clinton Democratic Party unfocused, weak, ineffective and mired in feel-good identity politics and political correctness, instead of achieving substantive legislative policy reform. This overwrought yet foggy timidity has paved the way for Donald Trump, and thus Brett Kavanaugh, because Republican power moguls have been able to translate fury into winning while Democrats more often channel it into feeling righteous, while losing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sculpture in Kosovo That Tracks a Country\u2019s Struggle", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRISTINA, Kosovo \u2014 A decade ago, Fisnik Ismaili designed a sculpture to celebrate Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence from Serbia: It was a word, \u201cNewborn,\u201d in 10-foot letters, painted a garish yellow. He did not have the cash to pay the metalworkers who built it, so he left his car and house keys as a deposit.On the evening that the sculpture was unveiled in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, more than 150,000 people signed it. \u201cThat moment felt larger than life,\u201d Mr. Ismaili said recently, in a cafe just yards from the sculpture. \u201cPeople kept coming, climbing it, writing on it. It went on for hours and hours.\u201dMr. Ismaili, now 45, signed it for more than 30 friends who could not make the independence celebrations. He wrote a message to his girlfriend, too. Then he added, \u201cThank God it\u2019s over\u201d to the \u201cB\u201d \u2014 referring to both Kosovo\u2019s long road to independence and to the sleepless nights Mr. Ismaili had endured while preparing the sculpture.\u201cAt that moment, we were extremely hopeful \u2014 everyone was,\u201d Mr. Ismaili said. \u201cYou should have seen the faces of everyone: 99 percent were crying.\u201dBut, Mr. Ismaili added, \u201cThe feeling didn\u2019t last long.\u201dBut since the sculpture\u2019s inauguration and Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence, economic and political progress has frustrated many in the country. Corruption is a major problem, and a border with Serbia still has not been agreed on.Mr. Ismaili\u2019s sculpture has tracked that history, good and bad.In 2016, for instance, he covered it with clouds, but also painted barbed wire around the letters \u2014 a statement about the difficulty Kosovars had getting visas to enter most of the rest of Europe (Mr. Ismaili promised politicians he would paint scissors cutting the wires if the visa rules were relaxed. They weren\u2019t).The following year, he painted bricks on the letters, knocked the \u201cN\u201d and \u201cW\u201d over, then wrote the words \u201cNo walls\u201d between them in a response to efforts to build a wall through Mitrovica, an ethnically divided town in the north of the country.\u201cEvery time I paint it, I want to give it a message,\u201d he said.In its current form, that message is optimistic: The letter \u201cB\u201d has been replaced by the number \u201c1,\u201d making a 10 to celebrate the years since Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence. But Mr. Ismaili initially wanted even this to have a political message. \u201cI wanted to make it a mirror \u2014 \u2018Time to reflect\u2019 \u2014 but I couldn\u2019t find a single company here who paints chrome,\u201d he said.In 1991, he left for London to avoid being recruited into the Yugoslav Army as the country split apart (there was fighting in Croatia after that country declared independence that year, and the war in Bosnia was on the horizon). \u201cPolice would stop you in the street and you\u2019d find yourself on the front line. I had a friend who lost his life like that,\u201d Mr. Ismaili said.In London, he studied multimedia computing, then worked for some major advertising agencies, but when the war started in Kosovo in the late 1990s, he looked to join the rebels. Eventually, he went to Kosovo and served three months in the Kosovo Liberation Army.Mr. Ismaili\u2019s initial plan for \u201cNewborn\u201d was to preserve it with the graffiti from the night it was unveiled. But people kept on signing, so he decided to repaint it every year on the anniversary of the declaration of independence, starting by painting the flags of countries that had recognized Kosovo as a sovereign nation.Mr. Ismaili\u2019s plan did not initially succeed. The government refused to let him touch the sculpture, he said, claiming that it would destroy the authenticity of the artwork.The sculpture went unchanged for five years, until it became so dirty that the city authorities had to repaint it. Mr. Ismaili was unimpressed. \u201cEven the yellow they used was different,\u201d he said. That night he went on Facebook and asked for volunteers to help paint the flags. Two days later, 150 people turned up to help. \u201cAt times, I thought they were going to arrest me for doing this without asking anyone, but when they saw how beautiful it was looking, no one bothered us,\u201d he said.With the help of volunteers, he has repainted it every year since. \u201cThere\u2019s been times in the last few years \u2014 many times \u2014 that I just wanted to paint it black. Just to send a message that this situation is so bad,\u201d he said. He once even bought the paint and loaded it into his car. \u201cWhat stopped me was the fact it\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t own this.\u201dStreet artists once turned the \u201cB\u201d into a \u201cP\u201d so the sculpture read \u201cNewporn,\u201d Mr. Zhegrova pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s good to let things like that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t institutionalize it.\u201dMr. Ismaili says he loves that people add graffiti to the sculpture \u2014 even if the messages can be rude: \u201cI\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to create a system to allow ordinary Kosovars to suggest ideas for repainting it.But, for now, he said, he would do what he always does: sit down about five days before the independence anniversary, and hope an idea comes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "War by Other Means", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome American officials appear to hope that resumed sanctions on Iran will lead to a popular uprising. Have they thought that through?Ms. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.In resuming sanctions, Mr. Trump hopes to force Iran to capitulate to unrealistic American demands, including ending all its nuclear activity and ceasing its military role in Syria and Yemen.It\u2019s unclear whether the administration has really considered the potential consequences of its actions. They may have the opposite effect of what is intended, by strengthening Iran\u2019s hard-liners and stoking more regional instability.Crucially, Mr. Trump has failed to enlist Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 the major powers that joined the United States in negotiating the nuclear deal \u2014 in his anti-Iran crusade. The Europeans say the deal is in their national security interest; they resent that Mr. Trump has unilaterally upended it.Some analysts say it could eventually benefit competitors eager to replace the dollar as the world\u2019s dominant currency and do long-term damage to the United States.Mr. Trump faces other trouble as well. No matter how painful the reimposed sanctions are, they won\u2019t be as effective as when the major powers were united in their enforcement. China, India and Japan have signaled a willingness to continue at least some purchases from Iran.As history shows, sanctions are most effective when they are applied judiciously and with broad international support. Conversely, the United States and its partners must be willing to remove sanctions when the target country changes its behavior. President Barack Obama saw the nuclear deal as a way to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, to ease the hostility that has dominated relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and to appeal to a new generation of pro-Western Iranians.That not only didn\u2019t happen, but in many ways Iran\u2019s malign regional behavior has grown worse, a bad call by the country\u2019s leaders.Iran is already struggling with a fragile economy and internal unrest, and some American officials hope a tightening vise will lead to a popular uprising. This tough approach, backed by Israel and Saudi Arabia, reached a crescendo last month when Mr. Trump and top advisers used a series of speeches to mount a coordinated verbal attack on Iran\u2019s government and to warn of dark consequences if it doesn\u2019t change its behavior.So could Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line approach indeed spark regime change? And then what?Despite recent unrest and economic weakening, experts say Iran\u2019s government isn\u2019t expected to fall any time soon.If Mr. Trump had stuck with the nuclear agreement, he would have had the standing to lead an effort with the five other major powers to address concerns over Iran\u2019s military presence in Syria, its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah, its hostility toward Israel and its backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Instead, he has alienated America\u2019s closest allies and set the stage for a conflict that could easily spiral out of control.An earlier version of this editorial misstated the nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It is not a weapons program.Advertisement"}

Look up the term \u201cpelvic canal\u201d in the typical anatomy or obstetric textbook, and you likely will find a description such as this: \u201cWell-built healthy women, who had a good diet during their childhood growth period, usually have a broad pelvis.\u201dLimited prescriptions of what constitutes a \u201cnormal\u201d pelvis or birthing process might lead doctors to perform unnecessary interventions \u2014 like induced labor, cesarean sections or the use of forceps \u2014 which can further exacerbate harm, said Lia Betti, an anthropologist at the University of Roehampton in London, and the study\u2019s lead author.\u201cWhat worries me is that doctors come out of school thinking of the European model of the pelvis,\u201d Dr. Betti said. In the early 1900s, this led to \u201chorrific situations\u201d in which American doctors used forceps on black mothers, trying to force babies to align with \u201cthe rotation pattern for a European classical pelvis,\u201d she added.Factors such as how long it takes a baby to progress through the canal, or which direction the head is facing on delivery, could change depending on pelvic shape. Mostly, they found, pelvic shape varied along lines of geographic ancestry. People of sub-Saharan origin generally had the deepest pelvises back-to-front, while Native Americans had the widest side-to-side. Europeans, North Africans and Asians fell in the middle of the range.The variation observed by Dr. Betti suggests that pelvic shape is not so strictly controlled.

Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft\u2019s monopoly back in the bottle.It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry\u2019s largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There\u2019s just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.The industry\u2019s new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets \u2014 these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting \u201csmart.\u201d Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend \u2014 known by the marketing catchphrase \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung.Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet.\u201cI can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,\u201d he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. \u201cIn our government-can\u2019t-do-anything-ever society, I don\u2019t see any reining in of the corporate trends,\u201d he said.At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a \u201csmart\u201d fan using Amazon\u2019s chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan\u2019s control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code \u2014 in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code.And that\u2019s it. The fan\u2019s digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in.This system illustrates Mr. Schneier\u2019s larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet.Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don\u2019t connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do.The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don\u2019t often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple\u2019s brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors.The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry.Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason techies don\u2019t like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn\u2019t a terrible idea.Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast.

{"Headline": "Google to Charge Phone Makers for Android Apps in Europe", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Google has always made its Android mobile operating system available free as a way of getting its search engine, web browser and other applications on as many devices as possible to collect data about users and to sell advertising.But on Tuesday, in response to a European antitrust ruling this year, the company said it would for the first time begin charging handset manufacturers to install Gmail, Google Maps and other popular applications for Android in the European Union.The new arrangement is the latest sign that global technology companies are adjusting their business practices in Europe to account for stiffer regulations there.By obligating handset makers to load the free apps along with the Android operating system, regulators said, Google had boxed out competitors. With the company now required to separate its services in Europe, handset manufacturers like Samsung and Huawei will now have more flexibility there to choose what applications they want to pre-install on phones.Google said it would sell a license for a package including its Google Play app store, Gmail, YouTube and Maps. Another license will be available for companies that want to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser, allowing handset makers to team up with rival services. The company did not say how much it would charge for the licenses.The European Commission had allowed Google to come up with its own ways for complying with the decision, putting pressure on regulators to ensure that the company met its obligations. Google already faces accusations that is has not complied with an earlier antitrust ruling over its unfair favoring of its own search results.The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.Android is the world\u2019s most widely used mobile operating system, powering more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. Google said that more than 24,000 different kinds of devices run the software. Using Android has allowed companies like Samsung to compete against Apple\u2019s iPhone without having to make their own software.In providing Android free to any device maker to use and modify, Google helped make the software available everywhere \u2014 in phones, tablets, cars and refrigerators. But the company tied the use of the popular Play store, where customers can download more than one million apps made by outside developers, to requirements that device makers feature other, ad-driven services like Google\u2019s search engine and web browser.Some handset makers argued to European regulators that Google\u2019s terms made it impossible for them to create devices less dependent on the search giant\u2019s applications. Those companies will now have more freedom to offer alternate services without facing consequences from Google.\u201cAndroid phone makers wishing to distribute Google apps may now also build noncompatible, or forked, smartphones and tablets\u201d in Europe, Google said in a statement. \u201cThey will also be able to license Google Play separately from Search and Chrome, with full freedom to install rival apps as before.\u201dGoogle declined to say what the financial impact of the changes would be, and it said the license fees were needed to make up for any lost ad revenue. But the company could make money from handset makers that choose to use its applications, and it will collect the licensing fees and the advertising revenue when its services are used.Google also plans to offer financial incentives to companies that continue featuring its search engine and browser, potentially giving the company an advantage over rivals.Samsung and Huawei, two of the largest makers of Android phones sold in Europe, had no immediate comment.The Android changes may not be permanent. Google is appealing the European Commission\u2019s decision, a process that could drag on for years. If the company prevails, it could revert to bundling its free services.Europe has become the world\u2019s toughest watchdog over the global technology industry. Once seen as overly aggressive, policies in the region are now influencing other countries to take a tougher approach. In the United States, where the tech industry has enjoyed little regulation, members of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are speaking more favorably of stricter oversight of online platforms like Facebook and Google.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stone Mountain: The Largest Confederate Monument Problem in the World", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. \u2014 The Rev. Ferrell Brown, a white pastor at a suburban Atlanta megachurch, stood on the big bald top of Stone Mountain on a warm Saturday morning, sharing a stage with two relatives of those murdered at a black church in Charleston, S.C., three years ago.In front of him were 2,000 evangelical Christians \u2014 mostly a mix of black and white Southerners \u2014 who had come to the mountaintop to worship across racial barriers.Below them, etched across three acres of granite on the mountain\u2019s north face, was the carving of Southern Civil War leaders that is literally the largest Confederate monument problem in the world.Pastor Brown spoke of his family\u2019s history, divulging that he was a descendant of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general and founder of the Ku Klux Klan. He spoke of his grandfather, who, he said, would throw a meal in the trash at a restaurant if he saw a mixed-race couple walk in.Pastor Brown told the audience that he knew as a child that he wanted to be different. He said he changed with the help of God.\u201cI stand here today as a representation of the racism of the white man against African-Americans, against Jews, against Hispanics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m asking forgiveness, I\u2019m asking you, I repent. I repent! I\u2019m asking you to forgive!\u201dThis late August gathering at Stone Mountain Park, just east of Atlanta, was organized by a group called the OneRace Movement, whose leaders sought to \u201cdepoliticize and bring restoration and healing\u201d to the place. They gathered in the heat of a governor\u2019s race in which Stone Mountain, with its controversial carving and ugly racist history, has come to play a complicated role \u2014 not as a central issue, exactly, but as a looming presence, imbued with the volatile power of Confederate remembrance and racial resentment.Stacey Abrams, a Democrat and former State House minority leader, is the first black woman in the country to win a major party\u2019s nomination for governor, and it was Ms. Abrams, 44, who injected Stone Mountain into the contest.The reaction has been palpable. Even some black Georgians oppose Ms. Abrams\u2019s idea, saying that erasing the carving would amount to erasing history. But even if she had never run, Georgia may have been due for a reckoning with Stone Mountain, a gargantuan reminder of how the past continues to haunt a state that is hurtling toward the future.And yet, this signature attraction is increasingly at odds with the state being reborn beneath it, and Georgians like Mr. Brown are impatient to turn the page.According to census projections, Georgia will probably be the first of the Deep South states where the white non-Hispanic population will cease to be the majority, a demographic trend that Ms. Abrams is hoping will work in her favor in November.While Ms. Abrams has taken pains to argue that she will protect the state\u2019s inclusivity, her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, has chosen a different focus, winning his party\u2019s primary with a series of provocative ads in which he brandished a shotgun and said he might use his own pickup truck to deport \u201ccriminal illegals.\u201dMr. Kemp, who is white, has, like President Trump, denounced the movement to take down Confederate monuments. In July, as the Atlanta N.A.A.C.P. planned a protest calling for the removal of the Stone Mountain carving, Mr. Kemp said on Facebook that he would protect it from \u201cthe radical left.\u201d\u201cWe should learn from the past \u2014 not attempt to rewrite it,\u201d he added.The matter of Confederate heritage in Georgia is not a settled one. In 2002, the state\u2019s last Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, lost a re-election bid after suffering a backlash from pro-Confederate \u201cflaggers\u201d who were angry that he changed the state flag, which had incorporated the Confederate battle flag.\u201cI would urge her to tack away from that issue as aggressively as she could,\u201d Mark Taylor, a Democratic former lieutenant governor, said of Ms. Abrams. Mr. Taylor, who lost his own bid for governor in 2006, had supported the flag change, and still considers it to have been the right thing to do. However, he added, \u201cIt is not a good issue for Democrat candidates.\u201dA recent report on the history of the Stone Mountain carving published by the Atlanta History Center shows its \u201cstrong connections to white supremacy, Confederate Lost Cause mythology, and anti-Civil Rights sentiments.\u201dThe idea to carve the side of the mountain was hatched in 1914. The next year, the Klan, which had faded after first emerging during Reconstruction, was revived atop the mountain with a cross burning.Proponents of the carving had strong Klan ties, with one early booster, Helen Plane, even suggesting that Klansmen be included in the carving. The group, she wrote, \u201csaved us from Negro domination and carpetbag rule.\u201dThe carving effort stalled during the Great Depression, but in 1954, Marvin Griffin, a candidate for governor, stumped on a promise to uphold segregation in the wake of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling \u2014 and to finish the carving.After Mr. Griffin\u2019s election, the state bought the land in 1958, writing into law that it was meant to be operated as a \u201cperpetual memorial\u201d to the Confederacy.In subsequent years, the report states, a \u201cneo-Confederate theme park\u201d grew around the mountain, replete with a plantation house, anodyne versions of antebellum life, and a \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d museum.Historical exhibits do not avoid the ugliness, but do not dwell on them, either. Amid presentations on indigenous peoples, 19th-century life and the feat involved in the carving, a plaque entitled \u201cA Dark Side of Our History\u201d dedicates two paragraphs to the Klan\u2019s influence.Before the prayer service on the mountaintop, a preacher, Jonathan Tremaine Thomas, was at its base, rallying the mixed-race crowd that was preparing to hike to the top.\u201cGod doesn\u2019t want one Dr. King, he wants a nation of Dr. Kings!\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cSo ladies and gentleman, as we begin to ascend this mountain, I want you to trust that history is shifting underneath your feet.\u201dOn the one-mile trudge up the big granite rock, Stephen Palmer, 33, a consultant, said that he did not think the carving should be taken down, but rather left up as a reminder.\u201cSometimes the memory is good, to know what once took place but is no longer taking place any more,\u201d said Mr. Palmer, who is black.On a warm, quiet morning a few days before the event, Ane Ryan Walker and Alvin Walker, a retired white couple from Texas, had visited Stone Mountain Park as part of a southern tour of Confederate monuments that they feared were being \u201cerased\u201d by a wave of politically correct \u201csocialists.\u201dMr. Walker, 64, a former worker in heavy construction, insisted that the carving had \u201cnothing to do with Jim Crow,\u201d and spoke about Reconstruction with a bitterness that made it feel like a current event: \u201cThe Yankees came down here, the Carpetbaggers came down here. Today, we still have to get approval from Washington to change our voter laws,\u201d he said.One of the most discussed alternatives to Ms. Abrams\u2019s idea of removing the carving would involve using the museum spaces around it to tell a more complete, unvarnished story of Stone Mountain\u2019s past.The leading proponent of this idea is Michael L. Thurmond, the chief executive officer of DeKalb County, and the only black member of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, which governs the park.Mr. Thurmond has also proposed adding a bell tower on top of the mountain. It would evoke, he said, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 1963 speech, in which he dreamed of a country where crooked places would be made straight, and rough places made plain, and where freedom might ring out from a multitude of American places \u2014 including Stone Mountain of Georgia.Advertisement"}

Mr. Cisse took over the restaurant and changed the name to New Ivoire. The customers, mostly fellow Africans (and friends), remained.The dining room is now adorned with futuristic lamps and paintings of village amphorae, a peacock and the Buddha. Food, served on hand-carved wooden plates, is washed down with housemade juices, including gnamakoudji, ginger pulped and squeezed through cheesecloth, its heat ever so slightly modulated by pineapple juice, lemon, sugar and vanilla: a Creamsicle that ends in flames.Essential to the table is the Ivorian staple foutou banane, plantains boiled, then beaten repeatedly until stretchy to the touch. This is hard labor. \u201cAll the women who do it are strong,\u201d said Fatima Dione, the American-raised daughter of a Guinean diplomat. She is manager, host and waitress at once, and often steps into the kitchen to help the three cooks: Ms. Boleane; Djeinaba Dia, from Senegal; and Laurette Silue, from Ivory Coast.Pieces of foutou, dense and faintly sweet, are pulled off and dabbed in stew, to drink it up. Its ideal match is sauce graine, whose surface has the sheen of red hematite. The color derives from palm nuts crushed into paste, their scarlet oil rising to the top. The texture on the tongue is lush, messing with diction; you might suddenly find yourself slurring your words.And here is okra the underestimated, a vegetable that confounds some Americans with its inner tap of mucilage, a viscous liquid shunned as slime. But viscosity has its rewards, turning to voluptuousness in gombo frais, a stew of broken-down tomatoes, palm oil and okra chopped into little rondelles and cooked until the guts melt.With the stews might come alloco (fried plantains) or riz gras, listed on the menu by its more generally West African name, jollof rice. The grains are fattened and cooked in a soup that\u2019s built from onions fried into a sugary sweat and simmered with garlic, fresh tomatoes and tomato paste, for layers of bright and dark.Both gombo frais and sauce graine are crowded with giant hunks of beef and smoked turkey, a stand-in for the more profoundly pungent smoked fish that\u2019s a beloved ingredient in West Africa. There will most likely be cow\u2019s foot, too, skin-on, boiled for hours and half gone to jelly. \u201cThey put cow\u2019s foot in everything,\u201d said Ms. Dione with a sigh. She didn\u2019t grow up eating it, and protested. \u201cI lost that fight.\u201dMs. Dione started waitressing at the original Ivoire in Harlem while she was still in college, working from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., then heading straight to class. It was her mother\u2019s idea: \u201cShe wanted me to get in touch with my African roots,\u201d Ms. Dione said.At Paradis des Gouts, she is an ambassador, explaining dishes to diners mostly unfamiliar with them, like attieke, fermented cassava pulp grated and molded into tiny couscous-like orbs. It has little flavor on its own but arrives topped with raw Scotch bonnets or habaneros: first the burn, then bland consolation.A foil-wrapped cube of Maggi bouillon stands at the ready, to be crumbled and scattered over the attieke as you will. It tastes of a hundred shades of salt, carnal and marine at once. More Maggi goes into a loose mix of tomatoes and pickled onions, with a dash of clarifying mustard. This is tossed over grilled snapper and nubs of lamb that don\u2019t go gently under the teeth.\u201cI had one customer say, \u2018Too fatty, too many bones,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Dione said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the appeal.

Neither of us had ever been to one, but honestly, by the time it was suggested to me, it sounded like the cure of and for the century. I\u2019ll probably never know. The local rage room was open for only 15 minutes on a Thursday, which we all found strange because, considering the state of the world, a rage room should maybe be open around the clock as a public service. (\u201cYou need to have them like Starbucks,\u201d McCarthy told me later.)Her publicist tried, but ultimately the rage room wouldn\u2019t open early, not even for Melissa McCarthy, and she called to tell me that we would be changing to indoor sky diving at the iFly at Universal Studios. \u201cI hope you see the metaphor here,\u201d her publicist said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s flying, she\u2019s up high, she\u2019s soaring.\u201d I nodded and dutifully wrote this down.McCarthy arrived. She\u2019s tiny, just 5-foot-2, and her face is a shiny, magnetic sparkle \u2014 its resting expression is cheerfulness, its cheeks are dimpled, its inquisitiveness is somehow loving. It draws people energetically near it so that when people passed her on Universal City Walk, something forces them to turn toward her, having no idea why, only to then find out that she actually was the actress Melissa McCarthy. She is prone to wide-eyed expressions of surprise; she is prone to making her mouth as round as her eyes as she listens in awe or surprise or delight. It\u2019s a staple of some of her Midwestern-seeming characters, a delighted incredulity when faced with the modern world.A tall, athletic man who worked for iFly led us to change into purple jumpsuits that were made out of some environment-defiant mixture of nylon and other proprietary materials and forced us to watch an instructional video about all the safety and fun we were going to have. McCarthy was excited. I tried to be, too, but truthfully, I was still kind of bummed. A rage room! I could really find my way through a rage metaphor right now. I asked her why she wanted to do it in the first place. Was she as angry as the rest of us? She said it sounded fun. I asked her how she chose indoor sky diving as a runner-up. Was she ready to jet off and leave this earth and colonize another planet and start over like the rest of us? No, she said. The rage room was closed and this also sounded fun. I blinked.I sat on deck, watching her take her turn. It had been a long time since I\u2019d participated in an overt magazine stunt whose purpose was to set a scene for the opening paragraph of a story, to crystallize and illuminate a person for the reader and create a metaphor through which to weave a story \u2014 it\u2019s just not done anymore. And I didn\u2019t want to waste time flying just because it\u2019s fun when we had a lot to talk about: The way the world has changed comedy, the grave wounds that make somebody go into this weird profession.I looked from my notebook to the tube to my notebook to the tube, and yeah, I guess she was flying, she was up high, she was soaring. Then I noticed her face beneath her helmet: Her mouth and eyes open as round as her dimples, her face an expression of unmitigated wonder and joy, and there beyond the glass, I noticed for the first time just what a good time she seemed to be having.It was the \u201980s or maybe it was Lee Israel herself. Israel wrote biographies about celebrities but couldn\u2019t support herself, so she began forging letters in the voices of celebrities, a kind of fan fiction that allowed her work to finally be something it never was, which was valued. McCarthy was drawn to a character so different from herself: \u201cTalk about conflicted and challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cTalk about someone who is not trying to be likable at all.\u201d The more McCarthy dug into her, the more she began to really understand how isolated Israel was. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit obsessed with someone who is in the middle of such a huge city with so many people and yet is alone. And chooses to be alone! And puts herself in positions to not make new acquaintances, to not meet people.\u201d Israel would go to gay bars, during a time when gay bars were just for gay men, and drink in a corner with her headphones on so that no one would talk to her.[Review: Melissa McCarthy is criminally good in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d]Consider the outtake from \u201cThis Is Forty\u201d in which McCarthy berates every person in the room. \u201cI\u2019m going to light you all on fire.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad your husband died.\u201d When asked if she has been drinking: \u201cI\u2019m gonna slit somebody open like a fish and drink their blood. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to drink.\u201d As she went, Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann laugh too visibly and too loudly for any of the film to be usable, but McCarthy keeps going. Judd Apatow, the movie\u2019s director, couldn\u2019t use it because of the laughter, but he also couldn\u2019t allow it to be lost to legend and so he ran it during the movie\u2019s credits. Everyone, including McCarthy, knew in the moment that it wasn\u2019t going to make it into the movie. She didn\u2019t care. She was making people laugh.It\u2019s strange to watch that now, just a scene of a person riffing for pure enjoyment. Comedy has changed so much since then; it has become unrecognizable since I first began interviewing her in 2016. It has gone from being a variety of ways to tickle a person \u2014 real life, funny because it\u2019s true, ironic funny, deadpan funny, parody funny, no-duh funny, slapstick, farce, absurdity, pratfalls, a real variety \u2014 to merely, glumly reflecting what a terrible world this has become. It is purely reactive. It is completely tethered to world events. For example, a few years ago, \u201cColbert\u201d was flailing, trying to find its footing. But the recent saturation of bad news (or the news producer they hired from \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d or both) made it a hit.\u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d is her third movie this year. The others, \u201cLife of the Party\u201d and \u201cThe Happytime Murders,\u201d were comedies and were not quite so adored. She read those reviews, too. She reads all kinds of movie reviews. She sees that when a drama doesn\u2019t work, it was \u201ca good effort\u201d and gets a thoughtful review, but when a comedy doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s a crime against humanity and gets taken outside behind the shed. And shot. And then burned. And then the ashes are put up on a scaffold so that future generations of filmmakers can choose never to dare. She worries that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 that if this keeps up, if no one can find the value in just plain comedy, there will be no discernible demand and then they won\u2019t get made and fast forward millions of years and all that will be left are Marvel movies, Mad Max video games and those jumpsuits we wore at the iFly.Critics never loved comedies, not even in her most beloved era, the \u201980s, but those movies could still get audiences; those movies could still be financed. Now audiences have access to Rotten Tomatoes ratings and every single review from every single paper; it is hard to come back from overwhelmingly negative critical consensus. Put it this way: Twenty years ago, there were three pure comedies in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of the year. This year, so far, there are zero.She worries about comedy. She worries about the gloom and fatigue that flows beneath the streets, waiting to suck away her will to laugh and to make laughter. In 2013, she and Falcone, created their production company, On the Day Productions, which allows them to make their movies on their terms, with their own comic tastes. They keep their costs down, making movies like \u201cLife of the Party\u201d and \u201cThe Boss\u201d and next year\u2019s \u201cSuperintelligence\u201d in Atlanta for an audience they know still exists. They keep their sets closed and tight and full of only people they know and trust. Some people call their movies failures because they\u2019re not critically beloved, but they mostly break even during their opening weekends. They still make millions and millions of dollars \u2014 and keep her among Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actresses \u2014 and offer a 90-minute refuge for a whole lot of people, so exactly which part of it is a failure?\u201cWe\u2019re in a lot of trouble if it all becomes cops and capes and horror and grim,\u201d she said. At night, she and Falcone, who directed \u201cLife of the Party,\u201d \u201cTammy\u201d and \u201cThe Boss,\u201d sit in what they call their old-people chairs with glasses of Scotch and talk about whether comedy can be saved. Falcone worries that the world and the movies the world wants to see are getting darker and darker and darker because the spectrum of human awareness has widened and the mood has dampened and we\u2019ve taken the movies down with us. But darkness should make you seek out comedy even more, shouldn\u2019t it? It used to. \u201cIt\u2019s why they make comedies after the war,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou need to see the human experience, and you need to be able to laugh at yourself instead of just making fun of other people. I\u2019m not saying what we do is so important, but it\u2019s a little stupid thing that maybe can take some of the tension off.\u201d Here she thinks about Lee Israel again. She thinks about how people protect themselves from the world.She makes coffee, and she does not turn on the news; she does not check her email; she does not do Transcendental Meditation. She watches TV \u2014 \u201cI treat myself right,\u201d she says \u2014 an old episode of \u201cKnight Rider,\u201d which she thinks everyone should be rewatching, or the original episodes of \u201cThe Incredible Hulk.\u201d\u201cI watch Lou Ferrigno freak out, throw a clearly rubber tree. Bill Bixby\u2019s high-waisted super chambray-colored pants. They\u2019re always so pristine. Even though he\u2019s backpacking in the woods, he\u2019s so freshly laundered. I had no memory of the softer side of the Hulk. Lou Ferrigno, as the Hulk, picked up a baby bird\u2019s nest \u2014 or did he pick up actual baby birds? I can\u2019t remember which. I was like: \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to touch a baby bird and put them back in a tree. They\u2019d die and then their mother would leave them.\u2019 Is that true? If you touch a bird does the mother really take off? That\u2019s what we were always told, right?\u201d Back to the Hulk. \u201cIt\u2019s great. The music. There\u2019s. So. Much. Score.\u201dAfter her episode, she invites the world into her home, but reluctantly, but carefully, but slowly. She walks outside to get The Los Angeles Times, whose print edition is delivered to her doorstep. She reads The New York Times on her iPad. But then she turns to her National Geographic, which she also has delivered. You have to look at the photos in print to really get it \u2014 a toucan, a polar bear. She looks at Nat Geo and she looks at The Times and she can\u2019t reconcile it. Everyone\u2019s talking about borders lately. They should be talking about this stuff. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about polar bears and the toucan because it\u2019s so random and someone is taking these beautiful pictures. That\u2019s what the world is. It\u2019s not borders. Of course, it\u2019s all that, too, but, like, let\u2019s also remember how amazing the whole planet is.\u201dOn weekends, she and Falcone put their phones away for the duration. On Sundays, they gather their friends they have been working with since the Groundlings improv school \u2014 since forever \u2014 to their home for dinner. Falcone makes meatballs and sauce or McCarthy makes meatloaf. Sometimes Falcone and Steve Mallory, their old Groundlings friend and frequent co-writer and co-star, grill steaks. McCarthy and Falcone talk to each other lovingly, doing different characters and little voices that they\u2019ve developed over time, each with its own pace and energy and voice, moving in and out of them with no transition as if they\u2019re additional guests in their home just inhabiting their bodies. Mallory says she will one minute be a tough-talking Midwestern person, and then in a second she\u2019ll be a too-literal scientist, and then she\u2019ll turn into cross-eyed, pageboyed Marbles, this character she has had forever that talks real loopy.She hates how the entire world is set up to make people more efficient. She hates the trend that every home needs an open-concept design of one room leading to another. She sees what it\u2019s really about, which is not you spending time with your kids while you cook and they watch TV but you being able to be everywhere at once. \u201cWe are literally knocking down walls to help ourselves multitask,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start a business called \u2018Walls,\u2019 and my specialty will be putting walls in, because in 10 years we\u2019re all going to want them again because we\u2019ve made our houses into studio apartments.\u201d She puts her hands to her mouth as if she\u2019s hollering: \u201c\u2009\u2018The bed\u2019s in the kitchen!\u2019\u2009\u201dAt night, while she takes a bath, her iPad comes out. She could spend hours there on Pinterest or on Etsy. She buys bullheads and wallpaper and Moroccan rugs and duck heads and a moose head. She buys a bunch of 1980s-style dresses from an Etsy shop owned by woman in New Mexico for the \u201980s-themed party scene in \u201cLife of the Party.\u201d She orders these things under a different name but she also wants to call the woman and say: \u201cYour dresses are in my movie! Thank you for the dresses! Go see the movie!\u201dThe sets, particularly the ones on which Falcone is directing, look the same again and again because they\u2019re populated by people who have known one another, some of them as far back as the Groundlings. On this one: Matt Walsh, who was also in \u201cGhostbusters\u201d with McCarthy, now playing her husband. Mallory, who wrote \u201cThe Boss\u201d and appeared in \u201cTammy\u201d and \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d and whom McCarthy and Falcone had invited as a guest writer to sharpen the day\u2019s dialogue. Damon Jones, who also appeared in both of those movies. Maya Rudolph, who has been in just about everything with her.The crew is mostly the same, too. There\u2019s Pamela the makeup artist, who has been with her forever. There\u2019s Sheila, the script supervisor going all the way back to \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d who tells stories about the nervous breakdown she almost had trying to keep track of all the ad-libbing in the Brazilian-restaurant scene. McCarthy and Falcone think they\u2019re going to use this new assistant director again. Once they find someone, they tend to keep her around. They do what they call \u201ccrazy checks\u201d on the people they hire. McCarthy, or a proxy, calls around and wants to know: Do they at some point freak out and lose their temper and yell at people? Are they nice? Are they nice even when certain people aren\u2019t around? People talking to extras disrespectfully makes her \u201cblood cold.\u201dWhen she was training at the Groundlings, she was taught the improv rules, to say \u201cYes and\u201d and \u201cWhy not?\u201d ad infinitum until you land at the most extreme and funniest state of play. When she\u2019s in front of these people, she finds it easier to do that, to take it 10 levels further than a regular comedian would. The freedom and comfort allows her to strip away the natural human vanity that undermines comedy as she tries out new lines and bombs incessantly. \u201cVanity,\u201d she told me, \u201cis a huge waste of time and you never get good work that way.\u201d Magic happens when you bomb so much. She learned that in the Groundlings, too. \u201cYou try 20 to get one.\u201d It allows her to be ornery and vulnerable in \u201cThe Heat.\u201d It allows her to be cantankerous and lost in \u201cTammy.\u201d It allows her to be bombastic and desperate in \u201cThe Boss.\u201dThe few rules on set are strict ones. The main one is: be present, which translates into people only using their phones for direct, necessary communication. Phones drive McCarthy crazy, so the rule is that you can use your phone if you need to, but no scrolling. If you\u2019re scrolling, you\u2019re not actually checking anything. You\u2019re checking on your 15th cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re absent-mindedly removing yourself from the space you are in,\u201d she says.She sees why phones are necessary, she accepts their existence, but she thinks the world got much worse and more apathetic and less willing to say \u201cYes and\u201d and \u201cWhy not?\u201d the minute everyone had a smartphone. She\u2019ll post on Instagram but she won\u2019t read Instagram. She won\u2019t even do email. People can text her or they can call her. Email will drown her. The return lobs will necessitate checking for yet another answer, and who knows when that will come \u2014 when she\u2019s sitting down for dinner with her daughters? When she\u2019s writing with Falcone? When she\u2019s about to think of something really funny or new or interesting?She wants her set to be safe from this. She wants it to be a place where conversations can get weird: \u201cDo you know so-and-so has a sixth toe?\u201d is her example of a weird turn in a conversation. She wants to know fun facts. She wants to know where people grew up. Or:\u201cNot that I want to wear pantyhose,\u201d she was saying. She was in full camera makeup and wore fake eyelashes that made her eyes even greener. \u201cBut, God, if I did I would want to just crack open a L\u2019eggs. Who thought of that? Who was like: \u2018We should put pantyhose in a chicken egg. They love wearing pantyhose, and they love large chicken eggs.\u2019 At some point, somebody was sitting around holding a bourbon and said: \u2018Women love eggs. You know why.\u2019\u2009\u201d She held a pretend bourbon in her hand and put the emphasis on the why but never stopped smiling.\u201cGuys,\u201d she said. When she speaks, she is soft and kind. She does not suck the life force out of everything she comes in contact with, unlike other funny people I\u2019ve interviewed. \u201cI think we\u2019ve cracked the code on why L\u2019eggs pantyhose used to come in an egg. We have to look up when that was started, but the theory is, which I\u2019m horrified is right, is because somebody said, \u2018Women have eggs, they love pantyhose, let\u2019s put them together!\u2019\u2009\u201dA crowd had gathered, and everyone was laughing \u2014 Ben, Maya, Steve, Matt, Pamela, Sheila, the producer Chris Henchy. They were running ahead of schedule. The days have been long on this one, but nothing crazy. Everyone agrees nothing crazy.See? You can\u2019t have a conversation like that when everyone\u2019s scrolling on their phones.McCarthy wanted to be wild, too. She was always trying characters on. She was a cheerleader one year, the next a Goth with black lipstick and bangs who wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone. She went to Catholic school for 12 years and wore a uniform but would say, \u201cKnee down and neck up is mine.\u201d She had friends. She was on the student council. She played tennis. But then she would dye her hair blue-black and wear Kabuki makeup and full-length capes. That wasn\u2019t teenage moodiness. There was no real darkness behind it. What can she say? She lived in a small town. She was bored. \u201cEveryone was wearing the same sweater from the Limited, and I could go to the thrift store and find an entire, full-blown costume for the same price.\u201d Her boyfriend wore a magician\u2019s hat and cape and spats to prom, along with what she called a \u201cPuttin\u2019 on the Ritz\u201d cane.She cultivated characters that were the opposite of her real self, all of them designed to make people laugh. Most of them were old because what\u2019s more opposite a 20-year-old than an 80-year-old? She grew up with her great-grandmother. One of her first jobs in fourth grade was as a caretaker for her 93-year-old Aunt Hilda. McCarthy would go to her house after school and make her a snack and hang out while McCarthy\u2019s mom cleaned downstairs. Her first real job was at a nursing home. She began to collect wigs (not from the nursing home), one to bring each of her elderly or societally fringe characters to life.She said she was never trying to escape herself. It wasn\u2019t like that at all. She had no emotional need beyond wondering what it was like to be these particular characters. The first time she did standup, she wore a giant wig. \u201cI like me,\u201d she said. This was over the summer, when we met at a hotel off Fifth Avenue and she was wearing a beanie, a pink cat T-shirt and a cross-body cellphone carrier. \u201cBut I am me.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even really understand my questions about what kind of loneliness makes a person go into her line of work. How can she tell you if she felt rejected for not being someone wearing the same Limited sweater everyone else was wearing when she doesn\u2019t even understand why you would want to wear the same clothes as everyone else in the first place?People don\u2019t really get her. They want to know her philosophy, her feelings on irony, how she does it. Falcone told me that everyone always wants to know what big secret she\u2019s keeping. \u201cI think people, in the effort to keep things poppy, don\u2019t look and see that while she\u2019s incredibly kind and Midwestern and gentle, she\u2019s also really complicated as a human, as we all are,\u201d Falcone told me. \u201cI think what people are missing is the fact that she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s smart. She also doesn\u2019t take [expletive]. She\u2019s told all the time, \u2018You can\u2019t do this or that in the acting world.\u2019 But she says, \u2018Why not\u2019 and \u2018Yes and\u2019 all the time, which I think is a hallmark of crazy people but also people that are successful.\u201dIn her bath, McCarthy thinks about originality. She thinks about the movies she grew up watching and how she waited for the day when she would finally be able to do that.By the time we sat down at that hotel, \u201cLife of the Party\u201d had come and gone. Critics called it \u201cthe latest Melissa McCarthy star vehicle that fails to do justice to the sheer awesomeness of its leading lady\u201d (RogerEbert.com) and said she \u201cfalls into the same trap she did in \u2018Tammy\u2019 and \u2018The Boss,\u2019 the two other movies she wrote with her husband/director Ben Falcone. By that we mean she allows her laugh instincts to get buried in a blanket of bland\u201d (Rolling Stone). \u201cLooking for something fun to take Mom to for Mother\u2019s Day? Do your mom (and yourself) a favor and steer clear of \u2018Life of the Party\u2019\u2009\u201d (ibid.).Critics say her comedies are just sanitized versions of a time she\u2019s nostalgic for. But the thing that keeps her making the kind of movies she and Falcone make isn\u2019t nostalgia. It\u2019s just that that\u2019s just the last time comedy was allowed to be a random assortment of things to make you laugh. It\u2019s her refusal to let the state of the world come and take comedy along with it. After \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d the media called her an overnight success, even though she was past 40 and had, by that time, \u201cworked like an animal\u201d for decades. All these years and all this hard work and she finally got to Wally World. But what happens when you get to Wally World and you find out it\u2019s closed?In their chairs, Falcone says maybe we\u2019re already too lost. McCarthy says, \u201cYeah, but what if?\u201dThe movie, which was directed by Brian Henson, Jim Henson\u2019s son, is a comedy that\u2019s maybe also a race allegory between puppets and humans? I couldn\u2019t quite tell. The resolution of the mystery at the heart of it involves \u2014 I hope I\u2019m beyond the statute of limitations with this crucial spoiler \u2014 a puppet\u2019s pubic hair not being the same color as the hair on her puppet head. This is perhaps the least obscene detail in the entire film.\u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d came out under the cover of late August with a small scandal attached to it. (\u201cSesame Street\u201d was upset.) A few critics called it the worst movie of the year. It was called \u201ctired, bloodless stuff\u201d (The Times). Elsewhere it was said that \u201cthis R-rated look at a serial killer running wild in a puppet-populated L.A., has what it takes to be a contender for worst of the decade\u201d (Rolling Stone). They said it was \u201cbasically, disgusting\u201d and \u201creprehensible\u201d (The New Yorker) and \u201ca joyless, soulless slog\u201d (Slate).Honestly, it wasn\u2019t that bad. The novelty of puppets ejaculating in a movie after a lifetime of indoctrination to \u201cSesame Street\u201d characters does not go stale after 91 minutes. Best of all, it is the dirty, cursing, obscene version of McCarthy, which is my favorite. Her character gets a liver replacement using a puppet liver and she becomes prone to the ailments of the puppets (including a glucose-snorting-through-licorice-straws addiction). Whatever Freudian issues young Henson was trying to work out, there are some laughs in there \u2014 real, full-body ones that remind you that laughter is actually a bodily response to something new and sometimes a little surprising. It happened during a scene when one of the characters watches an octopus/cow porn shoot that consists of the octopus milking the cow lasciviously. My breath spurt out like little gasps and my body spasmed in time with them. It seemed like a cough at first, as if maybe my body was expelling something? Or maybe I was sobbing unwittingly? Was I dry-heaving? I thought, What the hell is happening here? What is this thing happening to my body? But it was pleasurable. It forced my body to course \u2014 briefly, very briefly \u2014 with something that felt like well-being.She\u2019s right. You forget all this when you don\u2019t go to the movies. You forget how much your experience of a comedy depends on your being in a room full of people who are not just also laughing, but who also came just so they could laugh \u2014 even though in my screening it was just those two other people. There is something poignant about the act of entering the theater to laugh; there is something that feels revolutionary about it.Comedy changes. Comedy has changed. I finally watched the comedy special people keep recommending to me, \u201cNanette,\u201d and it\u2019s O.K.-funny, sure, but it\u2019s so relevant and so about the problems of the world that it feels more like a humorous TED Talk than a comedy special. \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cColbert\u201d and \u201cSamantha Bee\u201d are the open-concept homes of efficiency where you can get your comedy, your information and your outrage all from one source \u2014 things that used to be sold separately. The only time I laughed this week was during the day when my favorite Twitter feed, @_FloridaMan, tweeted out video of some idiot jet skiing down a highway that\u2019s an actual news clip from real life. I can barely make it through the cold open of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d it\u2019s so depressing.McCarthy has created her own world time and again \u2014 at home and on set and in her childhood. And yes, bubbles don\u2019t just keep things in; they keep things out, too. They keep out input and challenges, and sometimes they even keep out change. But what if it\u2019s valid to not want to change? What if it\u2019s valid to keep misery at bay?I don\u2019t have any bubbles anymore; nobody I know does, either. There was a story in the paper about a guy who doesn\u2019t read the news and people\u2019s faces melted off. Everyone I know has become political. My Facebook feed is a nightmare of radicalized everyone and fighting all the time and stupid JPGs with angry aphorisms and petitions. I\u2019ve become someone who uses the word \u201crevolutionary\u201d to describe being in a movie theater. I wrote this story six times, and each time it was returned to me as too depressing and listless. I tried to figure out how to make it work \u2014 a Melissa McCarthy article should probably not be depressing, I agreed \u2014 and my editor gave me some suggestions, but I couldn\u2019t hear him above the TVs in our newsroom, which all blared detailed accounts of sexual assault and miscarriages of justice and a climate-change story that said we would all be desiccated human Slim Jim husks of ourselves, withered by the parching sun in 20 years and outrage outrage outrage until we are limp and exhausted and miserable.What I\u2019m saying is that maybe McCarthy is onto something. Why stay out here when it is so much nicer in there, behind the gates with the resin zoo and the old \u201cHulk\u201d episodes? Why look for meaning in everything when the entire point of the comedy exercise is to transcend meaning and responsibility and poignancy? She\u2019s funny. She\u2019s polar bears and toucans. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what she aspires to. Take it or leave it, but please don\u2019t leave it because it has taken me this long to recognize it and that\u2019s not great. What I\u2019m saying is that maybe we should consider trying this her way. So:McCarthy was flying, she was way up high, she was soaring. She was hovering six feet above Los Angeles, her body and soul and her essence and her gifts protected by a glass tube (was the glass tube the point this whole time?), wearing a purple jumpsuit made out of some environment-defiant mixture of nylon and other proprietary materials and a helmet and goggles.

{"Headline": "How to Delete Facebook and Instagram From Your Life Forever", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixLost faith in Facebook and Instagram after data leakages, breaches and too much noise? Here\u2019s a guide to breaking up with the social network and its photo-sharing app for good.You may have decided enough is enough: It\u2019s time to delete Facebook.The company said in a statement that it was investigating the incident and would share updates. \u201cPeople\u2019s privacy and security is incredibly important, and we\u2019re sorry this happened,\u201d the company said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s why we took immediate action to secure people\u2019s accounts and fix the vulnerability.\u201dI have some firsthand experience with all of this. After the disclosure of Facebook\u2019s breach, I felt my trust in the social network was broken. So I pulled out my data from Facebook and purged the account. What I found out about the process: The more you have integrated Facebook into your life, the more time-consuming it will be to delete it.To make account deletion as painless as possible, here is a step-by-step guide. I also included steps on breaking up with Instagram, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app, for those looking for a cleaner getaway.Before you commit to breaking up with Facebook, it\u2019s important to handicap the potential collateral damage. Some products and services are deeply integrated with Facebook and could become difficult to use without the social networking account. Doing all of that was a pain. But the exercise was worth it to ensure I wouldn\u2019t break my accounts for other sites.Now that I knew I could safely delete Facebook, I started pulling my data out of the social network. That means any personal information that I had collected in my account, including my photos, message transcripts and friends list, and that I did not already have copies of elsewhere.I requested a copy of all my data. Facebook took about an hour to assemble all the information into one file that measured about 700 megabytes. The file took about 10 minutes to download, and the information was organized into folders for different types of data, like photos, search history and messages.Pulling your information off Facebook doesn\u2019t mean you are removing it from the company\u2019s servers, though. More on that in a bit.After making sure I had a copy of all the Facebook data I cared about, it was time to do the deed. In Facebook\u2019s settings menu, I clicked the button \u201cYour Facebook information\u201d and then clicked \u201cDelete Your Account and Information.\u201dFinally, I clicked on the blue \u201cDelete Account\" button. A prompt popped up asking for my password. Then a box showed up warning that deletion was permanent. I wasn\u2019t fazed \u2014 and hit the button.But wait. After hitting delete, my Facebook account was not actually erased, despite all the hoops I had jumped through. The site said that my account was scheduled for permanent deletion after 30 days, and that if I logged in again, I would have the option to cancel the deletion request.This grace period is here so people can change their minds. In addition, the entire deletion process may take up to 90 days to purge all backups of your data from the company\u2019s servers, according to Facebook. In other words, be patient.If you also want to get away from Facebook\u2019s clutches by removing your Instagram account, that process is much easier. That\u2019s because Instagram is not nearly as wide-reaching as Facebook; you don\u2019t use your Instagram account to log in to other apps, for instance. I confess I did not personally follow through with this. I kept my Instagram account because I like keeping in touch with friends there.After ending a romantic relationship, have you ever blocked your ex on Facebook so that he or she can\u2019t follow you around? You should do the same after breaking up with Facebook to make sure the site stops tracking your browsing activities.After I completed these steps myself, there was no sense of closure as I had expected. That\u2019s probably because I knew I might end up reversing the Facebook deletion for the sake of writing instructive articles like this one. I have 30 days to decide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Law Firm\u2019s Fee Settlement Could Shake Up Securities Class Actions", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA deal that was reached this week in a long-running fee dispute has the potential to reshape the way law firms that represent plaintiffs bill for their work and pay other lawyers for referring clients to them.The proposed settlement could prompt greater transparency about so-called finder fees that are paid to lawyers \u2014 especially those who do little actual work in a matter. It was agreed to late Tuesday by Labaton Sucharow, a well-known class action securities law firm.Under the settlement, which requires approval by a federal judge in Boston, Labaton would have to cough up $4.8 million in fees it collected, splitting the money between the plaintiffs and some of the other firms involved in the case. It must also retain a former federal judge to make sure its fee-sharing arrangements with other lawyers \u201care in compliance with applicable rules and emerging best practices.\u201dIt is not uncommon for law firms like Labaton, which has achieved significant settlements in securities cases involving Facebook, the Brazilian petroleum giant Petrobras and the mining company Barrick Gold, to pay referral fees to lawyers who bring them clients. But typically, the lawyers are expected to have done some work to justify a significant fee. It is considered good legal practice for such arrangements to be disclosed to all parties in the lawsuit \u2014 something the Labaton firm did not do in this litigation.John Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in securities law, said the case had shed an important light on the \u201crather sordid market of buying and selling plaintiffs\u201d in securities class actions.\u201cI think the whole arrangement was under the table and dubious,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.In a statement, Labaton acknowledged that its disclosure about the finder\u2019s fee \u201cfell short of emerging best practices.\u201d The firm, in a court filing that accompanied the proposed settlement, said it \u201caccepts responsibility\u201d for that shortcoming.Judge Mark L. Wolf of Federal District Court in Boston is expected to hold a hearing on the proposed agreement on Monday. A spokesman for the firm said Larry Sucharow, its chairman, would attend the hearing and \u201cbe prepared to address any questions the court may have regarding the proposed agreement.\u201dThe dispute over lawyers\u2019 fees erupted in 2016, not long after Labaton secured a $300 million settlement from State Street, a Boston financial services company, in a securities class-action lawsuit concerning transaction fees charged on foreign currency trades.In March 2017, the judge appointed a special master \u2014 the former federal judge Gerald E. Rosen \u2014 to look into the appropriateness of the fee package, including the issues of double-counting attorney hours spent on the case and the reasonableness of the rates charged by the lawyers. But during a 14-month investigation, Mr. Rosen made a startling discovery: Labaton had paid a lawyer in Texas a finder\u2019s fee equal to 20 percent of the attorneys\u2019 fee it received in the litigation.The payment to the lawyer, Damon Chargois, had not been previously disclosed. Mr. Rosen\u2019s investigation unearthed documents showing that Mr. Chargois did no work on the litigation other than help introduce the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System to Labaton roughly a decade ago. In 2011, Labaton filed a lawsuit for the retirement fund that was later consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by a few other law firms.None of those other law firms, nor Judge Wolf, were aware of the payment to Mr. Chargois. The Arkansas retirement fund also was unaware of any fee arrangement.The discovery of the undisclosed referral fee was a focus of a blistering 377-page report that Mr. Rosen filed in federal court in June. He sharply criticized the Labaton firm for not disclosing the referral fee and said it \u201craises serious questions regarding class action attorneys\u2019 ethical and legal obligations to clients and co-counsel, as well as considerable concerns about how judges can fulfill their essential fiduciary obligations to the class.\u201dAs part of the settlement this week, Labaton agreed to return $4.8 million to resolve the finder\u2019s fee and double-billing matters. Labaton and another law firm also agreed to pay $3.8 million for the cost of the special master\u2019s investigation.Mr. Coffee, the Columbia professor, said judges should be more aggressive in asking law firms to disclose any finder-fee arrangements at the outset of a class action, rather than after the case has been resolved and the bills are to be paid.Such arrangements are necessary information for the plaintiffs and the judge to make informed decisions during the case, Mr. Coffee said. \u201cThis should not just happen at the fee award stage,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark Plans a Fence to Stop a Pig Disease. Will It Work?", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTONDER, Denmark \u2014 Trying to halt the spread of a disease that can wipe out domestic pig populations, Denmark intends to build a fence along its border with Germany to keep out the pigs\u2019 wild cousins. There are just a few wrinkles to the plan.To the government\u2019s frustration, many Danes see the fence as being about more than just swine. Depending on their backgrounds and political stripes, people have called it a possible step toward blocking refugees, a detriment to wildlife, a reminder of painful history, or a violation of the European Union ethos of invisible borders and free movement.Oh, and there is little scientific evidence to suggest that it will work.\u201cWe have to enter the imagination of a pig,\u201d said Bent Rasmussen, the chief forest manager for the area, who is in charge of the project. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201dDenmark\u2019s $20 million answer includes a public awareness campaign, expanded permission to kill wild boar, and a fence about five feet tall along the 42-mile land border, across the neck of the Jutland peninsula, from the North Sea to the Baltic. In France, regional officials this week revealed plans for fences along parts of the country\u2019s border with Belgium, also to block African swine fever, but details and timing remained unclear.The Danish Parliament has approved the fence, and work is expected to begin early next year, though environmentalists have appealed to the European Union to stop it.But there are holes in the plan \u2014 or, more precisely, holes in the planned fence, which will have openings for 15 official border crossings, five waterways and passages for local farmers. It has to comply with an array of European Union rules and other international strictures protecting wildlife habitat and the movement of people and goods.SWEDENNorth SeaKattegatDENMARKCopenhagenTonderFlensborg FjordGERMANY50 milesBy The New York Times\u201cMy job is to disturb the wild boar as much as possible and humans and other wildlife as little as possible,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said during a drive along a reed-covered ditch separating Danish farmland from a German village.The hope is that animals like deer and otters will still be able to cross the border, but boar will be deterred. Critics ask why that would work, given that the wild pigs are smart and curious, and regularly forage over long distances.Hans Kristensen, a hunter and founder of a Facebook group opposed to the fence, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like creating your retirement fund by buying a lottery ticket.\u201d He said there was no reason to think it would keep out German boars.Experts note that the Belgian outbreak of African swine fever occurred far from any others, indicating that people, not pigs, transported the virus into the country.\u201cLong-distance spread of A.S.F. can happen anytime all over Europe,\u201d said Dr. Klaus Depner of the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health in Germany. \u201cFences cannot prevent such events.\u201dVittorio Guberti, a leading wildlife disease epidemiologist, said the fence was likely to \u201creduce the speed at which wild boar move,\u201d but he, too, said that unwitting humans were the main factor in spreading the disease.The Danish plan includes putting wildlife cameras where roads cut through the fence, to record how often boars circumvent it.Some politicians have called for reinstatement of border controls to stop the flow of migrants into Denmark, and they see a value to the boar fence and cameras that is not what the center-right government intended.\u201cHooray, we\u2019re getting a fence on the Danish-German border,\u201d Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a spokesman on European Union affairs for the right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party, wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe should add a couple of meters so the fence not just keeps German wild boar away, but also illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and adventurers!\u201dThe party has also asked the minister of justice about possibly \u201cstriking two birds with one stone\u201d and using the wildlife cameras to look for people crossing the border illegally.Such talk angers Henrik Refslund Hansen, a farmer. He vehemently supports anything that might protect his pigs and says that talk of refugees just muddies the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s indecent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a border fence; I don\u2019t want to hear any of that. It\u2019s a veterinary fence made to protect our animals.\u201dMr. Hansen knows what is at stake. In the 1980s, as a teenager, he watched as an outbreak of pseudorabies, another viral disease, forced his family to cull thousands of pigs, and he retains the chilling memory of earth-moving equipment removing the carcasses.But along the border, the planned fence is a source of unease for Denmark\u2019s ethnic German minority, about 15,000 people who maintain German-language schools and publish a newspaper in German.Jorgen Popp Petersen, a pig farmer and local representative of the minority\u2019s political party, recalls \u201cfanatics\u201d in his childhood resisting intercommunity marriages and calling for a redrawing of the border, which has changed several times over Danish history, often through warfare. The fanatics and their views are gone, he said, but sensitivities over ethnic divisions and national boundaries remain.The fence, he said, is a way to say that Denmark is fixing things by leaving Germany \u201cto sink or swim\u201d with the virus. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve any problems by holing up.\u201dDenmark\u2019s minister of environment and food, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, said he understood that sensitivity, adding that he almost choked on his coffee when he first heard the idea of a border fence.\u201cIt\u2019s very un-European to build fences and boundaries between countries,\u201d he said. \u201cI fight for free movement in every other context. When it\u2019s right in this context it\u2019s because such a large part of exports is at risk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microplastics Find Their Way Into Your Gut, a Pilot Study Finds", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers looked for microplastics in stool samples of people from eight countries. \u201cThe results were astonishing,\u201d they said.Though it will take more than 1,000 years for most of these items to degrade, many will soon break apart into tiny shards known as microplastics, trillions of which have been showing up in the oceans, fish, tap water and even table salt.Now, we can add one more microplastic repository to the list: the human gut.In a pilot study with a small sample size, researchers looked for microplastics in stool samples of eight people from Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom and Austria. To their surprise, every single sample tested positive for the presence of a variety of microplastics.\u201cThis is the first study of its kind, so we did a pilot trial to see if there are any microplastics detectable at all,\u201d said Philipp Schwabl, a gastroenterologist at the Medical University of Vienna and lead author of the study. \u201cThe results were astonishing.\u201dThere are no certain health implications for their findings, and they hope to complete a broader study with the methods they have developed.\u201cThe fact that so many different polymers were measured suggests a wide range of contamination sources,\u201d said Stephanie Wright, an environmental health scientist at Kings College London who was not involved in the study. Two of the eight participants also said they did not consume seafood.To conduct the study, they selected volunteers from each country who kept food diaries for a week and provided stool samples. Dr. Schwabl and his colleagues analyzed the samples with a spectrometer.Up to nine different kinds of plastics were detected, ranging in size from .002 to .02 inches. The most common plastics detected were polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate \u2014 both major components of plastic bottles and caps.Still, Dr. Schwabl cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the origins of the plastic.\u201cMost participants drank liquids from plastic bottles, but also fish and seafood ingestion was common,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is highly likely that food is being contaminated with plastics during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging.\u201dWhether microplastics pose a health risk to humans is largely unknown, though they have been found to cause some damage in fish and other animals. Additionally, the microplastics detected in the current study are too large to be a serious threat, Dr. Wright said. \u201cBut what may be of greater concern for these large microplastics is whether any associated chemical contaminants leach off during gut passage and accumulate in tissues,\u201d she said. The concentration of contaminants \u2014 20 microplastic particles per 10 grams of stool \u2014 was relatively low, she said.Nonetheless, Dr. Schwabl said the results were more than enough to investigate further.\u201cNow that we know there is microplastic present in stool, and we know how to detect it, we aim to perform a larger study including more participants,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave the wrong measurement for a grain of rice. It is approximately 0.2 inches in size, not .02 inches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Naomi Osaka, a New Governor and Me", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisIs Japan becoming more welcoming to mixed-race people?Ms. Rich is the Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times.TOKYO \u2014 Just over 40 years ago, when my family moved from California to Tokyo, the fact that my mother was Japanese did not stop schoolchildren from pointing at me and yelling \u201cGaijin!\u201d \u2014 the Japanese word for foreigner \u2014 as I walked down the street.After seeing my red-haired, blue-eyed father, a shopkeeper in the suburb where we lived asked my mother what it was like to work as a nanny in the American\u2019s house.When we moved back to California two years later, I entered fourth grade and suddenly, I was the Asian kid. \u201cChing chong chang chong ching!\u201d boys chanted on the playground, tugging at the corners of their eyes. Classmates scrunched their noses at the onigiri \u2014 rice balls wrapped in dried seaweed \u2014 that my mother packed in my lunch bag. When our teacher mentioned Japan during a social studies lesson, every head in the class swiveled to stare at me.Now, back in Tokyo as a foreign correspondent for this newspaper, I am no longer pointed at by people on the street. But I am incontrovertibly regarded as a foreigner. When I hand over my business card, people look at my face and then ask in confusion how I got my first name. My Japanese-ness, it seems, barely registers.For the past two decades, roughly one in 50 children born in Japan each year have had one foreign parent. Here we are known as \u201chafu,\u201d which comes from the English word \u201chalf,\u201d and our existence challenges the strain in Japanese society that conflates national identity with pure-blooded ethnicity.When Ms. Osaka arrived in Tokyo last month shortly after winning the United States Open playing for Japan, a Japanese reporter asked her what she thought about her identity, setting off a contorted debate in traditional and social media about whether the question was appropriate. Ms. Osaka delivered the best possible reply: \u201cI\u2019m just me.\u201dHer relaxed, even insouciant, sense of how her heritage defines her has made me feel less tortured about my own. I have long felt like a bit of an impostor because I am not quite fluent in the language. But Ms. Osaka\u2019s Japanese is imperfect, too.As a champion, Ms. Osaka has been widely feted, with Japanese media following her breathlessly during her stay in Tokyo last month, obsessing over her search for good green tea ice cream. A Yonex tennis racket similar to one she uses and a Citizen watch model that she wore when she beat Serena Williams at the Open are selling vigorously in Japan.Ms. Osaka seems to have been more publicly welcomed than Ariana Miyamoto, a half-black, half-Japanese woman who was crowned Miss Universe Japan in 2015. Then, the judges who selected her were criticized by people who said she did not look sufficiently Japanese.Still, the public has embraced a number of \u201chafu\u201d athletes and television performers in Japan, although their popularity can disguise an underlying ambivalence. \u201cThere is a mixture of envy and discomfort,\u201d said Gracia Liu Farrer, a professor of sociology at Waseda University in Tokyo who studies immigration.Ms. Osaka\u2019s popularity in Japan appears to depend in part on what commentators see as her quintessentially Japanese behavior. She has repeatedly been praised for her humility, with the media zeroing in on her apology for winning against Ms. Williams.I have chafed at similar interpretations of my behavior in the United States. When I have been reserved or less assertive than people think a situation calls for, they have attributed it to my \u201cJapanese side.\u201dHere in Japan, I know my \u201cAmerican side\u201d can work to my advantage. Particularly for a woman in a male-dominated society, it is useful to be regarded as foreign first and female second.Suzanne Kamata, an American writer who has lived in rural Shikoku for 30 years and raised 19-year-old twins with her Japanese husband, said her children\u2019s bicultural identity can free them from some of the most rigid expectations of Japanese society.\u201cJapanese identity seems so all-consuming, and there are so many rules and this idea that all Japanese have the same way of thinking,\u201d Ms. Kamata said. \u201cSo I suppose it\u2019s good to be \u2018other.\u2019\u201dAmericans often subscribe to the myth that we already live in a society that accepts all kinds of other. But when colleagues have mistaken me for another Asian employee in the newsroom, I realize some people still instinctively want to pigeonhole me as one, but not both.When my husband and I moved here with our two school-age children two years ago, we enrolled them in an international school, where many of their classmates are biracial. Having grown up in a town where so few people looked like me, I am grateful that they are spending their adolescence surrounded by friends who share their mixed heritage.Shortly after we arrived in Tokyo, I went out to dinner with a white American friend of my parents who is the mother of two daughters with her Japanese husband. When I asked what it had been like for them to grow up here as \u201chafu,\u201d she suggested I should adjust my language. She tells her children that they should never think of themselves as less than, but more. Instead of \u201chafu,\u201d she said, she calls them \u201cdouble.\u201d That works for me.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a professor of sociology at Waseda University.

{"Headline": "Facebook Ads From Unknown Backer Take Aim at Brexit Plan", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May has struggled to build support for her plan for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Now, it turns out, some of the opposition has come from an unknown organization posting ads to millions of people on Facebook.In the past 10 months, the organization spent more than 250,000 pounds on ads pushing for a more severe break from the European Union than Mrs. May has planned. The ads reached 10 million to 11 million people, according to a report published on Saturday by a House of Commons committee investigating the manipulation of social media in elections.The ads, which disappeared suddenly this week, linked to websites for people to send prewritten emails to their local member of Parliament outlining their opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s negotiations with the European Union.\u201cWe voted to leave the E.U., to take back control of our money and borders,\u201d one ad said.Who was behind the campaign remains a mystery. The name attached to it was Mainstream Network, a group that does not appear to exist in Britain, beyond the ads and a website. There is no information on Facebook or on Mainstream Network\u2019s site about who is behind the organization.The parliamentary panel, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the posts highlighted Facebook\u2019s continuing problem monitoring political advertising on its social network.\u201cHere we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organization spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it,\u201d Damian Collins, the chairman of committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.\u201dThe panel has been investigating the role of social media in elections, including Facebook\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s contentious 2016 vote to leave the European Union. It is expected to release a full report in the coming weeks.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said the company will update its disclosure policy in Britain next month. It will require political advertisers to verify their identities and then attach accurate information about their identities to the ads.\u201cWe know we can\u2019t prevent election interference alone,\u201d Mr. Leathern said, \u201cand offering more ad transparency allows journalists, researchers and other interested parties to raise important questions.\u201dTo oversee its response to a growing number of regulatory challenges around the world, the company announced on Friday that Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister in Britain who is politically well connected in Europe, would become its new head of global public policy.The Mainstream Network ads were taken down after Facebook announced its new political advertising rules in Britain, said Mike Harris, the chief executive of 89up, a social media marketing company that the parliamentary committee hired to help with its investigation.Mr. Harris, who specializes in political campaigns, discovered the ads recently when one popped up in his social media feed. His company, which has also done work for groups in favor of remaining in the European Union, found more than 70 ads posted over a 10-month period.The group behind the ads appears to be well funded. Based on what comparable political Facebook ad campaigns cost in the country, 89up estimated Mainstream Network spent \u00a3257,000, or about $335,000.

{"Headline": "These Cholesterol-Reducers May Save Lives. So Why Aren\u2019t Heart Patients Getting Them? ", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPowerful PCSK9 inhibitors were supposed to revolutionize care for cardiac patients. But insurers and other payers balked at sky-high prices. Heart disease runs in Mackenzie Ames\u2019s family. Her grandfather had a fatal heart attack at age 30 while dancing with her grandmother at the Elks Lodge in Bath, N.Y. Her mother had a quadruple bypass when she was 42. When Ms. Ames was just 9 years old, her LDL cholesterol level (the bad kind) was 400 mg/dL, about four times higher than it should have been.Diet and exercise did not help. Ms. Ames tried every cholesterol-lowering drug available, but nothing could get her LDL below 100 mg/dL.Her problem is a genetic condition, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (F.H.), that leads to high cholesterol levels and heart attacks at a young age. It affects 1.3 million Americans.\u201cI have followed every rule, and I still can\u2019t get access,\u201d Ms. Ames said. \u201cMy doctor can\u2019t get a straight answer.\u201dLike many similar patients, she has gotten caught in the crossfire of a marketplace battle between insurers, providers of prescription drugs and the makers of these drugs. Drug companies gave the PCSK9 inhibitors exorbitant price tags \u2014 the list figure was as high as $14,600 per year, although payers generally negotiate much lower prices. But insurers balked at the costs and questioned the effectiveness of the new drugs. Access is beginning to ease now, with some unusual new agreements between the manufacturers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers who act as intermediaries. Still, these drugs offer a cautionary tale, even as pharmaceutical manufacturers bring to market costly new treatments for common diseases like migraine, nonalcoholic liver disease and severe dermatitis. And unlike hepatitis C medications, the new cholesterol-lowering drugs would be taken for a lifetime. \u201cThe science behind these drugs is astonishing, but the price is also astonishing,\u201d said Dr. Steven Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States. (It is being acquired by Cigna, the health insurer.)Until recently, there were no studies showing the drugs did anything except lower cholesterol levels, Dr. Miller added. Payers resisted in part because the manufacturers needed to show that PCSK9 inhibitors also prevented heart attacks and strokes and saved lives. And given the expense, doctors needed to show that patients really needed these powerful drugs and not cheaper alternatives. \u201cStatins cost around $250 a year,\u201d Dr. Miller said. Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer at Harvard Pilgrim, which provides health insurance plans, echoed those concerns. \u201cPeople get very angry when their deductibles go up, or when their premium or cost share goes up,\u201d Dr. Sherman said. But the price of expensive drugs \u201cis coming out of somewhere.\u201dThe companies that make the drugs, Amgen and Regeneron, note the list price of drugs is always higher than the price insurers agree to pay. Regeneron, the first to market (in collaboration with Sanofi), set its list price to allow for substantial discounting when its competitor, Amgen, got its drug approved, a spokeswoman said. As for Amgen, whose drug was the second PCSK9 inhibitor to be approved, the drug\u2019s price \u201cwas set to be competitive within a complex health care system,\u201d said Tony Hooper, Amgen\u2019s executive vice president.Both companies say they deplore the subsequent lack of access to their drugs.And while pre-authorization forms for most other drugs require only the doctor\u2019s verification of a patient\u2019s medical history, the PCSK9 inhibitor forms usually required proof, including long medical records that often had to be faxed. Skittish insurers have denied patients without clear reason, or asked for additional data that were unavailable, said Dr. Leslie Cho, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.Some insurers, for example, \u201crequire inordinate testing or documentation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might want to know every statin you ever tried, or force you to try statins that make no sense, like trying simvastatin when you have already tried three other statins.\u201dInsurers had asked for documentation of cholesterol levels when the patient was not taking statins. But many had been taking statins for years and had changed doctors several times in the interim. That kind of documentation could be impossible to find.After a doctor applied for a patient to get the drugs, it could take weeks for insurers to issue a denial, and then the doctor had to resubmit the form to appeal. Some insurers approved a PCSK9 inhibitor for a patient but then cut off the supply after three months, asking for another pre-authorization request. Doctors often say they have neither the time nor the perseverance to try to get the drugs for their patients. Insurers would rather not cover such expensive patients, said Ron Howrigon, a former executive at Kaiser Permanente and other health insurers. Patients who need PCSK9 inhibitors are already at high risk for heart attacks and strokes, he noted, and their care can be expensive. If one insurer puts up enough barriers, patients may switch to another \u2014 and even change jobs \u2014 to get a drug that they believe might be lifesaving, added Mr. Howrigon, who now heads Fulcrum Strategies, a company that advises doctors on running their practices. Regeneron and Sanofi cut the price to Express Scripts. In return, Express Scripts made Praluent the only PCSK9 inhibitor it will provide to patients whose prescriptions it fills. Express Scripts also said it would greatly simplify its pre-authorization forms for the drug. Harvard Pilgrim struck a different deal. Amgen is reducing its price to Harvard Pilgrim \u2014 and will refund the cost of its drug, Repatha, for any patient taking it who goes on to have a heart attack or stroke. In return, Harvard Pilgrim also simplified its pre-authorization forms.Amgen has 20 more deals nearing completion like the one Regeneron and Sanofi made with Express Scripts, and officials claim that access for patients with commercial insurance has improved by 33 percent. Still, many patients and doctors are struggling to lay hands on the drugs. At the Cleveland Clinic, \u201cwe had to hire a couple of people to navigate all the paperwork,\u201d said Dr. Cho. They succeed only with extensive documentation of every lab test, every drug, the patient has had. Even in the best circumstances, Dr. Cho said, \u201cit takes four to six weeks to get an approval.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that there are certain insurance companies and certain groups that require inordinate testing or documentation,\u201d she added. And while her group has had some success with appeals, \u201conce you get denied, it is very hard.\u201dThen there are those patients who finally got the drugs only to see them snatched away.Rodney Scheidel, a 58-year-old Medicaid beneficiary in New Orleans, has diabetes, severe heart disease and an LDL level of 160 mg/dL. With his condition, the figure should be closer to 70 mg/dL. He cannot tolerate statins, said Dr. Keith Ferdinand, a cardiologist at Tulane Medical Center. \u201cHe meets all the criteria\u201d for a PCSK9 inhibitor, Dr. Ferdinand added. He managed to get a PCSK9 inhibitor for Mr. Scheidel. After three months, Medicaid cut him off and asked Dr. Ferdinand to reapply for the drug and to document Mr. Scheidel\u2019s LDL level to show the drug was working. \u201cThat is crazy,\u201d Dr. Ferdinand said. \u201cThere is no medical guideline that I know of that says if you had an effective therapy you would stop it and show again that it works.\u201d Now that Mr. Scheidel has stopped taking his drug, his cholesterol level will rise again, which could be interpreted as showing the drug did not work. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill fight all the way,\u201d Mr. Scheidel said.Dr. Ferdinand had the same reaction.\u201cThey make these decisions completely arbitrarily,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are We Still Teaching Reading the Wrong Way?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTeacher preparation programs continue to ignore the sound science behind how people become readers. Ms. Hanford recently released a radio documentary on science-based teaching.Our children aren\u2019t being taught to read in ways that line up with what scientists have discovered about how people actually learn.It\u2019s a problem that has been hiding in plain sight for decades. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, more than six in 10 fourth graders aren\u2019t proficient readers. It has been this way since testing began. A third of kids can\u2019t read at a basic level.How do we know that a big part of the problem is how children are being taught? Because reading researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics, and they\u2019ve shown over and over that virtually all kids can learn to read \u2014 if they\u2019re taught with approaches that use what scientists have discovered about how the brain does the work of reading. But many teachers don\u2019t know this science.But talk to teachers and many will tell you they learned something different about how children learn to read in their teacher preparation programs. Jennifer Rigney-Carroll, who completed a master\u2019s degree in special education in 2016, told me she was taught that children \u201cread naturally if they have access to books.\u201d Jessica Root, an intervention specialist in Ohio, said she learned \u201cyou want to get\u201d children \u201cexcited about what they\u2019re reading, find books that they\u2019re interested in, and just read, read, read.\u201d Kathy Bast, an elementary school principal in Pennsylvania, learned the same thing. \u201cIt was just: Put literature in front of the kids, teach the story, and the children will learn how to read through exposure,\u201d she said.But they did not give up their core belief that learning to read is a natural process that occurs when parents and teachers expose children to good books. So, while you\u2019re likely to find some phonics lessons in a balanced-literacy classroom, you\u2019re also likely to find a lot of other practices rooted in the idea that children learn to read by reading rather than by direct instruction in the relationship between sounds and letters. For example, teachers will give young children books that contain words with letter patterns the children haven\u2019t yet been taught. You\u2019ll see alphabetical \u201cword walls\u201d that rest on the idea that learning to read is a visual memory process rather than a process of understanding how letters represent sounds. You\u2019ll hear teachers telling kids to guess at words they don\u2019t know based on context and pictures rather than systematically teaching children how to decode. Many teachers learn these approaches in their teacher preparation programs. Publishers perpetuate these ideas, and school districts buy in. But colleges of education \u2014 which should be at the forefront of pushing the best research \u2014 have largely ignored the scientific evidence on reading.There is no excuse for this. Colleges of education have to start requiring that their faculties teach the science of reading. Children\u2019s futures depend on it.Advertisement"}

He added, with awe, \u201cThe guest list is incredible. There are binders filled with pages like this.\u201dHe had incorporated similar historical tidbits into his previous books, like \u201c716 North Palm Drive,\u201d which reprinted a 1934 issue of Motion Picture magazine with interior photos of the house in Beverly Hills, then owned by the actress Adrienne Ames.Mr. Silverman has carved out a novel role as the James Boswell of architecture in Beverly Hills and other exclusive Los Angeles enclaves. His vanity books tell of the Tudor revivals and Spanish colonials that played host to Golden Age movie stars and moguls, house histories written for a limited readership of the famous and wealthy who currently own them. The books are not sold on Amazon or at bookstores, but rather meticulously crafted as bespoke tomes for clients seeking to learn more about the rarefied worlds they inhabit.\u201cThis is so rewarding and fulfills so many of my interests that I felt I couldn\u2019t pass it up,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the country does books like this, certainly not in Los Angeles.\u201dThat first book created the template: Each chapter focuses on a previous homeowner, in chronological order, and is padded with archival photos, old newspaper and magazine clippings and anecdotes, culled from online databases like archive.org, libraries, books, vintage issues of Architectural Digest, public records and firsthand sources like relatives.To learn more about the Selznick estate, Mr. Silverman contacted Daniel Selznick, David O. Selznick\u2019s last surviving child, now 82 and living in the Motion Picture & TV Relief Fund Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. \u201cI picked him up and drove him over there, and as we\u2019re driving, he\u2019s pointing to all these houses: \u2018This person used to live there. Charlie Chaplin lived across the street from them.\u2019 You always hear about these actors and executives, and they\u2019re mythic characters. It becomes real.\u201dThe more history that\u2019s attached to a house, the more famous its owners and houseguests, generally the more involved the project. Mr. Silverman\u2019s magnum opus is \u201cA History of 209 Rockingham Avenue,\u201d which he subtitled \u201cThe House That Shirley Built,\u201d referring to Shirley Temple\u2019s one-time Brentwood home.Mr. Silverman himself tracked down a 1927 aerial photo of Brentwood, interviewed Ms. Temple\u2019s first stand-in and invited her and others to a Shirley-themed house party he organized to celebrate the child star\u2019s life. He can\u2019t resist going down such rabbit holes; indeed, it\u2019s become his calling card.\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent researcher, and I think he gets great pleasure out of it,\u201d said Joyce Rey, a veteran Beverly Hills real estate agent who has hired him.\u201cI had always heard that Liz Taylor had lived there,\u201d Ms. Rey said. \u201cBut David authenticates and enhances the information.\u201dAs for his own home, Mr. Silverman lives with his dog in Brentwood, in a 1950s ranch whose undistinguished history, he said, wouldn\u2019t make for an interesting book. More fertile territory is in the so-called Platinum Triangle, the wealthy enclaves of Bel Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Hills, whose large homes, with their celebrity residents over many decades, suggest stories on every palm-tree-lined block.Mr. Silverman left his sister\u2019s house and took a reporter for a spin around the area. The Selznick estate that Mr. Taschen was restoring was a five-minute drive through windy, lushly manicured streets.He pointed out the second-floor master bedroom, where, he\u2019d learned, on stuffy nights David O. Selznick pushed a button from his bed to open electric windows. A floor below was the projection room, where movies were screened on Sunday nights.Mr. Silverman spoke once again of touring the home with Danny Selznick, who\u2019d grown up there \u2014 a memorable experience for the archivist. \u201cDanny would say, \u2018This is where Cary Grant sat. Dad had his Oscars on this shelf.\u2019 It was just bringing the house to life.\u201dIn his own way, Mr. Silverman hoped to create the same effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dark Cavalcade of New Horror Fiction", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoundupThe strongest emotion we feel is fear, and the strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. I am paraphrasing H. P. Lovecraft, a founding father of American horror, who died in 1937, but this sentiment is very much relevant today. Fear. The gasp as your plane hits turbulence and drops; the creeping sensation as the front door squeaks open in the middle of the night; the shudder when you hear the dentist\u2019s drill buzz \u2014 we all know fear in some form or another. Fear drives us to do things we might never have considered doing, or to become someone we didn\u2019t plan to be. Fear forces us to choose between safety and risk. And this, of course, is the stuff of great fiction. There is much to fear and lots of the unknown in Sarah Perry\u2019s superb literary Gothic novels. \u201cThe Essex Serpent,\u201d published last year, revolved around the existence of a monstrous water snake off the coast of East Anglia. It was a moody and mysterious book, one that felt like a cross between Wilkie Collins and the sensation novelist Mary Elizabeth Braddon, with a little cryptozoology \u2014 the study of undocumented life-forms such as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster \u2014 thrown in.Melmoth walks the earth, a lonely and cursed woman, bearing witness to human suffering. In her long black robes, she appears and disappears throughout history, offering solace at moments of agony: to the heretic about to burn on a pyre of greenwood, to the boy who betrayed a Jewish family to the Nazis, to a woman during a mercy killing in Manila. Melmoth sees all, and wants nothing more than to take the guilty in hand, so that they might wander at her side.There is much to see. Perry has created a Prague that envelops the reader in a bath of sensation. There are hot meals in cafes, good wine poured, music in the air, the thrill of a secret manuscript in the fingers, jackdaws watching from fences. Plot moves concentrically, the stories like rings radiating from a drop of rain. There is no terrible secret or single horrifying deed. We know Melmoth and her intent from the beginning. Terror is not the point, nor is menace, exactly, although the novel offers both. The real horror of this novel is not the ghostly Melmoth at all, but the cruelty we human beings enact upon one another. How we betray and torture. How the innocent are persecuted without mercy. Melmoth, with her piercing gaze, is never far away, and that is scary enough.While reading \u201cMelmoth,\u201d I was reminded of something Jordan Peele, who won an Oscar for his horror screenplay \u201cGet Out,\u201d said about storytelling: \u201cWhen you entertain first, you can get at something socially profound or intellectual much easier.\u201d By the end of \u201cMelmoth,\u201d you are left with a feeling that you have experienced something wholly entertaining, and that you have found humanity and compassion in the process.I am a longtime admirer of Edward Carey\u2019s fiction. I read his first novel, \u201cObservatory Mansions,\u201d when it was published in 2001 and liked it so much I tracked down his phone number and called him in England to tell him I was a fan. Facebook and Twitter have made such elaborate (and expensive) gestures obsolete, but I remain as impressed by his work now as I was then.For some readers of scary novels, \u201cLittle\u201d may be a tad too whimsical. It is decidedly PG-rated. Although there is not a whole lot of white-knuckle terror happening, Marie\u2019s life is nonetheless a grueling fight against adversity. And while it may leave die-hard horror fans wanting more frightening fare, the soft scare may be a good thing for those readers who prefer to read before bed and sleep without nightmares. Datlow writes in her introduction that there are \u201czombies and vampires and serial killers and ghost stories and Lovecraftian horror herein,\u201d but that these conventions of horror writing \u201care not worn out \u2026 as long as writers take a fresh look at them.\u201dAnd they do, bringing readers to very scary places in ways I haven\u2019t experienced before. From escaping the Red Sweat in the south of France in Suzy McKee Charnas\u2019s \u201cLowland Sea\u201d to the surreal \u201cNo Matter Which Way We Turned,\u201d by Brian Evenson, a two-page tale that raises goose bumps like an ice cube on skin, they are little machines of fright that pack a lot of emotion in a few pages.There are excellent stories by old guard terror-ists like Neil Gaiman, Dan Chaon and Peter Straub, but my favorites are by women, a group underrepresented in the traditional horror arena. \u201cBlack and White Sky,\u201d by the masterly Tanith Lee, is a brilliant story of an island-wide attack of magpies that cuts off England, Scotland and Wales from the rest of the world. As in Daphne du Maurier\u2019s novella \u201cThe Birds\u201d (later adapted by Hitchcock into the film of the same title), vicious magpies become so dense that water and crops and sunlight are reduced to nothing. \u201cFeathers drop from the air as well, a thin drizzle of feathers, an autumn of feathers, always falling. Black as ink, white as snow, often sheened mysteriously, mystically blue.\u201d Lee, who wrote over 90 novels and 300 short stories before her death in 2015, could not have foreseen Brexit. And yet, this story speaks more powerfully of the danger of isolationism than any political poll or newspaper I\u2019ve read.Another of my favorites was \u201cBetter You Believe,\u201d by Carole Johnstone, a tightly written story of mountain climbers struggling to descend the south face of Annapurna. A blizzard hits and nature becomes the ruthless slayer that she is, picking off climbers one by one and sending them down into \u201cthe horror of all that silent blue dark.\u201d While the story is about survival, it is also about female rivalry, the sacrifices we make for love and what it really means to come out on top. We know we are in big trouble when Sarah, the narrator, thinks: \u201cBad things are about to happen.\u201d Bad things do happen. I won\u2019t say what. You should read it and find out. As one might expect, throwing a group of people together under such conditions brings out the worst in them. They beat, shoot at, steal from and cheat one another. All the jealousy and anger pushed below the surface of their lives begins \u2014 when the pressure of their situation is applied \u2014 to ooze out over the landscape. It is a sad microcosm of society, you might say, one with all the predictable results.But nothing is quite as predictable as it seems. We soon discover that there is a supernatural mechanism at work, a metaphysical machine that customizes life-changing visions for each person. A black tiger appears to Carina; a chalk-white creature with a \u201cpure gaze\u201d fills Isabelle with sorrow and longing; the Bloodman appears to Donald, driving him mad; an old man appears to Stefan and his son. These characters have all experienced crisis-inducing visions earlier in their lives. But now, these apparitions push them to understand something essential and life-altering about themselves. Such epiphanies render these unsavory characters much more interesting than they were at first glance. It is fun to watch them squirm. Their tendency toward violence, and their deplorable behavior, let me be vicariously violent and deplorable.\u201cI Am Behind You\u201d is pre-eminently readable. The pacing and structure kept me turning the pages. And while I was intrigued by the premise, it was the sheer weirdness of the book, its insistence on subverting expectations at every turn, that made it so good. \u201cI Am Behind You\u201d is my favorite kind of novel \u2014 utterly unclassifiable. It resists genre. While it might be called horror, it is also a suspense novel, a fantasy novel and a character-driven exploration of the state of humanity in our time.Lindqvist has been called the Stephen King of Sweden. I haven\u2019t read his other books, and so I cannot make general claims, but this novel, with its descent into an alternate universe and its insistence that reality can shift onto a weird and metaphysical track, has more in common with Haruki Murakami. And like Murakami, Lindqvist has defined his own style and genre. It\u2019s not horror. It\u2019s Lindqvist.Hurley is a writer\u2019s writer, his descriptions of landscape and character precise and evocative. \u201cThe moors \u2026 appear suddenly, too vast and wide to take in all at once, uncoupling from each ridge the eye comes to and drifting away. The land up there doesn\u2019t roll so much as swell, like a sea frozen in its wildest uproar, full of deep troughs and dooming walls.\u201d The Endlands are a character themselves, one with a gloomy disposition and a tendency to self-medicate.The novel is narrated from John\u2019s perspective. His voice is infused with the cadences of the local dialect, a style that is vibrant and melodic, yet just strange enough to throw me off balance from time to time. Such disorientation served a narrative purpose: I never felt fully comfortable in the novel. I was always left a little on edge, which is a good thing in a scary story.Hurley\u2019s ability to create unease, combined with his unquestionable talent, make \u201cDevil\u2019s Day\u201d a standout horror novel as well as a piece of literary art. There were times, however, when I struggled to keep reading. The pacing was lackadaisical, and I found that Hurley relies too heavily on ambience and dialogue to move his story forward. I wanted more to happen. Scenes in which friends and family talk about events that occurred long ago abound, leaving the reader to reconstruct past drama rather than experience it.

We Paid for Freedom with Our Lives.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMexicans still feel the aftershocks of that year\u2019s political earthquake.Mr. Krauze is a Mexican historian and was part of the student movement.The immediate goals of the movement were modest, among them the removal of a repressive police chiefs and the abolition of a law that punished political dissidence with prison. We students didn\u2019t want to overthrow the government or initiate a new Cuban Revolution. Nor did we envision democracy. We never thought of creating a political party, demanding autonomous electoral institutions or arguing that freedom of the vote be respected. What we really wanted was freedom: freedom to demonstrate, to express ourselves, to criticize power. We gained it, eventually, at a very high cost and, with the passage of time, we contributed indirectly to the arrival of democracy in Mexico. The recent triumph of President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador reaffirms that legacy. For the first time in the history of our country, the left has come to power within a context of electoral freedom and by means of democracy.The principal sources of our rebellion were internal. We were the children of the highly successful economic modernization of the three preceding decades but we were repulsed by the oppressive political system of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, with its faded, empty and self-satisfied rhetoric. We dared to request a public dialogue with the government. In the streets, we shouted \u201cMexico, freedom!\u201d We were festive, irreverent and enthusiastic. There were some 400,000 of us.Perhaps the greatest contribution of \u201968 was in behalf of freedom of expression. Although as president, Mr. Echeverr\u00eda, Mr. D\u00edaz Ordaz\u2019s successor, tried to ingratiate himself with university students through a rhetorical veering to the left, the criticism he kept receiving from the newspaper Exc\u00e9lsior (very much in the spirit of \u201968) exasperated him enough that he maneuvered a coup (in July of \u201976) against its editor, Julio Scherer. Let us hope that he will use that power with moderation, tolerance, a respect for plurality and the will toward dialogue, qualities those previous presidents did not display. And that he fully respects freedom of expression, the most important legacy of the 1968 student movement.Enrique Krauze is a historian, the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of \u201cRedeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America.\u201d This essay was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.Advertisement"}

And the president didn\u2019t like it. Before Sayoc was caught, Trump implied that the terrorism was a Democratic setup to deflect from his midterms roadshow. Pipe bombs getting in the way of pipe dreams.The president has, after all, put a tremendous effort into the sulfurous stew of lies, racially charged rhetoric and scaremongering that he has been serving up as an election closer. He has been inspired to new depths of delusion, tweeting that \u201cRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.\u201dHe has been twinning the words \u201ccaravan\u201d and \u201cKavanaugh\u201d in a mellifluous poem to white male hegemony. Whites should be afraid of the migrant caravan traveling from Central America, especially since \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d were hidden in its midst, an alternative fact that he cheerfully acknowledged was based on nothing.The word \u201cKavanaugh\u201d is meant to evoke the fear that aggrieved women will hurtle out of the past to tear down men from their rightful perches of privilege.Democrats seem blown back by the ferocious \u2014 and often fictional \u2014 effort.You\u2019d think by now that Democrats would have learned to do that in a compassionate way, and that they would be ready to counteract Republican horror movies. It is always the same shameless playbook, replicated since Richard Nixon launched his racist Southern Strategy, stirring up fears on desegregation and busing. They merely reboot it to suit the times.The only difference \u2014 and it is a shocking one \u2014 is that Donald Trump cuts out the middleman. He handles the dirty work himself \u2014 and revels in it. In the old days, presidents let their hatchet men stir up the racist skulduggery behind the scenes. So when Republican lawmakers complain about Trump\u2019s white nationalist rhetoric, what they are really saying is that they prefer a more subtle racism.When I covered the \u201988 race, I watched Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes concoct the scheme to bring down Michael Dukakis by making \u201cWillie Horton his running mate,\u201d as Atwater put it. The ads made by the Bush campaign and outside groups centered on Horton, a black criminal who broke into a Maryland house, raped a white woman and stabbed her husband while on a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison.\u201cThe only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it,\u201d Ailes told Time magazine.During the 2000 South Carolina primary, W.\u2019s backers tried to appeal to racist voters with a whispered lie that John McCain fathered an illegitimate black child.This season of ghouls is animated by the ghost of Roger Ailes, who \u2014 bankrolled by Rupert Murdoch \u2014 was the mastermind behind the hate-breeding technique he perfected on Fox News. It bore poison fruit with the Florida bomb suspect, whose Facebook page was littered with Fox News agitprop.One Fox producer under Ailes said they called it \u201criling up the crazies.\u201d For Ailes and now for his Frankenstein Trump \u2014 who has Ailes\u2019s old lieutenant Bill Shine as his media czar \u2014 it\u2019s all about picking and inventing the right battles, finding the lowest common denominator to boost ratings.In the documentary, those around Ailes marveled at his relentless talent for pouring gas on a fire, for stoking the paranoia and fear that would keep viewers on the hook.Trump\u2019s main training for politics was being a sparring star in the House That Roger Built. And Ailes taught Trump well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Playing the Long Game for the Supreme Court ", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives emerged from the Bork battle bent on winning control. It took 31 years. How will progressives respond?Contributing Opinion Writer It was 31 years ago this week, on Oct. 23, 1987, that the Senate rejected the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. Bork. Thirty-one years and a world ago: eight senators crossed party lines, with six Republicans joining 52 Democrats in voting against confirmation, while two Democrats joined 40 Republicans in supporting President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nominee, one of the country\u2019s best known and most outspoken conservative intellectuals. It was the biggest margin of defeat for any Supreme Court nominee in history.The seat intended for Judge Bork \u2014 the seat that had been occupied for 15 years by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., an appointee of President Richard Nixon and the \u201cswing\u201d justice of his time \u2014 went eventually to Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Kennedy turned out to be the non-Bork, voting to preserve the right to abortion and writing a series of gay-rights rulings that culminated with the 2015 decision that announced a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.We know that now, but we didn\u2019t know it then. The urgent question that emerged from the ashes of Judge Bork\u2019s defeat and that awaited an answer as Justice Kennedy took his seat in February 1988 was: Who won the Bork battle? If Anthony Kennedy turned out to be, as some predicted, \u201cBork lite\u201d or \u201cBork without the bite,\u201d voting as a Justice Bork would have voted, then the answer would be clear. The Reagan conservatives, despite having to tack against the wind of a rising Democratic tide, would have prevailed. The Democrats had retaken the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections, meaning that a fading Reagan administration, weighed down by the Iran-contra scandal, had lost the opportunity for legislative accomplishment. But President Reagan, filling a fourth and final vacancy, would have nonetheless managed to capture the Supreme Court.But if, on the other hand, Justice Kennedy turned out to embrace a constitutional vision notably more inclusive than Judge Bork\u2019s, if he rejected Judge Bork\u2019s doctrinaire originalism, then the scorched-earth Bork battle would be deemed worthwhile and the liberal side would be seen to have prevailed.Indeed, that\u2019s been the triumphalist liberal narrative for a generation. I\u2019ve channeled it myself, writing it more times than I\u2019d like to count about how the Bork confirmation hearing became the equivalent of a national constitutional teach-in that provided the country with a working definition of the constitutional mainstream. By that, I mean the right to women\u2019s reproductive autonomy, a role for the government in taking account of race in order to achieve meaningful equality, an approach to constitutional interpretation that wasn\u2019t shackled to the framers\u2019 original understanding of their 18th-century project. Judge Bork testified about his views for five spellbinding days. That the Senate rejected him despite his abundant professional qualifications had to mean that the public understood those views as outside the mainstream and thus unsuited for the Supreme Court.The organization offered the perfect vehicle for cultivating a new generation of young conservative lawyers to enter the pipeline, serving as law clerks by the side of growing numbers of conservative judges and \u2014 like Justice Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both former Supreme Court law clerks \u2014 becoming judges themselves. Allison Rushing is, naturally, a Federalist Society member. If she is confirmed, and there is no reason to expect otherwise despite a so-so \u201cqualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association, she will be a viable Supreme Court candidate for the next 20 years. And while the Heritage Foundation doesn\u2019t have a presence in the law schools, its boot camp for law clerks is clearly intended to keep the pipeline flowing.In other words, conservatives emerged from the Bork battle determined to win the war. They are succeeding in doing something that progressive are simply bad at: playing the long game. A long game takes a long time \u2014 31 years, in this case \u2014 and requires electoral victories, a necessary but not sufficient condition. Conservatives, once in office, never relaxed their focus on the courts. The Trump administration\u2019s front-loading of judicial nominees is simply a ramping up of an established pattern.I hope that his continued presence in the building, along with the memory of hers, might serve to remind those who work there, and who now hold the Constitution\u2019s future in their hands, of a time when not every decision was foreordained and ideology did not always reign supreme at the Supreme Court.Advertisement"}

Asked whether she planned to vote in the coming midterm elections, Ms. Johnson was ambivalent. She said she doubted that any candidate in either political party would make much of a difference in her life now.\u201cStay-at-home moms in Nebraska who have a limited grocery budget to live off of \u2014 no politician can understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially on a federal level. How could they?\u201dIn interviews with two dozen people who live in a pair of Republican-held swing districts that stretch across 160 miles of the American heartland \u2014 through the urban sprawl of Omaha, past the wind farms and cornfields of western Iowa, and eastward into the Des Moines metropolis \u2014 the spasms of the national news cycle were often back-of-mind distractions, especially among the less partisan women who are crucial to Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning back the House of Representatives.The concerns they described were personal, everyday issues that had only a tenuous attachment to President Trump \u2014 despite the efforts of Republicans, Democrats and the president himself to make the midterm elections a referendum on his popularity.What did come up in conversations: pre-existing conditions, prekindergarten, school safety, inequality, friends blocked on Facebook and the corrosive polarization of politics. What mostly did not: \u201cHorseface,\u201d \u201cPocahontas\u201d or any other denigrating nicknames Mr. Trump has lobbed at women lately; Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh; impeachment; Russia; and a \u201cBlue Wave.\u201dBetsy Rubiner, a Des Moines freelance writer, has been canvassing and making calls to undecided voters every week as a volunteer for Cindy Axne, the Democratic challenger for the Iowa seat held by Representative David Young, a second-term Republican. Ms. Rubiner said Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has scared her into activism. \u201cI feel terror, and that\u2019s not overstating it,\u201d she said.But the lack of engagement she finds from prospective voters on the issues that dominate cable news, she added, has been striking.\u201cAt least the ones I\u2019ve talked to haven\u2019t really talked a lot about Trump,\u201d Ms. Rubiner said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t talked about Kavanaugh. Not that I\u2019m hearing. It\u2019s much more sort of direct impact to them \u2014 their health, their health care, maybe their education if they\u2019ve got younger kids.\u201dHer canvassing partner, Martha Gelhaus, a retired state worker, nodded in agreement. She is still surprised, she said, \u201cby how much people don\u2019t know\u201d about national politics, and described how she doesn\u2019t broach the subject of Mr. Trump as a motivational tool when she talks to potential voters. \u201cI don\u2019t use that,\u201d she insisted.The dynamics in Nebraska\u2019s Second District and Iowa\u2019s Third, just across the Missouri River from each other, are a microcosm of the dueling forces at work in many of the congressional races across the country that will be the hardest for Democrats to flip. They are places where the liberal-heavy urban or suburban cores may not turn out in great enough numbers to outweigh the reliably conservative voters farther out.Still, they remain appealing potential pickup opportunities for the Democrats because of their history of voting for both parties. Nebraska\u2019s Second District went for Mr. Obama in 2008, but not in 2012; Mr. Obama carried Iowa\u2019s Third both times.Both districts feature Republican incumbents facing Democratic women who have the help of a coalition of progressive groups like Emily\u2019s List, Planned Parenthood, Naral and the Human Rights Campaign, which have tried to harness the surge of female activism since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In Iowa, Ms. Axne tends to avoid talking about Mr. Trump. She has tried to keep her focus on expanding access to affordable health care and covering pre-existing conditions, positions that are not as easy for her opponent to attack as radical and socialist.Ms. Eastman\u2019s place in the insurgent liberal wing of the party \u2014 she won a primary against the centrist former congressman who had represented the district until 2017 \u2014 has made her the target of those very kinds of attacks. Republican ads airing in heavy rotation in Omaha label her \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cextreme.\u201dMs. Eastman has said she does not identify as a democratic socialist. In an interview, she said she opposed impeachment for Mr. Trump and did not look down on Trump supporters, who include her in-laws.Still, she said that the president had enabled \u201canti-American movements\u201d to thrive and that he was acting in a way \u201cwe know, from history, dictators do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always tried to make this race about Iowans,\u201d she said. \u201cSo talking about the president really isn\u2019t a key part of that.\u201dBoth Republican incumbents have managed the delicate balancing act of criticizing the president\u2019s style while praising him on substance, with little apparent damage to their reputations among the Trump faithful. \u201cHey, I wish the president was a little more Iowa than New York,\u201d Mr. Young said at a recent campaign stop.Mr. Bacon has said he thinks Mr. Trump \u201ccould raise the bar\u201d with his behavior. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked much about the mob,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s portrayal of the Democrats as angry and unhinged.Lauralee Grabe, a retired librarian who lives in Mr. Bacon\u2019s district and plans to vote for him, said she did not blame the insult-slinging president for the breakdown in civility. Democrats, she insisted, are the ones \u201ctelling people to harass people in restaurants.\u201d\u201cThat really upsets me,\u201d she said as she stood in the doorway of her home after two canvassers handed her a large door-hanger flier that described Ms. Eastman as \u201ctoo extreme for Nebraska.\u201dAs an aside, Ms. Grabe said that she realized \u201cTrump can say some outrageous things.\u201dAt the Omaha Chick-fil-A, Ms. Johnson sat with two friends \u2014 another independent-leaning woman like her who said she was disillusioned with both political parties, and a self-described democratic socialist who planned to vote for Ms. Eastman. Ms. Johnson described being hyperaware of the politics around her but not inspired enough by anyone in either party to get more engaged.She said that she is socially liberal and that the thought of being seen in an establishment like Chick-fil-A, with its socially conservative management, \u201cmakes me want to hide my face.\u201dBut she also criticized the Democrats over the way they handled the Supreme Court confirmation hearings, saying they had used the woman who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault \u201cas a tool.\u2019\u2019Ms. Johnson weighed the value of voting in the midterms, asking whether it was just part of an endless cycle of disappointment with both political parties. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that a cop-out?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m my own worst devil\u2019s advocate.\u201d Still, she seemed unlikely to vote.Democrats always understood that mobilizing women would be essential to retaking the swing districts that could give them a majority in the House. And, as voters in Iowa and Nebraska make clear, no single approach will work.Rachel Hadaway, a software tester in Des Moines, stopped by a state Democratic Party event the other night with a specific purpose: to gather information she could use to persuade unmotivated friends to vote for Ms. Axne.As she listened to the speakers, Ms. Hadaway jotted down the things she liked about Ms. Axne that she hoped would be persuasive. Ms. Axne supports a fairer tax code, Ms. Hadaway noted, and has vowed not take corporate donations.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people, they have other things going on,\u201d she said, explaining why many people she knows are not enthusiastic about voting. Her message to her friends, however, might not be one that thrills most Democrats.\u201cI\u2019m not even saying vote Democratic,\u201d Ms. Hadaway said. \u201cJust vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Killing Aftermath Bares Jewish Rifts in Israel and America", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Saturday\u2019s massacre also brought to the surface painful political and theological disagreements tearing at the fabric of Israeli society and driving a wedge between Israelis and American Jews.Israel\u2019s Ashkenazi chief rabbi took pains to avoid the word \u201csynagogue\u201d to describe the scene of the crime \u2014 because it is not Orthodox, but Conservative, one of the liberal branches of Judaism that, despite their numerous adherents in the United States, are rejected by the religious authorities who determine the Jewish state\u2019s definitions of Jewishness.And the attacker\u2019s anti-refugee, anti-Muslim fulminations on social media prompted some on the Israeli left \u2014 like many American Jewish liberals \u2014 to draw angry comparisons to views espoused by the increasingly nationalistic leaders who now hold sway in their governments.The result has been a striking and lightning-fast politicization of the sort of tragedy that until now had only galvanized Jews across the world \u2014 not set them at one another\u2019s throats.Here in Israel, the decades-old animosity between left and right has reached new levels of enmity in recent years. Ultra-Orthodox parties that play a kingmaker\u2019s role in the right-wing government are pressing to increase their influence and that of Jewish law on daily life, sparking bitter fights over everything from who serves in the military to whether trains can run and stores can open on the Sabbath. Jews from liberal American denominations feel increasingly alienated from Israel\u2019s state-run religious life.With the Israeli government, like many across Europe, also taking a decidedly nationalistic turn, the election of President Trump has only compounded that strife, widening the rift between Israeli and American Jews. Politically liberal American Jews have been repelled by Mr. Trump\u2019s solid support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s effusive embrace of Mr. Trump and his granting of a wish-list\u2019s worth of political gifts. They range from scrapping the Iran nuclear agreement to repeatedly punishing the Palestinians and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.All of that, and more, bubbled up when one of Israel\u2019s most influential politicians, Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, jumped on a plane to Pittsburgh in his capacity as minister of diaspora affairs. Mr. Bennett gave voice only to unifying ideals: \u201cTogether we stand, Americans, Israelis \u2014 people who are, together, saying no to hatred,\u201d he told a vigil there Sunday night. \u201cThe murderer\u2019s bullet does not stop to ask, \u2018Are you Conservative or Reform, are you Orthodox? Are you right-wing or left-wing?\u2019 It has one goal, and that is to kill innocent people. Innocent Jews.\u201dOthers cited a pro-Jewish Home party text message sent to Haifa residents in advance of Tuesday\u2019s municipal elections. It warned Jewish voters fearful of \u201cthe flight of young Jews\u201d and a \u201ctakeover\u201d by \u201cthe sector\u201d\u2014 shorthand for Israeli Arabs \u2014 to vote for the Jewish Home slate.Even Michael Oren, the American-born deputy minister from the right-of-center Kulanu party, faulted Mr. Bennett for having sided with the ultra-Orthodox Israeli rabbinate, which refuses to recognize non-Orthodox denominations as sufficiently Jewish to participate fully in Israeli religious life.\u201cDid we or did we not say that the Left is guilty of encouraging anti-Semitism?,\u201d wrote the email\u2019s author, who responded to queries but declined to identify himself.Many Israelis, of course, reacted with horror and grief as they tuned into coverage of the Pittsburgh massacre. In Beit Shemesh, a largely ultra-Orthodox city 20 minutes west of Jerusalem, Elisheva Gutman, 24, a social worker, said her parents had vacationed in Pittsburgh two weeks earlier and had attended Sabbath services down the street from the Tree of Life synagogue, the killing site. \u201cWhen they go to Europe, my father takes off his kipa and puts on a hat,\u201d for fear of attack, Ms. Gutman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be that way in the U.S.\u201dIf other Israelis were quick to score political points over the Pittsburgh killings, though, in a sense they had been preparing for this moment. The disagreements between American and Israeli Jews have been piling up.Only last week, the Jewish Federations of North America\u2019s yearly General Assembly drew hundreds of Americans to Tel Aviv for a three-day conference focused on the strains in the relationship, titled \u201cWe Need to Talk.\u201dFor Israelis, Ms. Azrieli said, Americans don\u2019t serve in the Israeli army, pay Israeli taxes or live under the threat of rockets, but also don\u2019t let those realities stop them from trying to impose their views on Israelis.And Israelis on the right would add their lingering resentment of American Jews\u2019 support for the Iran nuclear deal struck by President Obama, which Israelis saw as a matter of survival, according to the author Yossi Klein Halevi, a New York-born Jerusalemite.Mr. Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, said the Pittsburgh shootings had exposed an even deeper and more worrisome divide between the two populations. \u201cEach sees the other as in some sense threatening its most basic well-being,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Jews don\u2019t understand the depth of the Israeli sense of betrayal over the Iran deal. And Israelis don\u2019t understand why American Jews regard Trump as a life-and-death threat to the liberal society that allowed American Jewry to become the most successful minority in Jewish history.\u201dHow damaged is the relationship? In her keynote, Ms. Azrieli felt compelled to plead, \u201cDon\u2019t give up on our country,\u201d adding: \u201cDon\u2019t walk away because your liberal sensibilities are insulted. Don\u2019t assume that nothing can change. Things do change \u2014 just painfully, slowly, incrementally, and with all of our help.\u201dAnd yet among Israeli leaders, some already have given up on American Jews, said Mr. Oren, the deputy minister and a former Israeli ambassador in Washington, who also cited some American Jews\u2019 opposition to President Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201cOne school of thought is: \u2018These are our people, we have to do everything possible to reach out.\u2019 The second school says:, \u2018It\u2019s too late, they\u2019re gone. After Iran, after Jerusalem, if we have limited resources we should invest in our base \u2014 evangelicals and the Orthodox.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe first school, which is mine, is a beleaguered school,\u201d Mr. Oren said. \u201cThe burden of doubt is on us; we have to prove that we\u2019re still correct. It\u2019s not easy.\u201dIn Beit Shemesh, Zion Cohen, 66, a mall manager, lamented the acrimony. \u201cI\u2019m Likud, but what\u2019s happened between Israel and America, I\u2019m against it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s painful to Jews in America how Israel acts toward them. The influence of the Orthodox and Haredim on the Israeli government is a catastrophe. And we need help from the Jews of the U.S., especially given how much anti-Semitism there is now in the world.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to unite the whole Jewish people.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a man shown standing in front of a mall in Beit Shemesh. He is Eli Peretz, not Teretz. The article also misidentified who avoided using the word \u201csynagogue\u201d to describe the scene of the crime. It was Israel\u2019s Ashkenazi chief rabbi, not its Sephardic chief rabbi.Advertisement"}

There were no incidents reported there, the police said.Finbarr Slonim, 20, of Manhattan and Kai Russo, 20, of Brooklyn were each charged with robbery and assault. Caleb Perkins, 35, of Manhattan was charged with robbery, assault and resisting arrest, the police said.Officials said they could not confirm whether those arrested were associated with a particular group.

Lancman, a councilman from Queens who is the chairman of the Council\u2019s committee on the justice system, said that video showing who he believes to be members of the Proud Boys beating someone should result in additional arrests.\u201cHow could we not arrest and prosecute white supremacists committing hate crimes in Manhattan?\u201d Mr. Lancman asked in an interview. \u201cThe police rolled up and didn\u2019t arrest anyone.\u201dAnd Gov.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Military-Industrial Base Is at Risk", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd here\u2019s what the White House is going to do about it. Mr. Navarro is assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy.President Trump\u2019s maxim that \u201ceconomic security is national security\u201d comes with an important corollary: A strong manufacturing base is critical to both economic prosperity and national defense.Policies advanced by the administration under this banner include corporate tax cuts and a wave of deregulation to stimulate investment and spur innovation; steel and aluminum tariffs to bolster core industries; a stout defense against China\u2019s brazen theft and forced transfers of American intellectual property and technologies; a significant increase in the military budget; expansion of Buy American rules for government procurement; and tough steps on trade to level the playing field for American workers, businesses and farmers.To this long list of measures to improve America\u2019s economic and national security, we should now add the actions recommended in a new Department of Defense report. This yearlong effort, carried out at the president\u2019s order, constitutes the first governmentwide assessment of America\u2019s manufacturing and military industrial base. It identifies almost 300 vulnerabilities, ranging from dependencies on foreign manufacturers to looming labor shortages.For example, the report highlights several \u201csingle points of failure\u201d involving the reliance on a single source of critical equipment or material, including propeller shafts for our ships, gun turrets for our tanks, fuel for our rockets and space-based infrared detectors for missile defense. A military-grade impregnated carbon product used in 72 different chemical, biological and nuclear filtration systems has only a single Defense Department-qualified source, and this current sourcing arrangement can\u2019t keep pace with demand.Or consider wrought aluminum plate \u2014 an essential component in armoring ground combat vehicles, constructing Navy ships and building military aircraft. According to the report, budget uncertainties, unpredictable demand from the Defense Department and the effects of foreign competition raise the risk of potential \u201cproduction bottlenecks during a future surge in D.O.D. requirements\u201d for the material. More broadly, \u201csharp peaks\u201d followed by \u201csignificant breaks or valleys in production\u201d have taken a heavy toll on the shipbuilding industry, a sector critical to constructing and maintaining our aircraft carriers, submarines and surface ships.A core threat to the American industrial base comes from China. According to the report, \u201cChina represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials deemed strategic and critical to U.S. national security,\u201d including a \u201cgrowing number of both widely used and specialized metals, alloys and other materials, including rare earths and permanent magnets.\u201dThe American military is also heavily dependent on foreign suppliers in such critical areas as printed circuit boards, machine tools, materials for propulsion systems and even nuclear warheads. As the report notes: \u201cBecause the supply chain is globalized and complex, it is challenging to ensure that finished assemblies, subsystems, and systems\u201d for nuclear warheads utilize \u201ctrusted, discrete components due to diminishing U.S.-based microelectronic and electronic manufacturing capability.\u201dEven the lowly, but increasingly high-tech, tent is at risk. With much of the American textile industry moving offshore, the United States no longer has the capability to manufacture high-tenacity polyester fiber. A similar problem exists for rechargeable batteries, which are vital parts across myriad applications.One of the biggest vulnerabilities identified in the report is a shortage of skilled labor for critical jobs. America is simply not generating enough workers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields to fill jobs in sectors such as electronic controls, nuclear engineering and space. Nor are we training enough machinists, welders and other skilled trade workers to build and maintain our ships, combat vehicles and aircraft.To address these vulnerabilities, the Trump administration will immediately begin implementing the report\u2019s \u201cblueprint for action.\u201d It will rapidly expand the use of already available Defense Department funds to close identified supply-chain gaps. Starting fast out of the gate, the president will sign determinations authorizing the use of funds, set aside in Title III of the Defense Production Act, to expand manufacturing capabilities in such areas as lithium seawater batteries (critical for anti-submarine warfare) and cutting-edge fuel cells (for the Navy\u2019s future unmanned, underwater vehicles).The Pentagon\u2019s National Defense Stockpile Program, created in 1939 to secure adequate supplies of foreign-produced and limited-source strategic and critical materials, will likewise shift into high gear to help build up reserves in key areas. The broader goal, as the report makes clear, is to \u201cdiversify away from complete dependency on sources of supply in politically unstable countries who may cut off U.S. access.\u201dAs part of the governmentwide effort, the president is also directing the secretary of labor to more precisely target occupations for current and future growth (e.g., systems engineers, high-skilled tool operators), expand worker training and education programs, and ensure appropriate incentives to recruit and retain workers. The secretary of energy is similarly charged with more aggressively addressing risks to the nation\u2019s manufacturing and industrial base within the energy and nuclear sectors, using funding that will become available in 2019.America has elected a president in the mold of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan \u2014 presidents best remembered for short but profound maxims that directed their boldest strategies and biggest successes.McKinley\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cPatriotism, protection and prosperity\u201d led to strong tariffs and sound money policies that realigned the Republican Party and catalyzed strong economic growth. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cSpeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d helped transform the Navy into a military force capable of projecting power around the world. And Reagan\u2019s \u201cPeace through strength\u201d inspired an unprecedented rebuilding of the military that brought the Soviet Union to its knees.History will judge whether Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cEconomic security is national security\u201d joins the ranks of great presidential maxims. The recommendations made in the Defense Department\u2019s report will surely be a part of that discussion.Peter Navarro is assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy and director of the National Trade Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dale Earnhardt Jr.: Bringing Concussions Out of the Darkness", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "OpinionI used to hide my suffering. But I\u2019ve learned that brain injuries don\u2019t have to be permanent. Supported byMr. Earnhardt is a former Nascar driver.During my two decades behind the wheel as a full-time Nascar driver, I suffered more than a dozen concussions. For a long time, I managed to keep most of them a secret, but then my symptoms got too severe to keep up the charade and I was forced to get help. My battle with head injuries has given me a wealth of firsthand knowledge of the causes, symptoms, and types of concussions, and their treatments.In 1998, at the Daytona 300, my Chevy was tossed into the air and slammed down so hard on its nose that my helmet dented the steel roll cage. Later that week when I was working inside a car at the shop, I suddenly felt the car rolling. I sat up and realized it hadn\u2019t moved an inch. I\u2019d eventually find out my vestibular system \u2014 the communication lines between the brain, inner ear and body \u2014 had been damaged. I persisted because it\u2019s what racecar drivers are supposed to do. You tough it out. I also believed then what so many still do now: that a concussion is permanent. I worried if I revealed how I really felt, my peers on the racetrack would see me as damaged goods.However, I am sure that there is a middle ground, that we can encourage our kids both to be active and competitive \u2014 and to be safe. Research shows that concussion risks can be reduced by playing smarter and using the proper equipment.When concussions do occur, it\u2019s important to remember that brain injuries can be treated and healed like any other athletic injury \u2014 but only if the proper steps are taken, the right doctors are reached and the prescribed treatment is followed through to the end.That treatment is not easy. I\u2019d never been a gym guy, but I learned how to become one. My rehabilitation in 2016 was the hardest I have ever worked. I wasn\u2019t told to sit in a dark room, the stereotypical treatment for concussion. That\u2019s not how it works anymore. Instead, I was pushed mentally and physically through fine motor skill tuning, exhausting computer-based eye tests, and a lot of old-fashioned cardio. After months of work I could feel my brain, eyes, ears and body communicating properly again.I also felt my life returning. The constant, dull feeling of fear lifted. I was smiling again. Now, I tell my story to let people know they don\u2019t have to silently walk it off. I tell it to my racing friends who confess they\u2019ve also been suffering in secret and to many others who\u2019ve never raced a lap. I\u2019ve given out the phone number to my doctor, Micky Collins at the University of Pittsburgh, more times than I can count in the past few years. And when those people reconnect later to tell me that Micky and his team have given them their lives back, it feels like winning a race. The advancements in brain science since my first major injury in 2012 are incredible. But all that science won\u2019t mean much if those of us who are hurting don\u2019t come out of hiding and allow it to be put to use.I don\u2019t blame my sport for my suffering. Neither do the other professional athletes I know who love their sport every bit as much as I love mine. And people hurt on the job performing other tasks are likely just as passionate about what they do.I will always wonder how many more races I could have won or how much longer I could have raced if not for my stubbornness.Don\u2019t make the mistakes I made. Help is out there. You just have to ask.Dale Earnhardt Jr. is a television analyst for NBC Sports and former Nascar driver. Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Cecilia Kang, The Times\u2019s technology policy reporter covering tech\u2019s reckoning and other policy issues that fall at the intersection of tech and government.This past week, the nation\u2019s capital was quiet as many lawmakers were back in their districts campaigning for the midterm elections. And the biggest stories for tech were overseas, with the technology industry\u2019s response to claims of Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the possible killing of a dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.Mr. Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber and an Iranian-American, told the conference\u2019s sponsor in a phone call that the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi were \u201cterrible,\u201d and that he would not go to Riyadh unless the questions about the journalist\u2019s fate were cleared up, according to two people briefed on the conversation.But Uber is not alone.

{"Headline": "How Do I Explain Justice Kavanaugh to My Daughters?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe spectacle of this confirmation has reminded us that to many people, women\u2019s suffering is a joke.Contributing Opinion WriterBefore he entered politics, President Trump was a fan of a different sort of spectacle: professional wrestling.That was what Monday night\u2019s prime-time swearing-in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court felt like. From the standing ovations to President Trump\u2019s apology to Justice Kavanaugh and his family \u201cfor the terrible pain\u201d they had been forced to endure, it wasn\u2019t just a victory lap, it was a body slam, a way to add insult to the injury that the hearings had already done to so many survivors of sexual harassment and violence.With his wife and young daughters in the audience, Justice Kavanaugh made all the correct, conciliatory noises. Gone was the red-faced, furious man of late September, with his claims about dark money and Clinton-funded plots; gone was the man who alternately wept and roared and looked as if he was trying to pass a kidney stone of compressed rage. In his place was a judge promising to be an umpire, not a partisan. But for all of his talk about how he was \u201cnot appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation,\u201d what was unsaid came through the loudest. You could see it, scrolling by in real time if you, like me, were watching the comments on Fox.com. \u201cKavanaugh is a stud for wading through this hailstorm,\u201d said one representative sample. And beer emojis.So many beer emojis.Clearly, that did not happen. Emotional women, loud women, angry women get ignored. Emotional, loud, angry men get to sit on the Supreme Court. They rise ever higher, borne aloft on gusts of male laughter. The spectacle of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing reminded us that, for so many conservative men, and the women who support them, women\u2019s suffering is still a joke.What am I supposed to tell my daughters about all of this?Our girls will learn to police their clothes, their words, their drinking, their behavior, their choices, because they\u2019ve been watching, and what they\u2019ve seen is this: If you get hurt, it\u2019s probably your fault, and if you tell, probably no one will believe you, and even if people do, probably nothing will happen.It\u2019s the old Ginger Rogers chestnut: To get where men get, to be believed as men are believed, women have to do what men do, only backward, and in heels. Our behavior must be impeccable; our manner, above reproach; our back stories, pure inspiration; our histories, spotlessly clean.That was all I could think of on Friday night at Princeton, when I sat, surrounded by some 3,000 alumnae, listening to the Princeton graduates Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor describe their paths to the highest court in the land. Justice Sotomayor was a first-generation college student. While Justice Kavanaugh and his buddies were preparing for their beach-week bacchanal, Justice Sotomayor and her mother were at \u201cAlexander\u2019s \u2014 which, if you know, is a little below Macy's,\u201d buying a raincoat that she could take to Princeton, to the admiration of the clerks, she said.Neither woman\u2019s high school yearbook featured jokes about drinking and mockery of the opposite sex. Neither woman had to offer clumsy, laughably dishonest definitions of \u201cboofing\u201d and \u201cdevil\u2019s triangle\u201d to the Senate, and the American people.Neither woman joined a hard-partying Greek organization in college. Both graduated Princeton with highest honors, both, they laughingly admitted, a little notorious, not because of any bad behavior, but because of the extra-long senior thesis that each of them wrote.Of course, neither woman\u2019s nomination could have survived a sliver of the scandal of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s high school behavior, or a hint of the emotion that he displayed. Imagine if Brett was Bette. Imagining a female judge, red-faced and railing about how the Senate was on a \u201cseek and destroy\u201d mission. She would have been a punch line, a cautionary tale, a joke.\u201cIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,\u201d Dr. Blasey said when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her strongest memory from when she was sexually assaulted in the summer of 1982. Right now, what\u2019s seared into my memory is the uproarious amusement of the men and women in the audience at President Trump\u2019s rally last week in Mississippi, when he tore into Dr. Blasey, a moment that political analysts say pushed Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination over the top.Laughter is President Trump\u2019s weapon of choice. Mockery is his go-to, especially where women are concerned, and other Republicans have learned well from him. They know the names to call us \u2014 clowns. A mob. Angry. They know how to claim that they\u2019re the real victims \u2014 harassed at their homes! Hounded out of restaurants! They know how to do what it takes to win, and, when they do, they don\u2019t just claim victory, they humiliate their vanquished foes.For so many women, these past weeks have been agony, the doubled dismay of having been hurt, then having been mocked; our pain disbelieved and drowned out by their laughter. The world my daughters, and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s, will inherit is the world we inhabit now, where men get excused, and women get interrogated: How much did you drink? Who drove you to the party, and where was the room where it happened and who drove you home when it was over?What will I tell my daughters?Speak up, even if those in power do not want to listen. Speak your truth, even if men laugh. Be loud, even though power prefers girls quiet. Speak up, even if they call you strident or shrill. Don\u2019t let anyone put a hand \u2014 real or metaphorical \u2014 over your mouth. March, demonstrate, chant, shout, vote. And maybe someday, you, or your daughters, or your daughter\u2019s daughters will be the ones with the last laugh.Jennifer Weiner is the author, most recently, of the memoir \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described where Justice Sonia Sotomayor went to school.

{"Headline": "Living in a Van Plastered With Hate, Bombing Suspect Was Filled With Right-Wing Rage", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAVENTURA, Fla. \u2014 On Twitter, Cesar Sayoc Jr. lashed out at immigrants, gun control advocates, and prominent Democratic politicians. On Facebook, he misspelled a racial epithet, directing it at the likes of Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama.With fury in his fingers, he shared inflammatory news stories from Breitbart, hard-edge videos from Fox News, and angry posts from pages like \u201cHandcuffs for Hillary.\u201d He tweeted a threat to former Vice President Joe Biden. And he posted photographs of himself wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat at one of President Trump\u2019s campaign rallies.After a frenzied nationwide search for the person who sent 13 makeshift bombs to some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent critics, Mr. Sayoc, 56, was arrested Friday morning in Plantation, Fla., at an AutoZone car parts shop. Authorities released a photograph of a man with a buzz cut and a mouth that drooped toward a frown. They hauled away a white van plastered with bombastic stickers expressing support for Mr. Trump and animosity toward those who clashed with him.\u201cDishonest Media,\u201d read one on the van\u2019s back right window. \u201cCNN Sucks.\u201d Cross hairs appeared on a photograph of one of the liberal commentators at the network, which received more than one package from Mr. Sayoc at its offices in New York.Records show he was a registered Republican; friends said he once danced as a male stripper. He also had a lengthy criminal history \u2014 he was once accused of threatening to use a bomb against a customer service representative \u2014 and led a life filled with failure. Well into middle age, he was living with his mother with no furniture, according to 2012 bankruptcy records, and he appeared to have been living most recently out of his van.Federal officials said Friday they were still exploring questions of motive. \u201cHe appears to be a partisan,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at an afternoon news conference announcing Mr. Sayoc\u2019s arrest, \u201cbut that will be determined by the facts as the case goes forward.\u201dAnd so, even as the details of a grim and bitter life began to emerge Friday, a shaken country was left to ponder what could have prompted someone full of political grievances to manufacture a slew of improvised explosive devices.Some of the packages falsely listed as a sender Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat. On Friday, Ms. Schultz spoke, with a shaking voice, for the first time about the ordeal.\u201cNo matter what your political persuasion, we need to turn the volume down,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply disturbing. I just can\u2019t imagine that anyone would do this.\u201dOn Monday, law enforcement officials discovered the first package linked to Mr. Sayoc at a private home outside New York City that belongs to George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist. Days later, Mr. Sayoc would post tweets that targeted Mr. Soros and others, according to the criminal complaint.Mr. Sayoc\u2019s posts on various social media accounts in 2015 showed an obsession with workouts and night life promotion, with little to no political content. But his more recent posts are full of political rage. His Facebook account, widely pored over after media reports of his arrest, suddenly disappeared on Friday.\u201cWe have found and immediately removed the suspect\u2019s accounts on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe will also continue to remove content that praises or supports the bombing attempt or the suspect as soon as we\u2019re aware.\u201dMuch remains opaque about Mr. Sayoc. Some of his social media posts seemed to suggest he was part of the Seminole tribe in Florida. But Lenny Altieri, a relative, said that Mr. Sayoc\u2019s father was from the Philippines and his mother was from Brooklyn. He was raised by grandparents after having problems with his mother, Mr. Altieri said.Mr. Sayoc had short stints in college as a young man, and had a passion for soccer, reflected in numerous soccer-themed messages on the van. He attended Brevard College, a small, Methodist-affiliated liberal arts college in Western North Carolina, for a year beginning in the fall of 1980 and played on the soccer team but did not graduate, according to a spokeswoman. He also attended University of North Carolina at Charlotte for one year starting in 1983, an official there said.Back in Florida, Mr. Altieri said, Mr. Sayoc was obsessed with bodybuilding and worked as a male stripper. He also worked as a manager for traveling \u201cmale revue shows,\u201d said Rachel Humberger, the wife of one of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s business partners.Ms. Humberger said that Mr. Sayoc seemed like a friendly man, based on the short interactions she had with him, and described the shows as \u201cMagic Mike style,\u201d a reference to a 2012 movie about male strippers, \u201cMagic Mike.\u201dMore recently, she said Mr. Sayoc had been talking to her husband about starting a new business: fish farms.Mr. Altieri said that Mr. Sayoc at one point had \u201ca lot of money, but lost most of it.\u201d He did not elaborate on how Mr. Sayoc had acquired it.Mr. Sayoc amassed a lengthy criminal record, dating back to 1991, which includes felony theft, drug charges and fraud, public records show.In August 2002, Mr. Sayoc, in a dispute with a power company over a bill, was accused of threatening to blow up the company. Mr. Sayoc was on the phone with the customer service representative and \u201cwas upset over an amount that he was being billed for,\u201d according to records released by the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office. He \u201cthen stated that he didn\u2019t deserve it and that he was going to blow up\u201d the utility.The customer service representative pressed an emergency button, which began recording the conversation. Mr. Sayoc stated that what he planned would be worse \u201cthan 9/11\u201d and that he planned to blow the agent\u2019s head off, according to the records.When the agent said Mr. Sayoc did not want to be making such threats, prosecutors said he had replied \u201cthat he doesn\u2019t make threats, he makes promises.\u201d Mr. Sayoc later described his remarks as nothing more than a joke.In June 2012, Mr. Sayoc filed for personal bankruptcy, listing assets of $4,175 and liabilities of $21,109.\u201cLives w/mom,\u201d a handwritten note on the petition said. \u201cHas no furniture.\u201dA later place of residence was the white van, which he often parked outside an aging strip mall in Aventura, Fla., that houses an LA Fitness, a Jewish market, a bakery and a post office.Manuel Prado, a 56-year-old hairdresser in a salon at the mall, Shoppes at the Waterways, said he had seen Mr. Sayoc for the past several years living in the white van with distinctive stickers.\u201cI knew right away it was him when I saw the pictures of the van today in the news,\u201d Mr. Prado said Friday afternoon. \u201cThat van was his home. It was really smelly when he had the door open and you walked by. It was horrible. He might drive off and run an errand or something, but every morning that van was there in the parking lot.\u201dMr. Prado, a hairdresser for 17 years, said he also saw Mr. Sayoc frequently at LA Fitness, a large club immediately west of the shopping mall. \u201cHe would pretend to exercise \u2014 I think he just went there to take showers,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cHe\u2019d sometimes use a bicycle in the gym. I assume he was a member because they\u2019re very strict about that.\u201dAsked whether he had ever spoken with Mr. Sayoc, Mr. Prado said: \u201cHe was very antisocial. He was a loner. I say hello to everyone here and he would never acknowledge anyone.\u201dPatricia Mazzei and Nick Madigan reported from Aventura, Fla., and Frances Robles from Miami.

{"Headline": "Machiavelli Would Have Loved This Year\u2019s Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump may not be on the ballot, but he will be on everyone\u2019s mind.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The stakes \u2014 already sky-high \u2014 for both the Trump administration and the Democratic Party in the coming congressional elections have been raised even higher by the struggle over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.Not only will the outcome be interpreted as a renunciation or vindication of the Trump presidency, it will also determine whether Democrats have recouped since the 2016 disaster and where the balance of power within the Republican Party lies.And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.The November election will also determine whether the regulatory decisions of executive branch agencies, especially the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, are subject to critical review.What financial ties exist between Trump and Russian oligarchs? Is the Trump family susceptible to bribery or blackmail? What are Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest as he offers new proposals on taxes and foreign policy? The American people deserve answers and Congress must follow the money. No longer can congressional Republicans reject transparency in order to politically protect the president.To date, Trump and his cabinet appointees have been able to operate without fear of review or oversight by a compliant Republican House and Republican Senate.Control of the House committees would empower the Democrats to focus public attention on both cabinet-level scandals and unpopular administration decisions that have been displaced from front-page coverage and evening newscasts by Trump\u2019s incessant controversies.Committee Democrats plan to put a spotlight on one cabinet member who has largely, though not completely, avoided the spotlight:The Republican majority has ignored the fact that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is the most ethically challenged member of the Trump administration \u2014 they haven\u2019t held any oversight hearings on his tenure, which has featured more than a dozen formal investigations by the DOI inspector general, the Office of Special Counsel and other watchdog agencies.Long-term political trends and the public\u2019s reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s surreal presidency are converging to make the 2018 midterm elections the most sweeping and divisive national referendum on any administration at least since the Great Depression.Of the political analysts I contacted, Jacobson was the most emphatic in his view that the coming election is of momentous significance.In an email he said, Voters will decide between two starkly different futures \u2014 that envisioned by Trump and his white nationalist and religious conservative allies and another that is best typified by Obama\u2019s legislative and regulatory legacy.In the paper he gave in Boston, Jacobson wrote:If the Democrats win control of the House, it will be read, accurately, as a clear repudiation of Trump\u2019s presidency, for they can only do so by winning a large enough majority of votes cast nationwide to overcome the Republicans\u2019 formidable structural advantage. It will put Democrats in a position to challenge, check, and investigate the Trump administration for at least the next two years, precipitating disputes between Congress and the White House at least as fierce as during the Obama presidency after 2010.Conversely, if Republicans retain their majorities, it will, in Jacobson\u2019s view, \u201cconfirm once and for all that the Republican Party is now Trump\u2019s party\u201d and congressional Republicans \u201cwill continue to ignore, downplay, or excuse behavior that by a Democratic president would provoke torrents of outrage and demands for impeachment.\u201dTrump in fact agrees with Jacobson on the significance of the election.A lot of what we\u2019ve done, some people could say, all of what we\u2019ve done, is at stake in November. Always fragile. We are just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetimes. This is one of the big, big \u2014 in other words, that\u2019s true, I\u2019m not running but I\u2019m really running.And what about \u201cthis horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats?\u201d They \u201care determined,\u201d Trump continued, to take back power by using any means necessary. You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don\u2019t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control. That\u2019s what they want is power and control, we\u2019re not going to give it to them.On Wednesday night, Trump, after mocking Blasey Ford at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, doubled down on the idea that the Kavanaugh nomination was a political winner:Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Look at the Energy, look at the Polls. Something very big is happening. He is a fine man and great intellect. The country is with him all the way!There are some intriguing twists.Frances Lee, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, argues that from a political rather than policymaking point of view, 2018 is more important than any election since 1994, when Republicans finally ended the seemingly permanent Democratic majority and ushered in a new era of two-party competition for control of Congress.Lee notes that \u201cTrump frames the 2018 elections to a truly remarkable extent,\u201d not only as the b\u00eate noire of the Democratic Party but as the overwhelmingly dominant force within the Republican Party.This phenomenon, she writes, became evident in the 2018 Republican primaries, which \u201cfeatured contests between candidates competing among themselves as to who could be most loyal to the president, with Trump\u2019s endorsement deciding the outcome in a number of cases.\u201dLee points out that because of Trump\u2019s centrality and his role inredefining the Republican Party around questions of ethno-nationalism, if Republicans retain control of Congress, even by a narrow margin, it will be an enormous vindication for the president and will further cement his recasting of the Republican Party around issues of national identity.Lee makes the case thatWhether Republicans win or lose in 2018, Trump is likely to gain a firmer grip on the Republican Party after 2018 than he currently has. Never-Trump Republicans have had to either renounce their former apostasy or retire from office. And to the extent that the party loses seats, those losses will heavily come from the party\u2019s moderate wing, leaving behind a more pro-Trump Republican Party in Congress.Lee is on target as far as Republicans in Congress go, but Trump\u2019s status in the party at large, in the event Republicans lose control of the House, Senate or both, is less certain.David Robertson, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, observed in an email that a Republican loss of the House \u201cwould reduce Republican control over taxes, spending, trade, and a host of potential policies of interest to the Republican coalition of business and religious conservatives,\u201d and would alsodiminish the president\u2019s influence with some Republicans inside and outside of Congress, and stoke interest in a primary challenge in 2020. Finally, Republican donors will question the return on continued investment in President Trump and his re-election.Like Lee, Leonie Huddy, a political scientist at SUNY-Stony Brook, sees a parallel between 1994 and 2018. She pointed out in an email thatCongressional acrimony directed at a president of the other party in 1994 will be even worse in 2019 if Democrats win the House. Trump is more unpopular among Democrats in 2018 than Clinton was among Republicans in 1994.Huddy described a likely agenda for Democrats once in control of the House:Step 1 is likely to be a subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns. But there is a slew of other financial issues that could generate investigations and hearings, including whether proceeds from the Trump D.C. hotel violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, and more generally whether the Trump family is profiting in various ways from the presidency. Trump\u2019s personal life is another likely topic of investigation. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. These accusations are also likely to generate hearings and investigations.David Bateman, a political scientist at Cornell, agreed with many of his colleagues that a \u201cRepublican victory will be interpreted as a validation of its more aggressively ethnonationalist wing,\u201d and that \u201ca defeat will be interpreted as a setback for them and for Trump.\u201dStill, Bateman, voiced caution.I don\u2019t see the midterm elections arresting the progress of an otherwise successful political program or overthrowing the ascendant faction of the Republican Party or even throwing the party into disarray \u2014 I expect they will quickly regroup, with a more coherent and right-wing caucus and without the burdens of making choices that come with being the majority party.A Democratic victory, Bateman continued, will impose some new constraints on Trump, but probably not enough to render him a spent force unwilling to run again (or unable to win) in 2020, let alone disarming his more dangerous tendencies over the next two years.Many of the most vulnerable Republicans are part of the more moderate wing of the party, as are many of those retiring. As they depart, Bateman notes, the hard right becomes more powerful within the congressional wing:White Christian nationalism has long been an important part of the coalition, and not only is it not going anywhere but the party\u2019s losses will probably make it more rather than less well-represented in the party.While Bateman argues that the Trump wing will be fortified within the Republican Party regardless of the outcome in November, Stephen Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, argues that the future of the party\u2019s Trump wing hinges on the election.\u201cFor the Republicans, it\u2019s a fight over the definition of and power within the party,\u201d Ansolabehere wrote in an email. If Republicans retain control of the House, \u201cit will be taken as an affirmation of the Trump G.O.P. agenda. Trump\u2019s wing within the G.O.P. will be further strengthened.\u201dConversely, if Democrats win the House, Ansolabehere expects them to inflict \u201cdeath by 1000 cuts\u201d on the Trump administration:I would look for a lot of oversight hearings to be conducted, dragging every department secretary into office to be accountable for what they have done over the past two years. Especially the Environmental Protection Agency.The 2018 election, Ansolabehere noted, \u201cfeels like a test of whether Democrats are really competitive with the Republicans or if 2006 and 2008 are just exceptions.\u201dWhile partisan animus began to rise in the 1980s, it has grown dramatically over the past two decades. As partisan affect has intensified, it is also more structured; in-group favoritism is increasingly associated with out-group animus. Finally, hostility toward the opposing party has eclipsed positive affect for one\u2019s own party as a motive for political participation.To complicate things further, the fight over Kavanaugh may have different consequences in the fight for control of the House and the Senate.At the same time, newly reported evidence suggests that Trump should worry about his domination of the Republican Party and that his hold on the party is less secure than his favorability ratings among Republicans suggest.Smeltz found that Republican respondents fell into two categories: \u201cTrump Republicans\u201d who hold very favorable views of the president and make up 55 percent of Republican voters and \u201cNon-Trump Republicans,\u201d whose view of Trump is \u201conly a somewhat favorable or unfavorable.\u201d They make up 44 percent of Republican voters and differ sharply with Trump Republicans on key issues.For example, pro-Trump Republicans oppose NAFTA 68-30, while non-Trump Republicans support the agreement 61-34. In the case of the Paris climate accords, 59 percent of non-Trump Republicans said the United States should participate versus 34 percent of Trump Republicans.In an expansive question on a goal of foreign policy, the Chicago Council asked if \u201cit is more important to be admired than feared.\u201d A solid 71 percent of non-Trump Republicans picked admired over feared, while 58 percent of Trump Republicans said it is more important to be feared.whether it is better to be loved more than feared, or feared more than loved. The reply is that one ought to be both feared and loved, but as it is difficult for the two to go together, it is much safer to be feared than loved, if one of the two has to be wanting. For it may be said of men in general that they are ungrateful, voluble dissemblers, anxious to avoid danger, and covetous of gain; as long as you benefit them, they are entirely yours; they offer you their blood, their goods, their life, and their children, as I have before said, when the necessity is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt. And the prince who has relied solely on their words, without making other preparations, is ruined, for the friendship which is gained by purchase and not through grandeur and nobility of spirit is merited but is not secured, and at times is not to be had. And men have less scruple in offending one who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared; for love is held by a chain of obligation which, men being selfish, is broken whenever it serves their purpose; but fear is maintained by a dread of punishment which never fails.Advertisement"}

Video of the Oct. 13 incident, which was recorded on Officer Peter Casuccio\u2019s body camera and released on Monday by the Columbus police as a \u201clife lesson\u201d for young people, ignited an online discussion about policing, race and gun control in the United States.Earlier in the video, he says, \u201cI pride myself on being a pretty bad hombre, because I got to be,\u201d warning the boys, \u201cDon\u2019t make me.\u201dAt another point, he says: \u201cThe last thing I ever want to do is shoot an 11-year-old, man.

{"Headline": "Your Dog May Be Smart, but She\u2019s Not Exceptional", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCat lovers of the world rejoice!In the long-simmering dispute over whether dogs are smarter than cats, a recent study published in the journal Learning & Behavior suggests that dogs are no more exceptional than other animals when it comes to canniness and intelligence.The news is sure to ignite debate (watch the fur fly!) among dog owners and scientists who study canine behavior. The authors reviewed existing studies and data on animal cognition and found that while dogs are smart and trainable, they are not \u201csuper smart,\u201d despite what most dog owners will tell you.The idea for the study came about when Stephen Lea, an emeritus professor in the psychology department at the University of Exeter in Britain, was editor of Animal Cognition, a journal that seeks to explain cognition among humans and animals in the context of evolution. Dog research, he said in an interview last week, was quite popular in the 1990s and continues to be so.\u201cI was getting a number of papers showing how remarkable the things were that dogs could do,\u201d he said. When it came to other animals, though, scientific studies on intelligence barely trickled in, despite evidence to suggest that horses, chimpanzees and cats had tricks of their own. \u201cAlmost everything a dog claimed to do, other animals could do too,\u201d Dr. Lea said. \u201cIt made me quite wary that dogs were special.\u201dTo be fair, Dr. Lea said he was a cat person. Still, he and Britta Osthaus, a senior lecturer in the School of Psychology, Politics and Sociology at Canterbury Christ Church University in Britain, set out to test the hypothesis.They compared dog cognition with members of three similar groups: carnivores, social hunters and domestic animals. Among the animals they studied were wolves, cats, chimpanzees, dolphins, horses and pigeons. What they found, Dr. Lea said, was that \u201cdog cognition does not look exceptional.\u201d(Perhaps that explains the plot of the 1996 feel-good animal buddy movie \u201cHomeward Bound 2: Lost in San Francisco,\u201d featuring the odyssey of Shadow, a golden retriever; Sassy, a Himalayan cat; and Chance, an American bulldog.)At the same time, domesticated animals share similar traits with their canine cohorts. Horses, like dogs, perform elaborate tasks. And cats? They have more in common with dogs than one might think. Still, he said, \u201cIt is much easier to show intelligence in dogs because they like to be trained.\u201d Dogs, Dr. Lea added, \u201care not smarter than they are supposed to be, given what they are.\u201d\u201cI have found throughout the years that my clients who are rocket scientists and neurosurgeons always have the most cats,\u201d she said. \u201cThirteen to 15 cats usually.\u201d She does not ignore animal instinct, which she says is separate from intelligence. \u201cCats have evolved over thousands of years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are intelligent in their own way.\u201dBesides, she said, \u201cI\u2019d rather have a loving companion than one considered to be the smartest.\u201dFor his part, Dr. Lea is bracing for the inevitable backlash. \u201cWe are not trying to say dogs are stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t think that they are extraordinary. And that is not a neutral thing to say.\u201dOne thing is sure, though: They\u2019re all good dogs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Poison on Facebook and Twitter Is Still Spreading", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial platforms have a responsibility to address misinformation as a systemic problem, instead of reacting to case after case.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The public knows about each of these incitements because of reporting by news organizations. Social media misinformation is becoming a newsroom beat in and of itself, as journalists find themselves acting as unpaid content moderators for these platforms.The internet platforms will always make some mistakes, and it\u2019s not fair to expect otherwise. And the task before Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and others is admittedly herculean. No one can screen everything in the fire hose of content produced by users. Even if a platform makes the right call on 99 percent of its content, the remaining 1 percent can still be millions upon millions of postings. The platforms are due some forgiveness in this respect. It\u2019s not just The Times, and it\u2019s not just Facebook. Again and again, the act of reporting out a story gets reduced to outsourced content moderation.\u201cWe all know that feeling,\u201d says Charlie Warzel, a reporter at BuzzFeed who\u2019s written about everything from viral misinformation on Twitter to exploitative child content on YouTube. \u201cYou flag a flagrant violation of terms of service and send out a request for comment. And you\u2019re just sitting there refreshing, and then you see it come down \u2014 and afterward you get this boilerplate reply via email.\u201d Mr. Warzel says his inbox is full of messages from people begging him to intercede with the platforms on their behalf \u2014 sometimes because they have been censored unfairly, sometimes because they want to point to disturbing content they believe should be taken offline.Journalists are not in the business of resolving disputes for Facebook and Twitter. But disgruntled users might feel that they have a better chance of being listened to by a reporter than by someone who is actually paid to resolve user complaints.The companies have all the tools at their disposal and a profound responsibility to find exactly what journalists find \u2014 and yet, clearly, they don\u2019t. The role that outsiders currently play,\u00a0as consumer advocates and content screeners, can easily be filled in-house. And unlike journalists, companies have the power to change the very incentives that keep producing these troubling online phenomena. But throwing light on the coordinated misinformation campaigns flaring up all around us is a matter that is much bigger than the death of print \u2014 it\u2019s essential to democracy.

{"Headline": "Palestinian Leaders Are Accused of Using Torture and Arbitrary Arrests to Crush Dissent", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 A West Bank journalist was detained by Palestinian Authority security forces for four days after he took photographs on his cellphone of the Palestinian prime minister\u2019s convoy stuck in line at an Israeli-controlled checkpoint.An activist in Gaza said that Hamas security forces detained him for 15 days after he wrote a Facebook post protesting the lack of electricity in which he asked the group\u2019s leaders if their children slept on the tiled floor to escape the heat, as his did.The systematic practice of torture by the two authorities might amount to a crime against humanity and could be prosecutable at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the report said.On Tuesday, spokesmen for the internal security forces of both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas dismissed the group\u2019s report as biased and inaccurate.Adnan Damiri, a Palestinian Authority spokesman, said the report was \u201chighly biased and full of mistaken information.\u201dIn an annex to the report, the security agencies of both Palestinian territories argued that abuses occurred only in isolated cases where perpetrators were investigated and held to account.Human Rights Watch said the evidence it had collected contradicted those claims.Speaking at a news conference in Ramallah, Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch and the lead researcher on the report, said: \u201cAbuses happen. When abuses happen, those who carry them out should be held responsible. When you have impunity, abuse continues. There has been impunity for a quarter of a century.\u201dTom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch, said that 25 years after the Oslo peace accord, \u201cPalestinian authorities have gained only limited power in the West Bank and Gaza, but yet, where they have autonomy, they have developed parallel police states.\u201d\u201cCalls by Palestinian officials to safeguard Palestinian rights ring hollow as they crush dissent,\u201d he added.But the 149-page report published on Tuesday, which was two years in the making, drew on testimony from more than 140 witnesses, including former detainees, their relatives and lawyers, and it also reviewed medical records and court documents. Human Rights Watch detailed more than two dozen cases of people who it said were \u201cdetained for no clear reason beyond writing a critical article or Facebook post or belonging to the wrong student group or political movement.\u201d The detentions often lasted for days or weeks, and the purpose of the authorities\u2019 actions, the advocacy group said, was to punish critics and deter further activism.Human Rights Watch also pointed to systematic abuse including beatings, foot-whipping and, in particular, a form of torture known as \u201cshabeh\u201d in Arabic, in which detainees are contorted for long periods into stress positions that cause pain but rarely leave marks.Human Rights Watch called on countries that provide assistance to the various security agencies accused of such abuse to suspend that part of their aid.Palestinian analysts have long noted the increasing autocracy of the octogenarian Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in his struggle to suppress real and perceived rivals, and the competition between his Fatah-led Palestinian Authority and Hamas has led to waves of tit-for-tat arrests.In Ramallah, some Palestinians asked about the authority said that they did not dare speak publicly, making a snatching motion with their fingers to suggest that expressing criticism could lead them to be whisked off the street. Unauthorized protests have been brutally broken up. In Hamas-run Gaza, the authorities have long been accused of intimidating journalists and critics.In response to questions posed by Human Rights Watch, one of the West Bank security agencies, the Preventive Security Service, said that 220 Palestinians had been detained following posts on social media because they \u201cfell outside the bounds of criticism and expression of opinion,\u201d and could have \u201cendangered the lives of citizens.\u201dJihad Barakat, the West Bank journalist who took the photographs of the Palestinian prime minister, was ultimately acquitted of any improper or unlawful behavior by a court in Ramallah.Amer Balousha, the activist in Gaza who complained about the heat, was first summoned on suspicion of incitement after calling on people to demonstrate and was later released. He was then arrested on another, unspecified charge \u201cof a criminal nature,\u201d according to the Hamas security forces.The Israeli authorities have accused Human Rights Watch of anti-Israel bias in the past and compiled a dossier on Mr. Shakir that documents his activities in support of a boycott, mostly from before he joined the advocacy group. The dossier also points to a 2016 report by Human Rights Watch that called on businesses to cease activities that benefited Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Says Allie Kieffer Isn\u2019t Thin Enough to Run Marathons?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisKieffer moved back to New York from Boulder, Colo., and took a job as a nanny. After a few years, she missed running and started again \u2014 but this time was different. There were no goals, no opponents to compare herself with and no times to record. Everything was on her own terms. She made friends jogging in Central Park. She joined CrossFit, unheard-of in elite running, a sport whose athletes are not exactly known for their bulging musculature. She began running more miles than ever, she was healthier than ever, and she was happier, too. And then something unexpected happened: She got faster. Much faster.Suddenly, Kieffer wasn\u2019t just trying to be one of the hundreds of elite runners in the country. She had become one of the best runners in the world.In doing so, Kieffer has given us a powerful example of what can happen when we stop trying to force ourselves to meet preconceived notions of how to achieve success \u2014 especially unhealthy, untrue ideas \u2014 and go after our goals on our own terms. When we focus less on fixing what we consider to be inadequacies and more on reinforcing our strengths, we can realize potential we didn\u2019t even know we had.Kieffer\u2019s story also proves that we can achieve far more when we value all women\u2019s bodies less for how they look, and more for what they can do. Not that being underestimated can\u2019t serve as motivation.\u201cI\u2019ve always gotten a lot of satisfaction by being the big girl everyone thought they were going to beat,\u201d says Kieffer.Of course, there is a growing movement telling us to embrace the bodies we\u2019ve got \u2014 thank you \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to drown out the other messages. Whether it\u2019s for a race or a wedding, women are told that they are at their most valuable when their bodies are their most diminished. Resisting the impulse to feed yourself is an accomplishment we praise. You don\u2019t have to buy into these values, but you\u2019ll probably still be judged by them.\u201cBut you\u2019re not even skinny!\u201d she exclaimed.(No, I learned in high school that not eating enough food won\u2019t get you everything you might have hoped it would.) After five years of pushing through injuries doing what I was certain the successful version of myself should do, I never made it to the starting line of a race. I\u2019d get injured, get upset, and try the same thing again, hoping that maybe by the seventh or the eighth or the ninth try it would finally work.Then, one summer, I realized I wasn\u2019t even trying anymore \u2014 without even deciding to, I\u2019d given up and let go. And then last year, I started running again, without any pressure, because I love it. And I decided to try racing again; now, the only goal would be simply making it to the starting line. I made it, and I reached the finish line too \u2014 faster than I\u2019d ever run. And it all somehow felt easier, and more satisfying, than whatever nonsense I\u2019d been attempting before. Sometimes, trying to keep up is less productive \u2014 and far more frustrating \u2014 than motivating yourself on your own terms. \u201cWhen you think about what high performers have in common, it\u2019s striking that motivation is so internal: they\u2019re obsessed with what they do, they love it. \u201d said Angela Duckworth, the psychologist who wrote the book \u201cGrit.\u201d \u201cDropping out can help you re-evaluate and reflect on why you\u2019re doing this in the first place. It\u2019s hard to both paddle really hard and navigate at the same time.\u201dKieffer has embraced her healthy approach to training, which was honed growing up on Long Island. She recalls afternoons spent rollerblading with friends and eating heaps of Italian food and ice cream \u2014 in the same outing. And she jokes that part of her edge now is that she is able to ingest more food than her competition on the run \u2014 because, after all, food is fuel.Operating on your own terms can also give you the confidence to bounce back when things don\u2019t go as planned. When I first met Kieffer in March, she was in a cast. She had broken her foot after ramping up her training. Instead of despairing, she focused on a comeback plan. Now, she has run her best time in nearly every event she has entered this year. Taking a more flexible approach to your end goal helps you cut yourself breaks that keep you in the game.And staying in the game is critical. For most of her life, Kieffer was one amid scores of good, anonymous runners. She only reached the national stage after investing in herself, sponsorless, for a decade. It shows that if we decide that the only people who have the potential to succeed are the ones who meet our idea of what successful looks like \u2014 when they\u2019re gifted children of 12 or high achieving 20-year-olds \u2014 and only invest in them, we\u2019ll prove ourselves right.Doing things on your own terms is hard work. Kieffer makes far less money as a runner than she made as a professional nanny. And of course, you have to know what you\u2019re doing. Giving up on your narrow definition of success only works if, after you reset, your autopilot leads you to a finish line, not to a couch.\u201cThere\u2019s a time for making something happen, and then there\u2019s letting something happen,\u201d said Stulberg. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell a novice not to follow a recipe, but at elite levels of performance, letting go and simply letting something happen can lead to a real breakthrough.\u201dBy conventional standards, she is doing nearly everything wrong. But she\u2019s beating a lot of the people who are still training the \u201cright\u201d way, so perhaps her path shows there\u2019s room for a more flexible definition of what the right way can be. This is probably true for more than just distance running.And when that fresh path translates to success \u2014 when the wrong way becomes a new right way \u2014 the pressure you were escaping in the first place can return. The trick is to turn that pressure into fresh motivation. Last year, the only person with any expectations for Kieffer was Kieffer herself. Now, she\u2019s aiming for the medal podium of the New York marathon next Sunday. And this time, she thinks, she belongs there. Advertisement"}

For me, it\u2019s sausages sizzling in a cast-iron pan with apples and onions.But where do you get good sausages these days?To find the best supermarket bratwurst, I assembled a little team for a blind tasting. We looked, unofficially, at a few criteria, assessing flavor, authenticity, texture and deliciousness, among other qualities.There are still good butcher shops, though, that make sausages in-house, both traditional establishments with European roots and new wave places run by earnest young butchers with high standards and sustainable values. Given the choice, I prefer a butcher shop, where my sausages come wrapped in paper instead of impermeable thick plastic.There are often more choices at a butcher shop, too. Besides brats, there may be bockwurst, veal frankfurters, fat knackwurst or delicate weisswurst (the pale finely ground sausages similar to the French boudin blanc), a particular favorite of mine. You may need to do a bit of traveling to find such a shop, but it is well worth venturing afar, if just for the intoxicating olfactory experience. I returned from a recent outing with a bag of assorted plump sausages, a chunk of slab bacon and a smoked ham hock.But let\u2019s face it: No matter where you buy your sausage or which sausage you choose, savory spiced caramelized onions and apples fried in butter make the perfect accompaniment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Ways N.J. Transit Is Failing Commuters", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Philip D. Murphy became the governor of New Jersey this year, he quickly targeted one of the state\u2019s most aggravating problems \u2014 its woeful transit system. He ordered an audit of the system, New Jersey Transit, to pinpoint its problems and suggest solutions.The agency\u2019s new leadership has held off making some big changes while waiting for the results of the audit, which took several months longer than expected to complete. But the leaders have indicated that the agency needs to be overhauled from the top down, with a more streamlined management, updated technology and a better process for hiring workers.\u201cThis audit is what will allow us to rebuild New Jersey Transit and restore faith in its operations,\u201d Mr. Murphy said at a news conference at a New Jersey Transit train station.Here are five problems the agency faces and proposals for how to fix them:From one annual state budget to the next, New Jersey Transit leaders never knew where they would get enough money to run their existing service, much less make investments for the future.Mr. Murphy has pledged to provide a significant increase in funding, but in his first year, the agency continued a much-criticized practice of shifting money from its capital budget to pay for its day-to-day operations. (On Tuesday, Mr. Murphy reiterated his pledge that there would be no fare increases before mid-2019.)\u201cToday, N.J. Transit is facing the unintended long-term consequences of these actions, which have only increased over time as subsidies continued to erode \u2014 a deterioration of its assets, continued schedule and safety problems, and a disillusioned ridership,\u201d the report, conducted by the consulting firm North Highland, concluded.The consultants recommended creating an office to develop a vision for the agency\u2019s future and a plan for managing its assets, which have shrunk by $1.5 billion in the last eight years.In short, they advised, \u201cRun N.J. Transit more like a business and less as a state agency.\u201dNew Jersey Transit has been losing key employees, some to competing transit agencies in the New York region, and has been having trouble replacing them. The hiring process is also hobbled by out-of-date practices. For many positions, the agency relies on paper applications and pencil-and-paper tests.\u201cAntiquated processes,\u2019\u2019 the report said, \u201ccreate a major bottleneck to hiring the right people at the right time.\u201dThe shortage of employees has been most profound among engineers. This summer, New Jersey Transit did not have enough engineers to drive its trains on most days, forcing many cancellations.Kevin Corbett, the agency\u2019s executive director, is trying to speed up hiring by doubling the number of training classes each year and by inviting its conductors to train to become engineers. Conductors can complete the training in 12 months, compared with 20 months for new hires.Some employees, including engineers, have left for New York\u2019s Metro-North Railroad and other agencies that pay more than New Jersey Transit.The consultants recommended modernizing and streamlining the recruitment and hiring processes so that more qualified candidates could be identified and jobs could be filled faster. They also suggested finding ways to pay more competitive salaries.The consultants said New Jersey Transit\u2019s system for managing its inventory, like spare parts for trains and buses, \u201cdoes not seem to be functioning properly.\u201dThe agency frequently runs out of 15 to 30 percent of the items it needs to maintain its equipment, which \u201dincreases the time that crews keep cars and busses out of service.\u201d And it can take the agency 450 days to complete large purchases.The approach to managing equipment has been mostly reactive, with the agency dealing with problems as they occur rather than trying to preventing them.\u201cIf N.J. Transit continues to operate in this way,\u2019\u2019 the report said, its equipment \u201cwill continue to degrade without the ability to determine, how, when and where a critical failure will occur.\u201dThe consultants recommended overhauling the way the agency tracks its assets and purchases new equipment. They also suggested that the agency hire its own general counsel so that it would not need to rely on the office of the state attorney general to complete so many of its larger contracts.The agency is so focused on trying to run its trains and buses safely and efficiently that \u201ccustomers often come as an afterthought,\u201d the report said.When they do receive information about delays and their causes, it is often inconsistent, the report said. Some information about changes is posted to social media platforms before it is shared internally, leaving conductors and bus drivers unprepared to answer questions from riders, it said.\u201cWe know we have to communicate better,\u201d Mr. Corbett said. He said that the agency had created a \u201cwar room\u201d for managing communications with customers and that \u201cinformation is now being sent out to customers quickly and more accurately.\u201dThe consultants suggested that the agency use social media to try to turn around negative impressions of its performance.\u201cMore could be done by N.J. Transit to put a more positive foot forward, rather than defending itself,\u201d the report said. Posting photos and other entertaining content \u201ccreates a positive brand image and uplifting conversation.\u201dBut it warned that those postings should be confined to non-rush hours, when customers are less likely to be in bad moods. \u201cDuring rush hours when traffic or services are more strained customers will be more likely to lash out if they see N.J. Transit posting on Facebook,\u201d the report said.Likewise, the report described Twitter as a forum that can contain \u201ca lot of vitriol.\u201d It advised against wishing customers a good night because \u201cthis is guaranteed to rile customers who aren\u2019t having a pleasant commute.\u201dNew Jersey Transit\u2019s costs have risen by 30 percent in the past decade while the agency\u2019s funding from the state declined.\u201cContinued funding decreases will bring N.J. Transit\u2019s viability as a primary mode of transportation in the state into question,\u201d the report said.Riders already bear a higher share \u2014 43 percent \u2014 of the costs of the operations than in other comparable transit systems, it found. The consultants did not recommend ways of solving the agency\u2019s financial problems, but suggested alternatives to fare increases.Among the ideas the report discussed were finding new sources of revenue, such as the development of real estate around New Jersey Transit train stations and other properties; selling more advertising around its stations; and proposing taxes or fees on ride-hailing apps, like Uber, that could generate funds for transit.\u201cIt is evident N.J. Transit cannot continue to operate under its present financial model,\u201d the report concluded.Advertisement"}

Drowned out by other events, their efforts deserve broader acknowledgment and support.What started out as independent artists wishing to express themselves has grown into a collaborative campaign of sorts, with individuals and cultural organizations banding together to promote Palestinian arts.A.M. Qattan is far from alone. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, there are 625 cultural centers in the Palestinian territories, with 545 cultural centers in the West Bank and 80 in the Gaza Strip. There are also 32 museums \u2014 27 in the West Bank and five in the Gaza Strip.These organizations have sprouted and have continued to operate despite many challenges, including travel restrictions between Israel and its surrounding areas, which complicates some Palestinians\u2019 ability to participate in their own cultural events.While those involved in this cultural mission are proud of the movement\u2019s independence, its organic growth and the increasing sense of camaraderie and solidarity that accompanies it, many would like the Palestinian government to do more to help. Ms. Jacir said she \u201creceived a small but symbolic support from the Palestinian Ministry of Culture\u201d for \u201cWajib.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely to change now that the United States has decided to withdraw the more than $200 million in aid to Palestinians, which many educational and humanitarian institutions depend on. Yet it is important for the Palestinian authorities to continue to designate a portion of their budget \u2014 as \u201csymbolic\u201d as it may be \u2014 to the invaluable contribution of Palestinian artists and filmmakers. At a time when the status quo between Israeli and Palestinians seems intractable, such works supply visual documentation of Palestinian concerns and a more measured portrayal of the conditions under which they exist.It\u2019s true that there is little precedent to suggest that national arts movements alone are capable of bringing about political change. But such cultural undertakings should be viewed as an essential component of the road to peace, one that provides vital possibilities for engagement, participation and cooperation among the generations of Palestinians who, individually and collectively, are painting distinct pictures of their myriad realities.Nana Asfour is an editor in The New York Times Opinion section.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Very Personal Taste of Racism Abroad", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayFor an African-American woman, a study-abroad program in Italy led to an eye-opening experience. \u201cDisgusting black women\u201d were the stinging words of one racial encounter.Up until about five years ago, I didn\u2019t have much experience being black outside the United States.My roommates during my sophomore year had both studied in Italy and raved about their time. They gushed about the panini from a little shop around the corner from the picturesque villas that housed their study program, and regaled me with stories of fun parties and their Italian romances.I was ready for that to be my life: fun, food and a European love story.But I was so caught up in my excitement that I neglected a crucial difference between me, my roommates and the majority of the other students I was studying with abroad. They were white. I, on the other hand, am an African-American woman with skin the color of dark chocolate and full lips. In the United States, I was aware of racism in a broad sense, but perhaps because of my age my eyes weren\u2019t fully open to it. My mother seemed to know better, saying things to me like \u201ctake off that hoodie\u201d when we walked into stores. When she muttered, \u201cyou don\u2019t see how they\u2019re looking at you,\u201d I assumed she was bothered by my fashion choices. When I arrived at the New York University campus, a 57-acre estate in Florence with lush greenery, tan stonewalls and rows of olive trees, I was captivated.During orientation, the Italian instructors talked about customs and other important practices to take note of. What I remember most is one woman from the program telling us to be mindful that Italians can be \u201cbold\u201d or \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201dFor me, it began with passers-by on the street calling me Michelle Obama, Rihanna or Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 as though I can resemble all three \u2014 and the Italian men selling Pinocchio marionettes in the piazza near the famed cathedral, il Duomo, shouting \u201ccioccolatta\u201d (chocolate).These incidents were minor compared to what happened a few weeks later. I took a trip to Cinque Terre, the five scenic villages on the rugged Ligurian coast in northwestern Italy, with about six friends.I was in my own world on a crowded beach, sitting underneath an umbrella while the other women in my group were by the water, when I noticed an olive-skinned man in swim trunks with a beer in his hand flirting, unsuccessfully, with them. When we were getting up to leave, he approached our group \u2014 and he did not seem drunk.I assumed he was just going to continue bantering, but before I knew it, the rejected suitor started aggressively telling my white friends in Italian-accented English to pick up their trash.He ignored me and the only other black woman in the group as if we were invisible, but I wasn\u2019t struck by this at the time.Before I could figure out a response, the other black female began yelling at him.I looked around and saw the sea of white faces staring on the packed beach \u2014 not a single one had made a move to help. I then locked eyes with a black man. He appeared to be an African migrant because he was selling beach gear draped from his body, much like other migrants I had seen who usually sold knickknacks or knockoff purses on the street.We stared at each other for what felt like a full minute and his eyes seemed full of sympathy.As my group walked away, one of the women made an observation I\u2019ll never forget. \u201cDid you hear that? He just called you \u2018disgusting black women.\u2019\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t shrug it off so easily.As I passed shopkeepers setting out signs and sweeping storefronts that morning, I noticed a short middle-aged white woman with a pixie cut walking a couple feet in front of me with her purse on her shoulder. She quickly stopped and turned around. She looked at me and screamed then pressed her back against the wall. I looked around in alarm, thinking something had happened, but couldn\u2019t figure out what.She screamed again, and this time, she fled the sidewalk. At this point, I could see the shop owners staring. The woman continued to look at me and shrieked once more. When I asked \u201cwhat?\u201d she gasped as if she were both frightened and disgusted that I had the nerve to speak to her. She then shielded herself behind a parked car. I was dumbfounded. So I kept walking, trying to leave my embarrassment on the street behind me. I wish I could say that was the first time someone had avoided me on the sidewalk in this world-famous city full of international tourists and students. It was not. But it was, by far, the most blatant.After that, I was hyper aware of the stares and comments as I traveled around the country, from the chocolate festival in Perugia to sightseeing in Milan and Venice, and visiting the Colosseum and the Vatican in Rome, even tossing coins for good luck in the Trevi Fountain there.On my last night in Florence, I was supposed to meet a few of my friends at a bar for farewell drinks. Earlier in the evening, I had a lovely dinner with a group of Italians to whom I had been introduced by a mutual American friend. This was the first time I had truly felt accepted in Italy, and I regretted having to leave them to go to the bar.I figured that I\u2019d ask for directions when I got to the neighborhood because I had purposely let the money run out on my pay-as-you-go phone, just as I tried to spend the last of my euros.In my passable Italian, I walked around trying to ask for directions in the same favorite outfit I had worn on the day the pixie-haired woman screamed on the sidewalk.I was taken aback when a group of white men brushed past me as if I were asking for money, not the location of a popular bar.Then a youthful, nicely dressed white couple, walking arm-in-arm, stopped abruptly as the man moved in front of the woman defensively, protectively, only to tell me he didn\u2019t know where the bar was.My engaged friend is getting married in Lamezia Terme, a city in southern Italy. So five years later, I\u2019m returning to the country that left a deep scar on my heart.Whenever I go back to my childhood home in Orange County, Florida, I am not surprised when I see the Confederate flag flying on high poles, plastered on car bumpers and worn proudly on T-shirts. But it surprises me that even the Dixie flag \u2014 and all it represents \u2014 doesn\u2019t get to me as much as the outright and physical disrespect I experienced very far from home.

{"Headline": "I'm Just a Middle-Aged House Dad Addicted to Pot", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Pollack is a writer. AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 My name is Neal, and I\u2019m a marijuana addict.A year ago I wouldn\u2019t have said that, because it would have meant giving up marijuana. I would rather have given up breathing.When I had my first cup of coffee in the morning, I pressed the little button on my vape pen, waited for the blue glow, took a huge inhale and then blew it into the mug so that I could suck in the THC and caffeine at the same time. Then I took another hit, and another. In the afternoons, I\u2019d smoke a bowl, or pop a gummy bear, or both. At night, I got high before eating dinner or watching the ballgame. Maybe I\u2019d stop getting stoned a little bit before bed, but what was the point? If I went to bed high, I could wake up high, too.But I\u2019m not a child with intractable epilepsy, or a veteran with PTSD, or a person who just wants to chill a little, or Willie Nelson. Unless you count writing articles about marijuana, I\u2019m not profiting from the industry. I\u2019m just a middle-aged house dad with a substance-abuse problem.Like most pot addicts in denial, I spent years telling myself that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive, and so I didn\u2019t have a problem. But clearly I did. And I\u2019m not the only one who suffers this way.I started smoking regularly in the \u201990s, when I was in my mid-20s. Pot made everything better \u2014 food, music, sex, cleaning \u2014 and it made nothing worse. I got depressed less often. I laughed all the time.But I also lost my temper for no reason. Did I yell at strangers in public? Probably. I barely remember, because I was stoned. But I do remember that once, high as a promotional blimp, I got into a bar fight with a former friend and broke his tooth with a beer bottle.Back when my writing career was booming, I got invited a couple of times to do readings in Amsterdam, a bad gig for a pot addict. Once, after ingesting a couple of THC pills, I dumped a pitcher of water over my head and insulted the Iraqi representative to National Poetry Day Amsterdam. Another time, I pulled down my pants and flashed a crowd of several hundred. If I had any boundaries, weed erased them thoroughly. The boom ended fast.In 2016, I became the Texas correspondent for a national marijuana newspaper, which gave me lots of excuses to get up to Colorado, America\u2019s new weed utopia. With legalization upon us, I started saying things like: \u201cImagine if you loved coffee but it had been illegal your entire life. That\u2019s what I feel like!\u201d I began to refer to Colorado as \u201cFree America.\u201dIn March of 2017, my mother died. The hour before she passed, I was outside the hospital, getting a shipment of medical gummies from a friend. I was high when I watched her die, I was high at her funeral, and I was high every day for the next eight months. To say I was \u201cself-medicating\u201d to deal with grief would be too kind. My addicted self took grief as a no-limits license to get stoned.In early November, I had the chance to fulfill my lifelong dream of attending a Dodgers World Series game. I spent way too much money on a ticket that turned out to be fake. So high that I couldn\u2019t remember where I\u2019d parked, I started screaming outside the stadium. If I\u2019d been sober, I would have just called the vendor and gotten a refund. That\u2019s what I ended up doing, eventually. But not before security guards surrounded me.I looked into a car mirror and saw an old man, sobbing over a baseball game. That was the moment I accepted that I had a problem. Three weeks later, I quit.I\u2019ve been sober for 11 months. I do the same things with my time that I did before, except that 75 percent of my life doesn\u2019t revolve around obtaining or consuming weed. It\u2019s incredible what you can accomplish when you\u2019re not high.In many ways, I\u2019m lucky my addiction didn\u2019t have more consequences. I never got arrested. My family stayed together, somehow. But I have lost a ton of dignity and integrity, intangibles that I may never reclaim.It wasn\u2019t so hard to go cold turkey. I had a couple of twitchy nights, and that was it. But it\u2019s easier to stay off the stuff because I don\u2019t live in a state where it\u2019s legal. I can get weed, but it requires a few steps. Addicts in legal states aren\u2019t so fortunate.Marijuana isn\u2019t alcohol or an opioid. You can\u2019t die from an overdose. It doesn\u2019t really evince physical cravings. So is it better to call my problem marijuana \u201cdependence\u201d? Does it matter?Advertisement"}

But Trump\u2019s attempt to head off retaliation for Saudi crimes by claiming that there are big economic rewards to staying friendly with killers \u2014 and the willingness of his political allies to embrace his logic \u2014 nonetheless represents a new stage in the debasement of America.That said, the claims are, in fact, false.Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that under current conditions, increasing exports, even if you can do it, won\u2019t create net additional jobs for the U.S. economy. Why? Because the Federal Reserve believes that we\u2019re at full employment, and any further strengthening of the economy will induce the Fed to raise interest rates. As a result, jobs added in one place by things like arms sales will be offset by jobs lost elsewhere as higher rates deter investment or make the U.S. less competitive by strengthening the dollar.But let\u2019s get real: Trump isn\u2019t going easy on the Saudis because of the jobs they provide to defense workers. His ever-inflating count of how many jobs are involved is in itself a dead giveaway that arms sales are an excuse, not a real motive, for his actions. So what\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so willing to forgive torture and murder?So, as I said, what we\u2019re looking at here is another step in the debasement of our nation. Accepting torture and murder is a betrayal of American principles; trying to justify that betrayal by appealing to supposed economic benefits is a further betrayal. And when you add in the fact that the claimed economic payoff is a lie, and that the president\u2019s personal profit is a much more likely explanation for his actions \u2014 well, genuine patriots should be deeply ashamed of what we\u2019ve come to as a nation.Advertisement"}

Fear, repressed memories or just the passage of time were challenges. So too, for some, were bad experiences dealing with the news media. And then there was the fact that many of his subjects had been poor and often living in small villages, where news \u2014 and a silencing shame \u2014 could spread quickly.\u201cThey have problems in their families where the priest and the church had become a sort of anchor for them,\u201d Mr. Clavarino said. \u201cThe priest, in many examples, was a substitute for the father or parents. These people have to deal with several acts of violence: the physical, the psychological and the loss of trust in other human beings. Priests in these small communities and poor neighborhoods are seen as the only people you can trust. And then these people abuse you.\u201dHe managed to get to know a survivor who had started a group for others like him. That person introduced Mr. Clavarino to others, whom he set out to photograph. It was important to him that his images not be sensationalistic, but oblique.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make work that arrived directly, like \u2018Boom!\u2019 That was too direct,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to work on the ambiguity of the places and the delicacy of these people: They are very fragile, so I tried to work in a delicate way.\u201dThat approach produced images that provide a narrative tension that is as unsettling as it is quiet. One shows a man whose bare chest has a tattoo of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s praying hands. Dangling from the hands is a rosary that has a blood-dripping razor blade where the crucifix should be. Another shows the green pants worn by one abusive priest. Another, a confessional.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Unconstitutional Dreams", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has birthright citizenship all wrong.Mr. Foner is a historian who specializes in the Reconstruction period.In an interview with the news program \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d President Trump announced that he plans to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship, the principle that everyone born in the United States, with a handful of exceptions, is automatically a citizen of the United States.\u201cIt was always told to me,\u201d the president declared, \u201cthat you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t.\u201d In fact, such an order would undoubtedly be unconstitutional. It would also violate a deeply rooted American idea \u2014 that anybody, regardless of race, religion, national origin, or the legal status of one\u2019s parents, can be a loyal citizen of this country.Birthright citizenship is established by the Civil Rights Act of 1866, still on the books today, and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified two years later. The only exceptions, in the words of the amendment, are persons not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. Members of Congress at the time made clear that this wording applied only to Native Americans living on reservations \u2014 then considered members of their own tribal sovereignties, not the nation \u2014 and American-born children of foreign diplomats. (Congress made all Native Americans citizens in 1924.)Embedding birthright citizenship in the Constitution was one of the transformative results of the Civil War and the destruction of slavery. Before the war, no uniform definition of citizenship existed. Soon after the conflict ended, members of Congress asked Horace Binney, a prominent lawyer and a former congressman, to explore the meaning of citizenship.\u201cThe word citizen,\u201d he responded, \u201cis found ten times at least in the Constitution of the United States, and no definition of it is given anywhere.\u201d States determined who was a citizen and the rules varied considerably. Massachusetts recognized free African-Americans as citizens; many other states did not. For persons immigrating from abroad, moreover, racial distinctions were built into federal law.The first Naturalization Act, in 1790, limited the process of naturalization to \u201cwhite persons.\u201d In 1857, on the eve of the Civil War, the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision, declared that no black person, slave or free, could be a citizen of the United States or part of the national \u201cpolitical community.\u201d Echoes of this outlook persist to this day, including in Mr. Trump\u2019s long campaign to deny the birthright citizenship status of President Barack Obama.Long before the Civil War, abolitionists black and white had proposed an alternative understanding of national citizenship severed from the concept of race, with citizens\u2019 rights enforced by the federal government. Gatherings where northern free blacks agitated for equal rights called themselves conventions of \u201ccolored citizens\u201d to drive home this idea. And by the conclusion of the war, the end of slavery and the service of nearly 200,000 African-Americans in the Union army and navy propelled the question of black citizenship to center stage of American politics.The Fourteenth Amendment was meant to provide, for the first time, a uniform national definition of citizenship, so that states would no longer be able to deny that status to blacks. It went on to require the states to accord all \u201cpersons,\u201d including aliens, the equal protection of the laws, as part of an effort to create a new egalitarian republic on the ashes of slavery.The birthright citizenship provision, explained Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, one of the founders of the Republican Party and the floor manager of the amendment\u2019s passage in the Senate, was intended to \u201csettle the great question of citizenship once and for all.\u201d The amendment formed part of a constitutional revolution that, in the words of George William Curtis, the editor of the Republican magazine Harper\u2019s Weekly, transformed a document \u201cfor white men\u201d into one \u201cfor mankind.\u201d In 1870, Congress amended the naturalization laws to allow black immigrants to become citizens. The bar to Asians, however, persisted; they could not be naturalized until well into the 20th century.Mr. Trump\u2019s prospective order would deny citizenship to children born in the United States to noncitizens. It is especially aimed at undocumented immigrants who supposedly pour into the country to have \u201canchor babies\u201d \u2014 one of the president\u2019s numerous exaggerations when it comes to the dangers posed by immigration. When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, the category of illegal or undocumented immigrants did not exist. The closest analogy to children born today to such immigrants were the American-born offspring of newcomers from China. At the time, their parents could not become citizens, but in 1898, following the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court affirmed that a person of Chinese origin born in the United States was a citizen by birthright.In the interview in which he discussed his plan to issue the executive order, Mr. Trump claimed that the United States is \u201cthe only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States.\u201d This, too, is an exaggeration, as many in the Western Hemisphere do recognize birthright citizenship. But it is true that in the past decade or two the nations of Europe have retreated from this principle. All limit automatic access to citizenship in some way, making it depend not simply on place of birth but also on ethnicity, culture, religion or extra requirements for the children of parents who are not citizens.That has not been our way. Adopted as part of the effort to purge the United States of the legacy of slavery, the principle of birthright citizenship remains an eloquent statement about the nature of American society, a powerful force for assimilation of the children of immigrants and a repudiation of our long history of racism.Mr. Trump\u2019s order, if issued, will not only violate both the Constitution and deeply rooted American ideals, but also set a dangerous precedent. If the president can unilaterally abrogate a provision of the Constitution by executive order, which one will be next?Eric Foner is the author of many works of American history, including \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution, 1866-1877.\u201d His latest book, \u201cThe Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Forged a Constitutional Revolution,\u201d will appear next year.Advertisement"}

But it would be humane, it would adhere to the rule of law, and it would work. Ms. Nazario writes about immigration and asylum.An immigration lawyer once told me bluntly: Immigration is a wedge issue.I have covered immigration for three decades. I am the child of immigrants, the only one in my family born in this country. I have twice made the same journey those in the caravan are making, traveling the length of Mexico with Central American migrants. These people deserve our compassion. But I lived in Argentina during the military dictatorship, and I also believe that nations must preserve the rule of law. For anyone who actually wants to work to resolve the immigration issue \u2014 not just use it to bludgeon the other side \u2014 I have a plan. Neither Democrats nor Republicans will love all of it. But it is relatively humane and fair, it would keep more migrants at home, where most would rather live and, unlike President Trump\u2019s proposal, it would actually adhere to the rule of law. Even those who say they are leaving their countries because they lack jobs are often indirect victims of violence and political corruption. I have spent time in a neighborhood in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, where a majority of businesses have shut down because gangs demand weekly war taxes. Failure to pay equals death. People have lost hope that anything will change in these countries. We should not be surprised that they are voting with their feet.We have been revoltingly inhumane. And yet, they keep coming.So here\u2019s my proposal. First, we must address the violence and despair that are pushing migrants out of these three countries. The good news is we already know how to reduce violence and corruption, and strengthen good government. In Honduras, the United States has been running pilot violence prevention programs since 2014. In neighborhoods like Rivera Hern\u00e1ndez in San Pedro Sula we have funded outreach centers where children can find mentors and help getting jobs, cutting off the gangs\u2019 lifeblood: new recruits. We put children most at risk of joining gangs in family counseling. And most important, we went after killers. I get blowback from liberals when I advocate this kind of meddling in Central America. I understand; I covered the wars in Central America. Yes, the United States has done a lot of bad things there. We supported right-wing regimes; deported some 300,000 criminals who added rocket fuel to fledgling gang violence in these countries; and squeezed cocaine traffickers\u2019 routes so that they rerouted drug flights, and the attendant violence, through Central America instead of the Caribbean. We are the source of much of the mayhem there.But now some of what we are doing is actually working. Shouldn\u2019t we do much more of it?It not only works, it is cost effective: When I investigated these pilot programs in 2016, they cost about $100 million a year, pocket change compared to the billions we spend dealing with migrants once they reach our border.While we work to address root causes, we must remain compassionate toward those who make it to our borders and ask for safety. Our laws protect their right to do so.This fiscal year, 50,036 unaccompanied migrant children were apprehended coming to the United States. They wouldn\u2019t even fill up half a Penn State football stadium. That\u2019s refugee dust, as one friend quipped \u2014 especially given the fact that the world is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II. We should instead release asylum applicants, even if it involves outfitting them with ankle monitors. We must also ensure that these hearings involve real due process. Children who arrive in this country alone are not entitled to a government-funded lawyer. And so children \u2014 toddlers even \u2014 are expected to argue complex asylum cases on their own. This makes a sham of our judicial system.Here\u2019s the part liberals will hate. We must be tougher toward immigrants who get real due process but still lose their asylum cases. We should empower and fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement to find, arrest and deport 100 percent of those who lose their cases. That\u2019s the rule of law.Republicans need a compassionate plan. Democrats need an actual plan. Or the caravans will continue. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shaking My Faith in America", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bloodshed in the Tree of Life synagogue is a sign that hatred of The Other is poisoning our public life.Mr. Fineman is an NBC News analyst and a journalism lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania.WASHINGTON \u2014 I grew up in Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue. My parents taught Sunday school there. I learned to read Hebrew (sort of) there. I was a bar mitzvah there. My mother sewed a fancy velvet jumper for my little sister to wear there.My response is grief, of course, and the immediate realization that this horror is part of a larger pattern of mayhem and hatred in America and around the world. Churches, minority communities, gay nightclubs, politicians and journalists are threatened. We live in an age of assault rifles, pipe bombs and bone saws.But I also have to admit \u2014 and am grieved to admit \u2014 that the mass murder at Tree of Life has shaken my perhaps na\u00efve faith in this country, one that I began developing as a boy growing up in Pittsburgh.The predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood has a bucolic-sounding name, and it fits. It is bounded on two sides by huge, wooded parks. The streets of mostly single-family homes are lined with lush trees; there is easy access to universities, civic institutions, playing fields and excellent schools.I was reared in a Jewish paradise \u2014 a.k.a. America, my Promised Land. Not the one God gave us (though I love that one, too), but the one we chose for ourselves.I was taught in Squirrel Hill that we were in the one country that was an exception to the history of the human race in general and the Jews in particular. Founded on Enlightenment principles of individuality, freedom, tolerance and justice, the United States was the only place besides Israel where Jews could live at one with their nation, unburdened by fear or confusion about identity.Now I must wonder: If Pittsburgh isn\u2019t safe for Jews, if Squirrel Hill isn\u2019t safe, if the Tree of Life isn\u2019t safe, what place is? Without diminishing anyone else\u2019s suffering and death, it\u2019s a sad fact that the Jews often are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political collapse. So, what does the bloodshed in the Tree of Life mean?It is a sign that hatred of The Other is poisoning our public life. It\u2019s always been a vivid strain in America, stimulated by the stress of immigrant waves, but one we have overcome time and again. Although we often honor it in the breach, our founding idea remains: that each person here is precious and born with unalienable rights. Now, political enemies in America deny each other\u2019s humanity.It is a sign that communications can foster something less than understanding. Social media allows us to be connected but also caricatured as propaganda in campaigns of dehumanizing division.It is a sign that President Trump\u2019s remorselessly cynical, jungle-style vision of how to conduct business and politics is ripping apart a society already under the stress of generational, demographic, technological, economic and social change.In physics, the arc of a swinging pendulum diminishes over time. That has been my perhaps too-comfortable view of American history: that the swing of our political pendulum would always slow and find an equilibrium closer to a more perfect union.In pursuit of that theory, as a reporter in Kentucky for six years and later across the country for decades, I chronicled the rise of the populist right as just another swing of the pendulum.I covered Ku Klux Klan rallies, court-ordered busing, \u201cdirty tricksters\u201d of the right from Richard Nixon to Paul Manafort, and Trump rallies across the country. None of that shook my belief that the country could somehow harvest the energy of protest against \u201celites\u201d for some eventual good.Now I am not so sure. The pendulum seems to be swinging more wildly and widely every day. The whole machinery feels in danger of racing out of control.But even as I begin to doubt that my Pittsburgh was the Promised Land, I remain guided and inspired by it. My late parents, Morton and Jean Fineman, were teachers who loved America even as they fretted about its shortcomings. They always reminded me that, in a democracy \u2014 and only in a democracy \u2014 people get the government they deserve, and that each new generation must work hard to win anew the rights and blessings that we take for granted.I only hope that the martyrs of the Tree of Life \u2014 like those in Charleston, Charlottesville and other mass shootings motivated by hate \u2014 did not die in vain. America\u2019s gifts are not easily preserved \u2014 even, I now know, in Squirrel Hill.Howard Fineman is an NBC News analyst and a journalism lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

Then, using a high-powered spectrometer, the team studied the ratios of different proteins for telltale signs of various foods.\u201cBased on the premise that you are what you eat, we can use different bone chemistry signatures \u2014 we call them stable isotope values \u2014 to determine differences in diets between individuals in the past,\u201d said Dr. Guiry. \u201cYou could see there was a big difference between rats that lived in the city and rats that lived in farmsteads and rural areas.\u201dThose differences weren\u2019t limited to the kinds of foods the rats ate. Because the bones came from multiple sites, the researchers were able to discern far greater dietary consistency among the city rats than among the country ones.\u201cAcross all the different sites in the urban area, rat diets didn\u2019t differ much,\u201d said Dr. Guiry. \u201cBut when we looked at rural areas, rat diets were all over the map.\u201dTo better understand those rural diets, the researchers also analyzed the remains of other animals living in those areas at the time, including raccoons and groundhogs. They found quite a bit of overlap, suggesting that brown rats, which may have come over on boats from Europe in the 1800s, were an early introduced species that competed for resources with North America\u2019s native animals.More urgently, he said, the method could hold promise for studying rat behavior in cities and controlling rat infestations, a task that costs billions of dollars every year.\u201cThis has given us an overview of how rats are eating and behaving over a long period of time in an urban area,\u201d Dr. Guiry said. \u201cAnd food is really important to how they reproduce.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My Republican Dad Is Voting for a Democrat ", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe\u2019s casting his ballot for Jon Tester, who is less of a cookie-cutter Democrat and more of a Bull Moose wild card, \u201ca Montanan who understands Montana.\u201d Contributing Opinion ColumnistBOZEMAN, Mont. \u2014 Montana has the highest suicide rate in the United States. For starters, there\u2019s the random geographical bad luck that the altitude of the state\u2019s six most populous cities exceeds 3,000 feet, the elevation at which blood oxygen levels go down and suicide stats go way up. Along with seven Indian reservations and agriculture being a leading industry \u2014 farmers and natives are more likely to end their own lives than other Americans \u2014 veterans make up about 10 percent of the state\u2019s population. According to the new Veterans Affairs secretary, Robert Wilkie, every day, 22 American vets kill themselves.So I guess it stands to reason that in a state so hellbent on suicide, its citizens would seriously consider voting for a merciless, skinflint presidential bootlicker like Matt Rosendale. The Cook Political Report just slid the Montana race for the United States Senate between Mr. Rosendale and the incumbent, Jon Tester, into the \u201ctossup\u201d category.For weeks, most commercial breaks on Montana television have featured one of the tongue-in-cheek ads scolding Mr. Rosendale for referring to himself as a rancher even though he\u2019s never owned a single head of cattle, much less a brand. Of course the tagline is \u201cMatt Rosendale: All hat, no cattle.\u201d The rancher fib does make him seem less trustworthy, plus weirdly ignorant of the fact that ranches by definition require, like, livestock \u2014 a sticking point in a state where cattle is the No. 1 agricultural product.My dad and I both have a soft spot for Theodore Roosevelt, and one way to understand Senator Tester\u2019s bipartisan appeal is that he\u2019s less of a cookie-cutter Democrat and more of a Bull Moose wild card. He voted against confirming Brett Kavanaugh, but he\u2019s just as ardent about shoring up funding for Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls or the reconstruction of Glacier National Park's Going-to-the-Sun Road.The ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee representing a state with about 100,000 vets, Senator Tester made national headlines and incurred presidential wrath by demanding a better nominee to head Veterans Affairs than Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson. But when presented with President Trump\u2019s second choice, the more sober Mr. Wilkie, Senator Tester voted to confirm him, assuring Secretary Wilkie at his first committee hearing, \u201cI sincerely, and I mean this, I want you to succeed, man.\u201dMr. Rosendale\u2019s views on education alone locate him in some kooky, extremist netherworld that makes him way weirder than Montana\u2019s Republican senator, Steve Daines. Last month, a video surfaced in which Mr. Rosendale asserted that this country needs to \u201cmove the federal government out of the funding that takes place for the colleges and universities.\u201dDoes that include Montana\u2019s two public universities established by the federal government through two separate acts of Congress \u2014 a Congress Mr. Rosendale is hoping to join? Is he aware that in a state ranked 37 in median income, federal support in the form of Pell grants and student loans is the only way some working-class Montanans can afford to attend those universities and acquire the economically crucial credentials needed for this state to finally earn more than those smug North Dakotans?Does Mr. Rosendale understand that Montana\u2019s farms, ranches and industries depend on the federally funded research performed at those universities? Last year, Senator Daines, who is, along with Senator Tester, a member of the Small Brewers Caucus, announced that he was \u201cthrilled\u201d about a $300,000 federal Department of Agriculture grant to the Rocky Mountain Malting Barley Cooperative. When Matt Rosendale looks in the mirror, does he honestly see a face that will ever be \u201cthrilled\u201d about barley?There is obvious wisdom in an agricultural state electing a farmer such as Mr. Tester as its senator. But before he turned his full attention to managing his grandparents\u2019 homestead, Senator Tester was a public school music teacher in his central Montana hometown. As a constituent who was partly raised by the music teachers of Bozeman\u2019s public schools, I know that it also makes sense, given the cacophony of the United States Congress, to dispatch a Montanan to Washington who knows how to inspire a bunch of squirrelly kids to work together, keep the beat and harmonize. Music teachers show their students how to read a score. The same orchestral logic applies to representing a big state with a few people. Every player \u2014 every firefighter, hiker, old Marine, child with Down syndrome and barley researcher, each lonesome soul driving a tractor into the sunset and all the reservation girls gone missing \u2014 everybody counts.Sarah Vowell, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \"The Wordy Shipmates\u201d and \u201cLafayette in the Somewhat United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They never have to know.View this recipe in your weekly plan._____Melissa Clark brilliance, and a pretty fun way to do dinner. Melissa bakes the bacon on a sheet pan, which is objectively the best way to do it. Add rice (make extra to serve with the shakshuka below, if you like) and a can of black beans to round out the meal, and try to follow her suggestion and add a ripe avocado to the taco \u2014 which technically makes it a BLAT taco.

Serve with tortillas, hot sauce and cheese; you could add rice here, too.View this recipe in your weekly plan._____A superb and simple way to do dinner: Sprinkle cod with a mixture of white miso, ginger, garlic, butter and panko bread crumbs, and then bake until that coating caramelizes and crisps. This recipe includes broccoli and brown rice, for a full meal. Miso lasts forever in the fridge, but that won\u2019t be an issue regardless.

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook.

He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company.

Numbers like these suggest that whether or not hackers manage to gain access to voting systems, they have already achieved their main goal, which is to sow pervasive doubt over the integrity of American elections. Whoever wins, this lack of confidence is as damaging to the nation\u2019s democracy as it is to its national security. And it drives down turnout at the polls, as voters who are already skeptical of the political process begin to believe not just that their vote won\u2019t count, but that it literally won\u2019t be counted.What to make of it all?Now for some good news. Elections officials have become acutely aware of these risks to America\u2019s electoral security, especially after the wake-up call they got in 2016.

{"Headline": "Jair Bolsonaro Wins Brazil\u2019s Presidency, in a Shift to the Far Right", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe won by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in Brazil \u2014 a country whiplashed by rising crime and two years of political and economic turmoil \u2014 and by presenting himself as the alternative.He appeared eager to dispel concerns that he would govern despotically, saying his government would be a \u201cdefender of the Constitution, democracy and liberty.\u201dWith 98 percent of votes counted, Mr. Bolsonaro was ahead with 55 percent, guaranteeing him a win over Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, who had 45 percent.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s seaside home in Rio de Janeiro, jumping and hugging one another when the results were announced. As golden fireworks lit up the sky, they chanted \u201cmito,\u201d or legend, paying homage to their president-elect.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory caps a bitter contest that divided families, tore friendships apart and ignited concerns about the resilience of Brazil\u2019s young democracy.Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, a former army captain who has been a member of Congress for nearly three decades, beat a crowded field of presidential contenders, several of whom entered the race with bigger war chests, less baggage and the backing of powerful political parties.Mr. Bolsonaro said that President Trump called to congratulate him, calling it \u201cobviously a very friendly contact.\u201dHis Workers\u2019 Party had won the last four presidential elections, and Mr. da Silva, a former metalworker, retained a devoted following among poor and working-class Brazilians who felt represented by him personally and had benefited from his party\u2019s social inclusion policies.Despite his influence, Mr. da Silva was not able to pull off the last-minute transfer of votes to the candidate chosen to replace him on the ballot, the bookish and urbane \u2014 but less charismatic \u2014 Mr. Haddad.And for those Brazilians who saw the political establishment they inherited from the Workers\u2019 Party as venal, Mr. Bolsonaro was an enthralling candidate.He accomplished little in his long legislative career, but his roster of offensive remarks \u2014 he said that he\u2019d rather his son die than be gay and that women don\u2019t deserve the same pay as men \u2014 was interpreted by many as bracing honesty and evidence of his willingness to shatter the status quo.\u201cThe way he\u2019s run his campaign is very clever,\u201d said Matias Spektor, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas University. \u201cHe has managed to align himself with the institutions that Brazilians still believe in: religion, family and armed forces.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, the patriarch of a family from Rio de Janeiro that includes three sons who are also lawmakers, ran an insurgent campaign that defied the political playbook that brought his predecessors to power.Yet, the vitriol and outrage Mr. Bolsonaro brought to the campaign trail as he traveled around the country largely mirrored Brazilians\u2019 dystopian mood.Nearly 13 million people are unemployed. The homicide rate is among the highest in the world \u2014 last year, 63,880 people were killed. And Mr. da Silva, the former president many had idolized, had left office with an approval rating of 87 percent only to become the most prominent scalp taken by a corruption scandal that has ensnared dozens of the country\u2019s political and business leaders.Part of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal lay in the extreme solutions he proposed to assuage the population\u2019s anger and fear of violence.\u201cViolence must be reduced because otherwise we are headed toward total chaos,\u201d said Roberto Levi, 36, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro.While rivals spent small fortunes on marketing firms, video editors and consultants, Mr. Bolsonaro relied primarily on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to communicate with voters and expand his base.Opponents enjoyed far more advertising time on television and radio \u2014 which is allotted by party size \u2014 and rolled out slickly edited campaign materials. But Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign drowned them out with a bare-bones, scrappy communications strategy. He and his sons broadcast shaky, poorly lit videos on Facebook and Instagram in which Mr. Bolsonaro cracked jokes, took aim at adversaries and bemoaned the state of Brazil.One dominant message, spread widely via WhatsApp, asserted with no evidence that Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s opponents encouraged schoolchildren to become gay or reconsider their gender identity by employing sex education materials referred to as \u201cgay kits.\u201d\u201cI like what Bolsonaro stands for,\u201d said Cintia Puerta, 55, an architect in S\u00e3o Paulo, said Sunday after voting. \u201cMy sister works in a school so I know they are teaching \u2018gay kits\u2019 to children, teaching them about sexuality at age 5 and 6. They\u2019re indoctrinating children in the school.\u201dAfter that, Mr. Bolsonaro declined to participate in debates and did few probing interviews, leaving significant gaps in the electorate\u2019s understanding of his position on pivotal issues, including pension reform and the privatization of state enterprises.In the wake of the attack, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s standing in the polls rose steadily after languishing in the low 20-percent range for weeks. Last-minute endorsements from the influential evangelical lobby and agribusiness leaders gave him a boost.After the first round of voting, in which Mr. Bolsonaro received just shy of the 50 percent required to win outright, some political analysts expected him to moderate his rhetoric in order to appeal to centrist or undecided voters.They were wrong.Last Sunday, he issued a threat to members of the Workers\u2019 Party that critics called downright fascist.For the Workers\u2019 Party, Sunday\u2019s presidential defeat leaves a political movement that won accolades from much of the population for affirmative action and inequality-reducing policies significantly weakened and effectively leaderless.Party luminaries hoped that Mr. da Silva, a lion of Latin America\u2019s left known as Lula, would return to the presidential palace. Even after Mr. da Silva was jailed, party leaders said that \u201can election without Lula is fraud.\u201dWhen courts made clear Mr. da Silva would not be allowed to run, and the Workers\u2019 Party nominated Mr. Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the campaign\u2019s slogan was \u201cHaddad is Lula.\u201dDuring his campaign, Mr. Haddad visited Mr. da Silva in prison multiple times, and did little to take responsibility for the party\u2019s mistakes. This lack of atonement pushed many hesitant Brazilians toward Mr. Bolsonaro, said Mr. Mainwaring, the Harvard professor.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party strategy was centered too much around Lula and too little around thinking about the future of the country and about winning this election,\u201d he said. \u201cAn important part of the Brazilian electorate would have voted for the P.T. if it had drawn a line in the sand and renounced the corruption of the past.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es and Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Tackles Rising Threat: Americans Aping Russian Schemes to Deceive", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Dr. Blasey testified, Right Wing News posted several false stories about her \u2014 including the suggestion that her lawyers were being bribed by Democrats \u2014 and then used the network of Facebook pages and accounts to share the pieces so that they proliferated online quickly, social media researchers said.The result was a real-time spreading of disinformation started by Americans, for Americans.\u201cThere are now well-developed networks of Americans targeting other Americans with purposefully designed manipulations,\u201d said Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher at the New Media Frontier, a firm that studies social media.Politics has always involved shadings of the truth via whisper campaigns, direct-mail operations and negative ads bordering on untrue. What is different this time is how domestic sites are emulating the Russian strategy of 2016 by aggressively creating networks of Facebook pages and accounts \u2014 many of them fake \u2014 that make it appear as if the ideas they are promoting enjoy widespread popularity, researchers said. The activity is also happening on Twitter, they said.The shift toward domestic disinformation raises potential free speech issues when Facebook and Twitter find and curtail such accounts that originate in the United States, an issue that may be sensitive before the midterms. \u201cThese networks are trying to manipulate people by manufacturing consensus \u2014 that\u2019s crossing the line over free speech,\u201d said Ryan Fox, a co-founder of New Knowledge, a firm that tracks disinformation.This month, Twitter took down a network of 50 accounts that it said were being run by Americans posing as Republican state lawmakers. Twitter said the accounts were geared toward voters in all 50 states.On Thursday, Facebook said it had identified 559 pages and 251 accounts run by Americans, many of which amplified false and misleading content in a coordinated fashion. The company said it would remove the pages and accounts. Among them were Right Wing News, which had more than 3.1 million followers, and left-wing pages that included the Resistance and Reverb Press, which had 240,000 and 816,000 followers.Facebook said this amounted to the most domestic pages and accounts it had ever removed related to influence campaigns. The company said it had discovered the activity as part of its broader effort to root out election interference. Also, the pages had become more aggressive in using tactics like fake accounts and multiple pages to make themselves appear more popular.\u201cIf you look at volume, the majority of the information operations we see are domestic actors,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of security. He added that the company was struggling with taking down the domestic networks because of the blurry lines between free speech and disinformation.Mr. Gleicher said that the accounts and pages that Facebook took down on Thursday violated its rules about online spam and that many of the domestic organizations probably had financial motivations for spreading disinformation. The organization can make money by getting people to click on links in Facebook that then direct users to websites filled with ads. Once someone visits the ad-filled website, those clicks means more ad revenue.But while traditional spam networks typically use celebrity gossip or stories about natural disasters to get people to click on links that take them to ad-filled sites, these networks were now using political content to attract people\u2019s attention.\u201cToday, sensational political content seems to be a more effective way for people to build an audience for their pages and drive traffic to their websites, which earn them money for every visitor to the site,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said.Administrators for the Facebook page for the Resistance did not respond to requests for comment. Ed Lynn, who runs Reverb Press, said he had no advance notice that Facebook would be removing the page. \u201cI believe Facebook has made a mistake where Reverb Press is concerned. We are a legitimate American news and opinion publication,\u201d Mr. Lynn said in a statement. He said he was appealing Facebook\u2019s decision.While domestic disinformation multiplies, foreign disinformation appears to be less prominent \u2014 or may be more hidden. That may be because Facebook and other social media companies have adopted measures to hunt for and remove foreign interference on their sites.Domestic disinformation is harder to root out than foreign disinformation, researchers said, because in many cases it mirrors genuine networks of Americans engaging in free speech online. Social media services can act to remove domestic disinformation only when the American groups that are making and distributing it start to use techniques that violate the companies\u2019 terms of service, such as creating false accounts.\u201cFacebook\u2019s tactics are extremely ineffective in stopping these networks of hundreds of Facebook pages and accounts from spreading disinformation,\u201d said Natalie Martinez, a fellow at Media Matters, a nonprofit in Washington that monitors disinformation from conservative American sites. \u201cUltimately, if you are a U.S. national and you decide to share something, the social networks have no reason to stop you.\u201dFacebook said the Right Wing News page on the social network was redirecting traffic to the Right Wing News website to drive up its ad revenue, and that administrators for the page appeared to change regularly. Facebook said some of the administrators ran multiple Facebook accounts under the same names, which the social network does not allow.Over the past few months, Right Wing News\u2019 Facebook page has increased its activity, researchers said. During the time that then-Judge Kavanaugh testified in Congress, Right Wing News \u2014 and several Facebook pages that mirror it by posting the same content \u2014 pushed out numerous articles that questioned the veracity of a lie-detector test that Dr. Blasey had taken and why she had come forward with her accusations.Facebook said the ad was paid for by Right Wing News and was allowed according to its rules, which let American citizens and residents place political ads. Though Facebook has since taken down the Daily Vine page, and the ad is no longer running, it was viewed as many as 50,000 times between June 19 and June 20, according to Facebook\u2019s metrics. The Daily Vine could not be reached for comment.Ms. Martinez said Facebook\u2019s actions against Right Wing News and other domestic disinformation networks would stem some of the flow of false content \u2014 but only for a little while.\u201cThere is little to stop them from spawning off as a new page, or account, and just starting to build their network again,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can just keep trying to get around Facebook\u2019s rules.\u201dKevin Roose and Max Fisher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

California being California, the ballots will be full of confusing ballot initiatives, one of the more contentious of which is a statewide rent control measure called Proposition 10.Specifically, it prevents cities from applying rent control to single-family homes and apartments built after 1995. It also ensures that landlords can raise rents as much as they like after a rent-controlled tenant leaves.The evictions and economic displacement that have accompanied rising home prices have awakened a long-dormant renters\u2019 movement. Proposition 10\u2019s main backer, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles, has promised to bring it back if voters reject it this year.

Medications are crammed into plastic tubs, and in the garden of her four-bedroom home stands a 290-gallon water tank.Nevine Mann is not readying herself for the threat of nuclear war, flooding or civil disorder in this part of Cornwall, in scenic southwest England. No, the specter that keeps her on edge is Brexit.\u201cPeople are talking about World War II and rationing,\u201d said Ms. Mann, a former midwife. \u201cPeople have also been talking about the blackouts in the 1970s, and how power was rationed.\u201d\u201cThis has the potential of being a combination of the two,\u201d she said.The government of Prime Minister Theresa May dismisses such talk, but its own ministers have published contingency plans for an exit on March 29 without a deal, and for the first time since the end of rationing in the 1950s, Britain has a minister responsible for food supplies. More ominously, the government has advertised job openings in emergency planning.Such measures may be intended to increase Britain\u2019s leverage in negotiations with Brussels, but they also signal to many people that there is a real possibility of a crisis, at least for a while.\u201cWe can\u2019t change a lot of things, but we can be ready for the worst possible outcome, because nobody died from being over-prepared,\u201d said the leaflet\u2019s author, James Patrick, a security consultant and former police officer. \u201cWe have a long history of being taken by surprise by predictable events.\u201dMr. Patrick, who lives in the East Midlands region of England, says that people need not stock large quantities of food, and that his family has enough for only a week. \u201cThis is a case of having some candles as well as a torch, a battery-powered radio, perhaps a solar-powered phone charger,\u201d he said, rejecting any parallel to doomsday preppers who prepare to barricade themselves in remote places with enough supplies for months or years.\u201cYou just need two cupboards of food and some extra toilet roll,\u201d he said, \u201cand coffee \u2014 because a lot of it comes through Germany \u2014 unless you fancy roasting acorns.\u201dSo divisive is the issue of Brexit that some of its supporters see \u201cpreppers\u201d as alarmists who want to scare the population into rethinking the whole idea.When Howard Hardiman, an artist who lives on a remote Scottish island, wrote on Twitter that he was stockpiling because he lives at the end of the supply chain, he drew abuse online from supporters of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.But even if the two sides reach an accord, it would still need approval from Parliament, where hard-line Brexit supporters in Mrs. May\u2019s fractious Conservative Party are threatening to wreck any agreement because of her proposal to keep some close economic ties to the bloc. Instead, they want a much cleaner break, with some insisting that there is nothing to fear from a no-deal Brexit.Analysts say that the possibility of disorderly rupture cannot be discounted \u2014 something that brings with it the risk of disruption to supplies and a decline in the value of the British currency, which would in turn drive up the costs of imported food and other goods (another reason to stockpile).Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation, an industry group, said there was no sign so far of strains on supplies but predicted that stockpiling by consumers would start in earnest if there was no agreement on Brexit by next month. The supermarket chain Tesco has said it is discussing contingency plans to keep more dried goods.For those reliant on imported medication, a disorderly Brexit is a particular worry, and the government has asked pharmaceutical companies to store six weeks\u2019 supply of medication, though what would happen after that remains unclear. Supplies might be flown in, bypassing clogged ports, but experts say a no-deal exit could also interfere with air travel, grounding many flights from the European Union.\u201cI feel physically sick if I think about it,\u201d said Jo Elgarf, a member of the 48 Percent Preppers group who lives in London and whose 4-year-old daughter relies on imported drugs to stop seizures. Because they have to be prescribed, she cannot stock more than a four-week supply.\u201cThere is no way I can protect my child, I am completely reliant on other people,\u201d she said.Ms. Mann, who takes anti-epilepsy and blood-thinning drugs, also worries about medication, and she says she can do little other than make sure her prescriptions are up-to-date.As for food, she said that she thinks she would be able to get local produce if shipping were disrupted, but admitted that she had became concerned at the end of last year, when Brexit negotiations were stalling. So she started buying extra cans and more dried food and fruit \u2014 items with a long shelf life \u2014 when she went shopping every two weeks. Then she added pet food (both her cat and her dog require special diets), and bought seeds to grow fruit and vegetables in the garden.She has equipment to purify rain water, and her roof is covered with solar panels \u2014 though she is waiting for hardware to allow the panels to supply the house in a blackout.Some of the darker predictions of food shortages causing disorder do not really weigh on Ms. Mann, who thinks it unlikely that Cornwall, less densely populated than the major cities, would see looting.\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily have to think about leaving and hiding in the woods or something because we are tucked away in the bottom end of the country,\u201d she said.Ms. Mann acknowledges that the idea of stockpiling seems \u201csurreal,\u201d but takes accusations of scaremongering in stride. \u201cWe are still going to use everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said, \u201cand, if we don\u2019t, then people are going to benefit from it through food banks.\u201d\u201cIf we are panicking for nothing,\u201d she added, \u201cdoes it matter?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Introducing the Internet Bill of Rights", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats promise that if they win back the House, they will start regulating Silicon Valley.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. In an interview with me this week, Nancy Pelosi even suggested that a new agency could be created to manage tech\u2019s growing impact. \u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d she told me, to \u201cprotect the privacy of the American people\u201d and \u201ccome up with overarching values\u201d \u2014 a set of principles that everyone can agree on and adhere to.Call it a Bill of Rights for the internet.To set the table, let\u2019s be clear that the tech industry has long operated nearly unfettered, aided by laws that have given its major companies broad immunity and an open plain on which to operate. The goal was to foster and encourage innovation. And like the pioneers who once set out for California to make their fortune, tech companies have thrived in that regulation-free landscape.But will it be too little, too late? Consider Mr. Khanna\u2019s list of principles, which begins by stating:\u201cThe internet age and digital revolution have changed Americans\u2019 way of life. As our lives and the U.S. economy are more tied to the internet, it is essential to provide Americans with basic protections online.\u201dIn short: Horse, meet barn door.The second says consumers should have to give their permission \u2014 an \u201copt in\u201d rather than \u201copt out\u201d system \u2014 before their data can be collected and shared with third parties. I like to call it the anti-Cambridge Analytica rule.Mr. Khanna noted that this requirement must be fulfilled in a way that is not onerous \u2014 consumers shouldn\u2019t have to click on something affirming their consent every time data is collected, for example. \u201cIf you have to click on something 50 times, it kind of defeats the purpose,\u201d he said.The third principle moves into a dicier area: the right \u201cto obtain, correct, or delete personal data controlled by any company.\u201d In Europe, this idea has manifested as the controversial \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws, which wouldn\u2019t fly here. Because of First Amendment issues, and also to prevent anyone from removing information that is merely critical, Mr. Khanna added a caveat that covers a lot of sins: \u201cwhere context appropriate and with a fair process.\u201dAnd so on down the list: The fourth centers on timely notifications in the case of breaches. The fifth would give consumers the right to move their data (called data portability). The sixth calls for making net neutrality a law rather than a regulation that gets Ping-Ponged every time a new administration takes office. The seventh would hinder big internet access providers like AT&T and Verizon from collecting more data than is necessary for the rendering of services. The eighth addresses fostering competition. The ninth would protect consumers from being \u201cunfairly discriminated against or exploited based on your personal data.\u201d And the tenth would demand that companies that collect personal data practice \u201creasonable business practices and accountability to protect your privacy.\u201dYou could call that last one the Equifax/Facebook/Yahoo conundrum: How do we protect consumers from endless data incursions and hacking by bad actors while also getting all the benefits of a fully networked society?It\u2019s an admirable list, but I suspect that if Democrats try to turn these principles into law, it will be like pushing back the ocean, especially since the business models of many of these companies are predicated on sucking up as much data as they can and exploiting it for gain. The consumer is the product \u2014 as much as insiders at companies like Facebook scoff at the idea.Mr. Khanna said he gets that it will be a slow road, and it will definitely require bipartisan support.\u201cThis is a 15-year fight, but I do not think tech is immediately primed against it and Congress is more willing to be strong on regulation,\u201d he told me. \u201cTech is amoral \u2014 it is great in many ways but not as great in others, and they need to now spend the next 10 years thinking about how they shape that tech for public good.\u201dMs. Pelosi said that national legislation does not have to be hostile, noting that tech companies know that public sentiment is turning against them. She said that more and more people are \u201caware that there is some vulnerability with the status quo\u201d and that she believes that \u201clegislation would get public support.\u201dIt already has in Europe \u2014 which has become the leader in stopping tech\u2019s aggressive march \u2014 and in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s home state, California, which has passed many of the kinds of laws that Congress should be considering.Recent legislation out of Sacramento has included the nation\u2019s most significant privacy law, as well as another on net neutrality (which is now being challenged by the Trump Justice Department) and even one to require publicly traded companies operating in the state to have at least one woman on their board.The federal government is very late to the party, but Ms. Pelosi promised that if Democrats get back the House in November, there will be a push for action.\u201cIt is not a question of being antagonistic, but being ready to find a better way for the future,\u201d she said, noting how quickly change has come via tech. \u201cThink backward a dozen years and look forward a decade. Like they say, you haven\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201dIt\u2019s certainly well past time to see something from the politicians whose job it is to protect the rest of us.You should have the right:(1) to have access to and knowledge of all collection and uses of personal data by companies;(2) to opt-in consent to the collection of personal data by any party and to the sharing of personal data with a third party;(3) where context appropriate and with a fair process, to obtain, correct or delete personal data controlled by any company and to have those requests honored by third parties;(4) to have personal data secured and to be notified in a timely manner when a security breach or unauthorized access of personal data is discovered;(5) to move all personal data from one network to the next;(6) to access and use the internet without internet service providers blocking, throttling, engaging in paid prioritization or otherwise unfairly favoring content, applications, services or devices;(7) to internet service without the collection of data that is unnecessary for providing the requested service absent opt-in consent;(8) to have access to multiple viable, affordable internet platforms, services and providers with clear and transparent pricing;(9) not to be unfairly discriminated against or exploited based on your personal data; and(10) to have an entity that collects your personal data have reasonable business practices and accountability to protect your privacy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s So Hard to Punish Companies for Data Breaches", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s difficult to determine how and where companies like Facebook went wrong, which makes regulation challenging.Ms. Wolff is an assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.At first glance, the lack of consequences that companies face for data breaches might seem to be a clear problem and something that can be easily remedied through heavy regulation like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. However, the problem turns out to be more complicated than that. Two challenges, in particular, have hindered effective legal and regulatory responses to breaches: determining whether a company was negligent in its security practices, and figuring out how to calculate the monetary value of stolen personal information and the harms inflicted on the people whose data was breached.The fact that your personal information was stolen from a company does not necessarily mean that the company did a poor job of securing your data and therefore deserves to be punished. The Facebook breach, for example, was made possible by three software vulnerabilities tied to user tools for privacy and for uploading birthday videos. These vulnerabilities might seem like problems that Facebook should have caught early on, but the truth is that every company has bugs like these in its software. The crucial question for determining Facebook\u2019s culpability for this breach is whether it should have been able to catch and fix those particular vulnerabilities sooner. Did the company test the code rigorously before releasing it? Did it ignore any warning signs or outside notifications about the bugs? Did it take swift action when it first realized something was wrong? Perhaps Facebook did absolutely everything right and was just unlucky. If that\u2019s the case, then it would be unfair and unproductive to penalize the company severely. On the other hand, if Facebook ignored several warning signs and failed to properly vet its new tools before releasing them, then it is entirely appropriate for the company to face a significant fine as an incentive to be more attentive to security in the future.What should happen to these companies? Ideally, they would face a combination of consequences that included both fines and corrective security measures. The fines would need to be hefty enough to motivate greater investment in data security and cover their customers\u2019 losses \u2014 recognizing not just lost money but also lost time, lost privacy and lost peace of mind \u2014 but not so hefty that the fines could never be enforced or would drive the company out of the country. We are caught between two extremes: a weak regulatory system in the United States that refuses to so much as investigate the Equifax breach and a fine-based scheme in Europe that is so harsh that regulators will never be able to impose the maximum allowable penalties. Neither of these systems comes close to striking the right balance of financial penalties mixed with corrective security measures. And until they do, companies will continue to escape serious consequences for their breaches.Advertisement"}

Curtis, issued a \u201cSpecial Alert\u201d on Facebook, noting that a verdict could come soon, and urging residents to \u201chelp me keep our neighborhood safe.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of anxiety when it comes to this case and what it says about relations between the police and residents,\u201d said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest who leads a South Side parish. \u201cThere\u2019s a segment of people who have almost completely given up their hope and belief in the system, and if nothing happens to the officer this time? There\u2019s a whole lot of folks that are going to say, \u2018That\u2019s my last chance of trying to believe in justice.\u2019 It\u2019ll set the relationship back decades.\u201dAt the center of the case are two people whose lives intersected for only seconds along a road on the Southwest Side on Oct. 20, 2014: Officer Van Dyke, 40, who joined the department 17 years ago and was described by a fellow officer as \u201cyour average Chicago police officer,\u201d and Laquan, who had recently turned 17 and had struggled, spending time in foster care and juvenile detention and wrestling with the death of a great-grandmother who helped raise him.After a truck driver reported someone breaking into vehicles in a parking lot that evening, police officers followed Laquan, who was carrying a three-inch pocketknife and refused to stop when they told him to. The pursuit \u2014 Laquan walking down the street and officers on foot and in squad cars behind him \u2014 ended when Officer Van Dyke arrived in a car, stepped out and shot him repeatedly, even as his body was crumpled on the street.\u201cThat video opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes,\u201d said the Rev. Ira Acree, a West Side minister. \u201cThere were people who really didn\u2019t know how bad it was out here, how corrupt it was, until that.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the knife in Laquan\u2019s hand that made the defendant kill him that night,\u201d a prosecutor, Jody Gleason, said during closing arguments. \u201cIt was his indifference to the value of Laquan\u2019s life.\u201d She reminded jurors that Officer Van Dyke had acknowledged telling his partner, before they even arrived, that they would have to shoot the person who was being chased.Calling Laquan \u201cthe author, the choreographer of this story,\u201d Daniel Herbert, Officer Van Dyke\u2019s defense lawyer, said that his client acted reasonably and lawfully when he opened fire.\u201cPolice are here to serve and protect,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t retreat. They can\u2019t run away like us.\u201dAs the jury began deliberations on Thursday afternoon, attention to the trial, which has been live-streamed on local news websites for days, has seemed mixed. Some people said the years it had taken to get to trial had made the issue fade some, and that they were only vaguely aware. Others, particularly in some of the South Side\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, said they were closely following the proceedings. Chicago, which has long wrestled with segregation and gun violence, has roughly equal numbers of white, black and Hispanic residents.\u201cHim getting off would just be almost a confirmation to a lot of people of color who feel like we are devalued here, we are discriminated against here,\u201d said Asiaha Butler, a resident association leader in Englewood, a South Side neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s so much racial bias here that no one wants to unpack and talk about.\u201dSome residents said it was unfair that unflattering parts of Laquan\u2019s past had been a focus of attention but Officer Van Dyke\u2019s past had not. There were indications that Laquan\u2019s life might have been steadying before he died: His mother was working to regain custody, and his school principal said he was \u201ccoming every day, joking and even giving hugs.\u201d Records show that Officer Van Dyke had at least 18 citizen complaints, including allegations of racial slurs and excessive force. In each case, he denied wrongdoing and was not disciplined.Fallout from the video has forced changes in the Police Department, including new rules for use of force. But people in Englewood said little felt different.\u201cThey can say what they want, but there\u2019s nothing different about the ways policemen act,\u201d said Robert Butler, 38. \u201cThey still ride around here like they own it.\u201dThe trial has also been watched intently by another group: Chicago police officers. Leaders of the police union sat alongside Officer Van Dyke\u2019s wife, Tiffany, in court, and some with ties to the Police Department have questioned the wisdom of prosecuting an officer for shooting an armed person. Officer Van Dyke, whom the city placed on unpaid leave after he was charged, has been working as a janitor at the police union.\u201cA majority of police officers know that they could be Jason, and they\u2019re watching it closely,\u201d said Brian Warner, a former Chicago police officer who met Officer Van Dyke in a support group for officers involved in shootings. \u201cIt\u2019s probably already slowed down others doing their job. Maybe they\u2019re not being as proactive as they were.\u201dHere, Mr. Acree said some people are waiting anxiously for the decision from the jury, which, some residents have noted with concern, includes only one black member. Other people have turned away entirely, Mr. Acree said, resigned to a sense that no police trial would ever end in conviction.\u201cThey\u2019re just numb, and saying, \u2018This is Chicago,\u2019\u201d Mr. Acree said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two cities.

As much as this is distorting, it also can be empowering.Similarly emboldening is when anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric is elevated or tolerated, either through appropriating the anti-Semites\u2019 rhetoric outright, \u201cdog-whistling\u201d to them, or allowing their hate to go unanswered. And this is what has accelerated over the past few years.Anti-Semitism is being normalized in public life.These incidents seem small, but add them together, nurture them with silence and acquiescence, and what grows is the poisonous weed of anti-Semitism.This must end.All Americans \u2014 online and in their communities \u2014 and all responsible leaders from across our society must step forward and clearly denounce this hate. People of all faiths and ideologies must speak out clearly and forcefully against anti-Semitism, scapegoating and bigotry in our society.If your candidate is attacking George Soros or the \u201cglobalists,\u201d or a member of Congress from your party is embracing Holocaust deniers, you must stand up and tell them to stop.If your allies in a range of social justice causes either explain away the anti-Semitism of the Nation of Islam by citing the good work they may do or justify demonizing the Jewish state of Israel and its existence, then they need to know that they can no longer be your ally.If your favorite social media platform continues to refuse to remove anti-Semitic garbage from its site, then vote with your clicks and deactivate your account.More than 100 years ago, the lynching of a Jewish factory superintendent, Leo Frank, in Marietta, Ga., shocked the Jewish community and the nation. It directly led to the formation of the A.D.L. to fight anti-Semitism.The Pittsburgh massacre should be a similar shock to us today, waking us up to the anti-Semitism and hate in our midst and reminding us all that the fight against them must be diligently fought at every turn by each and every one of us.Advertisement"}

Millie Tran, a global growth editor for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Then think of all the different and potential audience segments. Each will have slightly different formulas, and you have to constantly experiment, learn and calibrate. In practice, that means I\u2019m looking at a lot of data, reading a lot of reports, talking to a lot of people, trying to understand all these different contexts, and working to distill and communicate everything I\u2019m learning to the rest of the newsroom.What tech tools do you rely on to keep track of audience and expanding our audience?I\u2019m a big fan of contextualizing any number or piece of data, whether that\u2019s for benchmarking (is that higher or lower than we expected?) or explaining why we care about that figure (is it connected to our newsroom, to business goals or to both?). It\u2019s making a piece of information more sophisticated but also simplifying it. It comes down to our audience: How can I help my colleagues around the newsroom empathize more with our readers, viewers and listeners around the world?What is your personal tech setup like?It has changed a lot over the years. Almost a decade ago, I wrote my college senior thesis on cyberwar and taught a seminar on the same subject, so I used to be hypervigilant about all of that. Then, when I was working on the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and newsletter, I had my iPhone, an Android and lots of news apps to check out their push notifications, and email apps to test how an email would be experienced and read. (I was most recently the director of global adaptation at BuzzFeed.)Since starting work on international growth, I\u2019ve simplified my hardware \u2014 mostly one phone, an iPhone X, and my good old Moto X when I need to see something on Android \u2014 but I have as many apps as ever: 314.In terms of apps and software, I am constantly tinkering and trying new apps. For (mostly) work, it\u2019s the whole Google suite, Slack, Things for my to-dos, Bear for notes, Instapaper, Nuzzel, Spotify, Pocket Casts and, of course, the New York Times app. I\u2019m looking for a better mail app right now. The apps I use daily for everything else are Citymapper, Citi Bike, Weather Underground (though I have a whole folder of weather apps), Sleep Cycle and Nike Training.Translating our articles for non-English-speaking audiences is one growth avenue. What do you think of translation software? Or is it better to rely on people? Why?What tech do you and your family love outside of work? My best friends and family are all over the place, so there\u2019s a lot of video chatting through FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Facebook Messenger. I love randomly FaceTiming my friends.I travel to Vietnam every year to see my family, and it\u2019s incredible how quickly they\u2019ve all adopted Facebook, Uber and a bunch of other apps. Viber used to be the primary way for us to communicate, but now we\u2019re mostly chatting on Messenger.Finally, lots of travel sites and apps to find good flight deals to get to all of them!What do you do to take a break from tech?Honestly, I\u2019m rarely without my phone or some piece of technology and do believe in making tech work for me and my life, not the other way around. That said, I\u2019m a very tactile person, and you obviously lose a lot of that when you work on the internet. So I love activities like grocery and clothes shopping, and I love my plants and the deeply satisfying feeling of watching something you take care of grow. I\u2019m also looking for a pottery or drawing class right now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Believe in Ghosts", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCome to my family\u2019s house. You might believe, too.Contributing Opinion WriterDuring the search, my family drove farther and farther from Boston proper, to the center of the state, to look at farmhouses and estates and double-deckers. We had a weekly phone call on Sundays to discuss the finds. The primary question from my sisters and me, much to my mother\u2019s and brother-in-law\u2019s annoyance, was, \u201cIs the property haunted?\u201dAccording to Kerri, Massachusetts kept relocating its Native American population farther and farther west, as white New Englanders moved from the city and set up towns in previous expanses of woods and farmland. Our house was on the land of one of these reservations, for a part of a tribe that was especially despised because it consisted of Indians and blacks. They were moved out here in the 1830s, and then even this land was taken from them by the state, with vague promises, never fulfilled, to give them financial compensation.And so, we moved in.For the first few weeks, it was a constant calibration of whether there was a spirit present.\u201cHow are the kids adjusting?\u201d I asked every time I called home.\u201cIt\u2019s so quiet, they say they can hear the cows in the field a half-mile away,\u201d Kirsten said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re talking to them at night.\u201d We paused on this, to take in what it might mean. Definitely something to add to the pattern of things potentially being haunted. When someone new comes to visit for the first time, one of my sisters or I will usually ask if they have ever seen a ghost. Whether the person responds with enthusiasm or annoyance is usually a good gauge of whether they\u2019re going to enjoy hanging out with our family. When we were younger, we tended to make friends with girls who answered too enthusiastically, who would respond to \u201cHave you ever seen a ghost\u201d with an earnest \u201cYes, and he\u2019s looking at us right now, through the window!\u201d This also meant that having friends over sometimes ended in tears.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]The next time I stayed at the house, though, I saw it. Or rather, her. A figure in a cloak who was sitting on the couches in the living room, which I had to pass through to use the bathroom during the night. She was bent over, her face shrouded. I couldn\u2019t see her expression, but whatever radiated from her was something my mind registered as \u201cbenevolent\u201d and \u201cloving.\u201d This did not stop me from turning around immediately, running back to my bed in the other side of the house and locking the door behind me.For many nights, every time I slept in that room, there was an insistent knocking on the door, starting at 3 a.m.\u201cKaitlyn, that is a woodpecker,\u201d my mother said. She has no patience for the supernatural. It\u2019s because of her that I cultivate these feelings. She used to drive from our white suburb to the black children\u2019s bookstore three towns over for African and Caribbean folk tales. She loves ghost stories as part of our culture, but she\u2019d never actually mess with the supernatural herself. It\u2019s sort of like when my mother makes greens and uses Worcestershire sauce instead of ham hocks \u2014 she gave those up after too many relatives stopped eating pork in the 1970s. My mother, through extraordinary misfortune and just general bad luck, has had to move too many times in the past 20 years. She gave up a fear of ghosts a long time ago, if she ever had one. As long as a potential home is safe and clean, she doesn\u2019t see what the problem is. So, when I tell her I\u2019ve seen a ghost, she responds with \u201cOh, come on!\u201dWhen a ghost shows up in a story, it is often a way to talk about what cannot be said, what cannot be acknowledged \u2014 whether that is a repressed desire, a family secret, an unpunished crime or a genocide that some do not want to reckon with.\u201cShe likes that we are a family,\u201d I said.During evictions past, I adopted a superstition: Wherever I move, I always leave at least one box packed. It\u2019s an insurance against too quickly claiming a place you could just as easily lose. I\u2019ve done the same in this house \u2014 a shoe box of old mixtapes and the detritus of adolescence. Sometimes I leave them out when I visit, and when I return, someone has always packed them away, tidied them for me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Top End to Tasmania: Two Very Different Sides of Australia", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byplaces 42 and 43New and ancient rock art in the outback, and a bountiful island with a farmer-chic aesthetic.\u201cWhat do you want? What are you doing?\u201d my riverboat guide, Miyakoo Garnarradj, asked a crocodile who had slid off the muddy bank and was gliding through the water behind us, like a scaly Jean Valjean. Presumably, the croc was hoping to snack on the small children onboard, or perhaps lodge a complaint about the indignities of having to make his home in northern Australia\u2019s East Alligator River, which, according to local lore, got its name from a 19th-century British colonialist who couldn\u2019t tell his aquatic reptiles apart.The East Alligator River runs between Kakadu, with its campers set for hikes and waterfall plunges, and Arnhem Land, 75,000 square miles of outback that the Australian government set aside to be run by aboriginal custodians in 1930. Both fall under Unesco World Heritage designation as sanctums of aboriginal culture. Kakadu is traditional land that the parks department leases for recreational and educational purposes, while Arnhem Land requires a permit to enter and feels like a separate country that you can only reach by driving through the river, water splashing up to your windows.On an escarpment on the Arnhem Land side of the river, Miyakoo pointed out rock art. For thousands of years, his ancestors have been using mineral pigments, such as red hematite and yellow limonite, mixed with adhesives like water, blood and animal fat, to illustrate aspects of their culture on the sides and ceilings of rock shelters used during monsoons. Kakadu has two protected rock art sites, Nourlangie and Ubirr, set along walking paths and behind barriers. But in Arnhem Land, new art shows up constantly, often painted on top of older images. Miyakoo said he uses the paintings to find fish: \u201cWhen I see a rock art on an escarpment I don\u2019t know, I know this is where I can find barramundi,\u201d he said.Top End is also one of the few places where the 1986 smash comedy \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d comes up regularly in conversation. Several scenes were shot in Kakadu, including a scene in which Mick Dundee, played by Paul Hogan, grabs a snake that\u2019s headed for his love interest, Linda, and declares he\u2019s just saved her from a king brown. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the movie and it wasn\u2019t a king brown, it was a water python!\u201d Miyakoo said. He then laughed as if the mistake was hilarious, and I loved him even more. If the color green had a flavor, I imagine it might taste like fresh asparagus picked on a tiny countryside farm in southern Tasmania. I\u2019d never known asparagus to taste like it did that day \u2014 it reminded me of the sugar snap peas I used to eat off the vine when I was a kid visiting the home of a Kenyan woman named Wairimu, who had somehow managed to grow an African garden in the high desert of New Mexico.The key to the flavors I was experiencing, Rodney said, was Tasmania\u2019s uniquely hot summer days and cold nights. Here, vegetables ripen slowly and gain complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what these vegetables that people treat with disdain can teach us when we have them the way they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d He picked a purple leaf out of the ground and handed to me. It was mustard greens, which I\u2019ve always appreciated for their spicy kick, but had never known to be this subtle on the tongue.The contrast between Top End, with its sweltering heat and camper-van aesthetic, and Tasmania\u2019s farmer-chic sophistication was jarring. Traces of indigenous culture are also notably harder to find, the result of massacres and mass resettlements; Tasmania's history in that regard is particularly bleak. Several Aussies I\u2019d met had made jokes about Tasmania seeming to be a tad behind \u2014 something that can happen when a state is founded as a colony of convicts that builds a society in isolation. But as I visited its wild coastlines, its cheese makers and vodka distillers, I wondered if the island state of Tasmania had fallen so far behind the rest of Australia that it had inadvertently become the leader of the country\u2019s agrarian movement.They\u2019d founded the Agrarian Kitchen to fill that gap, but couldn\u2019t have anticipated the way the food market would move to all artisanal all the time. \u201cThat culture of people growing their own produce came back into fashion,\u201d Rodney said. \"But here it never went away.\"The stream of art tourists who come to see Mona and then make a week of it, was enough to sustain the kind of restaurant culture that Tasmania\u2019s half a million residents could not. Over six days, I ate better than any other single destination on this 52 Places trip. On the hipster stretch of Elizabeth Street, it took me four tries to find a place where I could just get a takeout sandwich instead of table service. And that sandwich was an artisanal veggie burger with a cauliflower patty and a matcha bun from an \u201cinnovative plant-based\u201d vegan restaurant.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: New ZealandAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s a law of modern Western and East Asian history (we\u2019ll call it Macron\u2019s Law hereafter) that with wealth and education birthrates fall \u2014 and fall, and fall. The existence of occasional exceptions only highlights how exceptional they are.This plunge has happened without population-control interventions as well as with them, and because Western-supported population control efforts in the developing world tended to be inhumane and not-so-mildly racist, over the last couple of decades they have fallen somewhat out of fashion, with Gatesian philanthropists and politicians alike. So why are they creeping back into the discussion? For three reasons: Because African birthrates haven\u2019t slowed as fast as Western experts once expected, because European demographics are following Macron\u2019s Law toward the grave, and because European leaders are no longer nearly so optimistic about assimilating immigrants as even a few short years ago.Of course government efforts to raise the Western birthrate, France\u2019s included, have been no more obviously successful than Western-sponsored efforts to cut birthrates elsewhere in the world.But focusing on European fertility has at least one moral advantage over Macron\u2019s finger-wagging at African babymaking: It\u2019s the part of the future that Europeans actually deserve to control.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Weeks Before Midterms, Transgender People Feel Like \u2018Pawns\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the news broke on Sunday morning, many transgender people, world-weary, saw it as grimly predictable: With two weeks to go until the midterm elections, the Trump administration was considering a new move that would undermine federal civil rights protections for the transgender community. This time, they thought, it was the nuclear option.\u201cThe thing that really took the wind out of my sails and is deeply upsetting, particularly as someone who teaches ethics, is what this ultimately says about the American people,\u201d said Gabrielle Bychowski, a college professor and married mother of two in Grand Rapids, Mich.\u201cThis is a very evidently political move done, approaching the midterms, to garner favor with a portion of the American public who would be encouraged and pleased by this news,\u201d Ms. Bychowski, 31, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that pain is a political tool. A certain portion of the American population takes pleasure at the pain of others.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.The midterm elections on Nov. 6 are a critical test for the Republican Party, which is defending slim majorities in the House and the Senate. It has sought to lessen the weight of President Trump\u2019s low approval ratings and beat back the enthusiasm of the Democratic base by framing the election as a referendum on immigration, crime and unruly leftist mobs. Many transgender people feel similarly in the cross hairs.\u201cTransgender people are frequently used as political pawns; they say we\u2019re monsters and we go into bathrooms and commit crimes and whatever else,\u201d said Bryce Celotto, 26, a middle-school teacher and Army National Guard veteran in Oakland, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s just like with immigrants or other marginalized communities: It is easy to throw us under the bus as a scare tactic.\u201dThe Department of Health and Human Services is leading the effort to establish a new definition of gender under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bans discrimination on the basis of gender in federally funded education programs. If enacted, the proposal would turn to genetic testing to resolve any dispute about a person\u2019s gender.The department has called on other parts of the federal government \u2014 including the Departments of Education, Justice and Labor \u2014 to adopt the new definition, a measure of government uniformity that would make the courts more likely to recognize it as well. The health agency is planning to formally present the change to the Justice Department by the end of the year, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times.Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said her organization had not seen the text of the proposal and did not know how its existence had come to light, but said she believed it was \u201cabout playing to the base and vilifying people.\u201d But she also suspected it had more to do with the last two years of anti-L.G.B.T. moves than it did with the looming midterms.\u201cWhat we think this is is a post hoc justification for their refusal all along to be enforcing civil rights laws for transgender people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to unify the logic across the various government departments.\u201dEven without the proposed definition of gender, many transgender people said they had felt the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s stance on L.G.B.T. issues in their daily lives. They said things had gotten harder.In New York City, Dubbs Weinblatt, an educational trainer at a Jewish organization, reported being harassed on the street and subjected to homophobic slurs more frequently. In Madison, Wis., Dany Seiler said vandals had attacked a local gay bar and the office of an L.G.B.T magazine, smashing windows and spray painting slurs on the walls.Some also said the proposal made them even more determined to vote in the midterms.\u201cSometimes it feels really futile to do it, but we don\u2019t have a better system right now so I think everyone should vote,\u201d said T.J. Briggs, an actor and unemployed law graduate in Stuarts Draft, Va. \u201cWhether they allow me to have any political power, I still exist, my friends still exist, my husband still exists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Vaccine effectiveness varies quite a bit each year, from a high of 60 percent in 2010-11 to a low of 19 percent in 2014-2015.It is impossible to know yet how effective this year\u2019s vaccine will be. Infectious disease specialists have long expressed frustration that medical science has not come up with a universal lifetime flu vaccine. Currently available vaccines target the spikes on the virus\u2019s outer shell, which are the parts that mutate the fastest.Because it takes more than six months to make each year\u2019s vaccine, manufacturers have to choose in February what strains to put into shots that will be shipped in September. During that interim, circulating flus can mutate to become a partial mismatch to whatever was chosen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Failure of the American Tax System", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tax system is made for people like Trump, but not for the rest of us.Professor Madoff teaches at Boston College Law School and is an expert on estate planning and tax policy. This would not be as troubling if the richest Americans paid more income taxes. But most of the wealth they acquire is not taxed as income. This situation \u2014 generous exclusions from income taxes combined with easy evasion of estate and gift taxes \u2014 has given the wealthiest a free pass on the costs of running the country.How do income taxes apply to these ways of acquiring wealth? They don\u2019t.Like Donald Trump, many of the Forbes 400 acquired some or all of their wealth from their parents. These transfers of wealth pass entirely free of income taxes. This may be surprising, because the income tax purports to be imposed on \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d \u2014 and the I.R.S. is clear that this should be interpreted broadly to include not just a person\u2019s salary, but also unemployment benefits, lottery winnings and even the cash value of bartered items. There is not even a requirement to report that money on a tax return. This allows the wealthy to believe that their tax liability is more burdensome than it actually is. Imagine a person with a $1 million salary (subject to $350,000 in income taxes) and a $100 million inheritance. Since he has to report only that $1 million, he might think he is paying taxes at a rate of 35 percent, when his actual tax burden is less than 1 percent of the wealth he acquired that year.The second way that the ultrarich make their wealth is through building or investing in businesses. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the ultimate example of the successful entrepreneur. With wealth topping $160 billion, Mr. Bezos is not only the wealthiest American, but is also estimated to be the richest person in the world.While these changes are fiscally significant, the lobbying effort\u2019s greatest impact was rhetorical: It shifted the conversation about the estate tax as a legitimate tax to one that \u201cimposes double taxation\u201d and \u201churts family farms and businesses.\u201d These families took an issue that applied to less than 2 percent of Americans and made it a populist rallying cry against \u201cdeath taxes.\u201d As a result, repeal of the estate tax has become one of the core tenets of the Republican Party, while Democrats hardly bring the topic up at all, leaving Congress with little appetite for closing loopholes. Indeed, the last time that Congress adopted any legislation closing estate tax loopholes was 1990.This has let taxpayers artificially reduce the value of their estates just long enough for them to pass from one generation to the next. Three common techniques \u2014 minority discounts, grantor-retained annuity trusts and family limited partnerships \u2014 were all used by the Trumps. What is to be done about this situation?To begin with, let\u2019s introduce honesty into the debate. For too long, we have allowed the perpetuation of the myth that the super-wealthy are subject to greater tax burdens than regular Americans. That\u2019s simply not true, and we need to recognize that.The measure of a well-functioning democracy is a tax system that fairly apportions its burdens. When we go to the polls next month, we would do well to keep in mind the importance of electing officials who represent the interests of everyone and not just the wealthiest among us.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect reference to a list of wealthy Americans. It is the Forbes 400, as the article noted elsewhere, not the Fortune 400.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened After I Shared My Story of Abuse by New York's Attorney General", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeciding to speak out against a powerful man is difficult. The aftermath is even worse. Ms. Selvaratnam is an artist, writer and producer.Early in our relationship, he told me that he could tap my phone and have me followed. I knew he had the power to do this. His power was a thread that ran throughout our relationship.We met in July 2016 at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. I had been involved in the arts and social justice causes for more than 20 years, but producing election-related videos in 2016 was my first step into electoral politics. He approached me and was surprised I didn\u2019t know who he was. I told him I lived in New York. He said, \u201cThen I\u2019m your lawyer.\u201dHis name was Eric Schneiderman, and he was the New York State attorney general.By August, we were spending weekends together. Soon after, we were living together. He didn\u2019t want me out of his sight, and I was falling in love. I admired him, especially after the election, when he was celebrated as part of the opposition to the president.One night, while we were making love, he slapped me on the face. It was as if he was testing me to see how far he could go. I could see his hand approach my cheek, tap, tap again, then slam. I was stunned. A man who had been praised for his advocacy for women and the vulnerable had just hit me.Over time, the slaps got harder and were accompanied by demands. He would slap me until I agreed to a three-way (something I never did). He would slap me until I agreed to call him \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201cdaddy.\u201d He called me his \u201cproperty\u201d and recounted fantasies of bringing me from somewhere far away to be his \u201cbrown slave.\u201d He would hurl spit into my mouth and mash his lips against mine or put his hands around my throat so that it was hard for me to breathe. He sometimes looked as if he were possessed. I felt as though I had vertigo. I was scared. But when I said stop, when I jumped out of bed, he made me feel as if I wasn\u2019t meeting his needs, that I was boring and not sexually liberated.With the expert\u2019s guidance, I distanced myself from him. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve been avoiding me,\u201d Eric told me. Without drama, we agreed by phone to break up.Eventually, I spoke with Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow at The New Yorker. I anticipated that I would be perceived as an opportunist or part of a conspiracy. I anticipated that I would be blamed for not leaving sooner. And I worried about my career: If people began to think of me as a victim, would they still hire me? Three of my close friends told me to keep quiet because Eric\u2019s work was so important to the progressive cause. \u201cWe need him,\u201d one said. (After the article came out, they supported me, but the earlier comments stung.)I wondered if he would come after me. I deleted my social media accounts, removed my name from the buzzer list at my building and mailbox. I got a throwaway phone and made plans to leave the country for a few weeks.The months since then have not been easy. I\u2019ve dealt with rebukes from friends, family and strangers telling me I should have shut up or that it was my fault. I have woken up in the middle of the night feeling fear, and I have lost some of my privacy. I felt the shame of going through the abuse, and then I felt the shame that comes from publicly exposing intimate details of my life.I have been working hard to understand how I \u2014 someone who wrote a book about women\u2019s health and produced films celebrating strong women \u2014 allowed myself to stay with a man who was physically abusive. As a child, I saw my father hit my mother, and I ran to stand between them. I remember my mother making up stories to explain away her bruises.As I opened up to friends, they told me their own stories \u2014 independent and accomplished women who were also slapped and spat at without their consent during sex. One friend told me her ex-husband would push her hard against a wall in front of their children, and another spoke of a boyfriend who had broken her rib.What I\u2019ve realized is that I accepted the violence for many reasons. Like many abusers, Eric was loving before he became violent. He also had a peaceful side, meditating and surrounding himself with spiritual teachers. I thought that he could get better, and that I was going to help him. I even felt sorry for him. So many people were putting pressure on him to save the world, I would tell myself.Ultimately, I take responsibility for staying, but doing so took a deep toll. I have a long bridge to cross before I can be in an intimate relationship again. I didn\u2019t understand until after the relationship ended how physiological the impact is \u2014 the shaking and shuddering that happens suddenly, when I feel trapped, when I feel mocked. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress are a real and common reaction to abuse. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I hear his voice in my head belittling me. Still, while I regret getting into the relationship, I don\u2019t regret coming forward.Over the last year, many powerful perpetrators have been exposed. But there are less obvious ones out there.

{"Headline": "Great Ad. Compelling Characters. But No Mass Audience for the Democratic Candidates.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is one of the more compelling ads of the midterm election cycle, a 60-second video featuring eight Democratic women running for House seats, reciting their backgrounds in either the military or intelligence services as the predicate for their first runs for political office. Bruce Springsteen\u2019s anthemic \u201cThe Rising\u201d soars in the background.And it may never be aired on television.The political action committee that created it, Serve America, led by Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a Marine veteran, is structured in a way that caps donations to individual candidates at $5,000 per election. Since it has already given the maximum allowable contribution to the campaigns and coordinated the ad with each of the candidates featured, paying to promote additional television or digital ads would violate likely campaign finance laws.\u201cWould I like several million people to see it? Yeah, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Moulton said.Will they? Probably not.So like an author with a well-reviewed novel, Mr. Moulton may have to be content with the praise, if not the audience. None of the eight candidates featured is likely to get a major boost.\u201cIt\u2019s powerful because they are co-opting the old Republican faith, flag and military themes and it gives them a credential outside of politics, which is attractive,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, who added, \u201cThere is an emotional impact of seeing so many of them.\u201dThe only hope for a truly broad audience is a bet that the video goes viral online. While it has had over one million views so far on a combination of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, according to Serve America, it has not come close to the audience that one of the women featured in the ad, M.J. Hegar, a Democratic House candidate in Texas, achieved with her own viral ad. That one has been viewed close to three million times on YouTube alone.Political advertising, while still wedded in many ways to traditional television, has evolved, and the internet offers a very low-cost alternative. A number of celebrities, like Mr. Springsteen, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Garner, Sara Bareilles, Judd Apatow, Jennifer Garner, Amy Schumer, Seth Meyers and Chelsea Handler, have shared the Serve America video on their social networks.Serve America and the candidates have received at least some contributions from the effort, but there is no way to gauge whether it spurred people to register or vote.\u201cIt\u2019s not targeted to any one particular district or group of people,\u201d Mr. Moulton said. \u201cWe just want Americans to know that there are amazing leaders running for office and these women are such shining examples of that.\u201dThe only way the ad can actually reach television would be through another group, like the Democratic Party, deciding to sponsor it.Mr. Moulton said the party could do more to support the candidates featured in the ads. \u201cI believe that as Democrats, if we want to start winning again, we need to start leading again,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are tough races. Yet these are extraordinary candidates in really tough districts.\u201dBut at least some of the candidates are hardly struggling for campaign funds. Amy McGrath, a former Marine combat aviator and Democratic House candidate in Kentucky, and Abigail Spanberger, a former C.I.A. operative and candidate in Virginia, each raised more than $3.6 million in the last quarter. Another, Chrissy Houlahan, running in Pennsylvania\u2019s redrawn Sixth District, is considered a strong favorite, with or without the help.Veteran political strategists said the video had a collective power, using a patriotic appeal to vote, without any overt partisan pitch. There is also a clear tonal diversion from the harshly negative ads that most voters are seeing in the closing days before the election.\u201cIf Democrats are going to take back the House, if all you do is slam Republicans, that\u2019s probably not going to get you over the line, particularly at a time like this when so viciously negative,\u201d said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist. \u201cShowing women who are patriots, who are less partisan, and who are clearly motivated by public interest, I just think it\u2019s great and exactly what people want.\u201cIt\u2019s a balm for the soul when everyone else is throwing bombs,\u201d he added.And it is not an accident that all of the candidates featured in the ad are women, in a year with a record number of women running for office. \u201cVery powerful message that works on multiple levels,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant who has worked on dozens of Senate and presidential campaigns. \u201cAs much about voting for women as voting for those who have served.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Must Answer for Jamal Khashoggi", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Saudi journalist in exile was abducted and murdered, as many fear, a full accounting is needed. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.While the crown prince was being extolled in many Western quarters for reforms like letting women drive and reining in the religious police, Mr. Khashoggi was writing about widespread jailings of dissidents at home and dangerous Saudi adventures abroad.All this was grist for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s pen, and it obviously grated on M.B.S. Mr. Khashoggi understood that challenging the brash 33-year-old prince posed a qualitatively new danger for internal critics, that M.B.S. demanded a monopoly on the narrative of his reforms and would let no one challenge it. Mr. Khashoggi knew how many of his friends and colleagues were being jailed. He was aware of a risk in going into the Saudi consulate \u2014 before entering, Mr. Khashoggi gave his cellphone to his Turkish fianc\u00e9e and told her to seek help if he did not reappear. At this stage, the suggestion of a deliberate and cruel execution must remain only that, a frightening possibility. Yet the monstrosity of such an action requires prompt and credible explanations.Why has the Trump administration, which has coddled, armed and hosted Prince Mohammed, not yet unequivocally supported Turkey\u2019s demand to investigate the consulate for a full reckoning? Though Mr. Trump has described journalists as \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d he cannot be unaware that his ally stands accused of a heinous murder.If those allegations do prove founded \u2014 a big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 the United States has options, including sharply cutting arms sales to Saudi Arabia and downgrading relations with it. Again, for now these are allegations. Yet whatever happened, it\u2019s scandalous that an outspoken journalist should disappear without a trace. A free press remains the surest defense against tyranny, and it\u2019s a tragic sign of our times that so many courageous journalists are repressed, imprisoned or killed, and that their oppressors act with impunity.Mr. Khashoggi spoke for Ms. Marinova and many other courageous reporters when he described in his column how he had become a journalist in exile: \u201cI have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison.\u201dThat is the same reason that all who can should raise their voices and demand a full accounting of the fates of Mr. Khashoggi, Ms. Marinova and all the other voices that have been silenced. And whether the responsibility falls on prince or pauper, let justice be done.Advertisement"}

Along the way, they discover that the straight path is not always the best path. \u201cI love pasta!\u201d he said. \u201cBut not with red sauce.\u201dYes, Italy! We would go to Italy. At the time it seemed like such a good idea. Culture! Sun! Vespas! Ciao! It was only after buying the tickets that I remembered the problem with traveling with young children is that when it comes time to travel, you actually have to bring your young children with you.So, here was our entire agenda for our Italy trip in June: \u201cEat as much pasta as possible.\u201d Full stop. Anything else that happened would be purely a bonus.ITALYFlorenceTUSCANYArea of detailRomeTuscany200 milesSienaSienaVald\u2019OrciaSan Quirico d\u2019OrciaLa Foce20 milesBy The New York TimesSomehow we managed to survive the eight-and-half-hour flight to Rome trapped in a metal tube with our children and 200 other passengers.Chiarentana is now run by Iris\u2019s lovely daughter, Donata. They sell several varieties of their own olive oil, including the frantoiano, which can transform a simple piece of bread into a gustative epiphany of earth and arbor and sky.The place bleeds history. But my son Holt did not care about any of that. He was intent upon setting up a cheap plastic bowling set in that magical cobblestone courtyard. He created an elaborate game with arcane rules that could only be played in this courtyard, under this linden tree. I tried playing with him, but got it all wrong.\u201cNo, that\u2019s the home pin,\u201d he said, weary at such ignorance.There is something refreshing about watching the very young play in a very old place. We must care about history, but we must not care too much. The wheel of time spins.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I asked Holt.We ordered three pastas, including eliche with fresh ricotta and wild fennel. Eliche means propeller in Italian; the pasta is shaped like a spiral, or the path a propeller would make in the water. Holt enjoyed this information. Like many boys his age, Holt is fascinated by systems, shapes, how things work and don\u2019t work; it seemed like his entire third year was composed simply of reciting a taxonomy of construction vehicles.The pastas came. They were divine. Life shrunk to its simplest ingredients. We do not need much to be happy in this world: something to slurp, something to sip. Everyone sat very quietly eating, even Max, our youngest. We marveled at the path propellers make from our mouths to our stomach. Suddenly Holt held his fork aloft, eliche skewered on its tongs. \u201cThis is the best thing in my life!\u201d he exclaimed.From that very successful first lunch things became a bit wobbly. My children, like most children, do not sit at tables for extended periods of time. Why sit at a table? Tables are boring, flat things that cannot be slapped, climbed upon, taken apart without reprimand. Children wonder: Why do adults always sit at tables for hours and hours, talking and not talking?\u201cI hate old buildings!\u201d he wailed over and over. \u201cI want to go home!\u201d In the gloaming, Bertoldo, the donkey, commiserated.Pici is the local style of eggless peasant pasta; it is like plump, irregular strands of spaghetti, stretched out by hand. The term pici comes from the Italian word \u201cappiciare\u201d which is the ancient action of rolling and coaxing out those long, lumpy strings. The owner of Osenna, Luca, told us his mother, the chef, could stretch a single strand of pici to over six feet long.\u201cYou could wrap it around your whole body!\u201d said Holt. Luca said this was not traditional but he would convey the idea to his mother.\u201cEveryday you come here to bless God,\u201d he said, completely out of the blue. Then: \u201cThis is my favorite building in the world.\u201dWe were in Siena a week before the first Palio of the summer, and the clay had just been laid, and rickety bleachers erected all around the racetrack. Imagining the screaming hordes, we sneaked through the ropes into the middle of the piazza, the still-wet clay sticking to our stroller\u2019s wheels. We were practically the only ones in the whole square, a moment of perfect serenity. Holt pretended he was a horse. Max pretended he was Holt.Our Airbnb was in Oltrarno, the hip, Brooklyn-like Florentine neighborhood just south of the River Arno, filled with little eateries and shops selling artisanal rucksacks and handmade puppets.Our first day we ventured into the sweaty scrum of central Florence and were quickly repelled by a tsunami of tourists. Florence in the high season is a nightmare. You cannot breathe, you cannot move. Our whole family grew quite cranky until we bought some gelato alla stracciatella. It has been proven by science that gelato is the cure for all ills, including gout, gunshot wounds and existential despair.We didn\u2019t even try to make it to the Uffizi Gallery or see the famous sites. My traveler alarm bells kept going off: We were missing out on the Caravaggios! But you are always missing out with kids. That is kind of the point. The beauty is in the miss.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d I said to Holt, pointing to the helicopter. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t fly.\u201d This felt perhaps more tragic to me than it should, a metaphor for our times. Good ideas that never take off.\u201cThat\u2019s O.K.,\u201d said Holt. And it was.By all appearances, the straight line, the shortest path, is the quickest route to the bottom. Right?Nope. Galileo discovered it was the brachistochrone curve, which, despite being longer, delivers the ball first. And as I watched Holt put marble after marble down each path, testing and retesting the hypothesis, I began to irresponsibly apply such principles to our little Italian adventure. The straightest way is not always the best way. Rather, by weathering the natural curves of life, by going down and then up, by lingering at the doorway for half an hour as Max joyfully closes and opens the door again and again, you are actually taking the more efficient path.\u201cIt\u2019s like a gem turned sideways,\u201d Holt said. \u201cIt\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d When you are 4, there is no such thing as hyperbole. Nearby, we found a magical little restaurant, Alla Vecchia Bettola, with communal tables and iron pots hanging from the ceiling. They managed to seat us despite being packed with Florentines. After 14 straight meals of pasta, this would be our last.By this point, the four of us were used to things. We were like a well-oiled machine. As soon as we sat, we ordered the children\u2019s meals. The kids tolerated the tableness of the table. Max did not demand his customary ramp exercises. We had our iPhone apps at the ready but did not need them. We all seemed to sense this little experiment was coming to an end. A group from Quebec at our table remarked how well behaved our children were.\u201cThey are not like this normally,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have been trained. Like seals.\u201dThe restaurant hummed. Locals laughed and made intricate gestures with their fingertips that meant all was not lost.I had one more bite of ravioli. And then I was done. I had finally overdosed on Italian food, something I did not think was scientifically possible.\u201cDown,\u201d said Max, pointing at the ground.And down we went. We had taken the wandering path and arrived at this moment, just in time.Reif Larsen is the author of the novels \u201cI Am Radar\u201d and \u201cThe Selected Works of T. S.

He was ordered held with bail set at $5 million. The victims, Vickie Lee Jones, 67, and Maurice E. Stallard, 69, were both black, while Mr. Bush is white.The police said there was no indication that Mr. Bush knew either of the victims, nor did he have any known connection to the grocery store. Mr. Bush has a history of mental illness, Chief Sam Rogers of the Jeffersontown Police Department said at a news conference on Thursday. Court records show that he also had a long history of domestic violence charges, and had previously been barred from possessing a firearm.Chief Rogers and church officials said that surveillance video had recorded Mr. Bush\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to enter the nearby First Baptist Church of Jeffersontown shortly before the attack.Billy Williams, the church administrator, said eight to 10 people were inside the church when Mr. Bush arrived after a midweek service. A church member in the parking lot grew alarmed when she saw him aggressively pulling on the historic church\u2019s front doors. Mr. Bush drove away after less than 10 minutes.\u201cThere were 70 people here at our weekly meeting service just an hour before he came by,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who was among them. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful that all of our doors and security was in place.\u201dHe added that they were praying for the families of the victims. Both had relatives who attended the church, which recently celebrated its 185th anniversary.After leaving the church, the police said, Mr. Bush headed to the Kroger. They said he entered the store just before 3 p.m. and fired multiple rounds at Mr. Stallard. He then exited and fired at Ms. Jones in the parking lot, Chief Rogers said, striking her several times.Mr. Bush was stopped by an armed bystander who shot at him in the parking lot, and whose name the police have not released. Mr. Bush tried to flee, but he was caught by police officers. Chief Rogers said Mr. Bush was taken into custody four minutes after the police received the first call for help.Both Mr. Stallard and Ms. Jones were declared dead at the scene.Chief Rogers said there were conflicting reports about a second armed bystander in the supermarket, and he could not confirm the account of a local man who spoke to reporters on Wednesday.Court records detail Mr. Bush\u2019s history of domestic violence incidents involving his parents and his ex-wife, who is black. She said that he had used a racist epithet against her.In divorce papers filed in 2000, his ex-wife said that Mr. Bush had tried to kill himself while he was supposed to be watching their son, then 2 years old. The following year, she told the court she was \u201cscared to death\u201d of him after he punched her in the face.In 2009, Mr. Bush\u2019s father, William Bush, then 78 years old, told the police that his son had attacked him and his wife.\u201cHe put his hands around my wife\u2019s neck and picked her up by her neck and put her down. I tried to restrain him, he hit me in my left jaw and knocked me down,\u201d the father said in court papers.His father added that Mr. Bush carried a gun everywhere and had threatened to shoot both his parents in the head. \u201cHe is dangerous,\u201d the father said. \u201cHe is paranoid. I want him to stay away.\u201dAfter the altercation with his parents, Mr. Bush was ordered to surrender his weapon to the authorities. He was barred from possessing a weapon after at least one other domestic incident, court papers show.Chief Rogers said that officials from the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the investigation.A Facebook page that appears to belong to Mr. Bush includes a lengthy description of his struggles with mental illness.Mr. Stallard was the father of Kellie Watson, who works as Louisville\u2019s chief equity officer. In a statement, Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville said he was \u201csick and heartbroken and angry\u201d over what happened, and asked the public to respect the family\u2019s privacy.Ms. Jones\u2019s nephew, Kevin Gunn, said she was \u201ca good Christian woman and wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Gunn, 48, said his aunt had retired from the local veterans affairs hospital and was helping to care for an elderly family member. He called the shooting \u201csenseless.\u201d\u201cIt seems like much more than mental illness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a hate crime.\u201d\u201cYesterday I was sad,\u201d Mr. Gunn said. \u201cToday I\u2019m angry.\u201dSandra E.

{"Headline": "These Funds Aim to Power Their Returns With Clean Energy", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you worry about climate change and have some money to spare, it\u2019s natural to wonder whether investing in green energy might plump your returns while helping to stem rising temperatures.A growing number of stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds specialize in the so-called green- or clean-energy industry. They invest not only in the expected companies, like generators of solar and wind power and their suppliers, but also in less obvious ones, like makers of LED light bulbs, electric cars and automobile batteries.Buying into one of these funds means betting on a burgeoning, if volatile, sector and pinning the green in your wallet to your hopes for a more verdant future.Demand for renewable energy is surging, according to the International Energy Agency, a nongovernmental organization based in Paris. As a result, growth in solar- and wind-powered electricity generation is far outstripping that of coal- and natural-gas-fueled generation, the group said in its \u201cRenewables 2017\u201d report. China\u2019s embrace of solar power has been the main engine for this growth, but the United States is the second-strongest market for renewables, the agency said.Even the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett has taken steps toward going green: MidAmerican Energy, one of the subsidiaries of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is aiming to obtain 100 percent of its electricity from wind power by 2020.\u201cDecarbonization is a huge and enduring trend, and it\u2019s being led by the private sector now, like Facebook going 100 percent renewable,\u201d said Pavel S. Molchanov, a senior vice president and energy analyst with Raymond James, the financial services company. In August, Facebook, too, announced that it was striving to power its operations with renewables by the end of 2020.But whether investors in mutual funds and E.T.F.s have any effect on the choices being made by companies like Facebook and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a subject of debate among investment experts and fund managers.Mr. Molchanov counts himself among the skeptics. \u201cIf a person sells a coal stock, someone is going to buy it,\u201d he said. \u201cWill that action lead to less coal being burned? No. For someone to contribute to decarbonization, the way they can do it is by putting solar on their rooftop.\u201dSome managers of green-energy funds disagree, saying individual investments do help the energy transition, even if they don\u2019t lead to the shuttering of a coal-fired power plant tomorrow.By signaling consumer interest, investment in these companies also can create a virtuous cycle, potentially pulling in even more money, said Jeff Waller, a principal in the global climate finance group at Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Colorado. \u201cYou\u2019re demonstrating there\u2019s demand from the average investor,\u201d he said. \u201cPension funds and 401(k) managers will want to meet that demand. That can create a larger pool of capital focused on this market, which can only help.\u201dJon F. Hale, global head of sustainability research for Morningstar, likened an individual\u2019s green energy bets to \u201cvoting with your money.\u201d Those sorts of \u201cvotes\u201d can embolden fund companies to offer more products and be more aggressive in supporting and even pushing for corporate environmental investments and initiatives.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the philosophy that the fund exists to build a green energy future,\u201d said Murray D. Rosenblith, one of the portfolio managers of New Alternatives. Mr. Rosenblith said he joined his co-manager, David J. Schoenwald, who founded New Alternatives with his father, in the belief that the fund was contributing to the advancement of renewable energy. \u201cI was a peace activist and had run a charitable foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come here if I didn\u2019t believe we were helping.\u201dOver the five years ending on Sept. 28, Fidelity\u2019s fund returned an annualized average of 9.75 percent and New Alternatives 6.73 percent, compared with an annualized average of 13.95 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Calvert opted to go its own way because it judged many of the existing indexes to be too concentrated, Ms. Huang said. The WilderHill index contains 39 stocks and the S.&P. index 29, compared with more than 150 for Calvert\u2019s index. \u201cSo we\u2019re offering a product that\u2019s more diversified but still addresses the energy crisis,\u201d she said.No standard recipe exists for what a renewable energy fund should contain. Some funds broaden their potential pool of holdings by including a salmagundi of stocks.Take Fidelity. Its fund can \u201clook at any company out there trying to push for environmental change in its industry,\u201d said its manager, Kevin G. Walenta. Only about half of its assets are dedicated to renewable energy and energy efficiency stocks. The fund also contains waste-management, water and agricultural holdings. That broad remit suits Mr. Walenta, who said he prefers to invest in longstanding companies and shies away from newer technologies.Energy efficiency, in particular, is a favored theme. \u201cThe payback period for efficiency investments gets better every year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the companies have brand power and long histories of positive economic profits.\u201d As an example, he pointed to Ingersoll Rand, a more-than-a-century-old manufacturer that makes efficient heating and air-conditioning systems. It has lately been one of the fund\u2019s top holdings.Mr. Hale, of Morningstar, said an investor shouldn\u2019t let concern about climate change be all that determines the amount of an investment in renewable energy. A green-energy fund or E.T.F. can supplement a diversified portfolio, with, say, a 5 percent or 10 percent allocation, but it does not take the place of a core holding, he said.A concern when considering such an investment might be the climate-change skepticism of the Trump administration. The solar- and wind-power industries are supported by federal tax credits. And the president likes to talk up coal, and he pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the international accord through which countries worldwide committed to goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If the Trump administration were to push for further changes in federal energy policy, that might hurt renewables.But Lucas White, manager of the GMO Climate Change Fund, said doings in Washington no longer bedevil wind and solar power all that much, as the industries are now mature enough that federal support isn\u2019t crucial for their growth. (Mr. White\u2019s fund, with a minimum initial investment of $10 million, is intended for institutional investors, like pension funds.) \u201cCosts have come down much faster than anyone thought was possible,\u201d he said.Mr. White noted that James L. Robo, chief executive of NextEra Energy, one of the country\u2019s largest power generators, has predicted that solar and wind power will be cheaper than coal or nuclear generation by the beginning of the next decade. \u201cWhen that happens, that\u2019s a massive change in the global energy landscape,\u201d Mr. White said.He is also among those who say that fund and E.T.F. investments can help green energy producers and other companies involved in climate-change mitigation and adaptation.\u201cThis may sound a little squishy, but if no one was willing to invest in these companies, they wouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

As a result, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new world \u2014 one in which it will be impossible, literally, to tell what is real from what is invented.That fake was exposed \u2014 but did it really make a difference to the people who wanted to inhabit their own paranoid universe?

{"Headline": "Notes on Global Convergence (Wonkish and Off-Point)", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy rich countries stay different and middle-income countries surge.Opinion ColumnistOK, that said, I read two things in the past few days that had me thinking about the biggest economic story there is: the dramatic rise of some formerly very poor nations, and the concomitant shift of the world\u2019s economic center of gravity away from the West.I\u2019d argue that these observations are really part of the same story. Let me start with Branko\u2019s observation.I won\u2019t do a full statistical analysis, but let me give the example of France versus the U.S. Figure 1 shows French productivity \u2014 real GDP per hour worked \u2014 relative to the U.S., and relative real GDP per capita. What you see is that French productivity has matched that of the U.S. for many years (it was actually higher for a while, although that was probably a composition effect reflecting an older work force.) French real GDP per capita has, however, slid relative to U.S. levels. Why?So these are just different choices. And while France does need more pension reform (it has done some already), it\u2019s far from clear that overall French choices are worse. On many quality of life indicators, like life expectancy (Figure 2), America has fallen behind.The end of Western convergence, then, isn\u2019t an indicator of some kind of failure. Meanwhile, the coming of rapid convergence by emerging markets is a huge success story.When I was in grad school in the 1970s, I thought I should do development economics \u2014 because it was clearly the most important subject \u2014 but didn\u2019t, because it was too depressing. At that point it was mostly non-development economics, the study of why Third World countries seemed to fall ever further behind the West. True, we were already seeing a growth takeoff in smaller East Asian economies, but few saw this as a trend that would spread to China and India.Then something happened; we still don\u2019t know exactly what. It\u2019s a good guess that it has something to do with hyperglobalization, the unprecedented surge in world trade made possible by breaking up value chains and moving pieces of production to lower-wage countries. But we don\u2019t really know even that.One thing is clear: at any given time, not all countries have that mysterious \u201cit\u201d that lets them make effective use of the backlog of advanced technology developed since the Industrial Revolution. Over time, however, the set of countries that have It seems to be widening.Once a country acquires It, growth can be rapid, precisely because best practice is so far ahead of where the country starts. And because the frontier keeps moving out, countries that get It keep growing faster. Japan\u2019s postwar growth was vastly faster than that of the countries catching up to Britain in the late 19th century; Korea\u2019s growth from the mid-60s even faster than Japan\u2019s had been; China\u2019s growth faster still.The It theory also, I\u2019d argue, explains the U-shaped relationship Subramanian et al find between GDP per capita and growth, in which middle-income countries grow faster than either poor or rich countries. Countries that are still very poor are countries that haven\u2019t got It; countries that are already rich are already at the technological frontier, limiting the space for rapid growth. In between are countries that acquired It not too long ago, which has vaulted them into middle-income status, but are able to grow very fast by moving toward the frontier.The result is a world in which inequality among countries is declining if you look from the middle upward, but rising if you look from the middle down. Fundamentally, however, it\u2019s a story of diminishing Western exceptionalism, as the club of countries that can take full advantage of modern technology expands.It\u2019s not entirely a happy story. That concentration of income and wealth at the top is worrisome, not just economically, but for its political and social implications; it\u2019s one reason U.S. democracy is teetering on the edge. And there are still hundreds of millions of people left out. But there\u2019s also a lot of good news in the picture.I now return you to our regular political anxiety.Advertisement"}

He never emerged. The Saudis say he left, but they have produced no evidence. That may be because corpses don\u2019t walk.Put these and other elements together \u2014 an erratic Saudi prince given carte blanche by Trump, wielding cash and fear to secure fealty, brooking no opposition to the House of Saud, blind to devastation from the Saudi-led war in Yemen, allowing women to drive but arresting the women activists behind this concession, detaining critics en masse, throwing a fit at Canada (yes, Canada!) over justified human-rights criticism \u2014 and the folly of killing Khashoggi in Turkey becomes incremental rather than inconceivable. For now, I find the case for Saudi perpetration of this hideous crime persuasive.Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance is now Exhibit A in the price of Trump\u2019s values-free foreign policy, his cavalier contempt for the core American values at the heart of America\u2019s alliances. That price was already evident from Yemen to the Philippines to Russia. Trump is a man who has called the European Union \u201cbrutal\u201d and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, \u201ca great personality.\u201d His former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, suggested that human rights concerns were secondary to \u201cour national security interests, our economic interests.\u201d So what did M.B.S. have to fear? After more than a week, Trump did muster a mild dissent \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d \u2014 but called relations with Saudi Arabia \u201cexcellent.\u201dThis is Trump World. Money talks. Brutes do what they want. Human rights are scoffed at. Morality (ha-ha) is what you can get away with. Truth is no match for manipulation (don\u2019t hold your breath for clarity on this foul deed). Decency dies. Culture collapses. M.B.S. dangles billions for his Vision 2030 Saudi makeover, and fawning businesses scurry to his \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d extravaganza this month. A stubborn journalist, a human being with a conscience, gets dismembered in a Saudi consulate.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin should not attend, absent some serious Saudi clarification of what happened. Nor should Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.One life! Mnuchin and Dimon might argue. What\u2019s a single life beside vast economic interests? But sometimes a single life is all of civilization.Except that right now you do.Looking at the history of the past two decades, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s consistent underwriting of the Wahhabi orthodoxy behind murderous Islamist hatred of the apostate West, it is impossible to argue that Iran has inflicted more harm on American interests than Saudi Arabia has. The Saudis take that dubious accolade.After 9/11, 15-man Saudi hit squads are very familiar to Americans.It\u2019s time to call in every Saudi chip.

But don\u2019t we have a responsibility to mitigate the next disaster?\u201cThere is strong consensus among scientists who study hurricanes and climate that warming temperatures should make more intense hurricanes possible,\u201d Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert at M.I.T., told me. He said that the probability of Hurricane Florence-magnitude rains in North Carolina has roughly tripled since the middle of the 20th century.Flooding actually causes more hurricane deaths than wind, and climate change amplifies flooding in two ways. First, it raises the base sea level, on top of which a tidal surge occurs. Second, warmer air holds more moisture \u2014 about 10 percent more so far \u2014 and that means more rain.As recently as the early 2000s, there wasn\u2019t much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change.Republicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and it\u2019s irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet.There are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.But we\u2019re not even having these debates.I worry that television coverage in the coming days will be dominated by heroes on boats rescuing widows on rooftops. Yes, that human drama is riveting \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t address the larger problem.The way to tackle lung cancer wasn\u2019t to celebrate heroic doctors treating patients in the cancer ward, while ignoring cigarette smoking, but rather to reduce cigarette use.Climate change may be the most important issue we face, reshaping our children\u2019s world.

Pro-Israel advocates consider the movement anti-Semitic and bent on Israel\u2019s destruction, not least because it promotes Palestinians\u2019 right of return to land now in Israel.The case put an uncomfortable spotlight on what has become an acrimonious debate over who should be allowed into the country and more broadly, the health of Israeli democracy. Ms. Alqasem\u2019s supporters, and even some critics on the right, accused the government of an overzealous border policy and said it would do more damage to Israel\u2019s image abroad than any student\u2019s call for a boycott.In their decision, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court echoed those concerns. Because Ms. Alqasem had promised not to call for a boycott of Israel, and had left the group a year and a half ago \u2014 \u201ca significant period of time,\u201d given her young age \u2014 her actions \u201cdo not raise satisfactory cause to bar her entry to Israel,\u201d Judge Anat Baron wrote.For that reason, Judge Baron continued, \u201cthe inevitable impression is that invalidating the visa given to her was due to the political opinions she holds. If this is truly the case, then we are talking about an extreme and dangerous step, which could lead to the crumbling of the pillars upon which democracy in Israel stands.\u201dMs. Alqasem\u2019s lawyers accused the government of relying on flimsy evidence, and officials acknowledged that they had relied at least in part on Google searches and the work of an organization called Canary Mission, which says it \u201cdocuments people and groups that promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.\u201dAfter being denied entry, Ms. Alqasem, who has Palestinian grandparents, appealed to the Tel Aviv district court. At the request of a judge, she formally declared that she would not participate in any boycott activities while in Israel and that she had no intention of visiting the Palestinian territories, according to her lawyers, Leora Bechor and Yotam Ben-Hillel.A key issue at oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday was whether Ms. Alqasem remained an activist in the boycott movement or, as she testified before the lower court, had parted ways with the organization in early 2017.The government, in seeking to rebut her testimony, charged that she had clicked \u201cAttend\u201d on the Facebook page of at least one event connected to the movement this year. The judges were not persuaded.Her lawyers argued that there should be limits to the Interior Ministry\u2019s discretion in enforcing the sanctions law, particularly because it restricts free speech. And representatives of Hebrew University warned that if students with valid visas could be turned away when they arrive in Israel over their activist pasts, there would a chilling effect on academic and cultural exchanges, which Israel prizes.In the past, Israeli officials have said the 2017 entry law would not penalize people for their political opinions alone and would apply only to major figures in the boycott movement.The entry law itself is being challenged in separate litigation. The judges in Ms. Alqasem\u2019s case needed only to find that she was no longer a boycott movement activist, whatever her past actions or present beliefs, to overrule her deportation.Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

There had been a limousine accident, she said, before passing the phone to a State Police trooper.The trooper told Mr. King that the limo carrying his four youngest daughters had crashed near an intersection in rural Schoharie, N.Y.\u201cAre there any survivors?\u201d Mr. King recalled asking.\u201cAnd he said, \u2018No, they were all killed.\u2019\u201dFour of the Kings\u2019 seven children \u2014 Amy, Allison, Abigail and Mary \u2014 were among the dead. Three of their sons-in-law were also killed in the Oct. 6 crash that claimed a total of 20 lives.From there, the facts settled in more slowly: They were now grandparents to three orphans, a 16-month-old, a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old.The full impact of the devastation from the country\u2019s deadliest transportation accident in nearly a decade continues to unfold in grim detail. But for the Kings \u2014 a tight-knit clan, many of whom lived close enough for daily impromptu visits \u2014 the shock is incalculable.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be down the road, three or four months from now, when it really hits us,\u201d said Mr. King, 72, as he sat in an armchair in his living room, six days after the call that changed his life.A steady flow of neighbors bearing pastries and hugs continues to cycle through the three-bedroom home that has been the family\u2019s anchor and hub in Amsterdam, N.Y., for 24 years. Strangers have sent well-wishes.\u201cI saw a Nebraska address on a bouquet of flowers that arrived,\u201d Ms. King, 70, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anyone in Nebraska.\u201dFor now, a long to-do list has crowded out mourning.There was the car they had to move from where it had been parked just before the 17 relatives and friends piled into the limousine en route to a birthday party at a brewery in Cooperstown, N.Y.There were the wakes and the funerals to plan and to pay for and to attend. There are recently purchased homes to take care of. One of their daughters had a will. The others did not.There are the longer-term arrangements to make for the three grandchildren, Mr. King explained as one of them, 2-year-old Isaac, slept on his lap.\u201cWe love our grandchildren,\u201d he said, \u201cbut realize we physically can\u2019t care for them full time.\u201dIt was a typical Saturday.Mr. King was cooking and Ms. King was tidying the house when she received a news alert about the limousine accident at around 2 p.m.\u201cBut they said the limo was carrying a wedding party so we weren\u2019t immediately concerned,\u201d Ms. King said.They sent texts to all four daughters. None were returned. That\u2019s when the worrying began.\u201cNormally, the girls were always sending pictures and things,\u201d Ms. King said.The phone rang right after sunset. It was Kim Steenburg, Amy\u2019s sister-in-law who had skipped the celebration because she was not feeling well. Ms. Steenburg\u2019s husband, Rich, also died in the crash.\u201cWe had been hopeful up until that point,\u2019\u2019 Mr. King said. \u201cIt was unimaginable really.\u201dIt was especially inconceivable because all four of the daughters had stopped by their parents\u2019 house in the hours before the crash.The night before, Allison King, 31, had dropped off a dozen fresh eggs from the chickens she raised. Abigail Jackson, 34, visited briefly on Saturday after coaching her daughter\u2019s soccer match. Mary Dyson, 33, drove by later in her pickup truck to drop off Isaac. Finally, Amy Steenburg, 29, showed up in a rush, said a quick hello and left with Ms. Dyson and her husband.\u201cThey were in a hurry,\u201d Mr. King said.And they were excited, on their way to celebrate Ms. Steenburg\u2019s 30th birthday with a tour and beer tasting at Ommegang, a popular brewery.In sharing memories of their daughters, the Kings recalled young lives cut short just as they were marking major life events like recent births and upcoming weddings.They were inseparable (bridesmaids at each others\u2019 weddings) and similar in looks (all blue-eyed and blonde), but unique in personalities.Ms. Steenburg, who had married her husband, Axel, just four months ago, was remembered as an avid traveler, always on the go. The couple, who had just moved into a new house, had flown to Hawaii last year, traveled to Ireland for their honeymoon and had a Caribbean cruise scheduled for early next year. Still, Ms. Steenburg, who would have turned 30 four days after the crash, would always find her way home.\u201cShe was famous for a text that would come at about 5 o\u2019clock,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cIt would say, \u2018What\u2019s for dinner?\u2019\u201dMs. Jackson dedicated her life to children. She was a teacher with a master\u2019s degree in education and taught remedial reading at the Lynch Literacy Academy in Amsterdam. She and her husband, Adam, had two young daughters, Archer Mattingly Jackson, 4, and Elle Berra Jackson, 16-months.\u201cDo you think they were Yankee fans, or what?\u201d said Mr. King, referring to the girls\u2019 middle names honoring two famous Yankees, Don Mattingly and Yogi Berra. The children will live with Mr. Jackson\u2019s mother.Ms. Dyson was a builder. An Army veteran and a civil engineer, she was stationed in Iraq for a year and helped with the rebuilding. \u201cShe was involved in building the first girls school in Iraq,\u201d Ms. King said.She was also an owner of a construction company in Watertown, N.Y., where she lived with her husband, Robert, 34, and their son, Isaac. This weekend the Kings are driving the boy to Seneca Falls, where he will live with Mr. Dyson\u2019s mother.\u201cAllie was my flower child,\u201d said Ms. King, using Allison\u2019s nickname. Allison and her fianc\u00e9 were passionate organic gardeners. They raised chickens, ducks and rabbits in their backyard garden in Galway, N.Y., and just two weeks ago they had attended an annual garlic festival in upstate New York with her parents.\u201cWe ate garlic soup, garlic ice cream, garlic everything,\u201d Ms. King said.Ms. King has kept newspaper articles about the accident. She is saving them for her grandchildren.\u201cI think they will want to read these stories when they get older,\u201d Ms. King said.She has also found comfort in a detail, heard secondhand.\u201cThe coroner told the sheriff that the kids didn\u2019t suffer,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cIt was immediate.\u201dThe Kings moved to Amsterdam about 24 years ago after the Air Force base where Mr. King worked in Plattsburgh, N.Y., a small city near the Canadian border, closed. Mr. King found a job as a meat manager at the commissary of a Navy facility, while Ms. King worked for a state agency.They settled in a ranch-style house with the four daughters and a son, Tom.

Mueller III, had a history of scandal.Russian operatives combed the American media to identify polarizing issues and then crafted social media messages to promote on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. The complaint follows two earlier indictments this year of Russians for election interference, including hacking Democratic computers. Some messages appeared to praise President Trump or his policies and went after his opponents or fellow Republicans who disagreed with him. Posing as Americans, the Russians warned that threats of impeachment could be a prelude to civil war.Borrowing a favorite political theme of conservatives and some members of the Trump administration, the Russians promoted the message of widespread voter fraud, arguing that stricter voter identification laws were needed to prevent Democrats from falsifying election results.The Russians accused Mr. Mueller of bias, falsely claiming he had close ties to the Democratic Party and a history of scandals during his tenure as F.B.I. director. The Russians sought to portray The New York Times, CNN and other media organizations as untrustworthy and deeply biased against the president. They picked up on Mr. Trump\u2019s favored term of \u201cfake news,\u201d accusing the mainstream media of deliberately spreading lies about the president.The Russians attacked \u201csanctuary cities\u201d as havens for illegal immigrants who had committed heinous crimes, citing without evidence \u201can illegal rapist who raped an American child as the peak of wickedness.\u201dBefore Senator John McCain died in August, hailed as a revered figure in American politics, the Russians crafted a message describing him as a lawmaker long past his prime who hated Mr. Trump and tried to subvert the president\u2019s promises.Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, was targeted as a threat to the party and to the agenda of all conservatives, particularly because of his relatively moderate position on immigration issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A First Glimpse of Our Magnificent Earth, Seen From the Moon", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsThe first people to view our planet from the moon were transformed by the experience. In this film, they tell their story.Mr. Vaughan-Lee is a documentary filmmaker. On Dec. 21, 1968, Apollo 8 launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla. The astronaut crew \u2014 Frank Borman, Bill Anders and James Lovell \u2014 were the first humans to escape Earth\u2019s orbit, venturing about 240,000 miles farther than anyone before them.Their mission was to orbit the moon, testing the viability of a future moon landing. NASA was focused on getting to the moon and beating the Soviet Union in the space race; everything else, including photography, was secondary. Yet during their lunar orbit, the crew emerged from the dark side of the moon to see the Earth rising before them over the lunar horizon. They scrambled to capture the image, producing the first color photograph taken of the Earth from the moon. It became known as \u201cEarthrise\u201d and has become one of the most well-known photographs in history. The iconic \u201cEarthrise\u201d photograph shifted the vision of space exploration from one that leaves Earth behind to one that marvels in the rare magnificence and beauty of our home planet. It ushered in a collective awareness of the Earth as a whole, transcending borders and boundaries, and came to be used by many to instill a sense of wonder, awe and stewardship toward the planet. It was a natural inspiration for the creation of Earth Day, and subsequently for the environmental movement as a whole. I\u2019ve always loved the Earth photography captured during the Apollo missions, and the \u201cEarthrise\u201d image is particularly poignant for me. In all the tellings I watched or read of Apollo 8 \u2014 and there are many \u2014 I wanted to experience more. I wanted to know the story behind the photograph, to know what it was like for the first human beings to see and experience Earth from space.I wondered what role this image could offer us 50 years later as we face intense political, social and ecological upheaval. Could it become a symbol of remembrance that unites us? All these years later, the Apollo 8 astronauts still remembered every detail of their mission and their experience looking back at the Earth. I had approached the interviews with all sorts of ideas about the profound insights they would share, the epiphanies they must have had and how it had forever changed their lives. And while they offered these insights during the interviews, they also provided something much simpler, something much more human that touched me the most. It was as if seeing the Earth from the moon had awakened a primordial feeling within each of them. Home.My editor Adam Loften and I spent countless hours reviewing archive footage and photography from the Apollo missions. The tactile quality of the 16 mm footage and 70 mm photography imparted a quality I felt was lacking from the crisp digital images from satellites and the International Space Station I\u2019d become accustomed to seeing. I could almost feel the human presence behind the lens, a sense of emotion that was imparted to the footage itself. In telling the story, I wanted to create that human connection to the Earth I felt within the footage and the astronauts\u2019 experiences. I wanted to explore how to feel and witness the Earth as our home the way they had. I wanted to share the awe and beauty they had experienced, to remember the power of this image they shared with the world. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rhetoric, Mobs and Terror", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe explosive devices were released into a toxic atmosphere created by Trump. Opinion ColumnistThere is no way to consider the explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats and the CNN offices and not recall that Donald Trump himself has created a toxic environment by openly targeting many of these very people and entities in his overheated, overwrought rhetoric.This is not to say that there is an explicit link between the president\u2019s rhetoric and the bombs. There is no way to know that at this point. We don\u2019t even know yet who\u2019s responsible for the bombs.But we can say without equivocation that Trump\u2019s stoking of fear and riling of anger is deeply problematic and indeed dangerous.Trump doesn\u2019t operate on an intellectual plane, but an emotional one, and the emotions he has learned to manipulate in politics are the darker ones.He learned that if you tap into people\u2019s anger \u2014 if you can articulate it and vent it, repackage it and glamorize it \u2014 their gratitude and appreciation will be expressed as loyalty and adulation.They will forsake their morals and principles.They will forgive your foibles.They will defend you to the death.Trump said to these people that their enemies were his enemies. Everyone they saw as a threat to their cultural heritage, societal dominance and personal privilege \u2014 Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants, liberals in general \u2014 he would attack on their behalf.In the movie \u201cGladiator,\u201d a senator says of the new emperor:\u201cI think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they\u2019ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they\u2019ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it\u2019s the sand of the Colosseum. He\u2019ll bring them death \u2014 and they will love him for it.\u201dTrump understands this, intuitively. He is not a grand strategist, but an irrational man who rose in an era of irrationality. Politics is not always about the elevation of the best candidate. Indeed, I would argue that it rarely elevates the best. But it always rewards the person who is best suited and positioned for the moment.In that way, Trump\u2019s hatred, racism, insecurity, anti-intellectualism and grudge against the elite society that had always disdained him was perfectly suited for conservatives who were entertaining the same notions but had no one to openly champion their intolerance with effrontery.On Monday in Houston, Trump was again whipping a rally crowd into a fear frenzy with his dystopian vision of America. He said:\u201cDemocrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs and MS-13 to pour into our country. And Democrat sanctuary cities release violent criminals from jail and straight into your neighborhoods.\u201dAs the audience chanted, \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t like them either, O.K.?\u201d He added:\u201cDo you know how the caravan started? Does everybody know what this means? I think the Democrats had something to do with it.\u201d\u201cSo as the caravan \u2014 and, look, that is an assault on our country. That\u2019s an assault. And in that caravan you have some very bad people. You have some very bad people. And we can\u2019t let that happen to our country.\u201dThere is no proof that there are \u201cvery bad people\u201d in the caravan, and it is more than a thousand miles away from our border.He said:\u201cThe Democrats want to replace freedom with socialism. They want to replace Texas values with Nancy Pelosi values. And they want to replace the rule of law with the rule of the mob. That\u2019s what is happening. And the Democrats would rather destroy American communities than defend America\u2019s borders.\u201dHe also said: \u201cA future under Democratic mob rule would be a total catastrophe.\u201dAs ever, there were chants of \u201clock her up\u201d with respect to Hillary Clinton.And he said this:\u201cYou know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist, O.K.? I\u2019m a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing \u2014 use that word. Use that word.\u201dThis is all from just one rally. He has held scores of them.This is the language in the air. This is the rhetorical backdrop as we await an investigation and answers about who sent bombs to Democrats and the CNN offices.This is the madness, fear-mongering and mendacity that must end.

{"Headline": "All the Good Beto Headlines Have Been Used", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDoes a much-covered Texas representative looking to unseat Ted Cruz stand a chance? And what if he \u2014 gulp \u2014 loses? Well, we\u2019ve been here before. Ms. Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer. HOUSTON \u2014 The sign in the newsroom of the Austin-based, politically prescient Texas Tribune has been up for several months. It reads, \u201cDays since a national Beto O\u2019Rourke profile:\u201d The number, as of yesterday, was zero. Just recently, the chief executive of The Trib, Evan Smith, cracked similarly wise in a tweet: \u201cThe humping of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s leg by every magazine in America is, well, something.\u201dRepresentative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who you probably know has been running to take the seat of Senator Ted Cruz, has been the subject of hagiographic articles in just about every publication in existence, including Town & Country, a magazine rarely known for its political influence. Beto (he has achieved first-name status) has also appeared on the TV shows of Ellen DeGeneres, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher, among many, many others.For a Texan, especially one who leans left, this situation can be disconcerting. It\u2019s nice to feel so much enthusiasm for a Texas race, but the implication, subtle though it may be, is that Beto is the only living human who might be able to save Texas from itself.Yes, Beto is the coolest-looking man to come out of Texas since Matthew McConaughey. He has an Ivy League degree and cares about the underserved and the undocumented. He doesn\u2019t wear cowboy boots to prove his Texas bona fides.To many urban Texans, that means that Beto is not so different from a lot of thoughtful, educated, big-city folks who live here. Non-Texans, in contrast, are still stunned to discover that even people who don\u2019t live in Austin know about Tuscan blends and Karl Ove Knausgaard.A win for Beto, then, is a win for the new Texas. A loss means that even though all of our major cities are blue, the old, [insert pejorative here] Texas still prevails.We have been here before. Ann Richards, you may recall, became a national icon after taking over the governor\u2019s office in 1990. From the outside looking in \u2014 and even to some locals \u2014 Texas seemed to be on a whole new trajectory: Ms. Richards did what she could to move the state forward, or at least gave the impression that she was. (The governor\u2019s job was largely symbolic until Rick Perry got in there.)The national media, and the so-called East Coast elites, adored her acrid folksiness, her ability to serve up put-downs as only a Texas woman can, with a gimlet eye and cornpone-laced delivery. Ms. Richards may have sounded like the Texas rubes they loved to make fun of, but what she said was in line with their liberal politics. She sure wasn\u2019t afraid to take on our 41st president when she was just a sassy state treasurer: \u201cPoor George,\u201d she said at the Democratic convention that put her on the national stage in 1988. \u201cHe was born with a silver foot in his mouth.\u201dMs. Richards showed the world that Texas had really, really changed \u2014 until she got trounced by the red tidal wave that elected George W. Bush governor in 1994.Then came Wendy Davis, the Fort Worth politician who filibustered for abortion rights on the floor of the Texas Senate for 13 hours in 2013. The live streaming of that event made Ms. Davis an instant national media star, with the Vogue spread to prove it.She wasn\u2019t Richards 2.0, but she had gotten herself, so the story went, from a trailer park to Harvard Law School. She was a bridge from Texas past to Texas future, a modern woman who could lead the state out of the backward Bush regime and the 14 far darker Rick Perry years. \u201cCould Texas turn purple \u2014 and is Davis the one to take it there?\u201d the author of the Vogue profile asked.The answer from Texas was a resounding no. Ms. Davis was trounced by the state attorney general, Greg Abbott, an Obama nemesis who won nearly 60 percent of the vote to Ms. Davis\u2019s 38. If national pundits were shocked, locals were not. Only 33 percent of all Texans voted, a vast majority of them older, white Republicans. \u201cA moment is not a movement\u201d is the way Evan Smith sums it up. And the Texans who voted didn\u2019t give a whit for the fervor of people who lived outside the state.So now comes Beto. In recent days it has been reported that his fund-raising in the last quarter reached $38 million, more than in any other Senate race in history \u2014 and that he is trailing Mr. Cruz by nine points in the latest Quinnipiac poll.\u201cTexas isn\u2019t a red state, it\u2019s a nonvoting state,\u201d is the line that started making the rounds as Beto\u2019s candidacy was gearing up more than a year ago. It\u2019s not a bad way of combating decades of Republican gerrymandering, voter suppression and the bedrock conservatism that has been with us here since, oh, Texas joined the union in 1845. The canvassers have been out in force, on college campuses and in neighborhoods that probably haven\u2019t ever seen a voter drive. There are voter registration cards in nail salons and smoothie bars, which is certainly a change.Maybe this will be the year a progressive candidate with a positive message wins in Texas. But if he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll still know who we are.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cTicker, the Quest to Build an Artificial Heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the United States follows through on the president\u2019s threat of a costly buildup, Russia can loudly blame America for starting a new arms race, and America will be further distanced from its allies.So given all that, even if I.N.F. is fraying, abandoning it makes no sense.Washington should press hard to persuade Russia to reverse course and go back into compliance; European allies should also more forcefully confront Mr. Putin about his new missiles. Prodded by the Trump administration\u2019s plans, Mr. Maas has already declared that Germany will urge NATO to force Russian compliance with the I.N.F. At the same time, the United States should release as much evidence as it can of Russian deployments and meet the Russian challenge by redeploying treaty-compliant land, sea and air arsenals.None of that is likely to resonate with Mr. Trump, who has made clear he is against any agreements that predate his administration, or the hawkish Mr. Bolton, who is constitutionally averse to arms controls. But on something with such grave potential consequences, Congress should join America\u2019s allies and the world\u2019s arms-control experts to impress on Mr. Trump that he is on a dangerous track that will further erode American leadership in curbing the world\u2019s most lethal weapons.Advertisement"}

Similar regional complexities are to be found with any issue one might want to consider as a legislator tasked with representing this district.The 101st was drawn in 2012, so the story goes, by Republicans to punish one of their own caucus members yet remain a safe Republican seat. In other words, its design is actively antidemocratic. (Broadly speaking, anything that artificially makes a district less competitive makes it less democratic.)Ideally, an incumbent should be able to protect his or her seat only by being an effective and successful representative. A district such as ours, which is intentionally packed with members of one party, necessarily reduces the degree to which citizens of all parties are represented. When politicians pick their voters, they often no longer feel compelled to work hard in order to provide quality constituent services and thoughtful leadership.Counties are the natural unit of governance in rural upstate New York, and by slicing them up we weaken their ability to provide coherent stewardship. Consider the travails of the Soil and Water Department in Otsego County. In order to stitch together the resources needed for a countywide stream remediation plan, it must appeal to the good graces of four different Assembly members and a state senator. Or consider the plight of the ironically named town of Neversink, already drowned once to create a water reservoir for New York City and now the only town from Sullivan County to be politically isolated into the 101st. Also problematic is the village of Ellenville with a large bilingual and minority population, whose current representative in Albany lives three and a half hours away by car in the suburbs of an entirely different urban area.The consequences of districts being drawn like ours are more than theoretical. All across upstate New York, people of all political persuasions are ignored and underserved by a political system that feels dominated by the big city. Anything that adds to the frustration and confusion of voters reduces turnout and increases disillusionment with government in general. Incoherent districts drawn by our incumbents further fracture the political power of rural and small-town New Yorkers. The process weakens both the ability and the resolve of our elected officials to argue for the resources and attention we need to solve our specific regional issues, including finding ways to balance the economy with the environment, repairing our decaying physical infrastructure, the paucity of rural access to good health care, collapsing dairy prices, Stone Age internet and cellphone coverage, endemic rural poverty and an epidemic of opioid addiction.As a candidate working tirelessly to win over an electorate intentionally constructed to stack the odds against me while unequivocally opposed to the disenfranchising practice of gerrymandering, I\u2019m in an awkward position. Even as I make an earnest and passionate appeal to the far-flung voters of our district that, given the current circumstances, I would be their best and truest representative, I also promise that, if they elect me, I will seek to redraw our district at the next opportunity. It is a change that, if successful, will mean that I am in effect arguing to no longer represent some of the very people who voted for me.

Sorry, Mark Zuckerberg.Dr. Marcus is a professor of psychology and neural science. Dr. Davis is a professor of computer science.In his testimony before Congress this year, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, addressed concerns about the strategically disseminated misinformation known as fake news that may have affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Have no fear, he assured Congress, a solution was on its way \u2014 if not next year, then at least \u201cover a five- to 10-year period.\u201dThe solution? Artificial intelligence. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s vision, which the committee members seemed to accept, was that soon enough, Facebook\u2019s A.I. programs would be able to detect fake news, distinguishing it from more reliable information on the platform.With midterms approaching, along with the worrisome prospect that fake news could once again influence our elections, we wish we could say we share Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s optimism. But in the near term we don\u2019t find his vision plausible. Decades from now, it may be possible to automate the detection of fake news. But doing so would require a number of major advances in A.I., taking us far beyond what has so far been invented.As Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged, today\u2019s A.I. operates at the \u201ckeyword\u201d level, flagging word patterns and looking for statistical correlations among them and their sources. This can be somewhat useful: Statistically speaking, certain patterns of language may indeed be associated with dubious stories. For instance, for a long period, most articles that included the words \u201cBrad,\u201d \u201cAngelina\u201d and \u201cdivorce\u201d turned out to be unreliable tabloid fare. Likewise, certain sources may be associated with greater or lesser degrees of factual veracity. The same account deserves more credence if it appears in The Wall Street Journal than in The National Enquirer.But none of these kinds of correlations reliably sort the true from the false. In the end, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did get divorced. Keyword associations that might help you one day can fool you the next.To get a handle on what automated fake-news detection would require, consider an article posted in May on the far-right website WorldNetDaily, or WND. The article reported that a decision to admit girls, gays and lesbians to the Boy Scouts had led to a requirement that condoms be available at its \u201cglobal gathering.\u201d A key passage consists of the following four sentences:The Boy Scouts have decided to accept people who identify as gay and lesbian among their ranks. And girls are welcome now, too, into the iconic organization, which has renamed itself Scouts BSA. So what\u2019s next? A mandate that condoms be made available to \u2018all participants\u2019 of its global gathering.First of all, there is no telltale set of phrases. \u201cBoy Scouts\u201d and \u201cgay and lesbian,\u201d for example, have appeared together in many true reports before. Then there is the source: WND, though notorious for promoting conspiracy theories, publishes and aggregates legitimate news as well. Finally, sentence by sentence, there are a lot of true facts in the passage: Condoms have indeed been available at the global gathering that scouts attend, and the Boy Scouts organization has indeed come to accept girls as well as gays and lesbians into its ranks.We are not aware of any A.I. system or prototype that can sort among the various facts involved in those four sentences, let alone discern the relevant implicit attitudes.To get to where Mr. Zuckerberg wants to go will require the development of a fundamentally new A.I. paradigm, one in which the goal is not to detect statistical trends but to uncover ideas and the relations between them. Only then will such promises about A.I. become reality, rather than science fiction.Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, and Ernest Davis, a professor of computer science there, are working on a book about how to build trustworthy A.I.Advertisement"}

Ms. Donegan is the only named defendant in a lawsuit that was filed against her by Stephen Elliott, one of the men named on the list.In his suit, Mr. Elliott said that the claims about him on the list, which included \u201crape accusations\u201d and \u201csexual harassment,\u201d were false and defamatory, and that they had caused him significant professional and personal problems. He is being represented by Andrew T.

Windsor, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act violated the constitution, a major victory for L.G.B.T.Q. rights. In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Kaplan said that she had taken Ms. Donegan\u2019s case to fight what she saw as an effort to keep women from coming forward with claims about sexual misconduct.\u201cI and other women who are involved in Time\u2019s Up have felt pretty strongly for a while that it would be really important not only to represent women who have been harassed or assaulted, but also to defend women in efforts that have been undertaken to stop women from speaking,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said.She noted that the standards for bringing a case for defamation are particularly high and difficult to meet in the state of New York and that it was hard for her to see how Mr. Elliott\u2019s suit would pass a motion to dismiss.\u201cOne can only surmise that the point of the lawsuit is to do something else, and again, my assumption is that the something else is to try to discourage other women from coming forward,\u201d she said.And just as Mr. Miltenberg has begun to establish himself as a go-to lawyer for prominent men accused of misconduct in the midst of the #MeToo Movement, Ms. Kaplan has worked on behalf of accusers. In the description, Ms. Hough wrote that Ms. Donegan \u201cdid us all a huge favor.\u201d\u201cShe made our world safer, and has paid more than her share.\u201d She added: \u201cNow she\u2019s going to need some help.\u201dAny remaining money, Ms. Hough wrote, will be donated to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.Ms. Donegan\u2019s case is currently being handled pro bono. (Funding from the Time\u2019s Up organization requires an official application.)

{"Headline": "Orson Welles and the Birth of Fake News", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany people believed his famous \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d broadcast \u2014 but many didn\u2019t. The difference offers a valuable lesson today. Mr. Schwartz is a doctoral student in history at Princeton and the author of \u201cBroadcast Hysteria: Orson Welles\u2019s War of the Worlds and the Art of Fake News.\u201dEighty years ago on Tuesday, Orson Welles revealed the terrifying power of fake news.On Oct. 30, 1938, Welles directed a radio adaptation of \u201cThe War of the Worlds,\u201d reimagining its Martian invasion through fictitious news flashes. Many contemporary newspapers claimed the show sparked a mass panic, sending multitudes of listeners fleeing their homes in fear.But that stubbornly persistent narrative is false. The myth of the \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d panic not only misinterprets how media persuasion and fake news actually work \u2014 it prevents us from understanding how to grapple with the problem today.In 1938, the answer seemed clear. Many scholars believed radio could, like a hypodermic needle, inject ideas straight into people\u2019s minds, convincing them of anything \u2014 even something as fantastical as an alien attack.But further investigation refuted this simplistic picture. A Princeton University survey of frightened listeners indicated only about a third understood the invaders to be Martians. The rest imagined something more plausible that they already feared, such as a Nazi blitzkrieg.The broadcast, in short, didn\u2019t bypass the conscious intellect to convince people of something they wouldn\u2019t otherwise believe. It passed through pre-existing fears, attitudes and beliefs, to be corroborated or refuted within the mind of each listener.The most extreme examples of panic often came from people told to tune in by someone else. They responded not so much to the radio\u2019s power as to the trust they placed in their particular messenger. Some never even heard the show itself.Later studies of the mass media would confirm these two fundamental rules of persuasion. Media messages generally cannot convince audiences of something contrary to their existing attitudes or prejudices. But they can powerfully reinforce what people already believe. Second, especially in the age of social media, fake news is most powerful when it is shared \u2014 not just by prominent information sources but also by anyone on Twitter or Facebook.The social media campaign carried out by Russian intelligence in 2016 to help elect President Trump depended on the very same persuasive factors that Welles unwittingly revealed. Russian operatives developed propaganda that, like \u201cThe War of the Worlds,\u201d appealed to pre-existing fear and anger among the American public, activating voters inclined to vote Republican and giving Democrats reasons to stay home. This content was specifically designed to be shared, so that voters might encounter it through someone they trusted.Crucially, unlike bygone broadcasters, Russian intelligence operatives could target their messages to specific portions of the electorate residing in key swing states, with propaganda tailor-made for small, specialized audiences already primed for persuasion.Still, the basic means of fighting fake news haven\u2019t changed much in 80 years. Many listeners frightened by \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d tried to verify what they heard, either by changing stations or calling local authorities.Such reflexive skepticism can and must be taught. The fundamentals of media literacy should occupy a central place in middle school and high school curriculums, arming students with the critical mind-set today\u2019s media landscape demands.But this problem cannot be solved solely on the individual level. As digital tools for falsifying images and video become ever more sophisticated and accessible, our democracy increasingly hinges on a question many Americans first considered in the wake of \u201cThe War of the Worlds.\u201d As one Mississippian asked after the broadcast, in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, \u201cHow will we know when news is news, or when it is just fiction, if that is an example of future radio programs?\u201dThat listener and others called upon their government to directly censor the radio. The Communications Act of 1934 required that broadcasters operate in \u201cthe public interest, convenience, or necessity.\u201dThe F.C.C., charged with implementing the law, took no official action. It didn\u2019t need to. Just the threat of regulation was enough to persuade the major broadcast networks to censor themselves. Fearful of losing revenue by offending listeners, networks banned the use of news broadcast language in drama, reserving the trappings of journalism for actual reportage.Today, social networks like Twitter and Facebook occupy the position once held by those broadcasters, serving as trusted conduits for news and information. That position must again come with a responsibility to serve the public interest by actively protecting users from misinformation.Without impeding the flow of ideas, internet providers can and should place reasonable limits on how some ideas are expressed, both by strengthening efforts to block websites that mimic legitimate news sources and by shuttering accounts that spread counterfeit journalism \u2014 whether they represent individuals, automated \u201cbots\u201d or government entities.If such action is not made a priority, voters must elect officials who will apply the same kind of pressure the F.C.C. did 80 years ago. Otherwise, we will all soon know what it felt like to be trapped in the scattered pockets of hysteria created by \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d \u2014 surrounded by fear and misinformation, unable or unwilling to seek the truth.A.

Students were lost in the bureaucratic shuffle of loan applications, tax-verification documents and arcane equations that calculate their expected ability to pay down to the last penny.

I also spoke to a mother who cried as I explained that if she couldn\u2019t pay more than $8,000 by the next business day, her child would not be allowed to return to college in the fall. But it felt to me that our only real job was to decrease callers\u2019 average wait time.

Delgado, a former Trump campaign surrogate.Miller and Delgado started an affair during the presidential race; Delgado became pregnant while Miller\u2019s wife was pregnant as well. Now Miller and Delgado are involved in a vicious custody battle over their son, which Delgado chronicles on her Twitter feed.For all its squalor, this is a story of public interest. It\u2019s reportedly the reason Miller didn\u2019t become White House communications director, instead signing on to defend Trump as a CNN contributor.So it was news when Delgado claimed, in a court filing, that Miller had made a previous girlfriend pregnant and then put abortion-inducing medication in her smoothie. In September the website Splinter, part of Gizmodo Media, reported on the filing, noting that Miller denied the allegations.There is an air of dark absurdity about this saga. Miller is unlikely to prevail, because there are broad protections for journalists to report on claims made in legal filings, whether or not they are true. But it\u2019s still worth taking seriously, because it\u2019s part of a mounting conservative assault on free speech.And, of course, there\u2019s Stephen Elliott, the writer suing Moira Donegan, creator of a crowdsourced spreadsheet of allegedly abusive men in the media industry, as well as the people who contributed to it. Through the suit, he\u2019s trying to force the disclosure of these people\u2019s names, something that would have profound implications for every part of the internet where anonymity is the norm.Donegan, however, didn\u2019t write the allegations against Elliott. And his suit attempts to use her fiery feminism against her, saying she has a \u201cwell-documented history of publicly publishing statements professing a hatred of men.\u201d Seeing this, any woman who contributed to the list \u2014 or merely forwarded a link to it \u2014 might feel the need to temper her anger at the patriarchy online.Roberta Kaplan, a renowned feminist lawyer who is now representing Donegan, told me that after Sullivan, it became conventional wisdom that defamation lawsuits aren\u2019t \u201crational or appropriate ways to settle disputes about truth or falsity, except in really exceptional circumstances.\u201dNow, however, things are changing. \u201cIn the same way that Time\u2019s Up and #MeToo have kind of overturned decades, centuries of accepted wisdom about what is O.K. or not with respect to the treatment of women, we\u2019ve seen a parallel overturning of accepted practices and norms about the advisability and, frankly, rationality of using defamation in this manner,\u201d she said.In other words, some men are really angry, and the political faction that claims to hate political correctness is appealing to the state to shut people up.Advertisement"}

Partly the answer is that gerrymandering, the Electoral College and other factors have rigged the system in their favor; Republicans have held the White House after three of the past six presidential elections, despite winning the popular vote only once. And they will probably hold the House unless Democrats win by at least 6 percent.Also, let\u2019s not forget about voter suppression, which is putting an increasingly heavy thumb on the scale. Still, given how unpopular Republicans\u2019 policy positions are, how do they even get close enough to cheat?But lies about policy, while they may confuse some voters, aren\u2019t enough.

{"Headline": "The Blind Man\u2019s French Dog Problem", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityIt\u2019s not really about the dog. Or being French. Or blind. Mr. Linn is writer who travels with a Seeing Eye dog. Last summer my wife, Juju, was invited to attend a conference in Paris, and she asked me to come along. I\u2019d always wanted to visit Paris, so of course I said yes. But before I could book my ticket, I needed to do some research. I\u2019m blind, and I use a Seeing Eye dog \u2014 a German shepherd named Nadia \u2014 to help me get around.First, I needed to find out where the French stood on guide dogs. This wasn\u2019t an unreasonable concern. In New York, where the law clearly states guide dogs can accompany their owners everywhere, I frequently run into trouble \u2014 in restaurants, cabs, parks, even hospitals. I didn\u2019t want to go to Paris on vacation only to have the same fights over my guide dog I could have at home.My research turned up some good news. It said that the French have some of the strongest service animal laws in the world, and more important, these laws are rigorously enforced \u2014 any form of discrimination is strictly forbidden. I was ecstatic. Not only was I going to experience a city that I\u2019d always wanted to visit, but I also was now sure that my guide dog and I would be welcomed with open arms.The problems began the moment we arrived in Paris. The representative from the apartment rental company took one look at Nadia and me and demanded an extra 700 euros security deposit, along with an additional 500 euros for a mysterious \u201cdeep-clean fee.\u201d I felt like I\u2019d been smacked in the face. And it really stung after the warm welcome I\u2019d imagined.So much for discrimination being strictly forbidden. Juju and I were furious, but what could we do? We\u2019d never find another apartment at the height of the tourist season. We were stuck. So that afternoon, I was on the M\u00e9tro traveling to a gritty neighborhood in the 20th Arrondissement in search of the office of the local guide dog federation to find out if anyone there could help me resolve my problem with the rental company. When I arrived, I was met by the director, a small lively man, who shook my hand vigorously before leading me into his cluttered office. He listened sympathetically while I described my dispute with the rental company. When I finished, he sighed heavily and drummed his fingers on the desktop.\u201cYou are absolutely correct, Mr. Linn,\u201d he said, \u201cThis is unquestionably a violation of French law. But your situation is a bit \u2026 er \u2026 tricky.\u201d\u201cWhy tricky?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe law clearly states you can\u2019t charge a blind person with a guide dog more than you charge everyone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the law doesn\u2019t apply to you.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\u201cBecause French law only applies to French dogs.\u201dFrench dogs? Was this guy pulling my leg? What the hell was a \u201cFrench dog?\u201d I pictured a bored-looking bulldog sitting at an outdoor cafe, a beret on his head, a cigarette in one paw, a glass of wine in the other.Then the director interrupted my daydream. \u201cBut,\u201d he said in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cthere is one thing I can do for you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\u201cI will make you a false identification card. Then, while you are in France, you and Nadia will be French, and you will enjoy all the rights of a French guide dog handler. Restaurants, taxis, museums, you name it. Simple, no?\u201dClearly I was missing something. Making a fake ID for a dog didn\u2019t strike me as particularly simple. But just then the director snapped a photo of Nadia and me, and began tapping away at his computer.I sat there stunned, a frozen grin on my face, while wave after wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu crashed over me. I felt a familiar anger rising in my chest. I wanted to pound my fist on the director\u2019s desk. I was angry because being blind is rarely my problem; my biggest frustrations stem from the fact that there is always some person in a position of power telling me that I\u2019m not quite right.Suddenly I was back in a Brooklyn courtroom for a custody hearing when a judge told me I couldn\u2019t see my 1-year-old daughter without my mother being present \u201cbecause no judge in their right mind would leave a baby alone with a blind man.\u201d This despite the fact the judge knew I\u2019d been my daughter\u2019s principal care giver from the time she was born.Then there was the immigration hearing to determine whether Juju would receive a green card. While a stone-faced immigration officer pored over pictures of our wedding, I sat there sweating through the back of my pants, obsessing over our lawyer\u2019s final words before we went into the hearing: Juju had a great chance of receiving her green card \u2014 she was a doctor, we had married for love, we were the right age and had similar backgrounds. The only \u201cproblem\u201d with our application was my blindness, which was sure to send up red flags.I could have remembered countless other examples of discrimination I\u2019d experienced over the years, but at that moment, the director tapped me on the shoulder and handed me my new identity card.\u201cVoil\u00e0,\u201d he said.Back at the apartment, I made a few jokes about my new French identity, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. We spent the rest of the week going to museums and restaurants and holding our breath. I could never just relax and enjoy myself. Having to use a fake ID all over Paris made me feel like I was \u201cgetting away with something,\u201d which left me tired and irritable.In the airport on the way home, I was still angry. My anger wasn\u2019t aimed at the French or their laws. I was angry because I\u2019d hoped to be treated with respect in France and instead I encountered the same problem I ran into in New York. The problem is a whole lot bigger than guide dogs or blindness or unexpected cleaning fees. Once again I was experiencing what it means to be a member of a minority \u2014 blind or black or poor or a newly arrived immigrant, for that matter \u2014 living day to day in constant fear that everything you have can be taken away from you, even your identity.Adam Linn is an author living in New York. He is working on a memoir of growing up without a father, going blind and becoming a father himself.Advertisement"}

Much might be said about Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s possible confirmation to the Supreme Court: in terms of his still only partly disclosed professional record, the allegations of sexual assault and his candor, or lack of it, in testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But apart from all that \u2014 and apart from whatever the reopened F.B.I. investigation might reveal \u2014 the judge himself has unwittingly provided the most compelling argument against his elevation to that court.The accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford raise another order of concern. Some might argue that the unresolved cloud over his past would require a Justice Kavanaugh to recuse himself from any case involving sexual assault or harassment. That might well be, but I have in mind something more sweeping and fundamental.Apart from formally promulgated codes of judicial conduct, the Supreme Court has recognized that those whom our legal system entrusts to resolve controversies among litigants have a constitutional duty to step aside whenever a conflict of interest \u2014 or the public appearance of such a conflict \u2014 is so powerful as to erode public trust in the fair and impartial administration of justice.

My decades of observing the court\u2019s work and arguing cases there convince me that his required recusal would extend to a very broad slice of the Supreme Court\u2019s docket during his lifetime tenure as a justice. That would leave the court evenly split in far too many cases, for years on end, if he were to recuse himself as required \u2014 or deeply damaged in the public\u2019s trust if he were not.It is up to the president and the Senate to decide whether this situation makes him unacceptable as a nominee.

{"Headline": "Deep in Human DNA, a Gift From the Neanderthals ", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterLong ago, Neanderthals probably infected modern humans with viruses, perhaps even an ancient form of H.I.V. But our extinct relatives also gave us genetic defenses.People of Asian and European descent \u2014 almost anyone with origins outside of Africa \u2014 have inherited a sliver of DNA from some unusual ancestors: the Neanderthals.These genes are the result of repeated interbreeding long ago between Neanderthals and modern humans. But why are those genes still there 40,000 years after Neanderthals became extinct? Some of those infections may have been picked up directly from Neanderthals. Without immunity to pathogens they had never encountered, modern humans were particularly vulnerable. \u201cWe were actually able to not only say, \u2018Yes, modern humans and Neanderthals exchanged viruses,\u2019\u201d said David Enard, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and co-author of the new paper, published in the journal Cell. \u201cWe are able to start saying something about which types of viruses were involved.\u201dLluis Quintana-Murci, a geneticist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris who was not involved in the new research, said that until now, scientists had not dreamed of getting such a glimpse at the distant medical history of our species.\u201cFive years ago, we would never have imagined that,\u201d he said.Our immune cells kill off viruses with an arsenal of weapons, such as antibodies and signals that cause infected cells to commit suicide. But Dr. Enard began his research by wondering if humans have evolved other ways to avoid getting infected.Viruses can\u2019t replicate on their own. They appropriate proteins inside our cells to do the heavy lifting, copying viral genes and building new shells to put them in. If those proteins were to change shape, however, it should become harder for viruses to use them to multiply.\u201cInstead of a strategy where you attack the virus, you run away from it,\u201d said Dr. Enard.To learn whether this is really a defense the body uses, Dr. Enard needed to find all the human proteins known to interact with at least one virus. But no such list existed. So he plowed through the scientific literature, looking for every example.Once he had built a catalog of 1,300 proteins \u2014 it took four months \u2014 he studied their evolutionary history. By comparing these proteins across different species, he discovered that many have changed over the course of evolution. The common ancestor both of modern humans and Neanderthals lived roughly 600,000 years ago, probably in Africa. Neanderthals left the continent long before modern humans and spread across a huge range, from the coast of Spain to Siberia, before becoming extinct.From fossils, scientists have been able to reconstruct entire genomes of Neanderthals. And they\u2019ve found that living people with non-African ancestry carry 1 percent or 2 percent Neanderthal DNA.That remnant DNA got into our gene pool through repeated interbreeding. But after Neanderthals became extinct, their DNA gradually declined in our genomes.It\u2019s likely that most Neanderthal genes were bad for our health or reduced our fertility, and therefore were lost in modern humans. But certain Neanderthal genes became more common, probably because they provided some kind of evolutionary advantage. In recent years, researchers have found that some of those genes encode proteins made by immune cells. They speculated that modern humans benefited by borrowing Neanderthal genes to fight infections.Dr. Enard and Dr. Petrov had a more specific question: Did modern humans acquire genes that helped cells evade specific viruses by altering the shapes of cellular proteins? The researchers pored through the genomes of living Asians and Europeans, and discovered a large fraction of those Neanderthal genes make proteins that interact with viruses.The viruses that infected Neanderthals must have posed a major threat to modern humans as they left Africa. They had no immunity to these infections. But Neanderthals did, and through interbreeding, Neanderthals provided modern humans with genetic defenses.\u201cIt\u2019s like they brought the knife, but they also brought the shield,\u201d Dr. Petrov said.Dr. Enard and Dr. Petrov also found clues about exactly what kinds of viruses these Neanderthal genes protect against. In living humans, many of the proteins made by those genes interact only with influenza viruses, for example. Others interact only with H.I.V.\u201cWe are not saying that viruses that infect the human population now come from Neanderthals,\u201d said Dr. Enard. It\u2019s clear, for example, that H.I.V. jumped into humans just a century ago from chimpanzees.Instead, it\u2019s likely that modern humans got infected with an ancient relative of H.I.V. Dr. Enard couldn\u2019t say how they were exposed to the new pathogen \u2014 perhaps directly through sex with Neanderthals, or by eating animals that both modern humans and Neanderthals hunted.But it\u2019s clear that, for billions of people alive today, Neanderthal genes likely play an important role in defending against such viruses.\u201cWe are not anything but the result of our past,\u201d said Dr. Quintana-Murci.Advertisement"}

None of this is confirmed, and we still don\u2019t know exactly what happened; we all pray that Jamal will still reappear. But increasingly it seems that the crown prince, better known as M.B.S., orchestrated the torture, assassination and dismemberment of an American-based journalist using diplomatic premises in a NATO country.That is monstrous, and it\u2019s compounded by the tepid response from Washington. President Trump is already rejecting the idea of responding to such a murder by cutting off weapons sales. Trump sounds as if he believes that the consequence of such an assassination should be a hiccup and then business as usual.The bipartisan cheers from Washington, Silicon Valley and Wall Street fed his recklessness. If he could be feted after kidnapping a Lebanese prime minister and slaughtering Yemeni children, why expect a fuss for murdering a mere journalist?M.B.S. knows how to push Americans\u2019 buttons, speaking about reform and playing us like a fiddle. His willingness to sound accepting of Israel may also be one reason Trump and so many Americans were willing to embrace M.B.S. even as he was out of control at home.In the end, M.B.S. played Kushner, Trump and his other American acolytes for suckers. The White House boasted about $110 billion in arms sales, but nothing close to that came through. Saudi Arabia backed away from Trump\u2019s Middle East peace deal. Financiers salivated over an initial public offering for Aramco, the state-owned oil company, but that keeps getting delayed.The crackdown on corruption is an example of M.B.S.\u2019s manipulation and hypocrisy. It sounded great, but M.B.S. himself has purchased a $300 million castle in France, and a $500 million yacht \u2014 and he didn\u2019t buy them by scrimping on his government salary.\u201cM.B.S.\u2019s message to Saudis is clear: I will shut you up no matter where you are and no matter what laws I have to break to do it,\u201d Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch told me.If Saudi Arabia cannot show that Jamal is safe and sound, NATO countries should jointly expel Saudi ambassadors and suspend weapons sales. The United States should start an investigation under the Magnitsky Act and stand ready to impose sanctions on officials up to M.B.S.America can also make clear to the Saudi royal family that it should find a new crown prince. A mad prince who murders a journalist, kidnaps a prime minister and starves millions of children should never be celebrated at state dinners, but instead belongs in a prison cell.Advertisement"}

But there is a growing perception that some who come to the city are more interested in less high-minded pursuits \u2014 namely, marijuana and prostitution, both of which are largely legal \u2014 and may be doing more harm than good.But in Amsterdam, it\u2019s not just the number of tourists that pose a problem. It\u2019s how they behave.Officials are trying to address the issue. Femke Halsema, the new mayor, visited the red-light district in the De Wallen section of the city in July, the month after she took office. Soon after, her administration announced a set of measures intended to curb misconduct.They include on-the-spot collection of fines as high as 140 euros, or about $165, for public urination, drunkenness or excessive noise (enforcement agents will be equipped with hand-held devices to take card payments); rigorous street cleaning; and the hiring of additional \u201chosts,\u201d or security workers in orange T-shirts, who are trained to give information and remind people of the rules, which include no drinking in the streets and no photographing prostitutes.Perhaps most important, the city is also betting on a marketing campaign to persuade visitors to respect the city and its rules.Iain Mills, a 24-year-old Briton who recently traveled to Amsterdam with a group of friends, is the sort of visitor the city wants to reach. Having taken a low-cost flight leaving midmorning from London, Mr. Mills was enjoying a beer on a canal-side terrace by early afternoon.The convenience of the trip was just one of the attractions, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my first time in Amsterdam and won\u2019t be my last,\u201d he added.Mascha ten Bruggencate, a city administrator who has been tasked with carrying out the new policies, said there was an obvious place to start. \u201cThe red-light district is symbolic of the problem,\u201d she said.On a recent Saturday night, Stoofsteeg, an alley in the district lined by red-lighted windows, was so crowded with tourists gawking at the women on show that walking 50 yards or so took at least 15 minutes of pushing and shuffling. A couple with a stroller gave up after a few minutes.Last year, 20 million tourists visited Amsterdam. During the busiest times of the weekend, as many as 6,000 visitors can pass through that alley \u2014 or attempt to \u2014 every hour, according to city estimates.Pim van Burk, 33, a corporate headhunter who lives above one of the brothels in the area, said that the noise did not bother him but that the crowds could make it difficult to get home. He said he had tried to solve the problem by installing a second bell on his bike. \u201cThat way, people think it\u2019s more than one bike behind them,\u201d he explained.Critics say that the 1012 plan has had unwanted side effects: By shrinking the red-light district, the city has effectively given the area over to characterless shops selling tacky souvenirs or refreshments.\u201cFirst it was the fight against prostitution, sex shops and coffee shops, and now it has changed to banning shops catering to tourists: ice-cream stores, even cheese stores,\u201d Ms. ten Bruggencate said.But the latest efforts go further. As well as the fines and increased presence of city workers on the streets, the ad campaign targets British and Dutch men ages 18 to 34. Those groups tend to visit the city to party, and they are a big part of the crowds on Friday and Saturday nights.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wag our finger at them, knowing this will be countereffective,\u201d said Camiel Verhey, who is in charge of the campaign at the ad agency WaveMaker. \u201cWe just want to show them how to enjoy the freedom on offer.\u201dMost of the ads have been placed online, focusing on sites where would-be visitors book flights, look for accommodation or check the weather. The campaign also uses Facebook and Instagram ads. And geotagging technology \u2014 which uses GPS to show a cellphone user\u2019s location \u2014 helps push the messages to groups as they make their way to the city center.The young men that the campaign is trying to reach tend to be on a tight budget, and city officials are hoping that reminders about the stiff fines and on-the-spot enforcement will help improve their behavior.\u201cSometime it is as simple as tourists not realizing that real people live here,\u201d said Edwin Sch\u00f6lvinck, an organizer of the group and longtime resident of De Wallen.And while he acknowledged that some of the tourists needed to behave better, he said he did not want them to go away completely. \u201cI like tourists, I like people coming here to have fun,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

{"Headline": "How Gordon Parks Became Gordon Parks", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSA new book examines Gordon Parks\u2019s transformation over the formative decade before his time as the first black staff photographer at Life magazine.At the beginning of the 1940s, Gordon Parks was a self-taught fashion and portrait photographer documenting daily life in both St. Paul and Chicago. By the end of the decade he was photographing for Life magazine. While his career has been examined closely, both in his own words and by others, this formative decade has attracted less attention than his experiences as the first black staff photographer at Life, and later as a groundbreaking Hollywood filmmaker.The book and the exhibition cover Gordon\u2019s work photographing for the Farm Security Administration, the Office of War Information and Standard Oil as well as his time in Chicago and St. Paul in the beginning of the \u201840s. It\u2019s an incredible leap from 1940 to 1950. How do you think the 1940s shaped him as a photographer?I was really excited that Philip Brookman focused on the first 10 years.While writing that essay I had an opportunity to go back into some of the work I only knew peripherally, and what excited me was the Smart Woman magazine that he worked on as a photo editor. I started looking at the black middle class of Chicago that he photographed but no one knew about. He focused on fashion in Chicago, of course in St. Paul, but he was very active with the black press during that time, very interested in black migration from the South to the Midwest and the North. But he was focusing on who was living there and what opportunities black people had who were artistic, who had businesses, who were educated. It is a totally different realm than what he focused on in D.C. So that early part was crucial for my reintroduction to Gordon\u2019s work.What I find extraordinary is his range and he did all of these different things during this period.And within different communities, Gordon was comfortable with knowing \u2014 and making different images about different communities. He understood what it meant to be an American in different forms and different ways. At the black newspaper that he worked at in St. Paul, he demanded a byline. He understood what it meant to have his name imprinted on the newspaper when he was making photographs of gorgeous ladies, college students, women who wanted to be models. He\u2019s actually part of their dream. He\u2019s documenting their dreaming of their lives outside of domestic work \u2014 opportunities that were broader.The photos he made for Standard Oil are mostly of white people working. But if you look at the family scenes over dinner you see the composure that he must have had to make them as comfortable as they were.I believe that he was able to make people feel at ease. You know, he was just a good soul.How did you meet him?I was studying photography at Philadelphia College of Art, and there were no black photographers in the history books. I was working on a paper for one of my teachers and asked, where are the black photographers?I remembered seeing Gordon\u2019s work in Life magazine when I was a teenager and was curious about why he was not in the history of photography. I wrote a letter, in purely undergraduate language, that said, \u201cI\u2019m writing a paper on black photographers, I\u2019d like to meet you and talk to you about your work.\u201d He sent a letter back and said, \u201cYes, come and meet me.\u201d He was living at the U.N. Plaza then. I met him and he opened his door and you know, he\u2019d been in my life ever since. Until the day he died. I interviewed him about three months before he died. He called me up to talk about the last book, \u201cHungry Heart.\u201dSo how would you describe him?Generous. One word, generous. He listened closely. He understood what I needed, and he offered support. He loved his work. And like he said, he did not get up early. You could not visit him before 2 p.m. He was a neat, meticulous man in terms of his style of dress.He understood that he had a legacy. And the fact that his photographs were organized, the fact that he knew he wanted his collection to be preserved and his story told by him and by others.And why do you think that is?Absence. The absence of the stories that he probably missed when he looked at the magazines while he worked on the railroad in the 1930s. He understood the silence of African-American history in terms of the larger story. And he was determined to make sure that his story was told, and the breadth of his story was told from multiple perspectives, from a boy growing up in the Midwest, to someone who had a dream about being a photographer. His life was complex. And it was not one-dimensional, as most people think when they see someone who is black and poor in that time period.This was a time when the World\u2019s Fair was in Chicago in 1933 and 1934 and he was traveling back and forth with a young family. Those experiences probably left an impact on him, especially when he started going to the Art Institute to look at art and tried to place himself within that framework of art making and art creating.His life has been widely examined \u2014 by himself in three memoirs, and in the last few years by many other people. Is there something that you think is not often considered but is pivotal in understanding him?I found that he was always looking at beauty. Not in terms of sentimental beauty.But understanding beauty in life, beauty in living. And I think that that\u2019s something that he was in search of in all of his photographs, about life and beauty in that simple sense. And that\u2019s something that people don\u2019t talk about often.That\u2019s interesting, and it goes beyond fashion.Yes, beyond fashion. It\u2019s a kind of inner turmoil of how we appreciate life and how do we give back. When I look at his photographs I see Gordon as a generous person. I see that exchange that happens when he\u2019s in an environment of that family at a table or with the cowboys outside of the store. He\u2019s not allowing barriers to stop him. He\u2019s completely there.But what really fascinated me is that they were so cool with him. You can see it in the photo.I just want to sit at that table and listen to what they are talking about.It\u2019s obviously part of his gift.And that\u2019s a relaxed gift. It\u2019s not forced. A kind of a way of reading \u2014 understanding humanity. He understood humanity. I still feel like he\u2019s with us in a sense. I\u2019m so happy that he made the decision to create the foundation, and understood that his photographs would open up a whole new reading of photography to another generation of photographers.What was the relationship between him and Langston Hughes?And I can see his deep involvement, not just as someone who took the pictures but someone who is part of that.And you see that sense of theatricality in his work. The way that Gordon created the narrative for the \u201cInvisible Man\u201d photos \u2014 not only the manhole cover but the underground scene with the light bulbs. He\u2019s reading deeply into the text. He understood props as well. That\u2019s why he could easily move right into making films.Is there anything else that you think is key to understanding him, both as a photographer and as a man?Well, he understood that his images mattered. That\u2019s why he wanted the byline. And I think that he agreed to make a radical difference looking at black lives in Chicago or in St. Paul.An earlier version of this article misstated the years when Gordon Parks traveled to the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago. It was in 1933 and 1934, not 1939.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jason Kander Withdraws From Kansas City Mayoral Race, Citing PTSD", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJason Kander, a war veteran who became a rising star in the Democratic Party, abruptly dropped out of the Kansas City mayoral race Tuesday, saying he needed to focus on healing from post-traumatic stress disorder.Mr. Kander, 37, who deployed to Afghanistan as an Army intelligence officer in 2006, was the clear front-runner in the race. He is best known for nearly beating Missouri\u2019s incumbent Republican senator, Roy Blunt, in a dark-horse campaign in 2016. In a year when Republicans in the state garnered huge wins, and Hillary Clinton lost by 19 points, Mr. Kander came within three points of taking the seat.On Tuesday, though, he put political ambitions on hold, saying that his efforts to deal with lingering issues of war on his own had failed.\u201cBy all objective measures, things have been going well for me the past few months,\u201d he wrote, noting that he had a best-selling book, an effective nonprofit, and was breaking records with his campaign\u2019s fund-raising. \u201cBut instead of celebrating that accomplishment, I found myself on the phone with the VA\u2019s Veterans Crisis Line, tearfully conceding that, yes, I have had suicidal thoughts. And it wasn\u2019t the first time.\u201dThe United States has a long list of combat veterans, from George Washington to John McCain, who have built successful political careers, and many have talked openly about their struggles to put their war experience behind them. But Mr. Kander\u2019s transparent acknowledgment of his struggles and decision to seek help is unprecedented, said Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\u201cFew people have the courage and vulnerability to admit the problem to themselves,\u201d Mr. Rieckhoff said. \u201cMr. Kander is leading by example, and I think he will show veterans everywhere that it is O.K. to get help.\u201dSuicide is a growing problem in young veterans, Mr. Rieckhoff added. His group plans to help plant more than 5,000 flags on the National Mall on Wednesday to memorialize veterans who died by suicide just this year.\u201cI felt fearful, way beyond anything I\u2019d ever felt before,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was, for the first time in my life, the raw, physical fear of being killed.\u201dWhen he returned to Kansas City, he wrote that he was ridden with guilt and anger, and plagued for years by nightmares. He minimized his symptoms, even to himself, because he felt nothing he experienced was harrowing enough to warrant professional treatment.\u201cInstead of dealing with these issues, I\u2019ve always tried to find a way around them,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI thought if I focused exclusively on service to my neighbors in my hometown, that I could fill the hole inside of me. But it\u2019s just getting worse.\u201dHe said he went to a Veterans Affairs hospital Monday to begin regular treatment, and would curtail his voter registration efforts to focus on healing.\u201cMost people probably didn\u2019t see me as someone that could be depressed and have had PTSD symptoms for over decade, but I am and I have. If you\u2019re struggling with something similar, it\u2019s OK. That doesn\u2019t make you less of a person,\u201d he concluded.The mayoral race had drawn nine candidates, but many saw Mr. Kander as the clear favorite. The election will be held in June.The current Kansas City mayor, Sly James, a Marine veteran who cannot run again because of term limits, voiced support for Mr. Kander in a statement.\u201cI\u2019m proud of Jason for having the courage to share his struggle, and for doing what he needs to do to take care of his health,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cI applaud his bravery, and will do all I can to help him through his healing process.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I certainly disagree with Bernie Sanders on a bunch of stuff.\u201dNeither Ms. Warren nor Mr. Sanders responded to a request for comments.Ms. McCaskill is a famously shrewd politician adept at surviving as a Democrat in one of the most purple states in the country, which she has represented in the Senate since 2006.Republicans view many of those seats, including hers, as possible pickups next week, when strategists see slim hope for a Democratic takeover of the Senate.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Mr. Hawley has assailed Ms. McCaskill for months as out of touch with average voters in the state, both for her considerable personal wealth and for her voting record, which he has called too liberal for the state.She has rejected that characterization, pointing to her working-class roots and her votes in favor of about half of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees and most of his judicial nominees.Ms. McCaskill voted against the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court, however, a move that Mr. Hawley has seized on as an example of her left-wing inclinations.

Yet the threat is real.China has both the playbook and the capacity to interfere. Chinese entities operating with the assent of the government in Beijing already have mounted long-running cyberespionage campaigns against United States government agencies, the defense industry and American private companies. And they have conducted disruptive cyberattacks on political processes and social media campaigns in targets the Chinese government considers internal: Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan.Chinese hackers have often used Taiwan to test cyber espionage techniques that are later deployed against other targets, and they appear to being doing the same with online influence operations.Seen from Beijing\u2019s vantage point, these operations are responses to internal threats. And so far China doesn\u2019t seem to have intervened in another country\u2019s elections through online attacks.If so, the tactics it has deployed in Taiwan may provide a model for any operations in the United States. For example, Chinese hackers could steal and release documents and emails from congressional staffers or State Department officials to, say, expose and embarrass supporters of closer relations with Taiwan or critics of America\u2019s allies.As it watches Washington struggle to find a coherent response to Russian interference in 2016, the Chinese government is likely to think that it could avoid serious repercussions if it ever launched similar cyberattacks in the United States.

{"Headline": "A Vault of Glass and the Deepest Volcanic Eruption Ever Detected", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesClose to the Mariana Trench and nearly three miles below sea level, scientists found evidence of an underwater eruption that was only months old.In 2015, an international team of researchers sent robotic submersibles beneath the waves north of Guam. They had set out to study an area south and west of the Mariana Trench \u2014 the deepest groove in Earth\u2019s oceans \u2014 and an arc of volcanoes, hoping to spy hidden hydrothermal vents.Instead, they discovered a spectacular glassy labyrinth, nearly three miles below sea level. It was recently cooled lava, the product of the deepest underwater volcanic eruption ever recorded by scientists.The finding wasn\u2019t just notable for its extraordinary depth. The extremely young age of the lava deposit offers scientists a window into the very beginnings of what happens when a volcanic outburst occurs beneath the seas. So often, they just see an epilogue.Robotic submersibles are helping to close this information gap.To the west of this arc, the seafloor is slowly spreading. Here, in what is known as the Mariana back-arc, additional volcanic activity is possible \u2014 and this is where Sentry spotted the prolific lava flows.Old lava flows were expected here, but what the researchers detected is the first known new eruption in the back-arc region. That makes this discovery enormously serendipitous, as eruptions here are only expected every few hundred years or so.After small sections of the dark, shiny lava flows were spotted by Sentry\u2019s onboard cameras, bathymetric scans of the area from the researchers\u2019 ship confirmed they are about 4.5 miles long and up to 450 feet thick.Produced by the rapid quenching of lava, the individual protuberances form a surreal collection of glass. Countless bulbous mounds and pillows protruding from the streams are adorned with narrow tubes, which the study authors compare to drips of wax on the outside of a candle.In 2015, sediment had yet to cover the flows, and hydrothermal vents were present. By 2016, the vents had quieted as the flow continued to cool. Speedy, mobile creatures like shrimp and squat lobsters had moved in. The surface was not yet hospitable for slower colonizers like sponges and anemones.Both the lava\u2019s cooling rate and the incomplete invasion of life indicated the eruption likely took place only months before the team stumbled across it. That youthfulness matters \u2014 these fresh rocks provide relatively unaltered insights into the chemical alchemy that produced them. It is also an opportunity to watch diverse communities of living things emerge and change as the hydrothermal system first springs up and then declines.\u201cThe closer in time we are to an event like this, I think the more we can learn about its impacts on deep-sea ecosystems and the chemistry of the oceans,\u201d Dr. Chadwick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NASA Is Cooler Than Ryan Gosling", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeralded in film for its past, but underfunded and underappreciated, the agency continues to give us insight and breakthroughs.Ms. Stirone is a freelance science writer.The romance associated with the Apollo program, and Apollo 11 in particular, is warranted. For one evening in July 1969 everyone paused and watched a human leave the confines of a ship and set foot on not a distant shore but an alien world. Line cooks flicked off their stoves and turned on the radio, families and friends gathered in front of TVs, and the faint sounds of Mr. Armstrong\u2019s disembodied voice danced through the corridors of buildings around the world.Going back to the moon or landing humans on Mars, some think, is the only way to surpass that pinnacle. However, there is so much more to the success of the space program than having boots on extraterrestrial ground.Since the last astronaut left lunar soil in 1972, NASA has conducted 161 human space missions and launched 76 successful robotic missions all over the solar system, from Mars to Saturn\u2019s watery moons.Since their launch in 1977, the twin Voyager spacecraft have been on a historic reconnaissance mission, traveling to every planet in the outer solar system, conducting experiments, then sending back images and data crucial to harnessing our understanding of the very nature of the cosmos. When Apollo 11 touched down on the moon, we had never detected an exoplanet, black holes and aliens were an outlandish idea, oceans and volcanoes on other worlds were the stuff of science fiction, and we had never sent a spacecraft beyond Mars. Quiet progress can still be tremendous.There are entire generations of active scientists, astronomers, physicists and engineers who trace their motivation for joining their field to either witnessing the Apollo moon landings or the Voyager flybys in the 1970s and \u201980s. And most of our basic knowledge of how climate works, how planets form, how stars are born and how long they have to live (including our sun) are the result of examination by NASA programs.Still, the benefits of NASA have never been strictly intergalactic. Both the camera in your cellphone and the memory foam in your bed are among hundreds of commercial goods that trace back to NASA technologies. The agency wasn\u2019t always so underfunded and underappreciated.In this era of exploration, that energy and those skills are best applied by looking far past the thin blue haze of our atmosphere, beyond the lure of the moon. It can be easy to forget that the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters a second, that a light-year is 5.9 trillion miles and that the universe is so immense that most light from afar has yet to reach our sliver of the sky.Astronauts at the International Space Station play a different role in our civic life than those of the Apollo crews. Neither they nor their robotic emissaries get parades or live TV broadcasts. No one stops making dinner when a space probe enters the orbit of a new world. But just because we\u2019re not watching doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. The secret to healing cancer or climate change could very well be hidden among the stars.After all, as space reveals itself to us, it provides answers to some of humanity\u2019s central questions: How did we get here?

{"Headline": "Salvini Seizes on 2nd Italian Teenager\u2019s Death to Push Immigration Issue", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Salvini, the leader of the anti-migrant League party and the country\u2019s tough interior minister, had arrived to leave a rose at the entrance of a drug den where the police had discovered the body of a 16-year-old girl, Desir\u00e9e Mariottini, who they believe had been repeatedly raped, perhaps while unconscious, and left for dead by African migrants.But the activists in San Lorenzo, a traditionally left-wing neighborhood still scarred from the bombings of the Second World War and now bearing the fresh wounds of drug dealers and lawlessness, refused to let Mr. Salvini pass.They carried banners reading: \u201cSalvini exploits tragedies. San Lorenzo is not your campaign\u2019s catwalk,\u201d and shouted for him to leave.\u201cHe\u2019s using this for his constant electoral campaign,\u201d said Isabella Troisi, 22, one of the activists. \u201cLots of people are afraid of migrants now and he is trying to make them more scared.\u201dThe standoff this past week laid bare Italy\u2019s widening polarization. But if Mr. Salvini\u2019s opponents on the left are now attuned to his media tactics and use of the migration issue to whip up his supporters, they have yet to blunt his deepening political inroads, outside this Roman neighborhood at least.Mr. Salvini\u2019s march has only continued. The leader of the formerly separatist party (it used to be called the Northern League) has used a new nationalist \u201cItalians First\u201d message to eclipse his governing partners in the Five Star Movement and become the driving force of Italy\u2019s government.He has cracked down on migrants, raised the alarm about a drug and security emergency, led a rebellion against the European Union, insulted its leaders as drunks, sated the news media with a constant stream of outrageous sound bites, baited the left into overreactions by purposefully echoing Mussolini and filled the widespread Italian demand for a law-and-order heavy.His support has grown so strong around Italy that he appears to have started thinking the unthinkable: conquering Rome with a League candidate for mayor, and thus governing a capital his party once explicitly ran against and disparaged as the \u201cGreat Thief.\u201dIf she were to resign, which is unlikely, elections could be held next May, and Mr. Salvini\u2019s League is in a better position than ever to capture the capital. \u201cA League Mayor in the Capitol,\u201d read an exuberant headline of the conservative newspaper Il Tempo.In the death of Ms. Mariottini, Mr. Salvini, one of the most politically attuned leaders in Europe, heard a clarion call that he has heard before and that has helped propel his political rise.The death of Ms. Mariottini provided a similar opening for Mr. Salvini, who uses social media as a constant and attention-demanding megaphone: He wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning that he had attended an emergency public order meeting with Ms. Raggi.(While the mayor has ordered an end to drinking after 9 p.m. in San Lorenzo, Mr. Salvini has proposed the \u201cchemical castration\u201d of rapists.)Then, he wrote, he would go to San Lorenzo: \u201cA 16-year-old girl can\u2019t die, raped like this, in a receptacle of crime and drug dealers. I\u2019m going to see it in person. #ZeroTolerance.\u201dBut before he arrived, cameramen, TV anchors and activists crowded in front of Via dei Lucani 22, the entrance to the drug den where the girl had been found and where the words \u201cJustice for Desir\u00e9e\u201d was now written amid red hearts.\u201cWe don\u2019t want xenophobes in San Lorenzo,\u201d said Carlo Caponi, a member of the anti-fascist National Association of Italian Partisans, who waved his organization\u2019s flag. \u201cWe defend the Constitution and everyone\u2019s civil rights.\u201dThe protesters exchanged sharp words with a few of Mr. Salvini\u2019s supporters, who made sure their voices were heard.\u201cPamela was killed by four Nigerians, and Desir\u00e9e was killed by Moroccans!\u201d screamed Ilenia Curti, 39, of San Lorenzo. (The police have so far held two Senegalese men, a Nigerian and a Ghanaian in connection with Ms. Mariottini\u2019s death.) When the activists challenged her, she screamed, \u201cItalians First!\u201dMs. Curti, whose Facebook page is peppered with posts expressing rage at the killing of Ms. Mastropietro in Macerata and admiration for Mussolini, screamed that the students and activists were \u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201cpimps.\u201dSuddenly, a stir ran through the crowd.\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d one reporter shouted, and the scrum rushed away from Ms. Curti and the protesters to the other end of the street.Moments later, Mr. Salvini, wearing a cobalt blue suit and open-collar white shirt, was encapsulated in the warm cocoon of the press. The former disc jockey immediately began talking.He said that by February, there would be 154 more police and 100 more paramilitary police officers in Rome \u201cthanks to a courageous economic budget that Brussels would like us to change, but we will not change a comma.\u201dHe said he would have gladly left the rose that he had brought with him in the car if it weren\u2019t for \u201cthose imbeciles.\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hurt the drug dealers.\u201d He said he would act to get rid of an \u201cidiotic law of the left-wing government\u201d that had decriminalized drug use.\u201cI am here to pledge myself to the normal people from the neighborhood who don\u2019t want drug dealing, chaos, prostitution, rackets. To clean it up,\u201d he said, adding that he couldn\u2019t explain why no one had done anything before, but he would act with a \u201cheavy hand.\u201dAt a certain point, Mr. Salvini broke free from the scrum and ran up the street, but the protesters, screaming that he should leave the neighborhood, held firm. Mr. Salvini stopped, and the protective orbit of camera satellites surrounded him again.Mr. Salvini\u2019s movable news conference seemed stuck. After more than 20 minutes, he retreated to his car and drove off.\u201cWe had had a good result in not allowing him onto the street,\u201d Ms. Troisi, the activist, said triumphantly. But she acknowledged that Mr. Salvini seemed always more popular in the city and the country, and that he always seemed to come out on top.A couple hours after the rally broke up, Mr. Salvini returned unannounced and left a rose in front of the gate.La Stampa, one of the nation\u2019s leading newspapers, published a picture of it on its front page.

{"Headline": "Gun Violence and Pipe Bombs Jolt Voters as Election Season Ends. \u2018Again?\u2019 One Asks.", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn South Florida, not far from the mass shooting in Parkland in February, voters absorbed a week of gun violence and pipe bombs with a kind of grim resignation.\u201cAgain?\u201d asked Karenn Durand, 27, mid-shift at a restaurant in North Miami on Saturday, pondering the mass murder at a Pittsburgh synagogue. She said she held President Trump personally responsible \u2014 if not for the shooting itself, then at least for the nation\u2019s deep divisions that the shooting reflected in horrific reality.In Milwaukee, Eric Pfeiler, an electrician who was walking downtown with his son on Saturday, saw more of a systemic breakdown than any one person to blame.\u201cThere\u2019s just so much turmoil everywhere, it\u2019s just sad,\u201d Mr. Pfeiler said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s lost their vision and has just started pointing fingers.\u201dAnd at Mr. Trump\u2019s rally on Saturday afternoon at an airport hangar in Murphysboro, Ill., people expressed anxieties over the violence and discord they saw in American society. But they had come for a Trump rally performance, and that was what they wanted to see. When he begged their forgiveness and asked them at one point, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to tone it down \u2014 just a little,\u201d many people roared a resounding \u201cNo!\u201dWith nine days left in an already divisive election season, the campaign\u2019s finale is unfolding amid a cascade of horrors and rounds of finger-pointing that reflect the deep fault lines in dozens of competitive House races and a handful of Senate races nationwide. If many voters appear set to back politicians from their own parties, according to interviews and polling, they also often defended or blamed politicians \u2014 particularly Mr. Trump \u2014 based on the same partisan lines.In Florida on Saturday, hours after the synagogue shooting, Eric Gooden, a Democratic voter, hoped for an electoral solution to the turmoil. \u201cThe only way this will end is by the voting box,\u201d he said.At Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Illinois, many people seemed altogether unaware of the synagogue shooting, until someone offered a prayer from the stage.Asked who was to blame for the country\u2019s strife, Patricia Mitchell, who drove more than two hours from St. Louis to attend, cited \u201cthe globalists,\u201d whom she then defined as \u201csomebody who won\u2019t allow or doesn\u2019t like for our country to just be themselves.\u201d\u201cThey want to mold everybody into one big melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re designed.\u201dBut the violence shows that the turmoil is starting very much at home. Many voters, in interviews with The New York Times in recent weeks, have been divided over national identity and who gets to define values in America, especially on issues of immigration and race.\u201cPeople have to stop saying hateful things about refugees, about Jews, about Latinos, about transgender people, about the other,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt has to stop in the context of everything that we are doing, not just in the context of this election.\u201dBut in the final weeks of the midterm election, which has become in part a nationwide referendum on Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, the climate has intensified, and escalating violence and fear are exacerbating divergent viewpoints among voters. At the halfway mark of his term, Mr. Trump faces a reckoning at home related to some of the words he spoke from the inauguration dais: \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and right now.\u201d\u201cPipe bombs against public officials, African-Americans killed in Kentucky, continued physical threats against the press, an all-out campaign of fear directed at immigrants\u201d signal that hate is on the march in America, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday.\u201cWe\u2019re facing a battle for the soul of this nation,\u201d added Mr. Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020. \u201cWords matter. And silence is complicity.\u201dFor some, a parallel that comes to mind for the current moment is the summer of the presidential election of 1968, which saw the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy two months apart, said Randall Balmer, who leads Dartmouth College\u2019s religion department.\u201cThe difference, however, is that those shootings appeared to be directed against specific individuals, whereas this year\u2019s violence is more tribal \u2014 against Democrats generally or Jews generally,\u201d he said.Political leaders and candidates on the left and right saw a host of issues in Saturday\u2019s tragedy, from gun violence to freedom to worship to the seemingly nonstop political maneuvering.\u201cWhy is it so hard to accept that a clearly deranged man carried out deranged acts?\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, tweeted. \u201cThe \u2018false flag\u2019 conspiracy theories on one side & the \u2018it\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault\u2019 on the other shows how unhinged politics has become. This isn\u2019t incivility. It\u2019s a society that has lost common sense.\u201dIn California, Katie Porter, a Democrat running for Congress in Orange County, denounced the commonplace nature of hate. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of Washington politicians who are too afraid of crossing their donors in the gun lobby to take common-sense action to protect our families,\u201d she said.As candidates in Pennsylvania canceled campaign events, and mourners gathered for vigils across Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump did not cancel his own rally in Illinois. He told the crowds the shooting was \u201can evil anti-Semitic attack,\u201d and he urged the need to \u201cvanquish the forces of hate.\u201d But then he also criticized Hillary Clinton, a target in the pipe bomb mailings, prompting chants of \u201clock her up.\u201d The crowd cheered when Mr. Trump said he would be sending troops to the border to stop the migrant caravan.In Florida, Edlyn LaFrance, 32, from Miami, said Mr. Trump was simply channeling the beliefs and grievances of his supporters, and that social media had only exacerbated an avalanche of national hate.\u201cYou just type one message on Facebook and hit \u2018send,\u2019\u201d Ms. LaFrance said. \u201cYou find like-minded people.\u201dThe current climate of division is so pervasive that, in a report to be released this week, the Simon Wiesenthal Center found that more than 40 percent of Americans believe that the country is headed to a civil war, in a survey completed in September.\u201cMore than 80 percent of the voting public blames either the presidency, mainstream media or Congress, and it breaks down roughly along party lines,\u201d said Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and dean of the center, who prayed at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cDemocrats and independents believe the executive branch is the problem. Republicans blame mainstream media and, to a lesser extent, Congress.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In Wisconsin, as news of the synagogue shooting broke Saturday morning, Ellie Thomas, a nutritionist, said she had been limiting her intake of news because the volume of tragedy had become overwhelming.

{"Headline": "Getting Beyond Balls and Strikes", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do umpires and judges have in common? Not as much as some people think.Contributing Opinion Writer Three umpires walk into a bar. The World Series is on TV \u2014 Red Sox vs. Dodgers. The three umps have a few beers as they watch the game and discuss their philosophies of umpiring.The first one says, \u201cI know that some are balls and some are strikes, so when I\u2019m behind the plate I call them as I see them.\u201d You might describe him as an empiricist.The second one then says, \u201cYou\u2019re right that some are balls and some are strikes, but I call them as they are.\u201d He\u2019s a realist. After a pause, they turn to the third one, who takes a deep drink and says: \u201cIt\u2019s true that some are balls and some are strikes. But they ain\u2019t nothing until I call \u2019em!\u201dHe\u2019s the pragmatist. (Or if you like, a social constructivist.)I got this joke from my friend Daniel Cohen, a philosophy professor at Colby, who credits it to the college\u2019s former president, Julius Seelye Bixler. As the World Series gets underway, I\u2019ve been thinking about what this story tells us about American justice and the way we make decisions \u2014 in baseball and in life.There was a lot of talk during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing about the proper role of a judge, comparing his or her ideal approach with that of an umpire. It was Chief Justice John Roberts, in fact, who \u2014 during his own hearing in 2005 \u2014 most famously used the metaphor. \u201cUmpires don\u2019t make the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThey apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ballgame to see the umpire.\u201dA few years later, during Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s confirmation hearing, she agreed with much of what Chief Justice Roberts had said. But she also noted that the metaphor might suggest to some people that law is a kind of robotic enterprise, that \u201ceverything is clear cut, and there\u2019s no judgment in the process. And I do think that that\u2019s not right, and that it\u2019s especially not right at the Supreme Court level, where the hardest cases go.\u201dJudges, like umpires, have to decide what kind of philosophers they will be: empiricists, realists, pragmatists \u2014 or something else entirely.If you \u201ccall them the way you see them,\u201d you\u2019re accepting that your role is to incorporate your own wisdom and research into the making of decisions \u2014 because \u201cthe way you see them\u201d is influenced by your own experience of being human.If you believe \u201cthey ain\u2019t nothing until I call \u2019em!\u201d you\u2019re not just a pragmatist \u2014 you\u2019re an activist, or so conservative legal scholars would have you believe.It\u2019s no coincidence that it\u2019s the world of grays that often presents the greatest challenge for conservatives; they don\u2019t like it when things fall outside the bright lines originally imagined by our 18th-century founders \u2014 men whom, we should note, agreed that African-Americans should count as only three-fifths of a human and that the right to vote should be reserved for white men who owned land.But the passage of time ensures that a changing world surely contains shades of gray. Most of the cases coming before the Supreme Court call not for the application of black-and-white rules but for an understanding of the complexity of human experience.If you were an \u201coriginalist\u201d umpire, for instance, how would you have called the 1951 game when Bill Veeck, the manager of the St. Louis Browns, sent in Eddie Gaedel to bat against the Detroit Tigers? Gaedel, who stood 3 feet 7 inches tall, had a tiny strike zone; if he\u2019d gone into the extreme crouch that Veeck wanted, it would have been just 1.5 inches high \u2014 smaller than the diameter of a baseball itself. How would you have ruled in a case like this, one surely unforeseen by the founding father, Abner Doubleday?He also lamented the technology that has brought us the digital strike zone on television, a little square that shows \u2014 in theory \u2014 whether a pitch was high and inside, whether it was low or away. \u201cReplay,\u201d he noted, \u201chas reinforced the feeling that it\u2019s simple and obvious. Yet there are many intangibles when calling balls and strikes.\u201dExactly \u2014 and it\u2019s the way you consider the intangible that defines what kind of judge, or umpire, you will be. It also has a lot to say about how you live your life and whether in the face of the new and unsettling you will react like a robot or whether you will react like a human being \u2014 a creature ruled by the law, to be sure, but also ruled in no small measure by wisdom, and kindness, and by love.Or you could be honest, like the comedian George Carlin\u2019s sports broadcaster, Biff Barf. \u201cI call \u2019em the way I see \u2019em,\u201d Barf said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t see \u2019em, I make \u2019em up!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even for Trump, There Is Such a Thing as Too Far ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen children are being locked away, Republican attacks on immigrants will backfire.Mr. Barreto is a political scientist at U.C.L.A.Over the past few weeks, on the campaign trail and at home in the White House, President Trump has made it clear that attacking immigrants is the main thrust of his midterm message. In 2016, his anti-immigrant campaign resonated with his core supporters and it may well again in 2018, but this year more people have been turned off by the reality of his anti-immigrant politics. As a result, Mr. Trump\u2019s vile strategy is more likely to backfire this time.Here\u2019s where Democrats have a chance to make their position clear and to win over voters who are frustrated with name-calling. Candidates should directly reject the racist rhetoric and blatant lies that demonize immigrants. It should go without saying but it bears repeating: Baseless fear-mongering is not what makes America great. Standing up for an inclusive and welcoming society sends a message to immigrant and minority voters that candidates are on their side \u2014 and this can lead to greater voter turnout.In poll after poll, voters agree that Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy is an effort to divide the country while distracting voters from other important issues, like access to affordable health care. In these last two weeks of campaigning, Democratic candidates would be wise to call out Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobia for what it is, to stand up for the most basic human rights and then to remind voters that the 2017 tax cuts were designed, in the main, to benefit the wealthy. Nor should they be afraid to remind voters that drastic cuts to health care are still on the Trump agenda.If Democratic candidates do this, they have a chance to not repeat past performance in midterm elections and mobilize a record number of immigrant and minority voters. But anger alone will not guarantee results. Candidates need to connect with people who don\u2019t regularly vote in midterms but who are upset over Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant crusade. Mr. Trump thinks he has a winning strategy, and he is counting on conservative anti-immigrant voters to make their way to the polls in 2018 just as they did in 2016. But now that his actual policies have been in place for half a term, fewer people turn out to be onboard with putting immigrant toddlers in cages. When given a chance, and when the campaign message is stark, voters will turn out for candidates who prefer inclusion to exclusion. In 2018, Donald Trump and his Republican Party have made it very clear which side they are on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: The China Trade War Could Decimate Deal-Making", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Fred Hu, the chairman of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group, told the NYT, \u201cChina is trying to cultivate ties with\u201d American business giants. It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank.

They cavort and dive in Brooks Falls, feasting on migrating sockeye salmon and gaining up to four pounds a day.There are more than 2,000 brown bears in Katmai, and in October and November they enter their dens, where they can hibernate for up to half a year and lose a third of their body mass. To prepare their bodies, they must enter a state known as hyperphagia, in which they eat nearly nonstop until they become practically unrecognizable to the rangers who know them.In the early summer, their menu options are limited \u2014 the omnivorous bears can subsist on sedge and berries. But starting in late June, millions of sockeye salmon swim upstream through the park to spawn. Bears will congregate en masse around Brooks Falls and catch them easily. The prime eating real estate lies just beneath the falls. \u201cThe bears will feel around with their feet to grab them,\u201d Sara Wolman, a Park Service ranger at Katmai, said in a phone interview.A single bear can add up to four pounds of weight a day, eating upward of two dozen sockeye salmon \u2014 which each contain about 4,000 calories. The largest adult males can turn in for the winter weighing in at over 1,200 pounds.The webcams \u2014 which provide vivid footage and are controlled by volunteers \u2014 have transformed the charismatic bears into social media celebrities. A perennial favorite is Otis, a 22-year-old behemoth who has won the competition two of the past three years. But on Friday he was defeated easily in the second round by a hulking challenger \u2014 Bear 409. Nicknamed Beadnose, she won the matchup by more than 3,000 votes and will meet Bear 854, nicknamed Divot, in the semifinals.\u201cI\u2019m rooting for her,\u201d Ms. Wolman said, praising her technique. \u201cShe\u2019s got her spot on the lip of the falls.

But what I feel now is new.I grew up in a house that everyone said was haunted. Several nights before my mother died there, my neighbors saw a black shadow \u2014 human shaped \u2014 slither along the walls of the stairwell, drift down the hallway and into her room. It went in, and it came back out.The next day, a home health care nurse looked in a mirror in the bathroom. Standing behind her in the reflection, she said, was a translucent crone with a cruel, knowing expression.She quit on the spot. My sister and I were annoyed. There are no such things as ghosts, we explained.I\u2019d said something similar to my children in that same house when they were young. Terrified one night by the sound of something in the house growling \u201clike a bear\u201d (which turned out to be my mother snoring), I hugged them tight and said: \u201cThere are no such things as monsters. I will protect you.\u201dWhen I was 24, I lived with a friend, Jon, in an uptown apartment in New York City, a friend who (although I did not know it at the time) was in the midst of a psychotic break. One night Jon woke me up at 2 a.m. and said that he had to stay in my room all night, to ward off an evil spirit. He sat himself down with a long kitchen knife in the corner, as I lay there, fairly certain that the evil spirit that was imperiling me was Jon himself.When my son Sean vanished, at Lego Land in Windsor, England, in the summer of 1999, I was terrified that I would never see him again. When he reappeared 45 minutes later, wondering what all the fuss was about, I wrapped that child up in my arms and wept. \u201cI was just exploring,\u201d he explained.(Later that same year, Sean wandered off while we were shopping in Blarney Woolen Mills in County Cork, Ireland. I went to the center of the store \u2014 sort of like the L.L. Bean of Ireland \u2014 and shouted: \u201cSean! Sean come here!\u201d And a minute later, four young boys appeared \u2014 all of them named Sean and not one of them my son.)When he was born, Sean was found to have a heart condition \u2014 super-ventricular tachycardia \u2014 that caused his heart to pound at 240 beats a minute. For the first several days of his life our child lay in the intensive care unit at Maine General, as we sat there weeping at his side. We did not know if he was going to live or die.I was frightened by all these losses, or near-losses. But these were nothing compared with what I feel right now.We never used to keep our doors locked; now we bolt them every night.These days, when I hear a gun go off in my Maine community, my heart pounds with dread that this time, someone is coming for me.Sometimes we talk about leaving the country, going back to Ireland.It is possible that the specter that appeared in the mirror in my mother\u2019s house was a trick of the light or a work of the imagination. It\u2019s possible \u2014 likely, in fact \u2014 that my friend Jon was suffering from schizophrenia, a medical condition. As for our son Sean, whom I\u2019ve feared I have lost again and again, he is now 22 and in graduate school, learning how to make robots.All of these monsters turned out, in the end, to be chimeras.But now I live in a world in which the president of the United States urges violence against reporters, in which survivors of sexual assault are ridiculed, in which migrant children are placed in \u201cbaby jails,\u201d in which transgender people are faced with erasure, in which Donald Trump lies and lies and lies. And in response to all of this, and so much more, a large portion of the country \u2014 is it 40 percent? \u2014 cheers and laughs and smiles.As a journalist, as someone who has been threatened with male violence, as the daughter of an immigrant, as a transgender American, as a person who believes that a president should tell the truth, I can tell you I am not cheering or laughing or smiling.Donald Trump has harmed me more than any specter. He has transformed the country I love into a place of fear and roiling hatred. I honestly do not know if my family and I can survive him.Once, I told my children that monsters were not real and that I could keep them safe. I was wrong.Advertisement"}

Contemplating the gleaming, tiled cafes with adjacent groceries that she had seen in Rome, she could envision her own sleek, hip place right in the center of Washington. At its heart would be an open kitchen serving rustic, seasonal Italian cuisine, and on the side, a market selling the same high-quality local produce, seafood and imported condiments she would cook with.That idea didn\u2019t seem radical to her, either, but when she went to banks for financing, they repeatedly rejected her proposal.\u201cTo them, I was doing something different \u2014 a woman opening a restaurant without any male partners,\u201d she recalled as she shook a pan full of sweet, sliced onions over the fierce blue flames of her stove at Centrolina. \u201cThey wanted to see a hundred other successful businesses in the same model, but there weren\u2019t a lot of comparable places to point to.\u201d\u201cComparable,\u201d in the banks\u2019 parlance, meant owned by a woman.The pan hissed and sputtered as Ms. Brandwein poured tomatoes into the steaming onions, setting the pot to simmer into a heady sauce. Then she took out her chef\u2019s knife and got to work on the eggplant, expertly slicing it into fat, even cubes, a bit larger than she would for a pasta topping. The girth of the pieces helps maintain their texture, she said, so they get crunchy on the outside without turning to mush within. She deep-fries the chunks in her ever-ready fryer at the restaurant; at home, a broiler gets the job done.It took her four grueling years to gather the funding for Centrolina, cobbled together from a mix of small investors, colleagues and customers whom she talked into the deal, one at a time.Financing secured, she put together her team, hiring women for all the management positions. She did this, in part, because she hoped that once the restaurant succeeded, it would stand as an example for other female chefs and entrepreneurs, as well as for the banks.When you read the menu, the reason is obvious: Ms. Brandwein has a way of seeing Italian classics from a fresh angle. She seems to ask herself, is there a way to make an already wonderful dish even more delicious?Sometimes the answer is no, and then she brings her exquisite technique to familiar dishes: grilled daily fish, or homemade ravioli with roasted squash, sage, butter and amaretto cookies.But when the answer is yes, the results can be thrilling. She serves her burrata with caviar and homemade potato chips, her gnocchi with nebbiolo-braised goat, her buckwheat chitarra pasta with anchovy and chickpeas.As for her higher ambitions? The restaurant business is finally changing, she said, and female chefs are getting at least a bit more of the respect and attention they\u2019ve earned.\u201cNow it\u2019s a great time to be a woman chef,\u201d she said. \u201cI just had to wait 20 years for that to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You are going to have to make the first move.\u201d I\u2019ve been struggling to find a succinct and not-angry response. Mostly, I\u2019ve felt grossed out that they missed the whole point of #MeToo. I say good night and never see them again. But it\u2019s happened often enough that I\u2019d like a better reply. Any ideas?E.The power of #MeToo always struck me as two-tiered: The personal stories it\u2019s yielded speak to the widespread sexual abuse and harassment that women and girls face every day. In turn, the prevalence of misconduct has increased awareness of and empathy with survivors, at least from anyone with a heart.But the guys you\u2019re dating seem to have missed the empathic connection with women, even as they\u2019ve carefully noted the number of men affected. This is hugely disappointing. When people (here, men \u2014 but not always) don\u2019t even try to identify with the pain of others, they often become more concerned with avoiding accusation than preventing further harm.As for responding to guys who don\u2019t know the difference between sexual assault and a good-night kiss, go with: \u201cThat\u2019s O.K.

(And for better or worse, the nuclear family is generally how our society is arranged.) When it\u2019s your birthday, you get to make the guest list. Call your sister and apologize for your tantrum.

I want to be supportive, so I text her occasionally to get together. I don\u2019t usually have fun, but I don\u2019t mind. She doesn\u2019t see many people. The problem: She asks me to plan parties for her, including her birthday party.

But there\u2019s a hopeful sign: People who are depressed and anxious often want to be alone. Your friend, on the other hand, seems to want to socialize, even if she doesn\u2019t have the energy to organize it herself.

What Thursday\u2019s hearing drove home, however, was that white male rage isn\u2019t restricted to blue-collar guys in diners. It\u2019s also present among people who\u2019ve done very well in life\u2019s lottery, whom you would normally consider very much part of the elite.In other words, hatred can go along with high income, and all too often does.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]And here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s perfectly possible for a man to lead a comfortable, indeed enviable life by any objective standard, yet be consumed with bitterness driven by status anxiety.You might think that this is impossible, that having a good job and a comfortable life would inoculate someone against envy and hatred. That is, you might think that if you knew nothing of human nature and the world.I\u2019ve spent my whole adult life in rarefied academic circles, where everyone has a good income and excellent working conditions. Yet I know many people in that world who are seething with resentment because they aren\u2019t at Harvard or Yale, or who actually are at Harvard or Yale but are seething all the same because they haven\u2019t received a Nobel Prize.And this sort of high-end resentment, the anger of highly privileged people who nonetheless feel that they aren\u2019t privileged enough or that their privileges might be eroded by social change, suffuses the modern conservative movement.Indeed, my guess is that his privileged roots are precisely why he\u2019s so angry.I very much ran with the nerds during my own time at Yale, but I did encounter people like Kavanaugh \u2014 hard-partying sons of privilege who counted on their connections to insulate them from any consequences from their actions, up to and including abusive behavior toward women. And that kind of elite privilege still exists.But it\u2019s privilege under siege. An increasingly diverse society no longer accepts the God-given right of white males from the right families to run things, and a society with many empowered, educated women is finally rejecting the droit de seigneur once granted to powerful men.And nothing makes a man accustomed to privilege angrier than the prospect of losing some of that privilege, especially if it comes with the suggestion that people like him are subject to the same rules as the rest of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Corruption: The Definitive List", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe many ways that the president, his family and his aides are lining their own pockets.OpinionThey don\u2019t even try very hard to hide it. President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit. They are accepting sweetheart deals from foreigners. And they are harnessing the power of the federal government on behalf of their businesses. There\u2019s a word for this: corruption. Given how widespread Trumpian corruption has become, we thought it was time to make a list. It\u2019s meant to be a definitive list of self-dealing by the president, his family, his staff or his friends \u2014 since he began running for president. To qualify, an incident needs to seem highly credible, even if it remains unresolved, and needs to involve making money. Compiling the list made us understand why some historians believe Trump\u2019s administration is the most corrupt since at least Warren Harding\u2019s, of 1920s Teapot Dome fame. Trump administration officials and people close to them are brashly using power to amass perks and cash. They are betting that they can get away with it. So far, Congress has let them.Here\u2019s the list, sorted into thematic categories:That celebration fits a pattern. Officials from foreign governments have realized they can curry favor with Trump by spending money at his properties. The list of governments includes Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, India, Afghanistan and Qatar. Some may have done so even if he were not the president, but others are well aware of what they are doing. The president has played golf at his properties dozens of times since taking office. He refers to his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, as the winter White House. Shortly after his election, he celebrated New Year\u2019s along with 800 guests there, with tickets costing more than $500. And Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, once encouraged people to buy clothes from Ivanka Trump\u2019s line \u2014 while Conway was giving a television interview from the White House. The president and his aides have repeatedly shown they are willing to use the government\u2019s prestige and power to help their friends and relatives make money. Among the examples:Several Trump officials \u2014 current and former \u2014 have traded stocks while serving in top government positions. In some cases, they appear to have made policy decisions benefiting the companies in which they owned a stake.Corey Lewandowski, the former manager of Trump\u2019s campaign, is paid for work that looks very much like lobbying \u2014 such as participating in a lobbying firm\u2019s phone calls with clients and doing work on behalf of T-Mobile, the telecommunications company firm. But Lewandowski has not registered as a lobbyist and says he does not need to do so. Trump officials have made a habit of billing American taxpayers for their personal travel. Ryan Zinke, Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior, chartered a $12,000 flight to fly out of Las Vegas, where he had given a 12-minute speech to a hockey team owned by a businessman who donated to his congressional campaign.And Price, the former health secretary, spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on private planes. His history of unethical stock trading didn\u2019t keep Trump from naming Price to the cabinet. But the private-plane scandal received enough attention that the White House eventually forced Price to resign.The pettiest kind of Trumpian corruption takes the form of interior decorating. It has shirked its constitutional duty.The biggest scandal of all, however, is not even the corruption of the Trump administration. It\u2019s the inaction of Congress. The founders were well aware that the government they were creating could end up with corrupt or unethical leaders, all the way up to the president. That\u2019s why the Constitution gives Congress tremendous power to investigate and even remove officials in the executive branch.Yet the current congressional leaders \u2014 the Republican leaders \u2014 have refused to do so. They have shirked their duty to act as a check on the president and his appointees. They have instead defended Trump and made excuses on his behalf. They have enabled the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes.What\u2019s missing from this list?

Not slow-smoked chicken dipped in mayonnaise-based \u201cwhite\u201d barbecue sauce \u2014 a longstanding specialty of Decatur, Ala. Not even mutton, smoked the better part of a day, then sauced with a Worcestershire-and lemon-based \u201cblack dip\u201d \u2014 the barbecue calling card of Owensboro, Ky.OHIO80 milesInd.Ill.LouisvilleLexingtonOwensboroKentuckyCave CityTompkinsvilleTenn.By The New York TimesNo, you\u2019ll find this barbecue chiefly here in Monroe County, and a handful of surrounding counties in southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee, where it goes by the name shoulder plate, or shoulder sandwich.In fact, you might question whether to call it barbecue at all. Just don\u2019t question Anita Hamilton Bartlett, the proprietor of R&S Barbecue in Tompkinsville (population 2,273), just north of the Tennessee state line.Five days a week for the last 27 years, the affable Ms. Bartlett, 60, and her team have followed an immutable ritual. At 5 a.m., they stoke a tall metal firebox behind the restaurant to burn hickory flats (rough-sawed planks) down to embers. At 9:30 a.m., they start the precarious process of transferring the glowing coals on a shovel to a stone hearth built into the back wall of the kitchen. Dips are simmered, slaws (creamy or vinegar) are mixed, and green beans are boiled to within an inch of their lives, in true Southern tradition.When the one-room restaurant, with its beige metal siding and mismatched tables and chairs, opens at 10:30 a.m., Ms. Bartlett has already started grilling the pork-shoulder steaks that constitute both the house specialty and the essence of Monroe County barbecue.Shoulder steaks? Grilled? You won\u2019t find the usual whole pork shoulders here, slow-smoked for half a day. There\u2019s no chopping or shredding the meat to be doused with vinegar sauce, as they do elsewhere in Kentucky and the Carolinas. Monroe County barbecue consists of pork shoulder cut crosswise on a meat saw into pencil-thin steaks, which are grilled, rather than smoked, over hickory embers.But these pork steaks don\u2019t become barbecue until they are dipped \u2014 not once, but twice \u2014 in a fiery amalgam of vinegar, melted butter, lard, salt and tongue-torturing doses of black and cayenne peppers.The result may make you think of Buffalo wings, with grilled pork steaks standing in for deep-fried chicken. But Buffalo wings don\u2019t taste of wood smoke. You may be reminded of jerky, as the thin slices of pork acquire a firm texture in the 30 minutes or so they spend over the embers. The dipped pork-shoulder steak appears to have originated in Monroe County. But why here, and how? As for pork steaks, Ms. Bartlett learned to cook those from Alex Erwin Tooley, whose father opened the first barbecue restaurant in Tompkinsville, Tooley\u2019s BBQ. Ms. Bartlett went to work there part time in the 1990s, \u201cto help Mr. Tooley out,\u201d she recalled. She found that she preferred cooking and serving to the line work she did at a local textile factory. She ultimately bought the business in 2004.Whole shoulder has obvious advantages \u2014 generous marbling, intrinsic tenderness \u2014 that make it nearly impossible to overcook and dry out. It takes more time to cook, but the process is considerably less labor intensive than cutting and grilling shoulder steaks.\u201cHe was the first person to cook pork steaks in Tompkinsville, and he\u2019d buy them from my daddy,\u201d Mr. Ross recalled. He thinks it was Mr. Evans who taught Mr. Tooley how to grill and dip a pork steak. There\u2019s another connection here: Mr. Evans was Ms. Bartlett\u2019s grandfather \u2014 the man who taught her about the incendiary dip.To produce pork-shoulder steaks, Mr. Ross starts with frozen pork shoulders from Indiana, which he cuts into slices, about 1/4- to 5/8-inch thick, using a meat saw. One 10-pound pork shoulder yields about 20 steaks, enough to feed five or six people.In a busy week in the summer, when demand peaks, Mr. Ross\u2019s five-person shop ships 20,000 pounds of pork shoulder to more than 50 barbecue joints in 13 counties in southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee.Mr. Walden took over in 2005. He follows the basic Monroe County formula, but with a few subtle twists.His dip contains ketchup and yellow mustard in addition to the usual vinegar, butter, lard and cayenne; they makes it a whisper sharper and sweeter. (Maybe that\u2019s why he goes through 30 gallons of dip a day.) The grilling time is shorter \u2014 15 minutes \u2014 and once cooked, the pork steaks rest in dip on a steam table, which makes them a little moister. As for how to eat them like a local, Dr. Berry wiggled his fingers. \u201cYou tear the steaks into bite-size pieces, dip them in the extra cup of hot sauce you had the wisdom to order on the side, and pop them into your mouth.\u201d\u201cDip the hell out of your pork,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the lingering burn, just enough to keep the endorphins going.\u201dTradition calls for grilling the chops over hickory-wood embers, a fuel that is steeped in romance. One easy way to do this in your backyard is to light hickory chunks in a chimney starter and let them burn down to embers. Or grill the pork over a charcoal fire enhanced with a handful of hickory chunks or chips. Gas grillers can place a couple of hickory chunks under the grate over the burners or between the Flavorizer bars of a Weber gas grill.Monroe County pit masters use a slow-grill process, cooking a quarter-inch-thick shoulder chop for as long as 40 minutes. I prefer a quick grill to darkly sear the outside of the pork, leaving the center juicy and with a blush of pink.As for the dip, it requires no tinkering, but you will need an ingredient that may not be part of your normal grocery run: lard. Lard reinforces the porky flavor of the steaks and keeps them rich and moist. If it\u2019s unavailable, use more butter. The preferred souring agent in Monroe County is brown vinegar (a distilled vinegar darkened with caramel coloring), but distilled white vinegar works just fine.The dip works great for all manner of grilled chicken and, yes, for Buffalo wings.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re found on six continents, have adapted to a dizzying array of habitats and range in size from 25-foot pythons to chameleons smaller than a pencil eraser. Extinct members of the group include massive snakes like Titanoboa and seafaring mosasaurs, which rivaled small whales in size. Squamates \u201cinhabit almost every single environment,\u201d said Tiago Sim\u00f5es, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta, who coauthored the study. \u201cThey learned how to climb on glass, how to swim, how to glide. They can even run over water.\u201dBut the origin of squamates has long been an enigma. The order belongs to a larger group called lepidosaurs, a category that also includes a sister lineage called the rhynchocephalians \u2014 represented today only by the humble tuatara, a small reptile in New Zealand.The two groups diverged from a common ancestor in the distant past, but when and how that happened has been a mystery. Genetic data had long suggested that squamates originated somewhere during the Early Triassic Period, 252 to 247 million years ago, said Adam Pritchard, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. At first, Megachirella didn\u2019t appear to offer much insight. The remains were beautifully articulated, but somewhat hard to make out. When scientists formally named it in 2003, they described it as a primitive lepidosaur. Available technology wasn\u2019t sufficient to probe deeper. But in 2014, Dr. Sim\u00f5es \u2014 who specializes in untangling the evolutionary history of living and extinct squamates \u2014 came across a paper on the fossil that caught his interest. Looking at the anatomical figures, he knew right away that he was likely looking at a lizard \u2014 and a very early lizard. He contacted one of the paper\u2019s authors, Massimo Bernardi, a paleontologist at the Museum of Science in Trento, Italy, and suggested that they run the fossil through high-resolution micro CT scanning in order to better see the compressed bones. Dr. Bernardi, who had been thinking along similar lines, agreed.Under the high-tech gaze of the scanners, the scientists were able to digitally reconstruct the small crushed bones, picking out fine details of anatomy invisible to the naked eye. They found that portions of the animal\u2019s braincase more closely resembled that of a modern iguana than those of other Triassic reptiles; so did the arrangement of teeth and the lack of perforations in the lower part of Megachirella\u2019s vertebrae. Even more intriguing were the animal\u2019s wrist bones, shoulders and arms, more characteristic of those seen in living lizards. But Megachirella had some vestigial bits of anatomy that are absent in modern lizards and snakes: gastralia, belly-ribs still found in tuataras and crocodiles, and a small cheek bone called the quadratojugal. Both Megachirella\u2019s appearance in the middle Triassic and the later remains of rhynchocephalian fossils make a strong case that the earliest squamates emerged toward the end of the Permian, a period 270 million years ago that was abruptly shattered by one of the worst known mass extinctions. At the dawn of the following Triassic Period, over 90 percent of life on the planet had been wiped out.The surviving animal groups rapidly diversified throughout the emptied world, said Michelle Stocker, a paleobiologist at Virginia Tech. The trees filled with chameleon-like drepanosaurs and eventually with the first pterosaurs; the oceans soon gave rise to the first marine reptiles; archosaurs morphed into bipedal crocodiles and skulking dinosaurs. Lepidosaurs scurried along in the shadows, undergoing their own explosion in diversity. And while rhynchocephalians fared well for tens of millions of years, Dr. Pritchard said, it now seems that squamates gained on them, becoming even more common and diverse. Somewhere in the Jurassic, 75 million years after Megachirella, the first recognizable lizards emerged, still bearing some of the anatomical markers of their distant ancestor. \u201cThe Permian extinction opened the way for the origin of these lineages, and opened up opportunities for colonizing land and sea,\u201d Dr. Sim\u00f5es said. \u201cA lot of the modern fauna in the world today \u2014 in terms of reptiles especially \u2014 originated at some point in the Triassic,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first mammals are from the Triassic, the first dinosaurs are from the Triassic, and now we know the first lizards are from the Triassic, too.\u201dMegachirella\u2019s mixture of archaic and modern anatomy is also a clue to which of today\u2019s lizard families were the first to emerge, Dr. Sim\u00f5es said. This is a contentious topic. Since 2014, DNA-based family trees have suggested that geckos, of all things, were the earliest group of modern lizards to evolve. But scientists who looked primarily at fossils championed the large and diverse iguanian family \u2014 a group that includes chameleons, iguanas and agamas \u2014 as the earliest modern lizards. Dr. Sim\u00f5es incorporated data from Megachirella\u2019s anatomy into a larger data set he had assembled by studying squamate species from 50 museum collections in 17 countries. The resulting tree suggested that geckoes were indeed the first of the surviving lizard families to emerge, in the Jurassic period (though there\u2019s no evidence they acquired their distinctive toe-pads until the Cretaceous period). Iguanian fossils show up in the Cretaceous, and the genetic data groups them closely with monitor lizards and snakes, Dr. Sim\u00f5es said. By the end of the Cretaceous, the rhynchocephalians had all but vanished, leaving only the tuatara. But the squamates continued to diversify into their present array of forms. \u201cThe amazing thing is that those few surviving lineages became very diverse,\u201d Dr. Sim\u00f5es said. \u201cImagine how diverse the world must have been in the Mesozoic, with all the uncut branches of the reptile family tree still around.\u201d \u201cEven the information we can get out of a fossil today, it might pale in comparison to what technology might let us understand about that extinct animal in the future,\u201d Dr. Stocker said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that we take care of these fossils now for future researchers.\u201d\u201cIf we keep looking in this period, we\u2019re going find amazing things that we never dreamed of, or things that we never thought lizards could do.\u201d Advertisement"}

I\u2019d thought she\u2019d only been injured. I remember thinking that very clearly; she has only been injured, don\u2019t worry about her.My friend Cameron Kasky called after I gave my speech and asked if I wanted to join the movement. He was getting a group of students together to organize what we ended up calling the March for Our Lives \u2014 a march on Washington to call for better gun laws.We worked out of Cameron\u2019s house in the early days. A lot of my friends outside the movement were having trouble sleeping. Even those who weren\u2019t on campus the day of the shooting had nightmares. But for those of us in the movement, there wasn\u2019t time to sleep. You can see very clearly in those early interviews that all of us had deep dark circles under our eyes. No one had an appetite. No one wanted to leave Cameron\u2019s house, not even to take a shower. None of us wanted to stop working. To stop working was to start thinking. And thinking about anything other than the march and the solutions to gun violence was to have a breakdown.One day all of us seemed to have a breakdown around 4 p.m. Cameron ran off, and I ran after him, because I was worried. Once I saw that he was O.K., I realized that I was having a breakdown, too. I wanted to go back to when blood hadn\u2019t stained the walls of our campus. Back to when I would hang out with Carmen on the bus. Back to before people would stop me to say, \u201cAren\u2019t you one of those kids from Parkland?\u201d But we couldn\u2019t go back. All of us know what it feels like to be Harry Potter now. Even when people come up to us quietly to say thank you, you never know if they\u2019re just trying to shoot you at close range. In the midst of all this, I try to take good care of myself. I shaved my head a week or two before senior year. People used to ask me why, and the main reason is that having hair felt terrible. It was heavy, it made me overheated, and every time I put it up in a ponytail (and I looked terrible in a ponytail) it gave me a headache. And, it sounds stupid, but it made me insecure; I was always worried that it looked frizzy or tangled. What\u2019s the best thing to do with an insecurity? Get rid of it. It\u2019s liberating to shave my head every week.You might not be a big fan of politics, but you can still participate. All you need to do is vote for people you believe will work on these issues, and if they don\u2019t work the way they should, then it is your responsibility to call them, organize a town hall and demand that they show up \u2014 hold them accountable. It\u2019s their job to make our world better.It has been months since the shooting. But whenever one of my friends finds an old picture of someone who died that day, or another shooting happens, or I hear helicopters or one too many loud bangs in one day, it all starts to slip. It feels like I\u2019m back at the vigil, in the hot Florida sun, with volunteers handing out water bottles to replenish what the sun and sadness had taken away.

In fact, I left off the second largest correlation, trailing only mean household income.I want to highlight this result because I think that my half of the political spectrum \u2014 the left half \u2014 too often dismisses the importance of family structure. Partly out of a worthy desire to celebrate the heroism of single parents, progressives too often downplay family structure. Social science is usually messy, with correlation and causation difficult to separate. But the evidence, when viewed objectively, points strongly to the value of two-parent households (and, no, the parents don\u2019t need to be heterosexual).What can be done to increase the number of two-parent families? That\u2019s a harder question to answer than whether family structure matters. Some of the usual anti-poverty strategies \u2014 like a higher minimum wage and better education \u2014 would surely help, by creating more decent-paying jobs and improving economic stability. But it\u2019s also worth thinking about what the government and individual communities might do more specifically to encourage and strengthen marriage.I realize that sounds conservative.

They stumble along branches and wobble their small feathered bodies as if they have had one marg too many.Have the drunk birds come early this year?In Gilbert, a city of about 1,800 people in northeastern Minnesota, the police chief sent out a lighthearted notice to residents this week informing them that there was no need to call the police on local birds that appeared to be inebriated.But bird experts are skeptical that this public debauchery was really the product of drunkenness. It is too early in the season for many berries to have fermented, they say, and birds may be slamming into windows at unusual rates because of a large seasonal migration through the area.Laura Erickson, a bird expert who lives in the nearby city of Duluth, Minn., said it was possible that a small number of robins or other species had gotten themselves intoxicated on berries, but those fruits typically require a longer period of cold weather to ferment on a large scale. Robins could also be fleeing \u201chelter skelter\u201d after spotting hawks, which are also in the peak of their migration season, she said.\u201cI think this week everybody is yearning for something that we can all laugh at together,\u201d she said. \u201cDrunken birds sound funny, and they are funny.\u201dChief Techar said in an interview that there were multiple reports of robins and other small birds acting confused, crashing into car windshields and generally \u201cflopping all over the place.\u201d In one case, he said, a bird had flown through a resident\u2019s window and lay dead on the floor.Another behavior of drunken birds \u2014 a condition most commonly seen in robins and other thrushes, as well as cedar waxwings \u2014 is an atypical willingness to stay put when a human approaches, rather than fly away.There\u2019s no definitive proof that the birds are drunk, Chief Techar said, but they sure are acting that way. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to give them a Breathalyzer test,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can tell.\u201dBut Mr. Kaufman, who lives in Ohio, said drunken birds were certainly a real phenomenon. Apart from berry eaters, drunkenness can also befall yellow-bellied sapsuckers that feed on fermented tree sap.Unlike some other observers, Mr. Kaufman finds it more difficult to laugh at the plight of these potentially drunken creatures. He compared this widespread glee to the reaction to YouTube videos of loopy children after oral surgery.\u201cFermentation toxicity,\u201d as the report called it, is most common in late winter and early spring, when thawing berries promote yeast fermentation of the sugars in the fruit.Ms. Erickson, the bird expert from Minnesota, said drunken birds could be taken to wildlife rehabilitation centers, where they would be given food and water to help sober up. A home remedy for a drunken bird that has been stunned, she said, is to place it in a box with holes poked in or a loosely fitting cover (and check on the patient every 10 to 15 minutes until it is ready to fly away).Chief Techar said on Friday that people might have taken his Facebook notice more seriously than he intended.\u201cIt has kind of gotten blown out of proportion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds like every bird in our town is hammered, and that\u2019s not the case.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her new book, \u201cOf Love and War,\u201d was published this month by Penguin Press, and it mostly includes photographs made for The New York Times as well as for Time and National Geographic. She spoke with James Estrin by phone. This conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity._____Q: Where are you?Q: Why another book?But I always knew I would do a photo book. A few years ago, I started compiling very wide edits, pulling together images that had resonated with me over time, and that meant something to me.I ended up with folders full of thousands of images. I talked to Stuart Smith, who is a book designer in London, and I just trusted that we would be able to do this together. I then dumped thousands of images on him and his colleagues at the studio. We just kept editing down over the course of almost a year.Q: Looking at all of these thousands of images, what did you discover? What did you learn?But it\u2019s very hard for me to look at my own work. I immediately go to what I missed and the images I didn\u2019t get. I always wish I was better. I\u2019m tortured by the work that I do. I\u2019m 44 and this is my first photo book after 23 years of shooting.Q: Because it took you so long, it\u2019s really a retrospective as well? Twenty-three years is a long time.Q: How did you decide to organize the book?Q: Giving up control is hard.Q: How many images were unpublished before?It\u2019s around a few dozen at least. But there are also contact sheets, letters and tear sheetsQ: What\u2019s interesting about looking back at your own work is that what you think is a good photograph today can be different than what you might have thought was a good image 15 or 20 years ago.What I tried to do in this book is go back and pull wider edits. And also have an archivist go back and look through the negatives and pull interesting frames. There\u2019s one frame \u2014 a panoramic photo \u2014 of the fall of the Taliban in Kandahar. I remember looking out the car window. I was working alongside Ruth Fremson, and it was all men who looked like Taliban with their guns looking into the car window. I was terrified to get out of the car. I remember Ruth jumped right out and started working, and I just followed her lead. I thought, \u201cO.K., well, if she can do it, I can do it.\u201dBut that was not a frame that I chose. That was a frame that Joanna [Burejza], the archivist, brought to me. It\u2019s one of my favorites. It\u2019s not a beautiful picture, but it\u2019s a raw picture. It\u2019s what it looked like catching them off guard as much as catching me off guard.Q: As you have gotten older, what has changed in your photography?I\u2019m a lot more judicious about when I shoot. I try to look for certain elements that will help tell the story. More details. I try to learn from other photographers and to keep experimenting. Keep pushing the boundaries. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a better photographer, but I feel like I\u2019ve learned the craft a bit more than when I first started.Q: What do you wish you did better or differently?That\u2019s not always a luxury we have as journalists, especially because security is a lot worse for journalists now than it was when I first started. Not having the time to stick around and work scenes as long as I would like to.Q: You\u2019ve been blessed with working regularly on important stories. You\u2019ve been doing important work, but you haven\u2019t dug in on really long-term stories.But one of the reasons I do this specific type of work is because I want to effect change, influence foreign policy and show what\u2019s going on in the world. Those things are time-sensitive. For me it\u2019s really important to get there, get the work and get it published. Get it seen and get people talking. That means working quickly and moving on to the next story.Q: What\u2019s different about being a photographer today than in 2000?I think that requires journalists to do their homework. They have to understand the situation on the ground. They have to make sure that they have a very trustworthy team.Q: What about being a woman photographer? Is there any difference from 2000 to today?There are a lot of female photographers working domestically in the U.S. but not necessarily ones that are willing to work in war zones or go into the situations where I\u2019m working. I\u2019m always very happy to see another female photographer when I\u2019m out in the field.I\u2019ve always said I think it\u2019s a big asset to be a woman in this field, given the countries that I work in. I have access to men and women.Q: There\u2019s a half of the world that men can\u2019t really photograph in some countries.Q: Plus they can\u2019t talk about being a mother, which you can.Q: That\u2019s no small deal.You kind of enter into this secret club of other people like you. You become more sensitive and you become more patient. And I have to be very efficient when I work, and I have to be very selective about the stories I decide to do.Q: How old is your boy now?Q: Fifteen or 20 years ago, we didn\u2019t talk about this concept of being an outsider or insider when you\u2019re photographing. What are your thoughts on the outsider-insider question?Q: I mean that there\u2019s a critique that our coverage of news was totally Western-centric and at times colonialist. It\u2019s only when it started getting too dangerous that we started employing more local people.The reality is all of these stories need to be told, and if it\u2019s told by an outsider or an insider, the important thing is that the stories are getting told. I think in an ideal world, you\u2019d have more insiders and some outsiders. But sometimes that\u2019s just not possible. When people start critiquing how stories are told, it\u2019s often people who have not been outside the comfort of their own country. But it\u2019s good to entertain all criticism because it\u2019s very important to talk about these things.Q: Why do you photograph?Q: So you have an autobiography, you have a film coming out sometime in the future and you\u2019ve been interviewed a whole lot. Tell me something I don\u2019t know about you.Advertisement"}

In the 1960s, when I was barely out of my teens, that happened to me with Paul Goodman\u2019s \u201cGrowing up Absurd.\u201d Not blind to slavery, nor to the fact that Washington owned human beings, Goodman nevertheless wrote words about our first president\u2019s letter that have stayed with me for decades. \u201cIt is hard to read these sentences without agitation and tears,\u201d wrote Goodman, a self-described anarchist, \u201cfor they are simply true and simply patriotic.\u201dThe final word, so unexpected, implicitly reclaimed from scoundrel politicians like Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, moved my callow soul. Patriotism didn\u2019t belong to such forces. It deserved to be embraced and protected.A few days ago I found a way \u2014 much needed \u2014 to refresh my patriotism. Almost by chance, I read again about a hero whose story had not come to mind for years.On a long car ride, in the passenger\u2019s seat, I had been talking with the driver about the current doings of Congress. I entertained her by reading aloud from my phone about Congressman Rodino. What I read \u2014 and remembered \u2014 moved me to some degree of \u201cagitation and tears.\u201dThe next bit, as our car passed through the New England countryside, moved me as an English major, a native of New Jersey and the grandson of immigrants. Childhood diphtheria left Rodino with a pronounced speech defect that he worked to correct by, in his quoted words, \u201creciting Shakespeare through a mouth full of marbles.\u201dMythology does build around politicians. \u201cBorn in a log cabin\u201d used to be the label for that. When I told a friend that Nixon financed his first campaign with poker winnings, accumulated on the Navy ship that brought him home from World War II, keeping the cash hidden in his footlocker, my friend wisely said: \u201cThat footlocker is Nixon\u2019s log cabin.\u201dBut even if those therapeutic Shakespeare recitations, the marbles, the \u201cmenial jobs\u201d are 37 percent fabricated, it is a fabrication I revere: far more heroic, to me, than any number of log cabins or foot lockers.And the next information is not myth, but fact: During World War II, Rodino was an appeals agent for the Newark Draft Board. That position exempted him from the draft, but in 1941 he enlisted in the Army and was stationed in North Africa, and later in Italy. At this point, my feelings for what I was reading merged with my memory of those long-ago televised Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment. As chairman, Rodino seemed \u201cunlikely\u201d \u2014 a frequently applied adjective that may have implied something about the name ending in a vowel and the New Jersey accent.On July 24, 1974, the opening day of the committee debate on the articles of impeachment, amid the subpoena process for the Watergate tapes, Rodino said, with the eloquence of plain speech: \u201cWe have deliberated. We have been patient. We have been fair. Now the American people, the House of Representatives and the Constitution and the whole history of our republic demand that we make up our minds.\u201d Six of the committee\u2019s Republicans eventually joined the Democratic majority in passing three of the five articles of impeachment. After the vote, Rodino later said, he phoned his wife and wept, for our country.I concluded my reading aloud in the car with words attributed to John Doar, the special counsel to the Judiciary Committee. He said that as chairman, Mr. Rodino \u201cimposed discipline,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no partisanship on the staff. In fact, it was remarkably nonpartisan. And that is the result of good leadership.\u201d\u201cLeadership\u201d is a term I mistrust. Like \u201ccreativity\u201d it sometimes varnishes over the absence of what it means. But I feel glad to invoke it as helping me restore my grasp \u2014 in what can feel like an Age of Unreason \u2014 of the word \u201cpatriotism.\u201dRobert Pinsky, a professor of creative writing at Boston University, was the United States poet laureate from 1997 to 2000.Advertisement"}

Yet there was little national attention in 2013 when the ID law was first introduced, in 2015 when it was made more restrictive by also banning college ID\u2019s, in 2016 when it was ruled unconstitutional or in 2017 when it was reintroduced and again ruled unconstitutional by a district court. It is a travesty of democracy, but for indigenous people in America, it is nothing new. We were not granted full citizenship until 1924, and in 1938, seven states still refused Native Americans the right to vote. Utah holds the honor of being the last state to enfranchise Native Americans, in 1957. If Democrats do manage to retake control of the House or the Senate, they should stand up for indigenous communities outside of election cycles. The Trump administration has seized land from the Mashpee Wampanoag in Massachusetts. Congress should establish pathways to have those lands returned. When Native Americans cast their ballots in the United States, they do so with the knowledge that this nation\u2019s democracy and its electoral system are made possible by genocide and land theft. Many of us nevertheless choose to vote, but it is grotesque that we must now also fight to reform that system to have the chance to fully participate in it.Democrats have had many opportunities to be true allies to indigenous people. Instead, they have saved their anger for when it suited their needs.Tristan Ahtone is associate editor for tribal affairs at High Country News and president of the Native American Journalists Association.Advertisement"}

We share joint custody of our two children. The problem: Whenever we\u2019re together, usually at events where the kids are also present (like parent-teacher meetings or visiting day at camp), he won\u2019t speak to me or even make eye contact with me. He will only communicate with me by text. It\u2019s embarrassing for me to have him act this way in front of others. I\u2019m also worried that his behavior creates stress for our children, who are already stressed about the divorce. Any advice?ANONYMOUSIt sounds as if your estranged husband is still (pick one!) too angry, hurt or guilty about your breakup to see beyond himself. This happens sometimes. I\u2019m sorry for your embarrassment and the occasional awkwardness for camp counselors and schoolteachers. But mostly I am worried about your children.Right now, they are learning a terrible lesson in abandonment in the wake of broken relationships. My concern is that they will come to emulate your ex\u2019s silent treatment or fear it mightily in their own relationships. Unfortunately, your husband probably isn\u2019t open to hearing constructive criticism from you now, and text messages are too blunt for conveying it, anyway.Ask him to join you at a counseling session that\u2019s focused on co-parenting. If he refuses, ask your lawyer to request a court-ordered session. If you get into a room with him and a therapist, don\u2019t say one word about your feelings. Who did what to whom is irrelevant now; your children are the sole basis of your relationship.Stay laser focused on negotiating more positive experiences for them. This requires that you and your husband be respectful to each other when you are together and avoid knocking the other when you are apart. It may be hard to pull this off, but it\u2019s essential for your kids\u2019 well-being.A friend was having some repairs done on his bike and asked if he could borrow my father\u2019s spare bike. My father agreed. Unfortunately, the bike was stolen while it was locked to a bike rack at my friend\u2019s place. My father is upset and wants a replacement bike. But my friend thinks he\u2019s only responsible for paying the value of the stolen bike. Should I cover the gap?F.Sometimes intermediaries can be helpful. (I\u2019m thinking of a dashing advice columnist!) But often we just get in the way. Step back from this conflict with your wallet in tow, and encourage the principals to work it out directly. Running interference often lets people take harder positions than they normally would.As guidance: Your father is entitled to a used bike comparable to the one that was stolen. I have no idea how thriving the secondhand market is in your area. If your father and friend can find one on the internet (eBay and Craigslist are full of listings) or at a bike shop, your friend should pay for it. If not, he should pay the reasonable value of the stolen bike. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but we assume risk when we borrow and also when we lend.I work for a great company that goes out of its way for its employees\u2019 comfort. Lately, I\u2019ve noticed a young Muslim woman praying in an area of the ladies restroom that\u2019s a little separate, but still part of the restroom. I know the company would find her a more suitable place if she asked for one. Am I O.K. saying something to her about this, or should I assume that she\u2019s a grown woman who can look out for herself?ERINPut me down as \u201cyes\u201d to both parts of your question. You should assume (and behave) as if the young woman can see to her own needs. You should also feel free to say a kind word to her, ask if she is comfortable praying in the restroom and venture your opinion that the company would find her a nicer spot if she asked. My only \u201cno\u201d here involves your speaking to anyone else in the company about this. That is the young woman\u2019s call.I received a save the date email to my friend\u2019s 40th birthday party from the party\u2019s host. A few weeks later, another friend, who received the same save the date email, received an actual invitation, also by email. But I never received the invitation. Should I ask the host if I\u2019m still invited, simply show up, or does this mean I\u2019ve been uninvited?ANONYMOUSIt\u2019s not easy to give a party without a glitch or two. But it would be extremely bad form to exclude you from the guest list after asking you to save the date. So, unless you\u2019ve recently become a Real Housewife, or you\u2019re embroiled in a blood feud with the host or honoree, assume that you\u2019re still invited. In the interest of accurate head count, call or write the host: \u201cI received your \u2018save the date\u2019 email but never received an invitation. I look forward to attending.

The American economy and financial markets are the largest in the world, and there are no good alternatives.In the long run, however, the rest of the world might get its wish. The dollar\u2019s status as the dominant global reserve currency is the result of faith in America\u2019s strong institutions. This includes the checks and balances among different arms of government, the rule of law and an independent central bank. These institutions have proved durable and earned the trust of global investors, who see the dollar as a safe haven in troubled times. But President Trump and his acolytes are undermining those very institutions with their words and actions.Other countries have long chafed at the dollar\u2019s dominance in global finance. Nearly two-thirds of the foreign exchange reserves held by the world\u2019s central banks\u2019, essentially their rainy-day funds, are held in dollars. It is the currency used to denominate and settle a significant part of international financial transactions. Almost all commodity contracts, including those for oil, are priced and settled in dollars.This gives the United States a lot of power. Since dollar transactions usually involve the American banking system, the United States government can put a chokehold on countries like Iran and Russia by limiting their access to global finance.In the past, none of this would have made a dent in the dollar\u2019s dominance. No other country has the unmatchable combination of size, trust and influence enjoyed by the United States. The global ripple effects of last week\u2019s stock market fluctuations were a clear illustration.But the Trump administration, and its allies in Congress, are wreaking havoc on the institutions that have made the dollar dominant for so long.The rule of law is being eviscerated by an administration that is openly venal and sees itself as above the law. And stacking the courts with judges who are chosen for their willingness to advance a particular agenda is eroding confidence in the judicial system.The dollar\u2019s dominance may outlast the Trump era, but it is not inevitable. If the president continues to hack away at America\u2019s institutions, the dollar, too, will suffer.

{"Headline": "With Bugs, You\u2019re Never Home Alone", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA citizen-science project aims to catalog the spiders, insects and other many-legged creatures that live indoors with us.\u201cStart with your windowsills,\u201d advises Rob Dunn. \u201cLight fittings are often a graveyard, too.\u201d In the world\u2019s densest cities, the indoor biome is bigger than the outdoor space, at least in terms of floor area. (Indoor Manhattan, Dr. Dunn calculates, now exceeds outdoor Manhattan by a factor of three to one.) Yet scientists know almost nothing about the spiders and flies and booklice that inhabit this space alongside us. Even Dr. Dunn was, until recently, guilty of ignoring his six-legged housemates. A few years ago, he and his colleagues decided to take a census of fifty homes in Raleigh, N.C., including his own. \u201cI would have told you I had four species of spiders,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhen we looked, we found ten in my house \u2014 and that turns out to be the average.\u201d Indeed, some houses in Raleigh had more than two hundred arthropod species in total; Dr. Dunn and his team have found a similar multiplicity of bugs living in homes as far afield as Sweden and Peru.At the same time, the extent of this ignorance was overwhelming. It took the team hours to survey a single home, and even longer to identify each specimen. At that pace, Dr. Dunn would never have enough data to understand even the basic patterns of indoor insect life, or how they differed throughout the United States, let alone the world. iNaturalist \u2014 a citizen-science app with users across the globe, and the ability to geolocate and even identify specimens from photos using A.I. \u2014 offered a way through this bottleneck.In July, Dr. Dunn created a page for the project, and began asking the platform\u2019s most active users to contribute. By mid-October, the project page had received more than 3,000 submissions, representing more than 800 species, from more than 1,000 participants around the world. Already there are surprises. Take booklice: tiny light-brown bugs with fat abdomens and bulging eyes, they are neither lice nor restricted to books. They feed on starch, including the starch in bookbinding glue, but typically prefer the higher humidity of a kitchen or bathroom. \u201cIf you were to ask any of us about booklice before this project, we would have said, sure, we\u2019ll probably find some,\u201d said Dr. Dunn. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve found them in one hundred percent of houses.\u201dGood news: You\u2019re never home alone. Meet your microscopic roommates and hairy houseguests up close and personal in bug-tastic augmented reality.\u201cPeople who live in tropical Asia clearly know this is in their houses, but it wasn\u2019t known by scientists more generally,\u201d Dr. Dunn said. One of the first things Dr. Dunn wants to do once he reaches 10,000 sightings is analyze how all these species are distributed globally. In Raleigh, the houses he surveyed were populated with bugs that originated in the Fertile Crescent and came to the Americas with European colonists. By that logic, Dr. Dunn would expect many of the indoor insects in New Zealand to be British. But that assumption may be wrong. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole bunch of Kiwis that have been super keen on this project,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it turns out that there are all these endemic New Zealand indoor species, like the Wellington house spider, that I\u2019ve never heard of.\u201dOther patterns are emerging, logical but intriguing nonetheless. Households with pets harbor more insect diversity; so do homes where the windows are open more often. Different bugs favor different rooms \u2014 a preference that, in some cases, seems to have been fixed for millenniums: beetle and fly remains have been used to differentiate between bathrooms and kitchens in archaeological sites from ancient Egypt to England. It\u2019s entirely possible that certain architectural styles or floor plans favor particular insect communities, but researchers know too little to even formulate those kinds of hypotheses.In a survey, scientists found many travelers could not distinguish bedbugs from other pests, which could have implications for hotels and the travel industry.For a bug-loving scientist who wants to understand the forces shaping life\u2019s diversity in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing ecosystems, the thrill of the Never Home Alone project is obvious. But for home dwellers who are more inclined to swat a fly than admire its iridescent coloring, what\u2019s the upside? Dr. Dunn bristled at the question, before gamely pointing out that many of these species are, or could be, extremely useful. \u201cIn tropical Asia, there\u2019s a jumping spider that\u2019s common in houses, and it preferentially feeds on dengue-infected mosquitoes,\u201d he said. Spiders, on the whole, are beneficial: they feed on less pleasant insects such as roaches, earwigs, flies and clothes moths, and they rarely bite. \u201cIn my lab, we all love spiders, but, in general, I would say our attitude about these species in our houses is misdirected,\u201d said Dr. Dunn.Effecting this attitude adjustment is perhaps the most ambitious goal of the Never Home Alone project. \u201cAlready, we\u2019ve made connections with people we could never have reached before,\u201d Dr. Dunn said. He reached out to Zain Al-najm, an art student and iNaturalist contributor in Basra, Iraq, who uploaded a photo of a long-legged, thin-bodied Enicospilus wasp, its exact species unknown \u2014 the only observation on the website from this family of bugs in the entire Middle East. \u201cThat was my most interesting insect,\u201d Mr. Al-najm said in an email. \u201cBut where we live are a lot of creatures that we do not care about but are really amazing.\u201d\u201cIf you find a fly in your house, it could be a house fly,\u201d Mr. Dankowicz said. \u201cBut just as often it\u2019s, like, a flesh fly, a bottle fly or a cluster fly, and those are really great and interesting species that you should know about.\u201dDr. Dunn accepts that most of us will never embrace the insects in our homes with great enthusiasm; he is striving merely for tolerance and, if possible, a little wonder. \u201cSome of these species are super cool,\u201d he said, describing a spider that kills its prey by spitting on it. (The spit is ejected from repurposed silk glands at speeds of nearly 100 feet per second). But even without our good will, our insect housemates will be there; our homes, with their mild and constant climate, not to mention huge quantities of food and water, present a welcoming environment for life at all scales. \u201cThe best we can do is hope to sway that population to species that benefit us, rather than do us harm,\u201d said Dr. Dunn. \u201cBut first we have to understand who\u2019s there.\u201d So, this Halloween, peek into those dark corners; look behind your toilet and under your bed. Resist the reflex to squash \u2014 or blowtorch \u2014 whatever you see, and take a photo instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Elephants Don\u2019t Shed Their Skin", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe cracks in African elephants\u2019 skin help them keep cool and stay healthy. A new explanation for how those cracks form could offer insights into treating a human skin disease.The African elephant is known for its thick, wrinkly skin. But look closer and you\u2019ll see an intricate network of tiny crevices that makes the mighty mammal\u2019s hide resemble cracked mud or damaged asphalt.The purpose of those cracks is no mystery. An elephant doesn\u2019t have sweat or sebum glands, so it covers its skin in water or mud to keep cool. The micrometer-wide cracks in its skin retain 10 times more moisture than a flat surface, helping the animal regulate its body temperature. They also help mud adhere to the skin, which protects against parasites and rays from the sun.That hunch received a boost when Dr. Milinkovitch\u2019s team examined elephant skin samples under a microscope. They found that just beneath the thick top layer was a lower layer of papillae, the same kind of small protuberances found on the human tongue. These projections form a vast canvas of spiky peaks and valleys. That seemed to support their assumption about how the cracks were formed.\u201cWe thought, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a simple story,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018If we shrink something that is attached to a geometry like this, the cracks will appear in the valleys that are underneath.\u201dBut when they ran computer simulations of growing elephant skin, they found that the skin didn\u2019t crack as they anticipated. Shrinking alone would not account for an elephant\u2019s skin patterns.Instead, the simulations suggested the skin was breaking because of the stress of bending. Evidently, the skin was thickening as the elephants aged, growing to the point that it eventually collapsed under its own weight. But why was still unclear.Further study of the skin tissue revealed that dead elephant skin cells resemble those of humans suffering from ichthyosis vulgaris, a disease found in one out of every 250 people that prevents the shedding of skin. In humans, the condition, for which there is no cure, causes thick, dry scales on the surface of the skin that are usually treated with moisturizers.But in African elephants, holding onto all that dead skin appears to be beneficial: The lack of shedding causes the skin to build up as the elephant ages, eventually bending and breaking over the layer of papillae, which provides the animal the means to stay cool.\u201cIf the skin was shedding, it would never get thick enough to generate the stress inside the little valleys of this lattice of elevations, and you would not have the cracks appearing,\u201d said Dr. Milinkovitch. \u201cIn humans, this is not a helpful problem.\u201dMore research is needed to determine whether the lack of skin shedding in elephants shares a genetic basis with ichthyosis vulgaris in humans. But the confluence of the conditions could suggest a path forward for treating the ailment.Advertisement"}

Each day, rescue workers pull out bodies. He takes a hard look at each \u2014 there have been hundreds by now \u2014 half hoping he\u2019ll recognize his 7-year-old boy and 35-year-old wife. So far, nothing.\u201cI have to believe he got out,\u201d Mr. Firmansyah said of his son, standing at the edge of a destroyed minaret in the demolished neighborhood of Balaroa. \u201cHe loved the mosque, so I know he\u2019d come here to meet me.\u201dBut time is running out. Friday marked the final official day of large-scale operations after the Indonesian government announced that it would end the formal search for remains. Weeks in the tropical heat have turned the concerns from digging out bodies to the health of the rescue workers.Many rescue workers and heavy equipment will remain for the next month, but the government is already drafting new construction plans.\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d said Haris Karimin, spokesman for the Central Sulawesi government. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep digging just because some people are mad.\u201dMore than 2,000 people have been declared dead, and government officials have said that as many as 5,000 are still missing.For Mr. Firmansyah and many Palu residents like him, the digging is all that is left.\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have to dig with my own hands I would. I\u2019m not ready to stop.\u201dOne woman, Riana Asnuwari, began pleading with recovery workers after they unearthed her mother\u2019s head scarf and motorbike from the wreckage earlier this week. \u201cAll I want is the body!\u201d she told them, distraught.The Balaroa neighborhood of Palu was among the hardest hit by liquefaction in the earthquake on Sept. 28. Extracting the bodies has been a monumental task for the authorities here.This week, excavators would dig for hours, sometimes as deep as 40 feet into the mud, to pull out whatever they could. Mostly it was car parts, torn mattresses, muddied household items \u2014 bits of everyday life. But inevitably there would be remains. Sometimes one excavator scoop would pull up five corpses huddled together. Other times, it might be just a finger.The Palu police hospital was the collection point for hundreds of bodies pulled from the debris. Families and body identification teams would methodically unzip each bag, searching for familiar clothes, tattoos or marks. The bodies are bloated and stiff from rigor mortis. On Friday, that part of the search ended, too: Any bodies found after that were bound for the mass grave perched on a hillside on the outskirts of town.What happens next around Palu is still unclear. Over 80,000 people had their homes destroyed. Most live in camps of makeshift plastic tents next to mosques, churches and government buildings. Officials in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, have talked about different options for redrawing the maps to build new homes. But where the money will come from, no one yet knows.For Mr. Firmansyah, moving on is not yet an option.He and his oldest son, Fauzhi, are two of the more than 80,000 of the displaced. They have moved in with Mr. Firmansyah\u2019s brother in law. But many are stuck in makeshift tent camps.For him, the end of the formal search for remains means his chance for answers has closed.\u201cEither they are dead, and that will be O.K., or they are still alive \u2014 and that is better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to wait is the hardest pain.\u201dOn the evening of Sept. 28, Mr. Firmansyah was just finishing a shower in his bathroom. His wife was checking Facebook in the room beside him, and Fauzhi had run into the yard. Then the earth rattled. He rushed naked into his back yard, knowing from years of experience with earthquakes to get into open space. His wife ran out of the other side of the house. He waited in the yard for the shaking to stop.It did. Thinking the worst was over, he walked back inside to put on a towel. Before he could go to meet his wife, he heard the harsh creaking of metal and bending of wood.\u201cIt sounded like the house was being pulled apart,\u201d he said.The floor tore out beneath him, and a wave of mud pushed him up into the ceiling. Shoved up into the tin roof, his leg was caught and crushed in the broken wood. Panicked, he shouldered his way through, he recalled.With a few heaves, he was outside and free \u2014 and looking at his entire neighborhood sliding around him.\u201cThe mosque looked as if it were floating toward me. I could never have dreamed to see it,\u201d he said.He hadn\u2019t gone up, the house had sunk down. It was completely swallowed up. He called out for his family. Only Fauzhi responded.Since then, Mr. Firmansyah has tried to hold onto the hope that Fajar somehow made it outside. For his wife, he is less optimistic.\u201cIf God could give me just one,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be enough.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

But which of the hundreds of kinds of wrasses will you see?\u201cIt has taken tens of millions of years to build the biodiversity of coral reefs, but it may take us only decades to destroy it,\u201d said Mary Wisz, a professor at the World Maritime University in Sweden who was not involved in the study.Explorers have long wondered why the Central Indo-Pacific holds such exceptional bounty, said Elizabeth Miller, a Ph.D. candidate studying ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona and the lead author of the paper.\u201cPeople say the Caribbean is a garden, whereas the Central Indo-Pacific is a jungle,\u201d said John Wiens, a professor at the University of Arizona.Overall, the scientists found, biodiversity in a region today is highly related to the age and number of colonizations it has experienced. The Central Indo-Pacific is so diverse largely because many old lineages have settled there.Around 35 million years ago, as the Tethys was closing off, the Australian and Pacific plates were colliding with continental Southeast Asia, creating an expanse of shallow ocean ideal for coral reefs. As species migrated from the Tethys (now the East Atlantic) to this area, the hot spot of marine life shifted.Since then, the Central Indo-Pacific may also have been less strongly influenced by major extinction events than other warm regions, Ms. Miller said.\u201cWhat a rich treasure it is to have this biodiversity,\u201d Dr. Wisz said. \u201cIf we are to safeguard it, we must take action, globally and quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Californian Who Unwittingly Aided Russian Election Interference Gets 6 Months in Prison", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe man, Richard Pinedo, was the third defendant to be sentenced in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia\u2019s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired. He was also ordered to serve six months of home detention after his time in prison.Lawrence Atkinson, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, told the judge that Mr. Pinedo did not substantially advance their inquiry because investigators had already identified his Russian customers by the time they confronted him. Jeremy I. Lessem, Mr. Pinedo\u2019s lawyer, said afterward that he was disappointed that prosecutors made no plea for leniency given Mr. Pinedo\u2019s cooperation.\u201cThis is a difficult pill for him to swallow,\u201d he said. \u201cAny custody at all was more than we were hoping for.\u201dMr. Pinedo\u2019s sentencing before Judge Dabney Friedrich in Federal District Court in Washington came amid signs that Mr. Mueller could be wrapping up some aspects of his investigation, even as prosecutors continue to debrief potentially key witnesses and summon others before the grand jury. The inquiry has been so opaque that it is impossible to assess what stage it has reached over all.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.Two prosecutors who worked on the investigation and prosecution of Paul Manafort are returning to their former divisions at the Justice Department, although at least one will remain engaged in matters under Mr. Mueller\u2019s purview. A third relatively junior prosecutor left in July. Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman who was convicted of multiple counts of fraud in August and then pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, is cooperating with special counsel\u2019s office.Mr. Mueller has referred several investigations and prosecutions to local offices of United States attorneys, either because they were outside his mandate or because the cases could drag on for years. The most recent court filings indicate the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, for instance, is now taking the lead in prosecuting the Russian individuals and companies charged in the scheme in which Mr. Pinedo became ensnared. Mr. Atkinson hinted to Judge Friedrich that the special counsel\u2019s office might have turned over some leads provided by Mr. Pinedo to federal prosecutors with \u201ca wider bandwidth\u201d to investigate them.Though Mr. Pinedo understood he was acting as a middleman for foreigners, Mr. Lessem argued in court papers that \u201cnever in his wildest dreams could he have foreseen that providing bank account information to set up PayPal accounts could be used to interfere with a presidential election.\u201dHe told the judge that because of the investigation\u2019s high profile, his client was a target of threats and harassment, a punishment in itself. Mr. Pinedo said some people have accused him of being a Russian agent while others have delivered veiled threats of retaliation for his testimony against Russian operatives. \u201cJust leaving my home to run errands is extremely stressful,\u201d he told the judge.Judge Friedrich said that while Mr. Pinedo deserved credit for his cooperation and sympathy for the harassment he and his family had endured, he had engaged in identify fraud on a large scale for a period of three years. \u201cYou committed a serious crime,\u201d she said, \u201cwith real consequences.\u201dAccording to court papers, Mr. Pinedo earned $40,000 to $95,000 enabling the Russians and others to bypass safeguards and gain access to online financial networks.He opened some bank accounts in his own name and worked with third parties to come up with other account numbers, then sold that information to his customers. When PayPal posted trial deposits into those accounts as a security measure, he emailed that information to his customers so their accounts could be verified.But Mr. Manafort faces a lengthy prison term and is forfeiting almost all of his wealth. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign\u2019s deputy chairman who pleaded guilty to two felony charges this year, is also awaiting a sentencing date.Advertisement"}

What will it take to regain civil discourse that serves common interests? Can anything be done to reduce the acrimony in American society?Mr. Fairman has had success working on many issues, including human rights, climate change, economic development, education and criminal justice policy. He has the rare talent of envisioning pathways forward through what appear to be intractable conflicts. I asked him to reflect on the divide in America today.But it\u2019s not only the electoral machinery. Since the Republicans won back the House of Representatives in 1994, it\u2019s been a much fiercer competition between the two parties than at most times since the Civil War. When you see yourself as the minority party for the long term, you have incentives to cooperate with the majority party to move some parts of your agenda. But when you think that you might win back control soon, there\u2019s a strong incentive to just hold out and fight. On the other hand, when you gain control, you know it might not last, so you want to maximize your wins and use whatever tactics you can to overcome opposition. We\u2019ve seen both parties doing this since the 1990s. And when you play win-lose politics fiercely for more than 20 years, voters adopt that mind-set too \u2014 or they become so frustrated that they tune out.There are also deep societal issues at play: demographic shifts, an economy that is changing fast and causing a lot of anxiety, and the culture wars. But we don\u2019t have to have strong partisan divisions on all those issues, and there have been times in our recent history when we haven\u2019t been so divided.Without that experience of being heard, people will keep on turning the conversation back to how we got here and who\u2019s at fault, and it\u2019s very hard to move forward.They could feed back the main points of their conversations to the state level, where they\u2019d be reviewed by party leaders, who would also be in regular, private conversation with each other. After six months, or longer if it seemed useful, there could be some public reflection and discussion.I\u2019m confident that a process like that with some design and facilitation from people who are independent could bring the partisan heat down, build relationships and make it harder to demonize each other, even if it didn\u2019t lead to agreement on the issues. Party machinery matters. It works. It\u2019s not hard for them to deliver activists to a room if they decide they really want to do this.Some organizations and projects that focus on supporting civil dialogue:Some organizations focused on conflict resolution and consensus building:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiny Nanoparticles to Treat a Huge Problem: Snakebites", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthSnakes kill or cripple 500,000 people a year, but antivenins are costly and rare in poor countries. Now scientists are testing injectable nanoparticles that neutralize venom.It\u2019s still a distant dream, but a Californian chemist and Costa Rican venom expert are reporting progress in a novel effort to make injectable nanoparticles that can neutralize snake venom and can be carried in backpacks.In wealthy countries, snakes are an abiding threat to an unlucky few, among them hikers, ranch hands, soldiers, zookeepers and reptile collectors.In the tropics of Africa, Asia and Latin America, however, they are a major cause of death and disability in rural areas: more than 2 million people are bitten each year. About 100,000 of them die, and another 400,000 are left with serious disabilities, including amputations or nerve damage so extensive that a leg or hand is permanently useless.Antivenins have existed for decades, of course, but they are expensive, potentially dangerous and used only rarely in poor countries. The medicines contain antibodies harvested from the blood of sheep or horses that have been injected with diluted venom and allowed to recover. Because they contain horse or sheep proteins, antivenins also can trigger life-threatening anaphylactic shock or hemorrhaging. They must be given intravenously in an emergency room, and many bite victims die before they can reach hospitals.\u201cThey have a lot of issues, but they\u2019re the only show in town,\u201d said Kenneth J. Shea, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine.Dr. Shea\u2019s lab is creating hydrogel nanoparticles coated with polymers \u2014 the building blocks of plastics \u2014 small enough to attach to proteins.While screening them against common venoms, he isolated some nanoparticles that bind with and neutralize two poisons produced by snakes like cobras, kraits, coral snakes, sea snakes and mambas.Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez, a venom specialist at the University of Costa Rica, injected dozens of mice with the venom of the black-necked spitting cobra. He found that Dr. Shea\u2019s nanoparticles significantly reduced tissue damage in the mice. Importantly, the nanoparticles did not appear to interfere with normal proteins or to trigger dangerous allergic reactions.Much more research needs to be done, Dr. Shea said, but the goal is to create a cocktail of particles that could be loaded in an injector like an Epi-Pen. It would not completely replace antivenins. But since the nanoparticles are relatively easy to make and need no refrigeration, they could be carried in the field and injected into the site of a bite, reducing tissue damage and stopping the poison from spreading. That would buy time to reach better treatment.Asked about the source of his funding, Dr. Shea said, \u201cWell, right now I don\u2019t have any money for this.\u201dThe military expressed initial interest, he said, and so has the veterinary industry. But he also hopes to attract the attention of groups that fund global health research, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Wellcome Trust.The path to regulatory acceptance may be a long one. Use of nanoparticles in medicine is relatively new, and for clinical trials involving snakebites, \u201cthere aren\u2019t many volunteers,\u201d Dr. Shea said. Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve tested enough recipes in my day to know whether a stew could survive without that \u00bc teaspoon of ground cumin or if a sheet-pan dinner really needs the four additional vegetables it calls for.I think we as home cooks get so fatigued with basic ingredients and preparations that we grasp at straws, adding a handful of this or a spoonful of that to whatever we\u2019re cooking just to compensate for our own boredom. But for me, less has always been more.You don\u2019t need every vegetable from the market sprinkled with the contents of your pantry to make something excellent. Choose two or three ingredients, then season them interestingly and assertively.Take chicken and potatoes. This isn\u2019t news, but chicken and potatoes are good \u2014 really, really good \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure they need anything else getting in their way.Would this particular chicken, slathered in a simple, garlicky chile butter, be excellent stuffed with loads of herbs and halved lemons?

My chicken and potatoes are all I need.Once your sheet pan is out of the oven, you\u2019ll see your restraint rewarded with a juicy, fiery-orange chicken, and tangy potatoes that are equal parts crisp and tender.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\u201cI built what I built myself.\u201dIt\u2019s a classic American tale of ambition and self-determination. Not Horatio Alger, exactly, but appealing, and impressive, nonetheless.Except that, like so much of what Mr. Trump has been selling the American public in recent years, this origin story was a sham \u2014 a version of reality so elaborately embellished that it qualifies as fan fiction more than biography. Also, as we\u2019ve come to expect from Mr. Trump, the creation of this myth involved a big dose of ethically sketchy, possibly even illegal activity.As Donald Trump emerged as the favorite son, Fred made special deals and arrangements to increase Donald\u2019s fortunes in particular. The Times found that, before Donald had turned 30, he had received close to $9 million from his father. Over the longer haul, he received upward of what, in today\u2019s dollars, would be $413 million.Along the way, it seems that certain liberties were taken with tax laws. The Times found that concocting elaborate schemes to avoid paying taxes on their father\u2019s estate, including greatly understating the value of the family business, became an important pastime for Fred\u2019s children, with Donald taking an active role in the effort. According to tax experts, the activities in question show a pattern of deception, a deliberate muddying of the financial waters. Asked for comment on The Times\u2019s findings, a lawyer for the president provided a written statement denying any wrongdoing and asserting that, in fact, Mr. Trump had little to do with the dizzying transactions involving his family\u2019s wealth.Everyone can understand the impulse to polish one\u2019s background in order to make a good impression. For Mr. Trump, whose entire life has been about branding and selling a certain type of gaudy glamour, this image-polishing has been all the more vital to his success. And he has pursued it with a shameless, at times giddy, abandon.This mythos was burnished and expanded by Mr. Trump\u2019s years on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d where he played the role of an all-powerful, all-knowing business god who could make or break the fortunes of those who clamored for his favor. Occasionally he could be harsh or even insulting, but it was always in the context of delivering the tough love that the contestants so needed to hear. And who was more qualified to deliver those lessons than Donald Trump? As with all reality TV, it was total bunk. But it promoted precisely the golden image that Mr. Trump \u2014 with a multimillion-dollar assist from his father \u2014 had carefully cultivated for his entire life.With this glimpse into the inner workings of the Trump family finances, some of the grimier, ethically suspect aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s mythmaking begin to emerge \u2014 and with them, many questions about all that we still do not know about the man and his business empire. Seeing as how that empire and his role in building it are so central to who Mr. Trump claims to be \u2014 the defining feature of his heroic narrative \u2014 the American public has a right to some answers. For starters, now would be an excellent time for Mr. Trump to hand over those tax returns on which he has thus far kept a death grip.But increasingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to bend the truth \u2014 and the rules \u2014 in the service of his myth looks less like innocent exaggeration than malicious deception, with a dollop of corruption tossed in for good measure.

{"Headline": "Scenes Across the Carolinas, Where Florence Is Far From Over", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "Along the coast, entire neighborhoods remain submerged, streets are still impassable and residents and towns are struggling to rebuild.Supported byALONG THE CAROLINAS COAST \u2014 Two weeks after a storm named Florence barreled into dozens of coastal communities \u2014 flooding homes, demolishing buildings, uprooting trees and carving up roads \u2014 its wrath and havoc continue, with entire neighborhoods still submerged and streets entirely impassable.About 80 miles north, in Lumberton, N.C., Patricia Fox, 56, a single mother who lost everything in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, once again tallied all she had lost. While her daughter slept inside their four-door sedan, where they are both sleeping these days, she worked silently and alone. Wearing a mask to cover her nose and mouth, she carried their belongings, now stained with mold, and dropped them onto their lawn. Across the Carolinas, states that have been battered time and again by hurricanes and tropical storms \u2014 where this time at least 45 people died, thousands were displaced, more than 1,000 remain in shelters, and damage is expected to surpass several billion dollars \u2014 Florence remains far from over.The late-summer air across the Carolinas crackled with an electric charge of haste and dread.The sun was still shining on beach bars and crab shacks, but every television was tuned to weather reports about the monster hurricane charging toward them. Its forecast path veered north, then south, as if it could not decide which city to wreck first. The beaches were already deserted, cedar-shake houses locked up and shuttered with plywood over the windows.Millions of people agonized over whether to stay and risk it, or leave and potentially spend weeks as storm refugees. They left work early to fetch their grandparents from tiny, flood-prone towns. They ran into supermarkets and stripped the shelves of bread, milk and batteries. It was as if the entire state of North Carolina was counting down.Then the sky went dark. Trees buckled and the pulsing ocean charged ashore. Some people banded together to mock the arriving storm with defiant hurricane parties. Some danced in the rain. Others, trapped in their cars on flooding roads, stuck in roofless trailer homes, had never been more alone.The wind screamed and waters started to puddle in neighborhoods. Here it came.The water just would not stop.Florence landed on Friday, Sept. 14, as a Category 1 hurricane, and crawled inland as slowly as three miles per hour, dumping an estimated eight trillion gallons of rain on North Carolina. Storm surge pushed rivers into historic downtowns, subdivisions and apartment complexes. People scrambled onto their roofs and into boats and helicopters.On the roads, drivers pulled into empty gas stations just to escape the relentless drum roll on their roofs. At home, they watched the water creep like a burglar up their steps and through their front doors. The state became a constellation of islands, each city cut off from the other by downed power lines, felled trees and drowned roads. Fatigue and desperation burbled up as people searched vainly for food, gasoline and power when nearly every storefront was dark.People like Juleon H. Dove, in New Bern, N.C., who took shelter on the second floor of his family\u2019s mortuary business, listening as the water rushed in below and watching from windows as it slowly engulfed nearby homes. Or Thierry Sullivan, in Chocowinity, N.C., who used his phone to film streets that had become unrecognizable, the \u201cwhole town\u201d under water, he said in one video he posted on Facebook. There were of course cities that dodged the worst, and people there celebrated in the drizzle and toasted the Waffle House and other open restaurants whose windows glowed like beacons.But the names of other cities became synonymous with Florence\u2019s waterlogged destruction: Wilmington; Lumberton; Jacksonville; New Bern. When the rain finally stopped, people crept out of the cocoon of their homes to see the shredded, soaked landscape that was their new reality.Power lines and 30-foot trees covered the roads. Neighbors\u2019 roofs were caved in. Lawns were covered in trash and branches. Convoys of National Guard trucks rumbled through town, and boaters plied the streets. Some people cried as they surveyed the damage. Others numbly sloshed through their homes and started sweeping out water.In Wilmington, N.C., Maikke Brandis, 33, a bar owner who chose to ride out the storm, said so many trees were destroyed that it would take years to rebuild the city\u2019s canopy. About 15 miles north, in Hampstead, N.C., Joey Canady, 54, a Baptist pastor who didn\u2019t evacuate so that he could care for his aging parents, walked somberly but determinedly through the flooded Hampstead Baptist Church, ready to rebuild.Still, as people vowed to bounce back, anxious questions hovered over every choice they made, like a new storm gathering force at sea. Would rebuilding wreck them financially? Was it wise to stay in the same house \u2014 even the same town \u2014 that had now been devastated by two powerful hurricanes in two years? Would governments in the Carolinas confront climate change now, or enact policies to limit development in areas torn apart again and again by floods?Those questions remain \u2014 and will for many more months and years.First, though, without any answers, they grabbed brooms and mops, chain saws and crowbars. They had to get to work.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Israel Owes American Jews", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation-state of the Jews must recognize Conservative and Reform Judaism.Mr. Oren is a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and a member of the Knesset.JERUSALEM \u2014 The massacre of 11 worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue has profoundly shocked Israelis. Though seemingly desensitized by years of terror on our buses and streets, much of this voluble country has been left speechless by the news of Jews being gunned down during Shabbat prayers by a ranting anti-Semite.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuben Rivlin fiercely condemned the massacre and expressed full solidarity with our American brothers and sisters. Naftali Bennet, the minister for diaspora affairs, flew immediately to Pennsylvania. And yet, for all these expressions of sympathy, Israel still refuses to recognize the Conservative movement to which all 11 victims belonged. Conservative as well as Reform weddings and conversions performed in Israel are not accepted by the country\u2019s chief rabbinate. The Tree of Life synagogue where the massacre took place was not even a real synagogue according to Israel\u2019s chief rabbis. The victims, murdered solely for being Jewish, practiced a brand of Judaism that, along with all other liberal streams of Judaism, is not deemed sufficiently Jewish for the Jewish state.Such disrespect contrasts starkly with American Jewish contributions to Israel. The record is everywhere: The names of American Jewish philanthropists are emblazoned on our ambulances, university dorms, homes for the elderly and centers for disabled veterans. American Jews have helped forest our hills and raise up our poor, unearth our past and forge our technological future. According to Israeli government statistics, investments and contributions from Jews living overseas \u2014 the bulk of them Americans \u2014 accounted for 6.35 percent of our gross domestic product, the equivalent of Israel\u2019s defense budget.Given all of this, why would Israel refuse to recognize the Conservative and Reform streams, which represent the majority of American Jews?One reason is democracy. Though steadily growing, the Reform and Conservative communities in Israel remain small, while the Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox together account for 20 percent of the electorate and are rapidly expanding. Most of them view the liberal strains of Judaism as a heresy.Such views are not shared by the majority of Israelis, yet Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox parties wield enormous political weight in our parliamentary system. Their support gives Israeli coalitions the stability necessary to grapple with our complex social and security challenges. Confronted with Orthodox opposition to the liberal American Jewish streams, Israeli governments must often choose between acknowledging their legitimacy and effectively managing and defending the state. Accordingly, not only our current government but also every coalition going back to 1948, right and left, has refrained from recognizing the Reform and Conservative movements.More recently, numerous American Jews supported the Iran nuclear deal, which Israelis viewed as disastrous to our security, and opposed moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, celebrated by Israelis as a long-awaited acceptance of our eternal capital. These schisms and more have eroded the willingness of many Israeli legislators to please American Jews at the price of political instability. The June 2017 decision by the Israeli government to withdraw from those parts of the Western Wall agreement that would have guaranteed equal status for all the streams at our holiest site reflected this tension.But such disputes cannot be allowed to fracture the Jewish unity on which Israel is predicated. Beyond the financial, political and even strategic considerations, Israel is morally obligated to preserve Jewish peoplehood. Even before we received the Ten Commandments, as slaves in Egypt, we were a people \u2014 as Moses demanded: \u201cLet my people go.\u201dIsrael was founded as the nation-state of the Jews, irrespective of where they live or how they practice \u2014 or do not practice \u2014 their Judaism. All Jews should regard Israel as their ancestral homeland, the realization of thousands of years of yearning, devotion and dreams, no less if they live on Long Island than in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. And if Israelis expect Reform and Conservative Jews to consider Israel as their spiritual homeland, then the recognition must be reciprocal. It fulfills our raison d\u2019\u00eatre.It is also mandated by law. Last July 19, our Knesset passed the \u201cBasic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People.\u201d Though controversial in Israel and abroad, the nation-state law commits Israel to uphold its role as the national home of all Jews and to strengthen ties with the Jews of the diaspora, especially those threatened because they are Jews. It calls on Israel \u201cto preserve the cultural, historical, and religious heritage of the Jewish people,\u201d including those in America. The nonrecognition of Conservative and Reform Judaism is incompatible with both the intent and the spirit of the law.In the aftermath of this horrific massacre, the Israel government must do more than express condolences. Threatened by rising anti-Semitism, American-Jewish communities need to know that Israel is behind them and not only in words. Now is the time to realize our historic mission, comply with our own law and reinforce the unity that has sustained us for thousands of years, through exiles, expulsions, genocide and rebirth. By recognizing Conservative and Reform Jewry, Israel will not only defy the anti-Semites but also, more important, reaffirm itself.Michael B.

The Ordinary is one of a cluster of brands run by Deciem, which was founded in 2013 by a computer programmer named Brandon Truaxe.Emails obtained by The New York Times sent by Mr. Truaxe before and after the video was posted show that his behavior was similarly disorderly in private. In one email, sent Tuesday afternoon with the subject line \u201cEXECUTIVE ORDER 2.12.10.10.18,\u201d the Deciem founder said: \u201cAll offices, production facilities and stores are shut down as of this moment.\u201dIn the email, he also insulted and threatened his employees and informed someone named \u201cAnand\u201d that \u201cyour employment with DECIEM has been terminated as of this instant.\u201d The company\u2019s chief financial officer is named Anand Khanzode.\u201cIf one more instruction that any of you received from me is not followed with precise attention to time efficiency and to the best of your abilities, I will terminate your employment immediately,\u201d Mr. Truaxe wrote. A person familiar with the email who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company said that the messages were typical of what they described as Mr. Truaxe\u2019s bullying, threatening style. In another email, sent a week before the video was posted, Mr. Truaxe took a more gentle tone, praising two employees for their \u201chumility\u201d and asking them to \u201cdedicate ten days to spending time with me.\u201d He declared that \u201cthe next few days will be more instrumental for DECIEM than DECIEM\u2019s birth in 2012.\u201d Referring to himself occasionally in the third person, he told the Deciem staff that \u201cmy love and respect for you is immense\u201d and asked that they pay close attention to \u201cthe communication that DECIEM will share with our world during the few weeks and months ahead of us.\u201d Stephen Kaplan, formerly Deciem\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company in February. He said in an email Wednesday that he had resigned \u201cbecause Brandon\u2019s demeanor had changed following a December vacation in Mongolia.\u201dMr. Kaplan said that he had \u201cno interest in all the current drama.\u201d\u201cI feel sorry for all the staff that must deal with Brandon on a day-to-day basis,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil he changes his ways, he is destroying what could have been a very successful company.\u201dAn investor in the company indicated that it was also troubled by Mr. Truaxe\u2019s behavior. \u201cThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies is a minority investor in Deciem, and, as such, we do not control the company\u2019s operations, social media or personnel decisions,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the material that has recently been posted on social media and will defend our rights as a minority investor.\u201dMr. Truaxe answered his phone on Wednesday but hung up when a reporter asked permission to record the call; following calls went to voice mail.The Instagram video this week apparently signaling the end of Deciem sent many of the company\u2019s customers into a frenzy as they sought to understand whether their preferred products would remain available. Many of the company\u2019s New York stores were closed on Tuesday afternoon and its website indicated that almost all its stores around the world had been shuttered, including ten locations in Canada and four locations in the U.K. (Only its three stores in Mexico City were not marked as closed.)Though Deciem has had at least a dozen product lines, The Ordinary has been its most popular brand. Whereas many skin care products arrive as premade serums and cocktails, The Ordinary gained devotees by offering simpler solutions, such as its popular line of acids. Customers were encouraged to experiment with ingredients in order to concoct tailored regimens, a practice that has helped drive conversation around the brand on social media.Advertisement"}

Instead, with a cellphone camera recording, the woman was forced to move as the man threatened to push her. The flight soon took off from Barcelona, Spain, without the man apparently facing any consequences.Ryanair\u2019s handling of the episode on Friday is now the focus of intense criticism, with people threatening to boycott the Dublin-based budget airline, and British officials promising to raise the issue in Parliament.Among those endorsing a boycott was David Lammy, a Labour Party lawmaker who, on Twitter, cited Rosa Parks\u2019s famed stand against discrimination on a bus, adding that \u201cwe ain\u2019t going back.\u201dA spokeswoman for Ryanair said the airline had reported the incident to the police in Essex, who are in charge of the region around London Stansted Airport, where the flight landed, and would not comment further.The police asked anyone with information to call them.\u201cEssex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.\u201dBut Mr. Turner said that because Ryanair is an Irish company and the incident happened on the ground in Spain, the man most likely could not be prosecuted in Britain.

But after the flight attendant moved out of the cellphone video frame, the man grew even angrier.The woman soon got up to sit with her daughter, and the flight attendant told the man he would speak to a supervisor.She said they had traveled to Barcelona to commemorate a year since her father\u2019s death.The daughter said of the man who berated her mother: \u201cI know that if I was behaving like he was \u2014 or any other black person for that matter \u2014 police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.\u201dRyanair\u2019s profits have been falling as the carrier \u2014 the biggest discount airline in Europe \u2014 dealt with rising costs and flight cancellations.Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far-Right Candidate Jair Bolsonaro Widens Lead in Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Jair Bolsonaro, the populist, far-right candidate leading the pack, spent much of the final stretch in a hospital bed, convalescing from a near-fatal stabbing, occasionally posting selfies and shaky videos in which he looked feeble and groggy. His near-disappearance from the political stage only increased his lead: polls suggest Mr. Bolsonaro will trounce opponents in the election on Sunday.His success has defied the laws of political gravity. Until recently, Mr. Bolsonaro was a provocateur on the fringes of power who accomplished little as a seven-term lawmaker, but made headlines by calling for a military dictatorship and verbally attacking women, gays and people of color \u2014 in a country that is mostly nonwhite.Until early August, he did not even have a running mate because traditional parties and politicians found him toxic.But much like President Trump and populist leaders around the world, Mr. Bolsonaro has tapped into a deep well of resentment at the political establishment. He channeled Brazilians\u2019 anger over staggering levels of corruption and crime, presenting himself as the only candidate tough enough to solve them.\u201cBrazilians want a hero,\u201d said Daniel Machado, a professor of political marketing, referring to Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vow to take radical measures to fix Brazil.\u201cWe need to break that system together,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, told followers earlier this week during one of his daily live videos on Facebook.A year ago, most power brokers in Brazil regarded Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential bid as fanciful, deeming him too incendiary to take the helm of the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy. Veteran political strategists and analysts thought his appeal would ebb as the campaign season officially kicked off in August.After all, Mr. Bolsonaro is also the most reviled contender in the field, with a 45 percent disapproval rate. But as Election Day approaches, centrist candidates with larger war chests and robust networks of support are seeing their political base drift toward Mr. Bolsonaro.His popularity only grew after he was stabbed while being carried by supporters during a political rally in September. The assailant told police officers at the scene that he was carrying out \u201can order from God,\u201d which led investigators to question his mental health. But the attack played into Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s message about the need to get tough on crime, analysts said.But many of his backers argue that he represents the only way to defeat the most powerful and corrupt presence on the Brazilian political scene in recent years \u2014 the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016.When the presidential race got underway, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a charismatic former metal worker and founding member of the Workers\u2019 Party, was the front-runner by a wide margin. Many Brazilians, particularly the poor and the working class in this deeply unequal country, identify with Mr. da Silva personally and long for the prosperity they experienced during his tenure. He stepped down in 2011 with record-high approval ratings.Since then, the party\u2019s standing has slipped. Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, oversaw the deepest recession in Brazil\u2019s history. She was impeached in 2016 for obscuring a budget deficit.So less than a month before Election Day, the Workers\u2019 Party officially nominated Fernando Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, betting that Mr. da Silva\u2019s base would transfer its allegiance to him. This was effective enough to push Mr. Haddad \u2014 a 55-year-old economist, lawyer and history professor with little national name recognition \u2014 into second place in the polls.The matchup between Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad has crystallized a bitter societal divide in Brazil that has widened in recent years amid the economic woes and public disgust at bribery schemes that tainted much of the political and business elite.While foes see a Bolsonaro presidency as potentially catastrophic for the country\u2019s young democracy, his supporters warn that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would put Brazil on the type of ruinous path that has engulfed neighboring Venezuela.\u201cI lived through the era of the dictatorship and not even then did I witness so much hate, so much division, so much aggression,\u201d said Clara Strauss, 79, during a recent demonstration against Mr. Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s not characteristic of Brazilians.\u201dBrazilians are distrustful of more than just politicians. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro has sowed skepticism and at times outright hostility toward the press. He has dismissed critical stories \u2014 including investigations into his real estate holdings and a messy divorce \u2014 as \u201cfake news.\u201d That approach has resonated with many Brazilians who see large news organizations as beholden to the elite.Karine Neder, 45, an interior designer from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state, said she started leaning toward Mr. Bolsonaro as media coverage of him became increasingly negative in recent months. She became a fervent admirer as Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to take drastic measures to restore security, like tougher prison sentences.\u201cWe live in a country where you can\u2019t watch the national news at night without being afraid of going to work the next day,\u201d she said after attending a rally for the candidate in Rio de Janeiro.While rivals enjoyed considerably more free airtime on television \u2014 which is allocated according to a political party\u2019s size \u2014 and spent heavily on polished ads, Mr. Bolsonaro proved very adept at using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to reach voters.\u201cHe had the time and this new, unfettered space to occupy the collective imagination,\u201d Mr. Machado, the professor of political marketing, said.Bolsonaro fans created hundreds of group chats on the messaging app WhatsApp, which has become a prodigious channel to spread misinformation during elections in Latin America.Mr. Bolsonaro is considered a conservative for his hard-line approach to security, his staunch opposition to abortion rights and his disdain for the type of affirmative action initiatives the Workers\u2019 Party created to chip away at Brazil\u2019s steep inequality.But how he would manage the economy \u2014 the world\u2019s eighth largest \u2014 remains unclear.Mr. Bolsonaro and his surrogates have offered few detailed policy prescriptions and have backed contradictory positions on central issues, such as whether large state enterprises should be privatized.The policy blueprint on his campaign website is heavy on exclamation marks and short on details. \u201cOur strategy will be to adopt the same actions that work in countries that are booming, with jobs, low inflation, wages for workers and opportunity for all,\u201d his policy document proclaims.Mr. Bolsonaro has reacted with exasperation when interviewers have pressed him for details on how he would handle the economy, which is only now emerging from the recession.\u201cI\u2019m an artillery captain,\u201d he barked during a recent televised interview on the Globo News network. \u201cWhy would I talk about the economy?\u201dMany experts see him as ill equipped to tackle complex challenges that will ultimately need to be addressed, including pension and tax reform.\u201cThe military, when they took power in \u201864, and established a dictatorship, had a plan,\u201d said Helo\u00edsa Starling, a historian at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cWe may have disagreed with it, but they had a plan. He doesn\u2019t have a plan for the country.\u201dBut that has not fazed investors. They appear to have faith that Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated economist whom Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would appoint as finance minister, would push market-friendly reforms and rein in the social spending that mushroomed under the Workers\u2019 Party. As Mr. Bolsonaro has surged in the polls, markets have rallied, with stocks and the real currency rebounding.As a Bolsonaro victory has appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents have rallied online and in the streets under the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him. But the demonstrations have not dented his support, which has left many of those who ardently oppose him feeling despondent.\u201cWe used to think that rights that have been conquered were rights that had been consolidated,\u201d said Ms. Schwarcz, the historian. \u201cI\u2019ve concluded that we were being foolish. We must continue fighting for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Campaign Against Migration Goes Unheard, or Unheeded, in Guatemala", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "More migrants from Guatemala than from anywhere else are trying to cross the border into the United States, despite warnings about the perils of the journey north.Supported byCONCEPCI\u00d3N CHIQUIRICHAPA, Guatemala \u2014 Six months ago, Liset Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s husband packed a small bag, hugged their three children and said goodbye as he left on the more than 1,200-mile trip to the United States. It was his sixth attempt to try to cross the border illegally to find work.The couple had borrowed the equivalent of nearly $13,000 from a friend to pay a smuggler for the trip. Ms. Ju\u00e1rez said her husband was aware of the dangers \u2014 unscrupulous smugglers, dangerous desert crossings and possible kidnapping by deadly Mexican drug cartels \u2014 but felt he had few alternatives in Guatemala, where he was deep in debt after his business failed.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Ms. Ju\u00e1rez said two weeks ago, speaking through a translator. \u201cWe have to feed our children.\u201d She declined to identify her husband by name, for fear he would be arrested in the United States by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Ms. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s husband was among the thousands of Guatemalans who have ignored a messaging campaign of billboards and radio and TV ads by the American and Guatemalan governments that warn against the dangerous journey to the United States.Over the past year, 42,757 Guatemalans traveling as families were either apprehended or otherwise stopped at the United States border with Mexico, according to Customs and Border Protection data. They accounted for nearly half of all migrants who sought to enter the United States with their relatives.And the numbers have been on the rise. Two years ago, just under one-third of families stopped at the border were Guatemalan.Interviews with dozens of people in Concepci\u00f3n Chiquirichapa, a town of nearly 10,000 residents with a vibrant public market, revealed that almost everyone has family \u2014 or knows someone with family \u2014 in the United States.The reason for the diaspora is simple, residents said: extreme poverty.About 76 percent of the population in Guatemala\u2019s western highlands is impoverished, and 67 percent of children younger than 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition, according to the United States Agency for International Development.Over one million Guatemalans in the region\u2019s rural areas lack electricity. Many earn little to no profit from the coffee, corn, beans and other agricultural products they grow, given the steadily declining price of farm goods. Coffee production alone has dropped 6 percent since last year, according to the Department of Agriculture, and small farmers are unable to cover their costs.Additionally, residents cited drug trafficking, widespread corruption in the local government and extortion by gangs as contributing to their decision to leave cities and towns in the western highlands.\u201cWe have to create better opportunities for people so they can stay home,\u201d said V\u00edctor Manuel Asturias Cord\u00f3n, who heads the National Competitiveness Program, or Pronacom, a Guatemalan government agency that promotes economic development.\u201cWe also have to work on countering smugglers who have convinced people that their best opportunities to be successful lie in the states,\u201d he said.Alarmed by the influx of thousands of Guatemalans at the border, American officials have begun to search for more effective ways to stem the flow of the migrants.In late September, Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, traveled to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2014 the three countries that make up the bulk of the migrants apprehended at the southwestern border. In Guatemala, he met with government officials and leaders of business and indigenous communities.He said law enforcement alone could not stop the migration of tens of thousands of Guatemalans attempting to illegally enter the United States.\u201cI\u2019m here to listen and learn the issues you are facing so we can work together,\u201d he told a group of Guatemalan officials at a center where migrants return after being deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Mr. McAleenan also toured several projects funded by the Agency for International Development, including a coffee processing facility in Guatemala City and a farm in Quetzaltenango, the largest city in the western highlands, where new variants of corn and other vegetables are being produced.Meeting with several indigenous leaders at a round table in Quetzaltenango, Mr. McAleenan said he understood that most people leaving the region were trying to find work.But he reminded them that illegally crossing the American border is a crime, and warned of smugglers who have misled desperate migrants by assuring them that they can remain in the United States if they arrive as families.\u201cThere is no ability to stay in the United States if you bring a child, and there is no ability to stay if you are pregnant,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said. \u201cWe need to continue to provide accurate information so they won\u2019t make this dangerous journey, where they face physical and sexual assault.\u201dBut the lure of a better life in America remains strong for many Guatemalans.In the town of Cajol\u00e1, a 20-year-old woman who identified herself only as Onelia said she had attempted to illegally cross the border into Texas at least three times \u2014 twice in Laredo and once in McAllen \u2014 before being deported back to Guatemala.Onelia works at the Asociaci\u00f3n Grupo Cajol\u00e1, an organization set up by a former migrant named Eduardo Jim\u00e9nez to keep local residents in Guatemala by providing them with jobs. Since July, Onelia has processed honey at the organization; other women make indigenous clothing to sell.There is a day care in the basement for children whose mothers are working upstairs. Their fathers have mostly migrated to the United States.Onelia said she enjoyed her work, and earned a decent salary. But in November, she said, she plans to again set off for the United States.\u201cWe know about the risk and we know how hard it is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we still want to go.\u201dThe messaging campaign, however, has largely gone unnoticed.Nine billboards in Guatemala\u2019s western highlands area, paid for by the American government, warn potential migrants about the dangers of the trip north. Officials said they have also placed advertisements on radio and television with additional warnings, at a total cost of about $750,000.Across Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the American government is spending about $1.3 million on the campaign.But interviews with more than a dozen people in the Guatemalan highlands\u2019 largest city and several small towns showed that few residents have seen or heard the warnings. Many of the people interviewed said they would not be persuaded to stay anyway.A parallel, and far more powerful, messaging campaign by smugglers is resonating by word of mouth.Residents said they see daily advertisements by the smugglers, or coyotes, promising to get them to the United States. On at least one community radio station in Quetzaltenango, smugglers regularly offer to transport and help finance northbound travels for migrants.Smugglers are also active on social media. Some have promoted their services on Facebook, offering to take migrants anywhere in the \u201cAmerican union.\u201dMost of the advertisements are couched in language similar to that of a travel agent. Migrants are offered different types of trips, based on how much they can pay. And many are guaranteed three chances to cross the border for the cost of their trip.The ads feature pictures of charter buses, offering an image of a trip that is far different from what most migrants will experience as they make the journey on crowded buses and on foot from Guatemala to the border between Mexico and the United States.At the urging of American officials, the Guatemalan government has begun offering rewards to people who turn in smugglers. But getting people to do so has been a struggle.\u201cNo one will turn them in, because within the community they are not seen as bad people,\u201d said Dora Alonzo, 27, who runs an organization in Quetzaltenango to keep children from trying to migrate to America. \u201cBut everyone knows who they are.\u201dMs. Alonzo said her father and a sister migrated to the United States with help from smugglers. Her father returned to Guatemala eight years ago, after spending seven years in the United States. Her sister lives in South Carolina, she said.She would not name the smugglers. But she said the American government\u2019s plea for Guatemalans to remain at home is unlikely to be effective. The promise of a good life in the United States, she said, overrides the risk of the trip.\u201cThat is the way to have a house and a car,\u201d she said.Mr. McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said it was too early to judge whether the new messaging campaign \u2014 in Spanish and indigenous languages \u2014 had worked.\u201cWe have to give it some time to see whether it\u2019s effective in reaching that audience and creating that deterrence,\u201d he said.Back in Concepci\u00f3n Chiquirichapa, Liset Ju\u00e1rez said her husband finally made it to the United States after nearly a half-dozen tries.He plans to stay three years. With the money he makes as a laborer, she said they plan to pay back their debt, and save up to open another business.Asked if she plans to join her husband in the United States, she shook her head no.\u201cI can\u2019t abandon my children,\u201d she said. \u201cI have three children I have to sustain here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Fell for an \u2018I\u2019m the Man\u2019 Man", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveStung by divorce, a high-earning professional tries to recast herself in the dating world as a woman in need of male protection.\u201cI\u2019m the man,\u201d he said. \u201cI should be in charge of the money.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d I said, feeling a jolt of anxiety. As a partner at a financial consulting firm, I thought: \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the money every day.\u201dBut I reasoned that he and I weren\u2019t going to be sharing a checking account anytime soon, so why end things prematurely? Besides, in the context of our conversation, he wasn\u2019t even referring to me but to his ex-wife; they had been driven apart by financial disagreements. This put some distance between his words and me, or so I told myself.I didn\u2019t normally go for guys who said things like, \u201cI\u2019m the man.\u201d I usually fell for men who didn\u2019t argue when I said it was my turn to pay for dinner. These men noticed my intelligence before my looks, or at least they said they did.But in my post-divorce haze, I found myself falling for a different kind of man.As his words lingered, I felt a combination of shock and curiosity, as if encountering a species previously thought extinct. I knew there were men who believed they should be in charge of money. The shock came from encountering one who readily admitted it.But he already had made clear he believed in traditional gender roles. With sex, too, he had said, \u201cI\u2019m the man. I want to lead.\u201dI found his bluntness surprising but also alluring. He was confident in his desires.Since my ex-husband had divorced me the previous year, I had been reconsidering what I thought I knew about relationships. And my previous belief in a relationship of equals seemed painfully na\u00efve.My ex called himself a feminist, but in our marriage that seemed to mean he felt fine about me dramatically out-earning him, fine about spending my income freely on luxuries, and fine about me covering the mortgage, the private school tuition for our children and the rest of our financial commitments. (At the time, he was building a small retail business from which he took no salary.)This experience should have led me to dump any guy who claimed it was a man\u2019s job to manage a couple\u2019s money, but here it was having the opposite effect. I craved a man who sought to take financial responsibility for his family, even if I didn\u2019t need it.After my fantasy of a partnership of equals had failed to materialize, I seemed to want to replace it with a fantasy of paternalistic protection.The men I\u2019d previously dated thought of themselves as staunch feminists \u2014 in hindsight, frustratingly so, at least in the sense that they were too inclined to defer to me (under the guise of respecting me) to ever take charge, either financially or sexually. I can\u2019t blame them; the pattern of choosing men too reticent to arouse me had been mine.I had interrogated the last man I dated on his Democratic bona fides before agreeing to meet for coffee. But with my new guy, I found myself quietly acquiescing as he told me his voting history shouldn\u2019t matter. (I took this to mean his voting history was the opposite of mine.)After paying for coffee that first evening, he carefully aligned the bottom of the receipt with his credit card, then wrapped it around tightly before placing the card back in his wallet (my ex would have scrunched up the receipt and tossed it in the nearest trash can). Watching the care he took with this mundane task, I knew I wanted him.A week later, we played chess in an ice-cream parlor. I sensed that losing would dampen his ardor, so I left my king open to attack, letting him checkmate me twice. As we left, he took my hand and pulled me closer.Lying in his bed before falling asleep, I felt guilty about the chess games. They were like fake orgasms, untruthful actions giving the man an exaggerated view of his talents. But these games didn\u2019t hide sexual dissatisfaction; they hid my intelligence, turning me into someone he would feel a need to protect.He often cooked for us in the kitchen he had remodeled himself (despite a career in data analytics, not construction). The walls of my kitchen were still marked with the rough outlines of the cabinetry my ex had wrested off years earlier in his aborted attempt at an upgrade.Sitting with a glass of wine, admiring my new guy\u2019s cooking and handiwork, I was tempted to minimize the implications of his beliefs on gender roles. I pondered him being in charge of the money. Unlike my ex, he was frugal, believing a car was for transportation, not luxury. His home was outfitted with charming furniture he had made himself.But he wasn\u2019t cheap when it came to me. He paid when we ate out; I never even offered, in part because I knew doing so would displease him, but also because I relished feeling cared for. He was fiscally responsible, generous and trustworthy.So I told myself there was nothing wrong with the man being in charge of the money as long as he made good decisions. At the same time, I found myself becoming guarded around my new guy, evading his questions and hiding things I thought he wouldn\u2019t like. When he asked if I ever went to church, I said no \u2014 but failed to mention I was Jewish. I never lied about my career, though I didn\u2019t tell him the whole truth either. He knew I was an actuary but not that I was a partner at the firm.Despite my evasiveness, I knew what I loved about him. A few years earlier, a dog had attacked his son. He fought off the dog, but his son was left with stitches and difficulty sleeping. He sued the neighbor who owned the dog, getting a sizable contribution to his son\u2019s college fund, and the neighbor moved away.Given the choice between a man who said all the right things about supporting a strong woman and a man who shielded his child from a vicious dog with his bare hands, I chose the latter. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.In the end, though, he didn\u2019t choose me.He was smart enough, first of all, to see through my deceptions: the restraint during chess and the lack of candor about my career. There were other things he may have spotted too, like the mezuza on my door frame or the chess strategy books on my shelves.And I think he must have realized I earned more than he did. When he expressed frustration that he hadn\u2019t been able to save for his children\u2019s college costs, I said nothing. And when he asked me about alimony and child support, I answered truthfully: I didn\u2019t receive any.When I made the mistake of mentioning work, he finally asked enough questions to find my career history online. It was aggressive enough (on his part) and evasive enough (on my part) for us both to feel like it was the beginning of the end.A few hours later, I lay next to him, noticing the swarthiness of his arms against my pale skin. I told him a story about sex with my ex-husband.\u201cYou initiated?\u201d he said, mildly incredulous.His other beliefs I had sensed and anticipated, but given our sexual compatibility, I hadn\u2019t expected him to believe a woman shouldn\u2019t initiate sex.When I next saw him, he was sullen and withdrawn. I mentioned my cabinetry problems, as if to say, \u201cSee, I don\u2019t earn more than you. I can\u2019t even afford a normal kitchen.\u201dIt was a last-ditch effort to turn myself into the person I thought he wanted and also the person I wanted to be: a woman who needed to be protected. Or perhaps, more accurately, a woman who wanted to feel protected, whether she needed it or not. My attempt was halfhearted though; I knew the endeavor was doomed.After we had sex, he said he couldn\u2019t stay over, though he had no plans for the morning. The next day, by text, I ended it, which is what he wanted me to do.It seemed like an obvious decision, but I surprised myself by bursting into tears. What he had offered \u2014 strength, protection and generosity \u2014 were things I had been looking for without even knowing it. That\u2019s the thing about gender roles. They can meet a need you were afraid to acknowledge, and they can take it all away when you don\u2019t conform.Eventually, I hired someone for the cabinetry work. It was expensive, but that\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s my kitchen, and I\u2019m in charge of the money.Susan Forray works as an actuary in Milwaukee, Wis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Hurricane Came the Con", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "Six years after Sandy devastated Long Island, homeowners are still dealing with the wreckage of a sweet-talking contractor who took their money and left their houses unfinished.Supported byIt was the giant whiteboard that did it, they said.After Hurricane Sandy destroyed their homes in October 2012, many Long Islanders fell hard for Cody Trey Lawrence, a sweet-talking contractor from Texas. To pitch the services of Turnkey Contractor Solutions, the company he partly owned, he used a whiteboard the size of a picture window to lay out his project management prowess. He detailed how he kept track of each home elevation and reconstruction project.In the chaotic years after the storm that left thousands of people shifting from one temporary location to the next, the Turnkey whiteboard promised order. And to dozens of desperate homeowners, Mr. Lawrence seemed like a savior. Plus there was the hook: Turnkey was cheaper than almost everybody else.\u201cMany of us were at the point where you took what you could get, and you crossed your fingers,\u201d said Lori Bacigalupo, whose house in Island Park was left uninhabitable after the hurricane.The family moved five times in six years, and to this day, the repair work on their home remains unfinished. This is largely because of the mess made by Mr. Lawrence, who left Long Island before the job was finished.\u201cI know we\u2019re still in better shape than many others, but what I would do to get my old house back,\u201d Ms. Bacigalupo said. \u201cIt\u2019s been six years of torture.\u201dMs. Bacigalupo is not the only one who feels this way.\u201cThere was a point where I thought he was just a bad businessman,\u201d said Mia Vogt, of Massapequa, about Mr. Lawrence. She is one of about three dozen homeowners claiming that Turnkey did not complete its contracted work. \u201cBut now I think he\u2019s fraudulent.\u201d(Mr. Lawrence denied this accusation, instead insisting that his business partner, Jorge Urbina, misled him and their clients. Mr. Urbina had no comment.)Amid the thousands of Long Islanders on the South Shore who lost their homes, for the dozens of those who hired Turnkey, the situation is doubly bad. Not only have they been left with unfinished restorations, many of them are furious that rogue contractors have gone unpunished. In addition, many are angry that state and local governments didn\u2019t respond fast enough to their concerns.\u201cI pay my taxes, I vote in every election,\u201d said Dean Bacigalupo, Lori\u2019s husband. \u201cSo when I approach them with a big problem like this, I expect them to respond. All we\u2019ve done is wait.\u201dAs towns along the Florida Panhandle start to assess the damage from Hurricane Michael and plan their next steps, homeowners in Long Island offer a cautionary tale of how natural disasters can leave a different type of debris after storm waters recede: endless paperwork, unfinished homes, displaced families, foreclosures, overworked contractors and caseworkers, miscommunication, suspected fraud and massive debt.The day after Sandy hit New York, the Bacigalupos, who had evacuated, returned to Island Park to assess the damage. Like most of the homes in this small village in Nassau County, their three-bedroom ranch had been completely ravaged. Although the house was still standing, every room had flooded.\u201cI was screaming, hysterically crying,\u201d Ms. Bacigalupo said.The neighborhood looked like a war zone, Mr. Bacigalupo said. Emergency personnel conducted search-and-rescue missions. Police officers, firefighters and volunteers from across the country worked tirelessly to clean up debris, including boats in the middle of the street.The Bacigalupos were awarded $149,000 from their flood insurance policy. They cobbled together an additional $71,000 from savings and Mr. Bacigalupo\u2019s 401(k) to renovate. The family\u2019s Christmas photo that year shows Lori and Dean\u2019s two sons, 12 and 9 at the time, standing in their skeleton of a house.The family bounced around, staying with relatives, then a Marriott and a Best Western. Without the regular use of a kitchen, they spent a lot of money on takeout. The emotional toll of losing a home led to many sleepless nights.\u201cIt was a strange time,\u201d recalled Mr. Bacigalupo, a middle-school social studies teacher and an adjunct assistant professor at Hofstra University. \u201cThe boys would play Minecraft and would build their structures higher, with sump pumps.\u201dThere was also a third, lesser-known option for funding that homeowners tapped: Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery awards. These grant awards, which come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, may become available after the president makes a major disaster declaration and Congress approves them.Initially, the Bacigalupos were told that they would receive about $170,000, a low figure that surprised them. They called their caseworker (assigned to them by the state recovery agency) to report that contractors were quoting them a figure of about $330,000 to elevate their house. They were told that these companies were price gouging; the state would not be offering more money.The Bacigalupos then heard about Mr. Lawrence\u2019s company, Turnkey, from several friends. Mr. Lawrence sat down with the couple. He had worked in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina, he said, and he had extensive experience with home elevation. He mentioned other projects in the area and his whiteboard that kept them all organized. They were impressed.Mr. Lawrence came to New York in late 2014. The Louisiana company he had worked for, seeing a major opportunity in a region still rebuilding after Sandy, sent him to the East Coast to drum up more business. He applied for and received his contractor\u2019s license in the city, as well as in Nassau and Suffolk counties.He joined industry organizations to get to know the local contractors and studied up on how the area\u2019s recovery system worked, including the bidding process for state and city-run reconstruction projects, as well as the New York Rising program. He attended meetings and spoke at industry dinners. Many contractors who worked with him all said the same thing about Mr. Lawrence at this time: He was pleasant, a hard worker, and he knew how to use his Southern charm.Just a few years later, dozens of angry homeowners would retain a lawyer to explore criminal charges against Turnkey, labeling Mr. Lawrence as a fraudulent \u201cstorm chaser.\u201d\u201cAll I ever wanted to do was help people,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence, who briefly returned to Long Island earlier this month to the Garden City office of Jerald C. Carter, a former Nassau County court judge and Ronald J. Bekoff, a partner at Hession, Bekoff & Lo Piccolo. Mr Carter represents Mr. Lawrence, while Turnkey is represented by Mr. Bekoff. Mr. Lawrence was visiting the area specifically to give his side of the story for this article.Mr. Lawrence ultimately left the Louisiana company that originally sent him to New York and floated among a few others before deciding to go into business for himself. In early 2016, he invited an old colleague from the New Orleans area, Jorge Urbina, to open Turnkey in Bohemia, just south of Ronkonkoma on Long Island.The two used savings and borrowed money to pay for the required workers\u2019 compensation and liability insurance, Mr. Lawrence said. The firm didn\u2019t have any start-up or operating capital, but Mr. Lawrence, who concentrated on sales while Mr. Urbina was in charge of the construction, said he was sure that everything would be fine because projects were meant to pay for themselves, and Turnkey was lining up clients at a good clip.That year, Turnkey had contracts for about 25 home elevation and reconstruction projects (averaging about $196,000 each) in Long Island, totaling $4.9 million in sales, according to Mr. Lawrence. \u201cWe crushed it the first year,\u201d he said.Mr. Lawrence had ambitious goals; he wanted Turnkey to have a national presence. Public records show that he was looking for work in Virginia and Connecticut in 2016. And after parts of southern Louisiana flooded twice, he returned to the area to bid for jobs there, too.George Kasimos, a flood-insurance-reform advocate from Toms River, N.J., recalled Mr. Lawrence marketing his business at a lecture Mr. Kasimos gave in the Baton Rouge area in late 2016.\u201cHe was giving out fliers to people, and I had to tell him to stop,\u201d he said.Claude Brown, a homeowner from Denham Springs, La., who had received a flier, asked Mr. Lawrence to take a look at his home that had been flooded.\u201cHe seemed like an honest person, very outgoing,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown was given a quote that was about $75,000 less than that of local contractors. About a year later, Mr. Brown bit.But Mr. Lawrence\u2019s interstate hunt for clients hurt Long Island homeowners. When the Bacigalupos signed a contract with Turnkey for about $167,000 in February 2017, they were told the entire project would be done by October of that year.The problems started right away.Once the home had been lifted and lowered as part of the elevation process, workers would show up only a few times a week, then quickly disappear. Some weeks they wouldn\u2019t show up at all. Tasks that were supposedly completed looked shoddy.\u201cI would come home on my lunch hour to see what was going on, and I\u2019d find one guy hanging out in my basement doing nothing,\u201d Mr. Bacigalupo said.The couple\u2019s contract with Turnkey split their payment to the company in quarters to coincide with the payment schedule of the state disaster agency, which gave homeowners money in four allotments.Since Turnkey relied on each quarterly payment from the homeowners, any hiccup in construction resulted in a cash-flow problem. Mr. Lawrence said that Mr. Urbina didn\u2019t hire laborers with great skill, which probably cost him millions of dollars, as work often had to be redone.The Bacigalupos grew nervous, they said, when Mr. Lawrence asked for $2,000 in cash to build a back deck. Meanwhile, his workers had also damaged the front curb and sidewalk. Alarmed, the family called their caseworker, but that person had left and their case had been assigned to a replacement. Paperwork would get lost, Ms. Bacigalupo said, and emails and calls were not returned.\u201cIt was exasperating having to explain to each new caseworker what was going on,\u201d and that\u2019s only when the caseworker called back weeks later, Ms. Bacigalupo said.Months went by without any progress, so the couple hired an engineer to assess Turnkey\u2019s work earlier this year. The report was shocking: The house wasn\u2019t even bolted properly into the new foundation.\u201cForget about the emotional toll,\u201d Ms. Bacigalupo said. \u201cWe knew he was robbing us blind.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Lawrence acknowledged that he was losing control of his business in the fall of 2017.Brittany Rigoli, a former permit expediter at Turnkey, said that Mr. Lawrence had a hard time saying no to clients and underestimated Mr. Urbina\u2019s labor management skills.\u201cHe trusted Jorge too much, and he should have managed the workers,\u201d Ms. Rigoli said. \u201cAll of us tried very hard to keep things going, to fix things.\u201dDuring exit interviews conducted late last year that had been recorded on video, according to Mr. Lawrence, former workers said that Mr. Urbina had been fattening time sheets, hiring ghost workers and keeping the profits. Mr. Lawrence said that he has kept a list of alleged ghost workers, as well as some receipts given to him from former workers, who said that Mr. Urbina had asked them to send money to his native Honduras.(Multiple attempts were made, in English and in Spanish, to speak with Mr. Urbina for this article, using a cellphone number provided by Mr. Lawrence. At times the man who answered confirmed that he was Mr. Urbina and then hung up when asked about Turnkey; other times he feigned ignorance or screamed before disconnecting.)And yet Turnkey had little money. Ms. Rigoli said that she was asked to co-sign on a company credit card. Another employee said she used her own personal credit card to buy building supplies, and while she was partly reimbursed, she said she is still owed about $10,000. In November 2017, Mr. Lawrence said, he took out a $500,000 loan from a short-term business lender, which he cannot pay back.In February of this year, Mr. Urbina left Long Island, cutting off ties with Mr. Lawrence, who left two months later.(Turnkey is no longer on the preferred vendor list and was fired from the St. Bernard Project earlier this year.)In the end, about 40 households in Suffolk and Nassau Counties claim that Turnkey never finished contracted work. Around 30 of them joined a private Facebook group, and they have estimated that Turnkey took about $4 million in federal grant awards for jobs that were not completed. Some say that Mr. Lawrence knew when to cut out on the job (after the home was lowered) so legally it would not look like contractor fraud, a criminal act, but a breach of contract issue, a civil dispute.\u201cI even accused Cody of running a Ponzi scheme,\u201d said Bruce Borg, who had contracted Turnkey to raise his home in Amity Harbor. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep blaming your partner for doing a crappy job. At some point, he must have realized what he was doing was illegal.\u201dNot every homeowner got as far as the Bacigalupos. Keri Malone\u2019s house in Moriches has been up on cribbing since September 2017. Mr. Brown, who encountered Mr. Lawrence in Louisiana, said that work on his home stopped after Turnkey demolished just half of his house. Mr. Brown filed complaints with his state contractor licensing board, state attorney general and local police department. Mr. Lawrence was charged with contractor fraud and misapplication of payments, and a felony arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Lawrence this February.While homeowners were dealing with this mess, they also started to panic about looming project deadlines. Owing to federal regulations, the state must close out programs that use grant awards within a certain time period. Therefore, the New York Rising program requires homeowners to reach specific milestones in order to get their grant payments.Because of a skilled-labor shortage, many people had to wait months, some even a year, before work began on their houses. Homeowners, worried that they wouldn\u2019t get subsequent payments, or worse yet, would legally be required to return funds they had already accepted, made numerous calls to the state recovery agency and consumer affairs departments. Some had liens issued on their homes from irate subcontractors who hadn\u2019t been paid by Turnkey. Most were confused as to what to do next.The phone calls worked; the state extended deadlines until the end of 2019 for about 2,000 homeowners. A state recovery agency spokeswoman said that as long as homeowners can prove they used the grants for required work, they will most likely not have to return any money.When the Nassau and Suffolk consumer affairs departments revoked Mr. Lawrence\u2019s contractor\u2019s license in the spring, he left New York to find work elsewhere. He claimed that he tried to hand over unfinished projects to other subcontractors, but the state recovery agency prevented him from doing so.\u201cThis is not true,\u201d said Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman with the Governor\u2019s Office of Storm Recovery. \u201cG.O.S.R. had no contact with Turnkey and would not be able to stop it from referring a job or recommending another contractor.\u201dDistrict attorneys in Nassau and Suffolk counties have opened up formal investigations on Turnkey, but charges have not been filed.\u201cI think about what has happened every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran out of money.\u201dHomeowners who recall Mr. Lawrence highlighting his project management skills in front of his whiteboard aren\u2019t convinced he\u2019s simply bad at math. In addition to exploring criminal charges against Turnkey, they have also contacted the F.B.I., as well as the I.R.S.Last summer, the Bacigalupos, still living in a rental, decided to take charge.

Last weekend, a group of my closest friends came over for dinner, one of those things that miraculously comes together sort of at the last minute. I got to the store that afternoon and put a sheet pan full of chicken thighs in the oven just after my daughter went to bed. (I did chicken thighs rather than a whole chicken because they\u2019re fast, everyone likes them and I barely have to think about them, since they cook evenly and are so forgiving.)This is a whole chicken, of course, and not thighs, but the simplicity is what I wanted to share with you: salt, pepper, oven, done. This is a great recipe as written if you have extra time, but you could use 4 to 8 skin-on, bone-in thighs instead, arranging them skin side up on a sheet pan. Scatter the herbs around, or skip them altogether; I also like to brush the skin with olive oil. Keep the same oven temp, and they should be done in 35 minutes._____Mix roasted squash with farro for a warm, sweet-and-savory grain bowl, which is substantial enough to be a meal. (If you\u2019re at all anxious about that, add browned chunks of sausage or toss in handfuls of baby arugula.) Seed and slice the squash while the oven heats, or buy cubed squash and just roast a little longer. You could also skip the apple cider and cook the farro in water; cook an extra cup of grains to use in the frittata below._____A legitimately fast way to do delicious fish tacos: under the broiler, with minimal but flavor-packed toppings. The fabulous Sarah Copeland, who wrote the recipe, tops hers with avocado and sour cream or full-fat plain yogurt for her two small kids. I\u2019d just make this for dinner, though you could add black beans on the side if you\u2019d like._____I\u2019m finding this recipe irresistible. Fresh broccoli and carrots, thinly sliced beef, noodles, soy sauce and ginger and garlic, stir-fried and bright and savory and delicious \u2014 and it\u2019s a one-recipe meal, though extra string beans on the side wouldn\u2019t hurt._____This ingenious recipe uses leftover farro for texture, fish sauce for umami, chile for heat and lime for brightness. It all adds up to something more interesting, and tastier, than a standard frittata \u2014 and you don\u2019t even have to turn on the oven.Advertisement"}

Protesters congregate in front of a firehouse. In the foreground a man stands guard, his back to the camera, a metal baton in one hand, multiple handcuffs dangling from the other.The tense image by Sheila Pree Bright evokes civil rights photographs of the past. But the clothes and hairstyles mark it as contemporary, taken at a 2015 demonstration against police brutality and the killing a year earlier of Michael Brown, a black teenager.The past often resonates in Ms. Bright\u2019s photographs, which are collected in a new book, \u201c#1960Now: Photographs of Civil Rights Activists and Black Lives Matter Protests\u201d (Chronicle Books). Committed to documenting recent activism through the lens of history, she reminds us that the struggle for racial equality and justice in the United States has been longstanding and ongoing. The book includes portraits of past and present activists, photographs of Black Lives Matter demonstrations and meetings, and texts by Ms. Bright, Alicia Garza, Deborah Willis, Kiche Griffin, Aaron Bryant and Keith Miller.Ms. Bright said the inspiration for \u201c#1960Now\u201d was the 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, an event that sparked the Black Lives Matter Movement. \u201cI was unwilling to sit on the sidelines,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI took a stand documenting the tensions, conflicts, and responses between communities and police departments which have resulted from police shootings in Atlanta, Ferguson, Baltimore and Baton Rouge. I\u2019ve observed young social activists taking a stand against continued injustice that closely resembles what their parents and grandparents endured during the era of Jim Crow.\u201dIn her work, Ms. Bright focuses not only on movement leaders, but also on the thousands of grass-roots activists on the front lines of protest. She is likewise committed to representing people historically overlooked in mainstream depictions of black political action, including mothers, women, and LGBT activists. \u201cBright\u2019s work challenges what we see and how we see it,\u201d wrote Mr. Miller. \u201cWithin the current context of momentous changes that surround us, her work refreshes our sense of the possible and expands our notions of what is beautiful.\u201dMs. Bright\u2019s photographs offer an intimate and humanistic view of black protest: a demonstrator staring mournfully into the camera, a tear running down his cheek; a somber activist, his mouth covered by tape inscribed with the name of Freddie Gray, the 25-year old African-American man killed while being transported by police in Baltimore; a marcher in rapt attention, his eyes closed, his hands clapping as if almost in prayer; and a moving juxtaposition of portraits \u2014 the artist Bree Newsome, who took down the Confederate Flag at the South Carolina Capitol in 2015, and Roslyn Pope, a member of the 1960s Atlanta Student Movement.The fight has progressed through such disparate movements and events as the abolitionism of the 19th century, the birth of the African-American press in the early 20th century, the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, the civil rights demonstrations of the 1950s, the Black is Beautiful movement of the 1960s and Black Lives Matter today. Despite different motivations and strategies, all belong to a shared legacy of African-American resistance to prejudice, white supremacy and oppression.\u201cThe movements of now are faced with the same and worsening challenges that organizers and activists encountered in the 1960s \u2014 substandard conditions in Black communities, a lack of political power, and an amnesia that says that Black suffering is a product of our imagination rather than our lived experiences\u201d wrote Ms. Garza, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network.By embracing the lush black-and-white aesthetic of legendary civil rights photographs, Ms. Bright underscores this historical continuity. While millions of cellphone photos are generated each day \u2014 some forceful testaments to racial violence and injustice \u2014 few possess the grace and quiet lyricism of her images.Ms. Bright hopes that her pictures will broaden our understanding of today\u2019s struggle for racial equality and justice, and the history that inspired it. She is heartened, too, by the conversations her photographs have generated about race, prejudice, police brutality, and social justice in the United States.\u201cI see my role as photographic artist as the messenger to bring about awareness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPhotography has always brought awareness about racial injustices that exist in this country. However, there are questions that weigh heavily on my mind: Have we learned from the past?

Roosevelt\u2019s \u201ccourt-packing\u201d plan cast the country into six months of furious debate over the propriety of such a move. In the end the plan evaporated, but not before the court capitulated. Roosevelt\u2019s proposal set off a genuine constitutional crisis, with little else on the national agenda getting any attention.Why should we care about what happened some 80 years ago?Because with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, an extremely conservative majority now is fully in control of the court, which, at some point in the future \u2014 perhaps five or 10 years from now \u2014 could lead to another crisis much like the one in 1937.Anyone watching the deeply troubled, and troubling, confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh surely understands the depth of anger on the left, which is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. If the country moves left in the next few years, as the court moves right, we have the makings for a serious collision.You may be waiting impatiently to point out that Roosevelt\u2019s plan to pack the court ultimately failed. In the heat of the battle, Roosevelt\u2019s key ally, the Senate majority leader, Joe Robinson, dropped dead, and at that point, Congress and country apparently had enough of the struggle and Roosevelt dropped it.Of course, the justices have learned this lesson over time, and so we have since avoided any really serious crises involving the court. Chief Justice John Roberts clearly understands the political implications of a court out of step with the populace. Though his views are profoundly conservative, the chief justice nonetheless has done an admirable job of moderating the impact of his colleagues on the right, even voting \u201cleft\u201d himself at critical moments, as he did to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care plan and to limit law enforcement searches of cellphone records. Still, it\u2019s hard to know if he can continue to pull this off as the court drifts ever farther right \u2014 just as it is hard to see him denying conservatives the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade.The more the justices are perceived as partisan and ideological, the more the public will treat them in precisely that way. Which includes bringing them to heel when they get seriously out of line.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Evolution of a Restaurant Dish, From Vision to Revision ", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdding a new item to the menu takes lots of trial, error and time. We followed the California chef Jeremy Fox as he created, and recreated, an elaborate chicken dish. By that calculation, just a few seconds might help decide the fate of a complicated offering that Mr. Fox had been contemplating for a year, and actively working on for weeks.For some chefs, putting a new item on the menu is a routine affair, even a daily one \u2014 adding a simple tomato salad, say, when tomatoes are plentiful. For many others, it is a painstaking process. For Mr. Fox, a restless chef who goes to bed and wakes up thinking about flavor combinations, the dish he had in mind was a puzzle requiring both creativity and practicality.It had to combine reliable ingredients like the chicken with peak-season produce, which would require replacing the blueberries and corn at summer\u2019s end. It had to be something the kitchen could turn out without disrupting everything else going on. And it had to be \u201cuser-friendly,\u201d said Mr. Fox, who would eventually bow to customers\u2019 limited appetites and deconstruct the dish.Returning to the Wednesday market a week later, Mr. Fox and Mr. Doubrava spent two hours picking up preorders and buying the rest of what they needed \u2014 including okra, selected piece by piece, because the smaller ones are more tender.On Thursday, the day the dish would premiere as a special, Mr. Fox discovered that the blueberries he had dehydrated to sprinkle atop the chicken-liver toast \u2014 adding sweetness, tartness and a bit of crunch \u2014 had grown a papery outer skin that he didn\u2019t like. He tried gently blowing on the fruit, to dislodge the skin. It worked.Some surprises are welcome. In what he called a \u201chappy accident,\u201d Mr. Fox forgot about the okra confit twice: He left it to cool too long, so the fat started to solidify, and then he put it in a low oven for too long, so the exposed tips on some pieces started to caramelize. Those pieces added a crisp element to the confit, which would be served with brown butter crumbs, dried carrots, oca leaves and gribenes.For the toast, Mr. Fox decided to use pain de mie \u2014 a soft, mild white bread \u2014 made with byproducts he had on hand: schmaltz, which is seasoned, rendered chicken fat, and whey from the restaurant\u2019s homemade ricotta. \u201cIt\u2019s fancy white bread,\u201d he said, \u201cand I wasn\u2019t as concerned with it tasting better than store-bought as I was with using things, rather than wasting them.\u201d Mr. Doubrava started a new batch (above) for the next day\u2019s service.Five cooks, working in sync, made two test versions of the chicken and sides. The first was for Mr. Fox and Mr. Doubrava. At 5 p.m., the second went out to the daily meeting of the servers and other front-of-house employees. Mr. Fox explained each part of the dish to the staff, who tasted it and discussed how best to describe it. \u201cIt\u2019ll sell better if a server can talk about it with enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Fox said.The evening\u2019s first diners weren\u2019t tempted. Mr. Fox had to wait a half-hour before the printer spat out the ticket he was waiting for. \u201cOrdering one Big Bird,\u201d said the expediter, a bit more loudly than usual. Mr. Fox allowed himself a hopeful smile and watched the line cook preparing the chicken, which involved struggling to fit it into the saut\u00e9 pan, feet and all, so the skin would crisp evenly. Once everything was plated, Mr. Fox made microscopic adjustments and stepped back. Two food runners hurried the order out the kitchen door.After the third order, Mr. Fox revamped the okra on the fly, adding fermented husk cherries and aioli. The dish was rich; he thought the acid of the husk cherries would cut through the fat, and that the creamy aioli would improve the \u201cmouth feel.\u201d By the end of the night, all seven orders had sold.A week later, the chicken took its place on the printed menu, but now it was roasted whole rather than spatchcocked, producing a moister, more tender bird that needed less preparation time but took longer to cook. \u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster to get the chicken to catch on,\u201d Mr. Fox lamented a month later. He had changed the preparation again, because diners didn\u2019t want to wait an hour for their entree. A semi-boneless bird, brined and split in half, solved both of his big problems: It cooked faster and fit neatly into the pan.The polenta was too popular \u2014 people who didn\u2019t want the chicken were disappointed that they couldn\u2019t order the side dish by itself. So Mr. Fox moved it to the \u00e0 la carte menu, where it became an instant hit. In place of polenta with the chicken dish, he substituted boiled potatoes served with a seaweed salsa, a fennel and onion pur\u00e9e, and crisp potato skins. And when the okra at the market wasn\u2019t to his liking, he used small roasted onions instead.Even with the fixes, there was resistance in the dining room. Tables of two felt that a whole chicken and three sides was too much food, so Mr. Fox downsized, moving the toast to the \u00e0 la carte menu. For one short, scary stretch, he sold one nightly order of the chicken, or none. He exhorted his servers to sound more enthused. The chicken started to sell out again.It lasted a second month, but regulars complained that they missed the half-chicken that had preceded it on the menu. In late September, Mr. Fox surrendered to popular demand: Big Bird became a roasted half-chicken with seasonal accompaniments. Carrot pur\u00e9e stepped in for the potatoes, with purslane providing a briny crunch.Perhaps the least popular ingredient \u2014 the chicken feet \u2014 survived until very recently, when Mr. Fox had to face facts: Plates came back into the kitchen with the feet untouched. He gave up. They go into the stock, now, with the chicken heads.The components continue to evolve with each week\u2019s market \u2014 purple daikon radishes have made an appearance recently \u2014 but Mr. Fox refuses to think about the next version in advance. Discovery is part of the fun.\u201cIf I think too far ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cby the time I get there I\u2019ll be tired of the idea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After much practice, I had perfected the angle in which I\u2019d hold out the camera, so that it wouldn\u2019t appear in the shot. Or so I thought \u2026 until I discovered hundreds of photos on Facebook with my hyperextended arm still in the frame.I was 18-years-old in 2013. Luckily \u2014 or unluckily? \u2014 for me, my memories are just a few scrolls away.The result is a combination of all the things I care about: young people, women behind the lens, and celebrating girlhood around the world. As part of that, we asked some of our Edit contributors to share their own 18-year-old ruminations. Here\u2019s what they said.Hallie Reed:I had to make so many choices at 18. The number of majors, clubs, jobs, and social activities to choose from was staggering. It seemed as if I could fashion my life into any number of forms. I felt like the decisions I made then would likely affect me for the rest of my adult life. Choosing to say yes to one thing meant saying no to a number of other possibilities. I wish I could tell my 18-year-old self that life can surprise you and paths can merge. I thought being a nursing major meant I couldn\u2019t write. I was wrong.Nushrat Rahman:To be completely honest, I don\u2019t remember much about being 18. That year, I went from attending a small private Islamic school in Detroit to a large public university a few miles away. It was a huge adjustment. From struggling to make new friends to making sense of my faith in an unfamiliar environment, it was rough times. I focused on my schoolwork because that\u2019s where I always did well. I would often sit in the quietest library on campus, the one mostly graduate students used. I remember the mildewy scent of that library, the typing, clicking, and page turning against near absolute silence. My spot near the windows became my hiding place. Ebony Miranda:While most of my friends were going off to college out of state, I continued living at home with my mom. I got my first job at a law firm and went to my local community college. I spent a lot of nights hanging out with friends, going to shows in LA, driving around the suburbs while blasting my favorite CDs, and smoking too many cigarettes (sorry, Mom). Taking a couple years between high school and college provided a lot of time to get to know myself better. I was starting to explore my queer identity and I began to think about my gender in new ways. I finally experienced intimacy that was consensual and safe. Even though I don\u2019t identify as a girl anymore, I still cherish my girlhood and all that it taught me. Elia Rathore:My 18th year taught me a lot. I graduated high school, and I remember crying by myself on the drive home on the last day \u2014 it had suddenly hit me that a giant chunk of my life was over. But soon that sadness faded when I realized what was next. I was ready for college, adulthood, and everything that my years of preparation had led up to. It was both haunting and freeing. Claire Haug:Amanda Gorman:Karina Balan Julio:It wasn\u2019t until my twenties that I realized actually grew up a lot at 18. I was moving to a college 8 hours away from my family and still grieving over the death of my father, who had passed away just a couple of years earlier. I remember calling my mom and my younger siblings everyday and trying to sound strong and steady. Learning to cope with that emotional load ultimately made me stronger \u2014 you won\u2019t see me panicking too often nowadays.Sharon Attia is news assistant on The Times\u2019 Gender Initiative, a photographer, and is grateful for her iPhone which has revolutionized the way she takes selfies.Advertisement"}

But he was attracted to the idea of working on long-term photo projects, which led him to the situation in Northern Ireland.Growing up in Poland, he had known only a little about the region\u2019s history. \u201cWe are a post-Soviet country, so we had been cut off from information from the West,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs a teenager, I saw pictures on television, and I do remember the reports talking about the Troubles, the I.R.A. and bombings. I saw the pictures and videos. That stayed in my head.\u201dIn subsequent trips, which he made every two weeks, Mr. Smiejek walked around and talked to people in parks and pubs about their past and their hopes for the future. But while he photographed both Protestants and Catholics, he gradually zeroed in on the Loyalists. Connecting with an organization that promotes restorative justice, he began to explore the Protestant communities.\u201cThere was a lack of knowledge about the Protestants, Loyalists and paramilitaries,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody I talk to from other countries, when they think about Northern Ireland, they think I.R.A.\u201dWith the help of a fixer and people who worked on the ground with NGOs, he began to widen his circle of subjects, meeting with families as well as historical societies run by former paramilitary members who shared their stories.Mr. Smiejek\u2019s images show Loyalists preparing for their marches in Protestant neighborhoods, or the bonfires set ablaze on the eve of July 12, which commemorates the victory of King William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Some are surreal, like the image of a double-decker tour bus spotted past one of the brick walls dividing neighborhoods.\u201cAfter the bands marching on the streets, the bonfires are the biggest sign of the Loyalists in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cSome families have years, even generations building the bonfires. And the kids are from families who were involved in the Troubles.\u201dMemories remain, as people remember the victims, Mr. Smiejek said. But he noted that others remained committed to forging a new path. \u201cWe have many people who have had enough and who finally want peace, who want to remove the walls and go forward and make this country better,\u201d he said.The borders and checkpoints that once marked the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island have gone.

If it worked \u2014 but was more effective than expected \u2014 China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?Beijing\u2019s latest effort to prop up its economy amid a trade war with the U.S. isn\u2019t working yet. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, fell again this week, to below 6.93 per dollar.But the currency doesn\u2019t trade freely: It moves within a range set by the central bank. And a fall in its value can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which is handy when President Trump\u2019s tariffs push up their prices in America.Among the sectors hardest hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s approach are the beverage and auto industries, which rely heavily on foreign aluminum and steel to make cans and cars. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, said this month that higher prices for aluminum imports from Canada were eating into quarterly profits and said it would raise prices as a result. The company lowered its profit forecast for the year and its stock slid. Similarly, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company said last month that the additional costs from the metal tariffs alone would shave about $1 billion off its annual profits.The new trade deal won\u2019t be signed until late November, and it could be amended before then. Some Republican lawmakers have been pushing Mr. Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. That may happen \u2014 or the whole thing could be thrown into limbo if Democrats take back the House.The uncertainty in insider trading law invites debate over the legality of misconduct that has no place in our markets. But this is a fixable problem: The law can be updated and made clearer. Ideally, Congress would take the lead. But bipartisan proposals to update the law have languished for years.

{"Headline": "Australian Leader Considers Moving Embassy to Jerusalem From Tel Aviv", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrime Minister Scott Morrison echoed many of the points President Trump gave for a similar decision. The announcement drew criticism as a political gambit to win a local election. SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday raised the possibility of moving the Australian Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, an idea that drew criticism as a baldly political gambit meant only to win a crucial local election. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would represent a break in Australia\u2019s longstanding position on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and could have global consequences by encouraging others to follow suit.\u201cBut frankly, it hasn\u2019t been going that well,\u201d Mr. Morrison said of efforts toward a two-state solution. \u201cNot a lot of progress has been made. And you don\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expect different results.\u201d Mr. Morrison credited a Liberal Party candidate, Dave Sharma, with persuading him to consider the proposal. Mr. Sharma, a former ambassador to Israel, is running in a local election for a seat long held by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that is now up for grabs. A Liberal Party loss in the election would mean the conservative coalition government, comprising the Liberal and National parties, would lose its single-seat majority in Parliament. That means it would have to negotiate individual votes from other members to pass legislation or the federal budget.The Liberals\u2019 treatment of Mr. Turnbull has turned the election for the seat into an actual contest, with party observers fearing it would go to one of Mr. Sharma\u2019s opponents. Some constituents expressed wariness of Mr. Morrison\u2019s gambit. At the Shop and Wine Bar in Sydney, Michael Mobbs, an environmental consultant, criticized Mr. Morrison\u2019s announcement as \u201copportunistic politics.\u201dWentworth is home to a sizable number of Jewish voters, and Mr. Mobbs said many he had spoken to were \u201coutraged this has been made a political issue.\u201d He added that he would be voting for the Labor candidate.\u201cThis is not a time to talk about an embassy in a foreign country faraway,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s degrading, ethnic politics.\u201dBut at a kosher bakery in Rose Bay, Sarah Lavan, a kindergarten teacher, welcomed the announcement.\u201cWe\u2019re happy and proud of him,\u201d she said of the prime minister. \u201cI think it\u2019s a brave step. My husband was so happy this morning \u2014 all his life he\u2019s voted Liberal.\u201d She dismissed criticism that it was a political move to ensure a victory in Wentworth.\u201cI don\u2019t think the step is to win more Jewish votes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn't matter what the reason is, the action is what counts.\u201d Penny Wong, the opposition\u2019s shadow foreign minister, said the announcement demonstrated \u201cjust how desperate Scott Morrison is to hold onto the seat of Wentworth.\u201d\u201cDoes anyone actually believe he\u2019ll carry this through?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just posturing ahead of a by-election that he is desperate to win in order to hold onto a slim majority.\u201dMs. Wong said Mr. Morrison\u2019s position went counter to that of past Liberal Party leaders, and even of Mr. Morrison himself. Mr. Morrison said in June that there was little indication the party would support such a move.The proposal has already met with approval in Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking to Twitter to share the news.The push to relocate the embassy is not new, said Lydia Khalil, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The embassy move, as well as opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, are part of \u201ca persistent position that has been advocated by Australian Jewish voices,\u201d she said.Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would benefit Australia\u2019s alliance with the United States, help to forge a deeper relationship with the Trump administration, and \u201cinsulate it from some of the more erratic positions against allies,\u201d Ms. Khalil said.\u201cIt would also promote the viewpoint that Australia drives its foreign and national security policies through the lens of that alliance,\u201d she said.But moving the embassy to Jerusalem would \u201cmake already stalled and difficult negotiations very difficult to revive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives more ammunition to people who want to derail the peace process even further and it doesn\u2019t help the already entrenched positions that have solidified over the years and don\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.\u201dVicky Xiuzhong Xu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worse Than Nafta", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new deal undermines investor certainty and makes disputes between the United States and Mexico more likely. Professor Flores-Mac\u00edas is an associate professor of government at Cornell. Professor S\u00e1nchez-Talanquer is an assistant professor of political science at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics.North American business leaders are breathing a sigh of relief after Canada agreed, at the 11th hour, to join the revised North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Mexico. But before they break out the Champagne, they should look at the details. Although the revised deal brings much-needed modernization in areas such as e-commerce and intellectual property, the media spotlight on Canada has obscured a bigger problem for the region: Under the new terms, North American trade is headed off the rails and, perhaps along with it, political stability south of the border.A key goal of Nafta, like all free trade agreements, is bringing certainty to the rules of the game to facilitate commercial exchanges. The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, undermines that certainty in two ways.First, the deal eliminates expert panels for resolving government-investor disputes in most industries, save for those covering energy and telecommunications. Although it preserves panels for bilateral disputes regarding dumping and countervailing duties, it defers to domestic courts as the main mechanism for solving controversies should governments change the rules down the road. This measure puts a lot of faith in the transparency and competence of the legal systems of the member countries and opens the door to potential cronyism, unequal access to those systems and even corruption.Second, the agreement sets up a mechanism for automatically reviewing its terms on a periodic basis. This and the automatic expiration after 16 years as the default option introduce significant uncertainty by making it less costly for governments to upend existing rules and threaten to exit the agreement. Establishing periodic reviews as natural breaking points for the rules of the game would certainly shorten investors\u2019 time horizons.Both of these changes point to a bigger problem with the new deal: the deinstitutionalization of North American economic ties.The certainty and centrality of Nafta to United States-Mexican relations has proved integral to aligning the two countries\u2019 economic and strategic interests. Before Nafta, relations were far from harmonious, in part because Mexico\u2019s interests were solidly on the side of the global south. Pointing to a history of invasions, occupations and the loss of half of its territory to the United States, Mexico long saw its northern neighbor as a threat to be contained. This explains why Mexico refused to support Washington-led initiatives at the Organization of American States to condemn Communism in Guatemala in the 1950s, rejected the expulsion of Cuba from the O.A.S. in the 1960s and acted with complacency toward the threat of leftist takeovers in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s.Thanks to Nafta, Mexico developed a stake in the economic success of the United States, which went from threat to partner. It has been directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s dependence on trade with the United States for its own economic development. With its economic fortunes intertwined with those of its northern neighbor, Mexico veered away from the Latin American political orbit and turned decidedly toward North America. In 1994, Nafta served as an important carrot for Mexico to gain membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly developed nations.Nafta also imposed constraints on the Mexican government\u2019s latitude to depart from the alignment with United States interests. In Mexico\u2019s legal system, international agreements are second only to the articles in the Mexican Constitution \u2014 above federal, state and local laws. Even if the government tried to depart from the pro-market orientation and respect for property rights provided for in Nafta, it would be subject to a number of legal challenges. The dependability of this partnership is undermined every time the agreement is up for renegotiation, whether scheduled or not. That\u2019s what we mean by deinstitutionalization: If it is subject to political whims in the three countries, then it is no longer a settled agreement, and its place as a foundation of cooperative United States-Mexican relations will quickly erode.Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. President Trump must now send the deal to Congress for approval. It is up to Capitol Hill, then, to make sure that whatever deal emerges, it continues to provide a reliable, permanent basis for North America\u2019s trade and political relationships. Although the up-or-down nature of the vote makes any changes unlikely, this experience should serve as a valuable lesson as America redesigns its trade relations with the rest of the world.Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas is an associate professor of government at Cornell University.

Nightly offerings might include Japanese turnips in a sun-dried turnip dashi broth; king salmon seasoned with a shio koji (fermented rice) vinaigrette; black cod in a miso broth seasoned with cod bones, grilled over Japanese charcoal; and confections, or wagashi, like Japanese cheesecake.

Most of the damage was to the hands and feet, the scientists found. Almost half involved lacerations, and about 22 percent resulted in an amputation. Eye and face injuries accounted for 1 percent of emergency room visits, and fractures for 22.4 percent. More than 200 people suffered burns from lawn mowers serious enough to be treated in an E.R.About 85 percent of the injured went home after being treated, while the rest stayed in the hospital or went to another facility \u2014 a nursing home for rehabilitation, for example, or a short-term hospital. Those who were immediately hospitalized stayed an average of two days, but about 600 of them needed home nursing care after they were discharged.And the price tag for all this landscaping mayhem? The average emergency room visit cost $2,482, and the average charge for hospitalization was $36,987 per patient. The researchers estimate that in all, lawn mower injuries cost a little more than $36 million a year. Children under age 4 were more likely than older people to injure their feet and to suffer an amputation. Based on their own experiences, the authors suggested that these injuries occur when a child approaches a family member who is mowing the lawn, or when they fall off the lap of a person driving a riding mower. Dr. Deborah Schwengel, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the study, said that while there are fewer injuries to children, they tend to be more severe.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that well-meaning adults are not aware of the danger, and that kids wind up with an amputation of an entire foot or part of a leg,\u201d she said. Older children and adults sometimes stick their hands into a mower, despite the whirring blades, to clear debris. The solution, Dr. Schwengel said, is safer equipment: \u201cWe\u2019re working with university engineering departments, and our hope is to create lawn mowers that are smart enough so that no one gets their foot or hand chopped off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outspoken Trump Supporter in Florida Charged in Attempted Bombing Spree", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn outspoken supporter of President Trump from South Florida was charged on Friday with sending explosive packages to at least a dozen of the president\u2019s critics, apparently bringing to a close an attempted bombing spree that has gripped the country just ahead of the midterm elections.The suspect, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr., 56, was arrested outside an auto parts store near Fort Lauderdale after a fast-moving investigation in which the authorities said they were able to pull a fingerprint from one of the bomb packages and collect Mr. Sayoc\u2019s DNA from two others.Mr. Sayoc, who seemed to be living out of a van in Aventura, Fla., was taken into custody on a day when four more explosive packages were found, including two intended for United States senators, both Democrats.A federal criminal complaint spells out his contempt for this week\u2019s many bomb targets, noting that Mr. Sayoc\u2019s van was slathered with images and slogans often found on fringe right-wing social media accounts.The complaint identifies a Twitter account that authorities said he used to rail against Democratic figures, and it notes that both his social media messages and the bomb packages used the same misspelling \u2014 \u201cHilary Clinton\u201d \u2014 for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent.Mr. Sayoc also posted frequently on right-wing social media groups, the authorities said. On Facebook, Mr. Sayoc published photos of a Trump rally he attended during the 2016 presidential campaign. He was wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.Of the four bombs discovered on Friday, one was addressed to Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; another was sent to James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence; and a third was intercepted before it reached Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat.Tom Steyer, a prominent Democratic donor, said a fourth package was addressed to him and found in a California mail center.At a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Mr. Sayoc had been charged with five federal crimes, including the interstate transportation of an explosive, the illegal mailing of explosives and making a threat against a former president and others.The packages sent by Mr. Sayoc included photographs of his intended targets, each one marked with a red X, according to the criminal complaint.When asked why Mr. Sayoc had sent the bombs to Democrats, Mr. Sessions said that he was not sure, but added that the suspect \u201cappears to be a partisan.\u201dThe F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said that the bureau was still trying to determine if Mr. Sayoc\u2019s bombs were \u201cfunctional\u201d but noted that they contained \u201cenergetic material\u201d that could be dangerous. Mr. Wray said that the investigation was \u201cactive\u201d and cautioned that there could be more bombs still undiscovered.The criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and detailed the five charges against him. (PDF, 11 pages, 0.13 MB)\u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u201d he said.But in a Friday night rally in Charlotte, N.C., the president accused the news media of trying to use Mr. Sayoc\u2019s political leanings to \u201cscore political points against me and the Republican Party.\u201d\u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,\u201d he said.Mr. Sayoc is a registered Republican whose arrest record in Florida dates back to 1991 and includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as allegations that he threatened to use a bomb, public records show.His criminal history from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that he listed his occupation some years ago as \u201cmanager.\u201dAccording to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother\u2019s home. \u201cLives w/mom,\u201d a handwritten note on the petition said. \u201cHas no furniture.\u201dMr. Sayoc was arrested around 11 a.m. Friday outside an AutoZone car repair shop in Plantation, Fla., about 20 miles from Aventura, officials said. Patrol cars shut down the surrounding streets, leaving rows of businesses inaccessible for part of the morning. The authorities also seized and towed away Mr. Sayoc\u2019s white van, where he was apparently living.At least 14 explosive packages have been discovered since Monday.

Two packages each were addressed to Mr. Biden and Ms. Waters. | By Jugal K. Patel and Joe WardSome residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van, the windows of which were plastered with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers, often parked in the lot of a strip mall, the Shoppes at the Waterways.\u201cIt struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\u201d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who until recently lived in Aventura and often noticed the van. \u201cIt was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied. Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.\u201dThe criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where he will be prosecuted. Five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of federal prosecutors in Manhattan.Mr. Sayoc is expected to appear before a judge in Florida on Monday.A lawyer from the Federal Defenders office in Manhattan, Sarah Baumgartel, was assigned to represent him. \u201cWe hope that he will be presented in court and brought to New York expeditiously so that the case can proceed,\u201d Ms. Baumgartel said.For months now, Mr. Trump has been attacking the F.B.I., ridiculing its officials and damaging morale at the bureau.The swift arrest on Friday was a public win for Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and a reminder of his agency\u2019s effectiveness.Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill of the New York Police Department also praised the F.B.I., sending a message that the two agencies, along with some half a dozen others that took part in the investigation, were in lock step.One law enforcement official said the investigation came together less than 24 hours before the announcement, with a preliminary DNA match first and the fingerprint match coming sometime Friday morning.Later on Friday, federal authorities executed a search warrant at a residence associated with Mr. Sayoc, but he had been living in his van. Agents conducted a preliminary sweep of the vehicle before towing it to the F.B.I. office, where they were expected to search it later on Friday.The official said that during an interview with agents, Mr. Sayoc denied playing any role in the bombing campaign.\u201cHe denied all knowledge of making the bombs,\u201d the official said. \u201cAny time they brought up the devices, he wouldn\u2019t say anything about them.\u201dMr. Sayoc was first interviewed under a national security exception that allows defendants to be questioned without being advised of their rights to a lawyer.After he was given his Miranda warnings and told he could have a lawyer, \u201che invoked his right to counsel pretty quickly,\u201d the official said. Mr. Sayoc declined to answer further questions.Of the packages discovered on Friday, the one addressed to Mr. Clapper, the former senior intelligence official, was meant for the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.The package addressed to Mr. Booker was found in Florida.The device sent to Ms. Harris\u2019s district office in Sacramento, Calif., was discovered at a mail facility there, she said in a statement on Friday.

{"Headline": "A White Van Laden With Stickers Is at Center of Bombing Investigation", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAVENTURA, Fla. \u2014 One sticker has a Photoshopped image of President Trump standing on a tank, haloed by fireworks with an American flag behind him. \u201cDishonest Media,\u201d and \u201cCNN Sucks,\u201d reads another one, the cable network\u2019s logo affixed to it. And then there are the memes expressing support for the president and animosity toward his critics.Photographs of the van, believed to be Mr. Sayoc\u2019s mode of transportation and his home, is a kind of Facebook feed on wheels: Many of the decals appear to show widely-circulated conspiratorial internet memes that Mr. Sayoc himself posted in repetitive bursts on his social media accounts.\u201cHe communicates in meme,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, a researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University who was analyzing Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media accounts on Friday. \u201cThe van is basically his identity, in meme.\u201dIt also may have been where he slept. Manuel Prado, a 56-year-old hairdresser at a salon in the shopping center where the van was often parked, said he had seen Mr. Sayoc living in the vehicle for the past several years.\u201cI knew right away it was him when I saw the pictures of the van today in the news,\u201d Mr. Prado said as he prepared to cut a customer\u2019s hair. \u201cIt was really smelly when he had the door open and you walked by. It was horrible. He might drive off and run an errand or something, but every morning that van was there in the parking lot.\u201dSeveral of the political decals portray those who received some of the 13 packages that the F.B.I. linked to Mr. Sayoc, including CNN, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder. George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor and another bomb target, also appears to be on a sticker.The back windows of the van bear American flag stickers and are covered with paeans to God, the military and the president. Some of the lettering is covered with new decals, suggesting that Mr. Sayoc was updating his messaging.Soccer is also a theme: North Carolina college soccer teams are praised on the back windows. \u201cTop Youth Soccer Recruits for Trump,\u201d reads one decal. Others refer to the Seminole Tribe of Florida.But most of the van is devoted to pro-Trump, anti-Democrat messages that seem to have been cut and pasted directly from Facebook and Twitter.His van appeared in his social feed, too, with photographs of van decals \u2014 a jumble of slogans like \u201cWe Vote Pro-Life\u201d and \u201cAmericans & Americans First\u201d \u2014 posted to Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Twitter feed.A collage on a right-rear window, which also appears on a window on the left side, features campaign images of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. A slogan closer to the front of the van reads, \u201cI am Donald Trump & I Approve This Message.\u201dOther images portray prominent liberal critics of Mr. Trump, including the filmmaker Michael Moore and Jill Stein, a Green Party candidate for president, whose face appears in crosshairs.Then there are the memes. \u201cThe Swamp to Be Drained,\u2019\u2019 for instance, invokes Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d campaign slogan, and shows prominent Democrats and media figures in a swamp, along with phrases like \u201cNot Enforcing Immigration Laws\u2019\u2019 and \u201cClinton\u2019s Illegal Email Server\u2019\u2019 and the Black Lives Matter logo.Another shows a photo of people running and is captioned \u201cMillions of liberals cross the border illegally into Mexico to escape Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201d Larger text above it reads: \u201cI Have a Dream.\u201dThe van reflects the power of memes, which can spread quickly with emotional visuals and few words, said Dr. Albright, of Columbia. \u201cThey can inspire in good ways and also in bad ways.\u2019\u2019As photographs of the vehicle circulated on Friday, it became an object of much fascination on social media. Some people posted photographs that they had taken of the van months ago.Others wondered about the nature of the decals. Were some of them affixed from the inside? How much had they cost?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are the Danes Melancholy? Are the Swedes Sad?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe truth about the Nordic economies.Opinion ColumnistBut is a negative assessment of the Nordic economies really right? That\u2019s not at all clear. That lower G.D.P. number conceals two important points. First, by any measure people in the lower part of the income distribution are much better off in Nordic societies than their U.S. counterparts. That is, there is a lot less misery in Scandinavia \u2014 and because everyone has some chance of falling into low income, this reduces the risk of misery for a much larger share of the population.So I thought it might be useful to put together some information on how the Nordic economies actually compare to the U.S.First of all, the Nordics really have made drastically different choices in public policy. They aren\u2019t \u201csocialist,\u201d if that means government control of the means of production. They are, however, quite strongly social-democratic: as Exhibit 1 shows, they have high taxes, which finance much more generous social benefits than we have here. They also have policies on wages, working hours, and more that tilt the balance toward workers in a number of dimensions.But this understates the case, because these data don\u2019t include \u201cin kind\u201d benefits like health care and education. All of the Nordic countries have universal health care \u2014 not just single-payer, but for the most part direct government provision (a.k.a. \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d) This compares with the U.S. where \u2014 especially before the Affordable Care Act went into effect \u2014 lack of health insurance was common even for families near median income, and high deductibles are an obstacle to care even for many of the insured.Nordic education also lacks the glaring inequality in quality all too characteristic of the U.S. system.Once you take these benefits into account, it\u2019s likely that at least half the Nordic population are better off materially than their U.S. counterparts. But what about the upper half?As the CEA notes, real G.D.P. per capita is lower in the Nordics than in the U.S., and that\u2019s reflected in those lower incomes for the upper half of the income distribution. But it\u2019s worth looking at why G.D.P. is lower.Once you take vacations into account, Denmark and Sweden basically look comparable in performance to the U.S. Finland looks worse, but this is something of a special case: the Finnish economy has been ailing for a number of years, not because of socialism, but because its two premier exports \u2014 Nokia and wood pulp \u2014 were hit hard by technological change, and membership in the euro has made adjustment difficult.The point for welfare comparisons is that while Nordic families at, say, the 60th percentile of the income distribution have lower purchasing power than their American counterparts, they also have much more free time and an arguably better work-life balance. Are they really worse off? You can make a good case that taking all of this into account, the majority of Nordic citizens are actually better off than Americans.The bottom line is that real G.D.P. per capita isn\u2019t everything, and you shouldn\u2019t uncritically use that measure to judge how social democracy is working in Scandinavia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The State Faces Some Big Problems. Are We Ready?", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The race for governor of California \u2014 between Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican business executive \u2014 is one of the least competitive contests in the nation. This is a Democratic state, and polls show Mr. Newsom with a substantial lead.But the fact that there is little suspense about the outcome does not mean this is not an important contest that deserves examination. Jerry Brown, who has been governor for eight years, is stepping down just at a moment when California is facing challenges that would test the most experienced chief executive.On one hand, the California economy is roaring along. It is the fifth largest in the world, making it a driving force in the national economy. Unemployment is at a record low. It has the most billionaires in the country. When Mr. Brown took office, he faced a $26 billion deficit; the state now has a surplus of close to $16 billion.But most economists \u2014 as well as Mr. Brown and Mr. Newsom \u2014 warn a recession is in the state\u2019s near future. (Mr. Cox told us he does not hold this view.) And economic downturns in California are notoriously damaging because of the state\u2019s reliance on high-income taxpayers for revenue. A recession would force the next governor and Legislature to consider deep cuts in spending.And the next governor is going to face big financial demands as well \u2014 starting with a housing and homelessness crisis. The affordable housing shortage threatens to cause a labor shortage, because workers cannot find homes near their jobs. Policies embraced by President Trump \u2014 including tariffs on Chinese goods and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants \u2014 could be harmful to this state\u2019s economy, with the nation\u2019s two largest ports and a sprawling network of farms reliant on immigrant workers.Sorry for the gloom and doom, but it seemed a topic better explored before Election Day than after.Have you seen an 800-pound hammer? Because the police in Healdsburg are trying to find one.It disappeared from the city\u2019s community center lawn over the weekend, Officer Darryl Erkel said Wednesday. At first, he said the authorities wondered if it was a prank. But the 21-foot-long piece of art \u201cjust hasn\u2019t shown up,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe have no leads.\u201dThe artist who created the piece, Doug Unkrey, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to its recovery, a city spokeswoman said.All of which leads to another question: Why does someone even want an 800-pound hammer this badly?\u201cWhere are you going to put it?\u201d Mr. Unkrey asked in an interview with The Press Democrat.Added Officer Erkel on Wednesday: \u201cI highly doubt it\u2019s in someone\u2019s personal art exhibit.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Can\u2019t Escape the Business of War", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany in the tech industry don\u2019t want to be part of the military-industrial complex. But defense work is already part of Silicon Valley\u2019s DNA.Ms. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the origins of Silicon Valley.It may not be a popular position, but Mr. Bezos\u2019s comments reveal an important truth: The Pentagon has been part of the Silicon Valley story all along. Defense contracts during and after World War II turned Silicon Valley from a somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet. The American tech economy rests on the foundations of the military-industrial complex. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment.The result is an enduring technological optimism. Early Silicon Valley didn\u2019t have a J. Robert Oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation. Instead, it had an ebullient regional booster, Fred Terman, an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn Stanford from a middling school with a good football team into an engineering powerhouse.Big defense certainly made its mark. The region\u2019s biggest employer from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War was Lockheed. Local start-ups of the time also benefited, and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds, not necessarily military ones. Take, for example, David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. An outspoken critic of government overreach, Packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things. \u201cI think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money,\u201d he once told HP executives. \u201cWhile this is an important result of a company\u2019s existence, we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being.\u201dThe next generation of Silicon Valley technologists took these sentiments further. They grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money; their first encounters with computers were often in government-funded university labs. Yet by the time they graduated from college in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of them wanted nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. So they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life. They stayed in academia, moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer-education centers and community message boards.Then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture, part cowboy. \u201cThe personal computer operator is the Electronic Man on Horseback riding into the (sinking) Western sun,\u201d declared a columnist in the newsletter InfoWorld in 1980. \u201cHe is the last of the rugged individualists, and the personal computer is his only effective weapon.\u201dWhether their employees realize it or not, today\u2019s tech giants all contain some defense-industry DNA. The result is the conflicted identity we now see in Silicon Valley. Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New American Dream Home Is One You Never Have to Leave", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "OpinionForget the game room and formal dining. You need space for aging parents and Airbnb guests.Supported byMs. Jackson is a real estate journalist. In the southwest corner of Elk Grove, Calif., about 15 miles outside of Sacramento, there\u2019s a shell of a shopping center that was partially built during the peak of the real estate bubble, then abandoned when the market crashed. Locals have taken to calling it the Ghost Mall. Look in one direction from the Ghost Mall and you\u2019ll see farmland. Turn the other way and you\u2019ll see what looks like a brand-new town being built from scratch.From a distance, the whole thing looks just like the kind of master-planned suburban community that went up along the outermost edges of cities all over America in the early 2000s, before the housing bubble burst. And in many ways, it is. But the American dream of homeownership has changed in the last decade \u2014 and so has the American dream home. A decade ago, a dream home was designed to wow your friends and neighbors. Today, it\u2019s designed to house your relatives. Or your Airbnb guests. And also be your workplace. Homebuilders say one of the biggest selling points in 2018 isn\u2019t a three-car garage or a grand entryway \u2014 it\u2019s a home with flexibility.Now, even as many housing markets have roared back from the bust to boom again, the American dream home is one you never have to leave.With big open rooms, stylish furniture and a walk-in closet off the master bedroom strategically staged with just a handful of purple and gray garments neatly draped on hangers, I knew I was in a nice house \u2014 maybe even someone\u2019s dream house. But the dream was tempered. The sales pitch seemed to take into account a new economic reality.The new emphasis on home flexibility means some once-standard rooms are disappearing. Most of the model homes I toured that day in Elk Grove did not have formal living rooms or dining rooms, floor-plan staples in new homes for at least a hundred years. That\u2019s not unusual. Lennar and other homebuilders say their most popular models today have \u201cgreat rooms\u201d that combine both, often with smaller total square footage.\u201cAs homes became smaller, rooms need to serve multiple purposes,\u201d said Kermit Baker, the American Institute of Architects\u2019 chief economist. The trade organization started its quarterly home design trends survey in 2005, around the peak of the previous boom, with heavy emphasis on specialized areas like game rooms, wine cellars and media rooms, Mr. Baker said. \u201cThose have largely given way to multipurpose spaces.\u201dIn the 1980s and \u201990s, home sizes swelled and the McMansion \u2014 mass-produced and developer-designed architectural abominations \u2014 cropped up everywhere. I asked Jon Jaffe, the president and chief operating officer of Lennar, what the biggest selling point was in the 2000s, just before the recession. \u201cIt was just bigger is better,\u201d he said.The empty or half-built McMansion ultimately became a symbol of that burst bubble, and the shaky mortgages that dragged the whole country down. You could see remnants of the bigger-is-better ethos down the road from another new Lennar community I toured in Elk Grove. Driving along the winding, suburban streets, I came across an older development, built during the previous boom by a different developer. The trees were taller, and the homes looked lived in, with American flags hanging near front doors and basketball hoops in the streets. Most of the decade-old homes felt a bit grander \u2014 some had little turrets and wrought-iron balconies. Others had three-car garages, front and center. The newer homes had less ornate exteriors and typically two-car garages.There was a for-sale sign in front of one of the older homes, a 3,200-square-foot, five-bedroom on a cul-de-sac that was built in 2004. With a quick property-records search, I found out that shortly after it was built, it sold for $457,000. Nine months later, it sold again for $573,000. In 2010, it went for just $285,000. This month it sold for $535,000.When the housing bubble burst a decade ago, property values dropped by as much as 60 percent in some areas. Millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. Nationally, the median price of existing homes today is $269,600 \u2014 up 44 percent in the past six years. Many buyers are still recovering from the whiplash of the home-value roller coaster ride. In many parts of the country, the market\u2019s recovery has been so swift that prices have risen much faster than wages, up just 12 percent to 15 percent in the same period. It\u2019s harder to get back into the market if you don\u2019t already own a home. If you can buy something, your priority might be finding a home you\u2019ll never have to leave, even if your property values or personal fortunes fluctuate.\u201cOur customer, which is a home buyer, is feeling more and more frustrated and bewildered in the last decade,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage that has more than 1,000 agents.The assumption that homeownership is a sure path to building wealth feels shaky. For those who can even consider it, buying a home is often an anxiety-filled decision. How do you purchase a house you can hold onto if the bottom falls out again? Like the generation that came of age during the Depression and penny-pinched even when they were well-off later in life, buyers in their 20s and 30s today entered adulthood with the imprint of financial trauma. They know they need a backup plan.\u201cYou have the aging baby boomer,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of young adults coming home, out of college. They can\u2019t get a job. They\u2019re back living with Mom and Dad.\u201dJill Hill, a 37-year-old in Fort Worth, purchased a $349,000 home with a Next Gen suite in it about a year ago. She lives in the main house with her husband and two children, and her father lives in the attached unit. They reasoned it was less expensive to have everyone under one roof than to pay for a separate rental place for her father, who has health problems. Ms. Hill, who watched friends lose homes during the downturn a decade ago, said she was cautious about the type of loan she and her husband took to buy the home and looked for a home they could stay in for a while. \u201cI believe this is our forever home,\u201d she said. \u201cIf when my children get older and they aren\u2019t ready yet to move out, they could move into that place.\u201dThere are now dozens of new start-ups, like Avava Dwellings and Cover, that add similar units to existing homes, building them in backyards or converting garages. The New Home Company, a California-based developer, said floor plans with secondary master suites, casitas and accessory dwelling units address the multigenerational living trend and have grown in popularity over the past five years.\u201cToday, the conversations are about, \u2018I really want to buy a home that\u2019s going to last me 10 or 20 years,\u2019\u201d said Joan Marcus Webb, the chief marketing officer for the New Home Company. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer, \u2018I want to move after five years.\u2019\u201dIf the baby boomer\u2019s dream house was a multi-turreted McMansion with a formal living room, dining room and three-car garage, the millennial\u2019s might be a just-big-enough cottage-style bungalow with a home office, a rental unit and a carport that doubles as an outdoor living room.Ms. Marcus Webb said the New Home Company recently had architects draw up plans for a new home design that includes just that: a flexible, L-shaped outdoor living area that could be a living room, a carport or a place to park an Airstream. \u201cIt could either be a girl cave or your guest room,\u201d she said. \u201cOr a place for your parents.\u201dCandace Jackson is a California-based freelance journalist who covered real estate for The Wall Street Journal for seven years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Accuses Russians of Interfering in Midterm Elections", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe woman, Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, managed a multimillion-dollar budget for the effort to \u201csow division and discord\u201d in the American political system, according to a criminal complaint. She bought internet domain names and Facebook and Instagram ads and spent money on building out Twitter accounts and paying to promote divisive posts on social media.As in 2016 \u2014 when American intelligence agencies assessed that Russia was trying to bolster the campaign of Donald J. Trump \u2014 the conspirators seized on divisions in American politics, prosecutors said in describing a yearslong effort called Project Lakhta. This year, the trolls wrote posts touching on immigration, guns, race relations, women and even the debate over the protests by National Football League players during the national anthem. Since April 2014, prosecutors said, Ms. Khusyaynova acted as the chief accountant for the project.But this time, prosecutors said the operatives appeared beholden to no particular candidate. Russia\u2019s trolls did not limit themselves to either a liberal or conservative position, according to the complaint. They often wrote from diverging viewpoints on the same issue.\u201cThe conspiracy has a strategic goal, which continues to this day, to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d David Holt, an F.B.I. special agent, wrote in an affidavit.Prosecutors in Virginia, not Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, charged Ms. Khusyaynova of conspiring to defraud the United States. But those accusations appear to build on the special counsel\u2019s earlier indictment, which also identified companies controlled by Mr. Prigozhin that were named again in the new complaint.One of the companies, Concord Management and Consulting, has fought the special counsel\u2019s charges in court, demanding that the government demonstrate it willfully violated the law. Friday\u2019s criminal complaint, with its detailed descriptions of the conspiracy continuing for months after February\u2019s indictment, appears to do just that.Earlier Russian influence campaigns stood out for their clumsiness \u2014 Facebook posts from the Internet Research Agency, another arm of Project Lakhta that conducted Russia\u2019s social media disruption campaign in 2016, often contained broken English and off-topic cultural references.Operatives were instructed to attack Republicans who failed to sufficiently champion the construction of the border wall that Mr. Trump has sought; to stress the need for strict voter identification laws, especially in \u201cblue states\u201d; and to highlight \u201cscandals that took place when Mueller headed the F.B.I.\u201d in an attempt to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Acknowledging the time difference between Russia and the United States, one conspirator advised the others to post in the morning to attract liberal audiences during the American evening \u2014 \u201cL.G.B.T. groups are often active at night,\u201d the operative wrote \u2014 and to seek out conservatives awake in the morning by posting just before they left work for the day.They also developed strategies for blending in to partisan American audiences. \u201cIf you write posts in a liberal group \u2026 you must not use Breitbart titles,\u201d read one message sent to the Russian group, referring to the conservative American news site. \u201cOn the contrary, if you write posts in a conservative group, do not use Washington Post or BuzzFeed\u2019s titles.\u201dThe group also gave suggestions, some of them racist, for reaching specific affinity groups. One member suggested keeping posts simple when they were aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups of color, writing that \u201ccolored L.G.B.T. are less sophisticated than white; therefore, complicated phrases and messages do not work.\u201dFraming suggestions often accompanied news stories shared by the group\u2019s members, according to the complaint. One story, originally posted by the conservative news site World Net Daily, was titled \u201cThe 8 Dirtiest Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About.\u201d When instructing a group member to share the story on social media, an unnamed member of the Russian group urged colleagues to \u201cemphasize that the work of this commission is damaging to the country and is aimed to declare impeachment of Trump,\u201d according to the complaint.Much of the social media content included in the complaint was fairly standard fodder for partisan Facebook pages. In 2017, a fake Facebook account called Bertha Malone was used by the Russians to post an image falsely claiming that former President Obama had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. More than one million people saw the account, according to the complaint.Another 2017 post, by a fake account called Rachell Edison, was used to post an image about the National Rifle Association. The text accompanying the image read \u201cI think next 4 years will be great for all Americans, and for gun lovers especially!\u201dAny effect on the midterm elections is all but impossible to calculate. The disruption effort that prosecutors described went beyond the United States, targeting elections and referendums in Ukraine and the European Union.Ms. Khusyaynova was fastidious, keeping detailed records of expenses for a budget that totaled more than $35 million from January 2016 to June 2018. Between January and June 2018 alone, prosecutors said, the project\u2019s proposed operating budget totaled more than $10 million.She routinely requested funds from Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s companies. In one instance, she asked for 15 million rubles, or about $230,000, on Feb. 16, coincidentally the same day that Mr. Prigozhin and the other Russians were indicted.Ms. Khusyaynova\u2019s responsibilities also included more mundane tasks like paying salaries and renting office space.Prosecutors said that the Russians tried to hide what they were doing, disguising payments as software support and development from entities controlled by Mr. Prigozhin. Affiliates of his companies used 14 bank accounts to finance Project Lakhta.Friday\u2019s announcement was the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to inform Americans of any foreign election meddling. The Justice Department had little reason otherwise to unseal the complaint; Ms. Khusyaynova lives in Russia, which does not have to extradite its citizens to the United States. Typically, the F.B.I. and Justice Department would keep the charges quiet and hope Ms. Khusyaynova might travel to a country where she could be detained.\u201cExposing schemes to the public is an important way to neutralize them,\u201d the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, said in July. \u201cThe American people have a right to know if foreign governments are targeting them with propaganda.\u201dMr. Trump, who has been widely criticized for his reluctance to acknowledge and occasional outright dismissals of Moscow\u2019s interference on his behalf, stressed on Friday that his administration had sought to protect elections, accusing the Obama administration of keeping quiet about the issue in 2016.\u201cIt had nothing to do with my campaign,\u201d he told reporters while traveling in Arizona.United States intelligence agencies said separately on Friday that they believed foreign interference continued to be a threat to American democracy.\u201cWe are concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies,\u201d said a statement from the director of national intelligence, the Homeland Security Department, the F.B.I. and other agencies.Julian E.

Cut Medicare and Social Security!Opinion ColumnistThe point is that we\u2019re now in a political campaign where one side\u2019s claimed position on every major policy issue is the opposite of its true position. Republicans have concluded that they can\u2019t win an argument on the issues, but rather than changing their policies, they\u2019re squirting out clouds of ink and hoping voters won\u2019t figure out where they really stand.Why do they think they can get away with this? The main answer is obviously contempt for their own supporters, many of whom get their news from Fox and other propaganda outlets that slavishly follow the party line. And even in appeals to those supporters who rely on other sources, Republicans believe that they can neutralize the deep unpopularity of their actual policies by misrepresenting their positions, and win by playing to racism and fear.But let\u2019s be clear: G.O.P. cynicism also involves a lot of contempt for the mainstream news media. Historically, media organizations have been remarkably unwilling to call out lies; the urge to play it safe with he-said-she-said reporting has very much worked to Republicans\u2019 advantage, given the reality that the modern G.O.P. lies a lot more than Democrats do.

{"Headline": "In Literature, Who Decides When Homage Becomes Theft?", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotes on the CultureAppropriation goes both ways, and increasingly it\u2019s being seen as a creative freedom for writers who have been excluded from the literary canon.Neither was trespassing. There\u2019s long, honorable precedent for revisiting and recasting the work of fellow writers, communing and wrestling with predecessors and contemporaries alike; it\u2019s essential to art as a sustained exploration of the human condition over time. So why the imbalance in response? Perhaps, paradoxically, Moore\u2019s take on Nabokov seems more \u201cacceptable\u201d precisely because she doesn\u2019t stray too far from the original, doesn\u2019t subvert it, but simply and deftly applies a light, modern gloss with her incisive observations of domesticity and her trademark mordant wit. Her characters \u2014 white, educated, middle-class \u2014 are readily identifiable as part of Western literature, possessing their leading roles as if born to them. Shepard\u2019s are not: They\u2019re drawn from her background as the American-born daughter of a white father and a mother who was both Pakistani, with roots in a country once colonized by and subordinate to the West, and Muslim, part of a group increasingly demonized in today\u2019s political rhetoric. Shepard\u2019s approach to Gallant, and the Western literary tradition, is thus more radical. As an outsider, she is refusing to \u201cknow her place\u201d on the margins and is instead writing herself into the canon, making \u2014 taking \u2014 a space where none might otherwise be granted.IN \u201cTHE ICE WAGON Going Down the Street,\u201d Gallant\u2019s central character, Peter, is a man of pedigree from Ontario, whose surname has the chime of money and whose faith in his capacity for victory rests on his father\u2019s conviction that \u201cnothing can touch us.\u201d With his patrimony frittered away by the previous generation, however, he must take a dull clerk\u2019s job in Geneva, which he silently revolts against by \u201cstrolling to work as if his office were a pastime and his real life a secret so splendid he could share it with no one except himself.\u201d His wife, Sheilah, supports him blithely, haunting the story as a kind of vague shimmer on the sidelines. But Peter\u2019s lack of momentum is challenged by Agnes, his ambitious and prim young female office mate and a fellow expatriate Canadian, who on her first day at work hangs her framed college degree on the wall \u2014 an act of pride that, to him, betrays \u201cpush, toil, and family sacrifice\u201d and her \u201cinferior\u201d origins as a child of immigrants from Norway: \u201cHe would not have invited her to his house except to mind the children.\u201d At a party, she gets drunk, despite her religious convictions, and Peter has to escort her home, leading to an unexpected, inchoate intimacy. He has a slow-moving premonition of disaster (\u201ca railroad bridge over an abyss snapped in two and the long express train, suddenly V-shaped, floated like snow\u201d) and retreats. When they next see each other at work, Agnes reveals her disillusionment with Peter and his \u201ceducated,\u201d amoral crowd, meandering through unearned lives. Soon after, Peter and his wife leave Geneva, still convinced of their shining future, which never comes to pass.Shepard\u2019s aim in \u201cForeign-Returned\u201d is not to write over Gallant\u2019s story, as in a palimpsest, but to write alongside it; to tilt the lens to take in the people kept offstage at the time Gallant\u2019s story was set, like the Pakistani sociologists, mentioned only in passing, who supplant Peter and Sheilah as guests at their wealthy white friends\u2019 summer home, or the Muslim refugee child who appears, weeping, on their friends\u2019 Christmas card. Here the heir to Peter\u2019s melancholy abeyance is Hassan, an unaspiring analyst from Karachi. In Pakistan, he and his wife, Sara, grew up in ancestral homes and \u201chad histories that were understood by their friends, shared by their neighbors,\u201d but in Connecticut, they were \u201cinconsequential.\u201d Where Peter and Sheilah never allow themselves to doubt their own worth, Hassan and Sara perceive their diminishment and are estranged by it: She tries to fake her way up the social ladder, and he comes perilously close to publicly exposing her lies.In \u201cThe Ice Wagon,\u201d Peter\u2019s inability to anchor himself becomes a reflection of postwar malaise. \u201cForeign-Returned\u201d unfolds amid the anti-immigration fervor of the 2016 presidential election and is suffused with a more immediate sense of threat. Hina confides in Hassan that she was harassed by a white man while canvassing for voters in Pennsylvania; he\u2019s infuriated on her behalf, abruptly becoming her ally. Later, when she feels sick at a party \u2014 after some older Pakistani women badger her to take off her hijab for a matchmaking photo \u2014 he\u2019s appointed to accompany her home and ends up inside her apartment. In her anger at herself for believing in the superiority of \u201ceducated Pakistanis\u201d like those at the party (and, by extension, Hassan), Hina unpins her head scarf, unfurling her hair before him in a shocking act of intimacy. The next time they meet, she confesses that she has not spoken to her parents in five years, since they tried to marry her off and she refused. This is the grief that propels her, a grief wholly alien to Hassan, who cannot imagine such a severance: He \u201chad always been aware that he might lack the qualities essential for success in America, but it had never seemed as evident to him as it did now.\u201dShepard\u2019s story ends on a note of resignation. Hassan and Sara have returned to Pakistan, where they genially recall a sun-burnished Connecticut that never was, while Hassan tries to picture the younger siblings whom Hina left behind, wandering their American living room, \u201ccontent in their kingdom,\u201d before the Old World and its ancient demands intrude. It\u2019s a quiet, contained close to a story of unarticulated and unrealized wants. In \u201cThe Ice Wagon,\u201d Peter and Sheilah have likewise returned to their home country, none the better for their travels but heroically oblivious to their defeat. Only in the final moments do we get a glimpse of Peter\u2019s isolation, as he swerves into a vision of solitude at once serene and terrifying, of waking up early in the morning and running out, alone, to meet the ice wagon coming down the street \u2014 a vision borrowed from Agnes (as Shepard, decades later, will borrow from Gallant): \u201cHe has taken the morning that belongs to Agnes, he is up before the others, and he knows everything. There is nothing he doesn\u2019t know.\u201dInevitably, the backlash against each work of art was followed by a backlash against the backlash, and rumblings about censorship. But those fighting most fervently for and against cultural policing missed the central point. Lepage\u2019s productions drew ire for bypassing black and indigenous peoples \u2014 their ostensible subjects \u2014 in favor of nearly all-white casts, and Carlson-Wee\u2019s poem was a well-meaning but na\u00efve portrait of homelessness that reinforced rather than interrogated stereotypes. The issue isn\u2019t the right of artists to imaginatively enter other lives. What\u2019s being questioned is the concentration of cultural capital, and how members of the dominant class, who tend to receive more resources and broader access to the public, are rewarded for telling \u201cdifficult\u201d stories \u2014 like those dealing with the subjugation and suffering of minorities and the poor \u2014 even when they misrepresent the people they\u2019re claiming to speak for. Often theirs are the loudest, if not the only voices heard on the subject. No one should proscribe artists from trying to transcend the limits of their experience; the joy of art and literature has always been how they free us from those limits. The answer is not to have fewer stories, but more.\u201cTo steal a book is not a theft,\u201d pleads a drunk, starving scholar in the Chinese writer Lu Xun\u2019s 1919 short story \u201cKong Yiji.\u201d The sad-sack character, having failed the official state exam, has no means of making a living, so he swipes books and sells them in order to buy wine. His defense hinges on a shift between two distinct words for \u201csteal,\u201d one elevated, one vernacular; accordingly, the phrase is sometimes more aphoristically translated as \u201cto steal a book is an elegant offense,\u201d in which form it has been misapprehended by the West as ancient Confucian wisdom. The original joke is that the difference is entirely semantic: Theft is no longer theft if you use a more beautiful word. But is it a joke? Writing, after all, is about choosing one word over another. \u201cPurloin,\u201d \u201cburgle,\u201d \u201cfilch,\u201d \u201csteal\u201d: Pick one and the dominoes fall, affecting every word that follows. Somewhere a butterfly flaps its wings. The story changes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Economic Anxiety Didn\u2019t Elect Trump and It May Hurt His Party in the Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is less popular than overall growth would predict.Mr. Griffin and Mr. Sides just completed a study of economic distress levels and voting patterns. The 2016 election is almost two years behind us, but arguments over why Donald Trump won haven\u2019t stopped. Because Mr. Trump drew support from white voters with less formal education \u2014 the \u201cwhite working class\u201d \u2014 many attributed his victory to Americans\u2019 economic anxiety.But this narrative has obscured the true nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition. On the whole, Trump voters were never extraordinarily economically distressed. And now the economically distressed are actually less likely to approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance as president.Traditional ways of measuring people\u2019s views of the economy often suffer from partisan bias: People are more likely to say that the economy is doing better when their party controls the White House. For example, immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and well before he could do anything to affect the economy, the percentage of Republicans who said the economy was getting better increased from 15 percent in October 2016 to 80 percent in February 2017, according to Gallup polls. Over the same time period, Democrats became less favorable about the economy.The results showed that minorities of Americans reported an acute economic struggle in the previous year. Eight percent said they or their spouse had lost a job. The percentage who had difficulty making a payment for their mortgage or other major expenses ranged between 7 and 14 percent.A larger fraction expressed concern about their economic situation. About one in five were somewhat or very dissatisfied with their income and 25 percent reported a drop in their income in the previous year. Savings were a real concern: 33 percent said that they did not have any savings and 40 percent were dissatisfied with their savings. Nearly half (47 percent) said that they were not very or not at all financially prepared for the unexpected.Who was especially likely to report economic distress? To answer this, we combined these 14 questions into an overall index that ranges from 0-100, where 100 indicates the most distress. The average in this survey was 29. Among the white working class voters that featured in so much election commentary, the average was also 29, which suggested more distress than whites with a college degree, who averaged 23.But focusing on the white working class obscures the true contours of economic distress. In reality, it is people of color who report the most distress \u2014 a fact that is not surprising but stands out clearly in the new data. Hispanic-Americans without a college degree averaged 37 on this index and African-Americans without a college degree averaged 32. In fact, African-Americans with a college degree reported slightly more distress (30, on average) than whites without a college degree.This pattern was evident at every income level. Nonwhites with the same household income as whites still reported more economic distress. This was true even when comparing nonwhites with college degrees to whites without college degrees.What about Trump voters overall? They actually reported less economic distress than those who voted for Hillary Clinton \u2014 and again this was true at every income level. Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, those who voted for him in the primary, reported less distress than did the primary supporters of either Mrs. Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Similarly, the much-discussed \u201cObama-Trump voter\u201d did not report distinctively high levels of economic distress.If anything, economic distress is now a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s support. Republicans who reported high levels of distress were 10 percentage points less likely to approve of Mr. Trump, compared with those with low levels of distress. Among independents, economic distress was associated with a steeper 17-point drop in approval. In other words, economic distress is doing what it typically does in American politics: serve as a referendum on the incumbent president.This matters a great deal for the upcoming midterm election: whether Americans vote for congressional candidates in the president\u2019s party depends on the president\u2019s popularity. So the economically distressed Americans who disapprove of Mr. Trump could very well punish his party in November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now for Rent: Email Addresses and Phone Numbers for Millions of Trump Supporters", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, consultants close to the Trump campaign are ramping up efforts to put that database \u2014 by far the most sought-after in Republican politics \u2014 to use, offering it for rent to candidates, conservative groups and even businesses.It is an arrangement that has the potential to help the Republican Party in key midterm races, while providing a source of revenue for President Trump\u2019s campaign and the consultants involved.It has also set off concerns about diluting the power of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most potent political assets, while raising questions about whether his team is facilitating the sort of political profiteering that he disparaged during his campaign.It is not unusual for candidates to rent supporter data to \u2014 or from \u2014 other campaigns. The new effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s team, however, appears to be the first time the campaign of a sitting president facing re-election has opted to market its list.Federal election law allows campaigns and political action committees to sell or rent their lists, provided that the payments received are fair market value.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, which is not known for its adherence to political norms, quietly signed a contract with a newly formed Virginia-based company called Excelsior Strategies to market the emails and cellphone numbers \u2014 what is known in the political industry as first-party data.Excelsior is offering the chance to email Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters at a rate of $35 per 1,000 addresses \u2014 or more if the renter also wants to push posts into the Facebook timelines of supporters \u2014 according to interviews and marketing emails obtained by The New York Times. The firm has also explored the possibility of clients\u2019 being able to send text messages directly to the phones of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, according to the marketing emails and interviews.Those contacts could be of tremendous benefit to Republican candidates or political groups around the country seeking to capitalize on their base\u2019s enthusiasm for the president.\u201cRepublicans have suffered from being behind in small-dollar fund-raising, and the president, over the course of the campaign and his presidency, has built the largest Republican first-party data list,\u201d said Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale, who engineered the agreement. \u201cSo giving other candidates and groups access to that data through a legal means to rent it was one of the best things I could do for the Republican ecosystem. And the campaign makes a little money, too. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201dSo far, parts of the list have been rented to a number of Republican candidates \u2014 including the gubernatorial campaign of Ron DeSantis in Florida and the Senate campaign of Josh Hawley in Missouri \u2014 as well as nonprofit groups advocating the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and even to an author promoting a pro-Trump book, according to people familiar with the arrangement.The Trump campaign maintains ownership of the list as well as veto authority over all rentals, according to interviews and the marketing emails. One such email indicates that \u201cas long as the political group, org, nonprofit or business is not hostile to the president, then they are most likely able to use the data with no problem.\u201dIt is not clear whether the president, who is known to abhor the prospect of others\u2019 profiting from their affiliations with him, is aware of the details of the arrangement.The people familiar with the arrangement said that the rentals so far had been sparing, but that the volume began increasing in recent weeks as key midterm races began heating up.It is unclear how much the arrangement has yielded for Excelsior, Campaign Inbox or the Trump campaign to date. That is partly because such transactions may not be completely traceable through campaign finance filings and partly because the filings on record mostly only cover expenditures through the end of June \u2014 before the arrangement was completed.The arrangement replaces an earlier one that had relied on companies owned by Mr. Parscale, a close confidant of the Trump family who had played a key role in building the list as the digital director of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. During that campaign, his company, Giles-Parscale, was by far the biggest vendor, receiving nearly $88 million in payments, though most of the money was probably passed through to Facebook and other platforms for ads.In the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, another company owned by Mr. Parscale began quietly renting out the list to a few campaigns, though people who work with the Trump campaign said that he did little to solicit such rentals.He approached Mike Shields, a veteran political consultant who had helped found his own company, Convergence Media, after the election. Mr. Shields recommended a top executive at Convergence, Tom Newhouse, who had worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee.One employee of Excelsior and Convergence wrote to Republican consultants last month that \u201cConvergence Media recently started a partnership with the Trump campaign to be the exclusive broker of all of their campaign data, including their donor data.\u201d The data, the employee said, \u201cis currently available to be used for email and Facebook advertising,\u201d adding that text messaging and online advertising should be available soon.Within the new initiative, there has been some confusion about the precise roles and relationships of the companies involved. Rob Simms, who helped found Convergence with Mr. Shields said, \u201cConvergence Media is not a vendor to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.\u201dMr. Parscale praised both the Convergence team and Mr. Newhouse as responsible stewards of the Trump campaign\u2019s data.\u201cThis first-party data is very sensitive and valuable, and you don\u2019t want to have a lot of people in it,\u201d he said. \u201cTom has an outstanding reputation, and I trust him. There are a lot of bad actors in town and I don\u2019t think he is one of them.\u201dStill, there are practical reasons to avoid widespread rentals of the Trump campaign list, warned Cyrus Krohn, who helped build the Republican National Committee\u2019s list into a digital force as the committee\u2019s digital director during the 2008 election cycle.\u201cWe\u2019ve already become so inundated with an influx of political messaging that I would be concerned about oversaturating supporters with emails,\u201d said Mr. Krohn, who left Washington and now runs a technology start-up in Seattle. \u201cThe response rates are going to degrade and the performance is going to wane.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A president with even a pretense to statesmanship would have canceled it \u2014 the country was in the middle of what can reasonably be described as a terrorist attack, with someone attempting mass murder against leading Democrats. Trump, needless to say, is not such a president.At the rally \u2014 which featured Trump fans chanting, \u201cLock her up!\u201d about Hillary Clinton, to whom one of the bombs was addressed \u2014 Trump called for the country to come together \u201cin peace and harmony.\u201d Then, in characteristic fashion, he blamed the press for America\u2019s climate of simmering rage. \u201cThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories,\u201d he said.It was an audacious act of misdirection, especially since the attack included a bomb sent to the New York offices of CNN, one of Trump\u2019s favorite punching bags. But while Trump\u2019s words were meant to further derange American political debate, they were, in one sense, clarifying. They demonstrated the rank disingenuousness of conservative complaints about \u201cincivility,\u201d a term that\u2019s increasingly used to conflate expressions of political anger with political violence, equating yelling at politicians with trying to kill them.These acts should be condemned unreservedly. But there is no serious comparison between left-wing and right-wing violence in this country, either in the scale of the phenomenon or the degree to which it is encouraged by political leaders.McInnes, conversely, was, until last year, a contributor to Fox News, the propaganda arm of the Republican Party. He now has a show on CRTV, a right-wing online video network whose contributors include Michelle Malkin and the former Fox News host Eric Bolling.Trump describes journalists as the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201d When someone sent bombs to leading figures in the Democratic opposition, he blamed the media for covering him too aggressively. We don\u2019t know who is behind these bombs, but we do know that Trump can\u2019t even fake concern for their intended targets.The dubious category of \u201ccivility\u201d lets people on the right pretend that mailing a politician a bomb is in the same vein as berating a politician in a restaurant. It\u2019s a sort of right-wing political correctness, treating rudeness toward powerful people as akin to assault.In June, the actor Robert De Niro cursed at Trump during a speech at the Tony Awards. On Thursday, news broke that De Niro was among those who were sent explosive devices. Only one of these things is a problem. We are in a dark place in this country. The blame belongs with Trump, not those shouting their opposition to him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breakthrough Leukemia Treatment Backfires in a Rare Case", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA highly unusual death has exposed a weak spot in a groundbreaking cancer treatment: One rogue cell, genetically altered by the therapy, can spiral out of control in a patient and cause a fatal relapse.The treatment, a form of immunotherapy, genetically engineers a patient\u2019s own white blood cells to fight cancer. Sometimes described as a \u201cliving drug,\u201d it has brought lasting remissions to leukemia patients who were on the brink of death. Among them is Emily Whitehead, the first child to receive the treatment, in 2012 when she was 6.The treatment does not always work, and side effects can be dangerous, even life-threatening. Doctors have learned to manage them. But in one patient, the therapy seems to have backfired in a previously unknown way.He was 20, with an aggressive type of leukemia. The treatment altered not just his cancer-fighting cells, but also \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 the genes of one leukemia cell. The genetic change made that cell invisible to the ones that had been programmed to seek and destroy cancer.At first, the patient had a complete remission. But at the same time, that single enemy cell was multiplying uncontrollably, into billions of leukemia cells that caused a relapse nine months later and ultimately killed him.His cells were engineered at the University of Pennsylvania, where the treatment, called CAR-T therapy, was developed in collaboration with Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and the drug company Novartis. The treatment was experimental, and he was part of a study.Researchers say that the case was a rare event, never seen before, and that there is no evidence of this problem in cells engineered by Novartis, other drug companies or other research centers.The patient who died had B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that had relapsed several times after standard treatments, and was being treated at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.The university declined to say when he was treated, to protect patient privacy. But the study he joined enrolled patients from August 2011 until September 2016.Once he relapsed after the CAR-T treatment, tests on his blood indicated that all of his leukemia cells carried genetic changes from the treatment, and all the cells had identical traits indicating that they originated from the same cell. The finding stunned university researchers, who said that of hundreds of patients who have received the therapy, the case was the only one known in which a leukemia cell was transformed and caused a lethal relapse.\u201cIt is exceptionally rare,\u201d said Dr. Marco Ruella, an assistant professor at the university\u2019s medical school, and the lead author of the journal report. He emphasized that the treatment is still the best option, and most likely the only one, for many patients when other therapies fail.\u201cBut it warrants close monitoring of patients, and improvement of the manufacturing process,\u201d Dr. Ruella said. He also said the findings underlined the importance of studying every patient who relapses after the treatment, to find out why.The treatment requires removing white blood cells from the patient to obtain T-cells, which are the fighting forces of the immune system. The T-cells are then exposed to a virus that carries new genetic material into them, enabling them to recognize and kill cancer cells. Next, the turbocharged cells are dripped back into the patient.In the process, some leukemia cells are also captured along with the T-cells, Dr. Ruella said. But they generally die on their own, or are killed off by the reprogrammed T-cells, he said, adding that the researchers do not know why one malignant cell was transformed and survived in the patient who died.But he said the university would work on ways to make sure malignant cells were purged from its engineered T-cells.The University of Pennsylvania licensed its research to Novartis, which received approval for the treatment from the Food and Drug Administration in August 2017. The therapy, marketed as Kymriah, was a major milestone, the first gene-altering treatment for cancer. The treatment costs $475,000.A spokeswoman for Novartis, Julie Masow, said in an email that the cells used to treat the patient who died were made at the University of Pennsylvania, not by Novartis, and that Novartis uses a different manufacturing process.The company issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are not aware of any cases of this happening in the more than 400 patients treated with Kymriah.\u201dThe statement also said that Novartis had various processes in place to eliminate leukemia cells from its product, and that it had created a registry to monitor Kymriah patients for 15 years after treatment.Advertisement"}

Mr. Khashoggi has not been seen since he entered the consulate on Oct. 2.One of the men on the list published by the newspaper, Sabah, is an autopsy expert at Saudi Arabia\u2019s internal security agency, according to the two Turkish officials. Another appears to be a lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force. The officials, citing confidential intelligence, said all worked for the Saudi government.Turkish officials have said that Mr. Khashoggi was killed at the consulate and that his dismembered body was taken away \u2014 an allegation the Saudi government has vehemently denied. Mr. Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi commentator, United States resident and Washington Post columnist, had become a prominent critic of the kingdom\u2019s rulers.Saudi leaders, including Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself, have said that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, shortly after he entered, and that they have no knowledge of his fate.Turkish officials have cited confidential intelligence to support their contention that Mr. Khashoggi is dead, but have declined to disclose that evidence.In recent days, anonymous Turkish officials have leaked a steady stream of details about the alleged killing. They say they believe the operation was ordered by the highest levels of the Saudi court in part because of its scale and complexity.The leak of the list of 15 Saudis appears to be part of a Turkish government campaign intended to put pressure on the Saudi government to admit that Mr. Khashoggi was killed, and to spur wider international outrage.The Times found corroborating information about two of the men \u2014 the lieutenant and the autopsy expert \u2014 by comparing the names and photographs in Sabah, the newspaper, with social media profiles and Saudi media reports.By leaking the names of the individual Saudis, Turkish officials added to an increasingly detailed, if still incomplete, account of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi.Earlier leaks included information about the flights that carried the 15 men in and out of Istanbul. There were also reports about an unexpected day off granted to consulate employees the day that Mr. Khashoggi went to the consulate. And there was security camera footage of Mr. Khashoggi entering the consulate.The Saudis have yet to produce video footage or other evidence supporting their contention that Mr. Khashoggi left the building.Turkish officials have said, without offering evidence, that Mr. Khashoggi was killed within two hours of entering the consulate and dismembered with a bone saw brought for that purpose.Although the Turkish allegations about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing have so far relied largely on confidential intelligence, Western intelligence agencies have generally regarded their Turkish counterparts as reliable on domestic matters.\u201cThe Turkish services are extremely capable, especially with regards to internal threats or incidents,\u201d said Thad Troy, a senior executive of the business intelligence firm the Crumpton Group and a former senior C.I.A. officer with experience in Turkey.\u201cThe Saudis would have been extremely na\u00efve to believe they could get away with this,\u201d he said, noting that the intelligence services of both countries had previously had \u201cclose relations.\u201dOn Tuesday, Saudi officials began to contact their Turkish counterparts for secret talks about resolving the matter. The Saudis have told Washington that they believe they can smooth over the issue, according to both Turkish and American officials briefed on the discussions.Turkish officials have said that they, too, hope to avoid a confrontation with Saudi Arabia, another major regional power.But the leaks of the names and other information might make it harder for both sides to save face \u2014 for example, through a compromise in which the Saudis would acknowledge the killing of Mr. Khashoggi but blame it on rogue actors.If the 15 men indeed killed Mr. Khashoggi on the orders of the Saudi royal court, as Turkish officials have charged, the ease with which they appear to have been identified suggests that they did little to cover their tracks. And that suggests that either they were careless or they wanted their actions to be discovered \u2014 perhaps to intimidate others.Another Saudi identified in Sabah, Meshal Saad al-Bostani, appears to be a Saudi Air Force lieutenant who was born in 1987. A photograph of a man at the airport appears to match photos on the Facebook profile of a man with the same name who says he studied at the University of Louisville.It was unclear what immediate impact the disclosures might have on the unfolding discussions between Saudi Arabia, Turkey and possibly Washington over resolutions to the dispute.Saudi officials have said that they are willing to open the consulate in Istanbul to police inspection. The Turkish authorities were reportedly prepared to bring in forensic teams to scour for clues.More than a week after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, however, Turkish officials say they have little hope of obtaining significant new evidence. There were also conflicting reports on Wednesday about when the promised inspection might actually take place.An earlier version of this article included details about several Saudis named by Turkish officials in the case that had not been independently corroborated by The New York Times. The details have been removed in this version.David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Ankara, and Malachy Browne from New York. Reporting was contributed by Eric Schmitt and Christiaan Triebert from Washington; Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon; and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.Advertisement"}

It was a producer on HBO\u2019s acclaimed thriller \u201cSharp Objects\u201d this summer and the Emmy-winning documentary series \u201cThe Jinx\u201d in 2015. But it has also been behind a series of forgettable one-season flops like \u201cThe River\u201d (ABC), \u201cStranded\u201d (Syfy), \u201cEye Candy\u201d (MTV) and \u201cSouth of Hell\u201d (WE TV).The anthology series on Hulu will consist of a new television movie under the \u201cInto the Dark\u201d banner every month for the next year. In addition, there is a television adaptation of the Blumhouse franchise \u201cThe Purge\u201d on USA, and \u201cSacred Lies,\u201d a young-adult drama on Facebook Watch. Going into production next month for Showtime is an adaptation of a Roger Ailes biography starring Russell Crowe. Several other projects are in production, including unscripted series.In other words, not too many ghosts. Blumhouse executives explained that only 20 percent of the studio\u2019s television projects will be traditional horror fare. (The movie division is somewhere closer to 80 percent, Mr. Blum said.)Or, as Mr. Gold put it, \u201cit\u2019s simple sales: To only be peddling horror, that\u2019s not a great way to scale a whole studio.\u201dMs. Wiseman and Mr. Gold were speaking from the no-frills, cramped headquarters of Blumhouse in Historic Filipinotown. The pair work out of a small box of a room where a glass wall separates the roughly five feet of space between their seats. They often communicate by taping Post-it notes to the glass.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing with Blumhouse: You have all this production, but we don\u2019t have a lot of space!\u201d Ms. Wiseman said.When Mr. Blum hired Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Gold, he also decided to rip up his game plan for television. He wanted to build a studio where Blumhouse would be calling the shots.\u201cIn the movies, we\u2019re running everything. We make all the decisions,\u201d Mr. Blum said in an interview. \u201cOn the production, we\u2019re in charge 100 percent. And so I\u2019d go from that to television, where I was asking permission to brush my teeth. For everything! It was extremely frustrating.\u201dStill, Mr. Blum described building a successful independent studio as a big financial risk.\u201cIt is harder than ever to cut through the clutter,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cThe flip side to that there is more opportunity for independent players to develop content. It\u2019s harder to have massive audiences but it\u2019s also easier to find someone take a chance on quality content.\u201dOne of the first orders of business for the television unit was to discard the company\u2019s policy of shoestring budgets. The reason? Streaming services like Netflix, HBO and Amazon are more than happy to spend more on one episode of a TV series \u2014 $5 million plus \u2014 than Blumhouse does on some of its feature films.\u201cI\u2019m not saying people are saying, \u2018Please spend as much money as possible,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cBut there are just a bunch of buyers that are not price-sensitive.\u201dIf it works, they\u2019ll have continuing series on basic cable and streaming services. And they\u2019ll have glossy shows, like \u201cSharp Objects\u201d or the Ailes limited series, where, Ms. Wiseman explained, \u201cthe economics may not be as fantastic but the kind of heightened storytelling is really the goal.\u201d Essentially, to burnish the reputation of the Blumhouse brand.\u201cInto the Dark\u201d is one of the projects reminiscent of its Blumhouse film brethren. The show is cheap to make \u2014 right around $2 million per television movie \u2014 and it will be horror oriented.And if \u201cInto the Dark\u201d is not generating as much attention as \u201cThe Hill of Haunting House\u201d \u2014 neither Hulu nor Netflix discloses viewership statistics \u2014 everyone is urging patience.\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018Into the Dark\u2019 is going to work or not,\u201d Mr. Blum said. \u201cIs it good that people aren\u2019t talking about it? Of course not. I want more people to talk about it. But I don\u2019t know what metric to use.\u201dMeanwhile, the TV adaptation of \u201cThe Purge\u201d has shown solid results in the six weeks it has been on USA, averaging roughly two million viewers, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data.It is USA\u2019s biggest ratings get of the year among adults under 50, though the numbers were not big enough to crack the top-five-rated scripted cable shows in recent weeks.It\u2019s not yet known if USA will pick up another installment of what was supposed to be a limited series \u2014 establishing continuing shows is a big priority for Blumhouse \u2014 but Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Gold are happy with the show\u2019s performance.\u201c\u2018The Purge\u2019 is a favorite for a different reason,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said, \u201cbecause could we step up and play with our brothers and sisters on the feature side and say we\u2019re not going to ruin your brand.\u201dMr. Gold chimed in, \u201cOr to put it another way: It didn\u2019t feel like a good move to be the team that screwed that up for everybody!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an Unlikely Family History Website Transformed Cold Case Investigations", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFifteen murder and sexual assault cases have been solved since April with a single genealogy website. This is how GEDmatch went from a casual side project to a revolutionary tool.LAKE WORTH, FLA. \u2014 On Halloween night in 1996, a man in a skeleton mask knocked on the door of a house in Martinez, Calif., handcuffed the woman who greeted him and raped her. Two weeks later, he called the dental office where she worked. Investigators tried to track him down through phone records, but got nowhere. They obtained traces of his semen, but there was no match for his DNA in any criminal database.Last month \u2014 two decades after the crime \u2014 the Sacramento district attorney\u2019s office tried something new to finally crack the case of this serial rapist, who had attacked at least 10 women in their homes. Investigators converted the assailant\u2019s DNA to the kind of profile that family history websites such as 23andMe are built on, and uploaded it to GEDmatch.com, a free site open to all and beloved by genealogical researchers seeking to find biological relatives or to construct elaborate family trees. Within five minutes of reviewing the results, the investigators had located a close relative among the million or so profiles in the database. Within two hours, they had a suspect, who was soon arrested: Roy Charles Waller, a safety specialist at the University of California, Berkeley.And no one has been more surprised than the two creators of GEDmatch \u2014 Curtis Rogers, 80, a retired businessman who could be easily mistaken for just another low-key Florida grandpa in his white Velcro sneakers, and John Olson, 67, a transportation engineer from Texas. Their tiny outfit, which began as a side project, has unintentionally upended how investigators across the country are trying to solve the coldest of cold cases.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of been a shock to all of us how these things developed,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who was drawn to genealogical research by a search for his own family history. \u201cAll of a sudden, all this notoriety.\u201dMr. Olson agreed: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on a high-speed ride with no way to steer.\u201dInitially, Mr. Rogers was outraged at how law enforcement was using his website, but he now feels proud. \u201cWithin a year I think it will be accepted,\u201d he said. Some genealogists find that notion profoundly problematic, given the many ethical and privacy issues that have emerged as investigators have come to rely on a privately owned family history site to solve crimes.GEDmatch headquarters, in Lake Worth, Fla., is a small yellow house with turquoise shutters, a white picket fence and a palm tree in the yard. A brief tour, the first that Mr. Rogers had ever given a journalist, began with his desk, the only desk in the house. He drives there every day from his home half an hour away.Past the bathroom is a room filled with Mr. Rogers\u2019 wife\u2019s paintings and labeled boxes, evidence of his other job as a professional guardian.Some GEDmatch users are family tree completists who collect cousins the way some people collect baseball cards. Other users are retirees digging into old family mysteries. Many others are adoptees and the genealogists who help them use the site\u2019s tools to track down biological parents. More than 10,000 people likely have used the site in this manner over the past eight years, according to two genealogists who teach people how to conduct such searches.This is the case that revealed to law enforcement that it\u2019s possible to figure out just about anyone\u2019s identify through their cousins\u2019 DNA.\u201cI take off one day, I\u2019d never catch up,\u201d he said, settling his sneakers on the base of his faux-leather swivel chair.He sent a 15-step guide to a user having trouble uploading a file, one of many basic tech support emails he responds to daily. Other common questions include: does this mean my father isn\u2019t actually my father?On his desk was a short stack of $10 checks \u2014 the monthly amount Mr. Rogers charges for \u201cTier 1 membership\u201d to the site, which technically is free to use. So far, GEDmatch has 6,500 or so members, enough to cover basic expenses and pay its founders a little something. Mr. Rogers spent his early career in business, growing an international consumer base for brands such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Quaker Oats. He knows he could charge more. But that wouldn\u2019t feel right, he said, because the goal of family history research is to help people, a sentiment common among dedicated genealogists.Mr. Rogers grew up hearing that he was related to Thomas Rogers, who came over on the Mayflower in 1620. His dive into genealogy began when he decided to investigate it.Around this time, a number of genealogy companies had begun offering autosomal DNA testing, a type of genetic analysis useful for finding relatives.Mr. Rogers asked Mr. Olson whether he could do something with all the data.\u201cI think it was a challenge for him and then he kind of got hooked,\u201d said Mr. Rogers.Before long, and with no advertising, they said, their database was doubling in size every year.What convinced Mr. Rogers to keep investing in the site were \u201clove letters for GEDmatch,\u201d which were unlike any customer service notes he\u2019d seen, and \u201cpeople really like Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise.\u201dOn April 25, the Sacramento County district attorney\u2019s office announced that there had been a breakthrough in the case of the Golden State Killer.Mr. Rogers saw the news while sitting in bed watching TV.\u201cI\u2019d never even heard of the Golden State Killer before they captured this guy,\u201d he said.But when one of the newscasters mentioned \u201ca new form of DNA technology,\u201d he turned to his wife and asked, \u201cDo you suppose I was involved?\u201dIt seemed possible; around six months earlier, two companies involved in criminal investigations had asked for his blessing to use the site.The site\u2019s privacy agreement had always been vague, essentially stating that its owners had no control over how any individual\u2019s genetic or family tree data would be used. But explicitly sanctioning a law enforcement presence felt different.Mr. Rogers was furious when he confirmed that a third set of investigators, without first telling him, had involved GEDmatch in the Golden State Killer case. It seemed inevitable that the news would drive thousands of people off the site.Mr. Rogers and Mr. Olson hadn\u2019t expected such an outpouring of support. Neither did they anticipate 5,000 new uploads to the site shortly after Mr. DeAngelo\u2019s arrest \u2014 a daily record, Mr. Olson said.As praise has flowed in, both men began to relax.

Many are attaching themselves to contentious national cultural issues like illegal immigration and kneeling N.F.L. players, which tend to garner more attention online than narrower local issues. Others are giving their opponents mocking, Trump-style nicknames in hopes of standing out from the pack.It\u2019s not surprising that campaigns are engaging in name-calling two years after Mr. Trump used all-caps aggression to energize his base and help lift him to the White House.But the nature of social media platforms has turned up the temperature on such rhetoric. The algorithms powering the services often reward the reactions generated by outsize personalities by spreading their messages more widely, and can render bland wonks effectively invisible. Candidates from both parties have learned what Mr. Trump and his digital campaign gurus figured out in 2016: Visceral anger travels further online than inspirational messages, and the way to get noticed on the internet is to be loud and provocative above all.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to break through in this media environment,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former communications director for Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican whom Mr. Trump derided as \u201cLiddle Marco\u201d during the 2016 presidential primaries. \u201cOn social media, these sorts of tactics drive engagement much more than boring policy speeches do.\u201dThere is little evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s recipe for social media dominance translates well to smaller races. But many candidates are trying it anyway.\u201cAll the oxygen is in these broad, national debates,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, the creative director of Priorities USA, a progressive organization that is among the biggest liberal buyers of digital advertising. \u201cIf you want to do the Trump tactic of stealing attention, you have to talk about those things.\u201d\u201cTrump was the first candidate to run an internet-first campaign,\u201d said Gerrit Lansing, a former chief digital officer of the Republican National Committee. \u201cHowever, the vast majority of campaigns and candidates are still consulted by people who spent their careers with newspapers and the evening news, and that\u2019s just not how the world works anymore. Your political branding needs to be punchier in the internet age.\u201dMr. Kalasho\u2019s social media feeds are a mixture of bare-knuckle politics, aspirational lifestyle content and outright trolling. One recent post read, \u201cI am against fake news, fascists, and Marxists, in that order.\u201dMr. Kalasho, who is running for re-election this November, credits social media with his ability to attract attention, calling it a \u201csuperpower.\u201d He said he had been inspired by the way Mr. Trump used Twitter to shape the news cycle. And he admitted that the pressure to perform on social media had made him gravitate toward more polarizing topics.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of shallowness to social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about policy, potholes or health care and be popular.\u201dOf course, winning in politics is not about racking up likes and shares \u2014 there is also the matter of getting votes. Some candidates with large social media followings have fared worse than expected in primary elections this year, including Cynthia Nixon, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor in New York, and Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for governor in Michigan who finished well behind Gretchen Whitmer in the primary.Amanda Litman, a founder of Run for Something, a liberal organization that helps recruit progressive candidates for office, said negative nicknames and provocative campaign messages might get more attention than positive stories, but they didn\u2019t necessarily help candidates connect with voters.\u201cHow many candidates have we seen who pick up wildfire online but it doesn\u2019t translate to votes?\u201d Ms. Litman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of many ways to measure a campaign\u2019s effectiveness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Man Died After Being Infected With a Brain-Eating Amoeba. Here Are the Facts.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA New Jersey man died after being infected with Naegleria fowleri, also known as the \u201cbrain-eating amoeba,\u201d a rare infection that is contracted through the nose in fresh water.It is the first confirmed case of the infection in the United States since 2016, an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Jennifer Cope, said on Monday.The amoeba is a single-celled organism that can cause a rare infection of the brain called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM, which is usually fatal.The amoeba got its nickname because it starts to destroy brain tissue once it reaches the brain, after it is forced up there in a rush of water. Before it enters the body, it happily feasts on the bacteria found in the water.\u201cIt turns to using the brain as a food source,\u201d Dr. Cope said. \u201cIt is a scary name. It is not completely inaccurate.\u201dThe amoeba can also hide in pipes that are connected to tap water, the C.D.C. said. You cannot get infected by touching contaminated water or by swallowing it, and the infection cannot be passed from one person to another.Signs of infection include headache, nausea, vomiting and confusion \u2014 all typical for people with any type of meningitis, Dr. Cope said.Patients who are admitted to the hospital with these symptoms should tell a doctor if they have recently been in a freshwater park, pool or body of water, she said.The amoeba is not found in salt water.Most of the infections happened when swimming in warm lakes or rivers. Swimmers or divers should take steps to prevent infection, such as blocking water from entering the nose.\u201cHold your nose or use nose clips,\u201d said Dr. Tina Tan, epidemiologist for the New Jersey Department of Health. \u201cAvoid putting your head under water, such as in hot springs, and stirring up the dirt or the mud.\u201dMost of the infections occurred in Texas and Florida because they have warm climates and large populations, and water sports are popular, Dr. Cope said. Precautions should be taken for activities like diving and water skiing that have the potential to force large amounts of water into the nasal cavity.Advertisement"}

But we also need to show them love.Contributing Opinion Writer The mother sat in my office. Her daughter, my advisee, was failing three of her four classes. Perhaps, the mom suggested, a private tutor might be hired, to help her child get back on track.\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said, trying to be compassionate. But I also sneaked another look at the daughter: half asleep, clearly hung over and quite possibly high.What I wanted to say was, \u201cMy suggestion would be that your daughter actually start going to all the classes she\u2019s skipping, to maybe also start doing the homework.\u201d Instead I let the mom talk.\u201cThe thing is,\u201d she said, \u201cshe\u2019s really a good kid.\u201d And it was at this moment, I believe, that my heart broke in half \u2014 for the mom, for her child and for all of us still trying to figure out the best way to shepherd young people into adulthood.Some people would describe that mom as a \u201cbulldozer parent,\u201d engaging in a more aggressive form of what we used to call \u201chelicoptering.\u201d Others have taken to calling them \u201clawn mower parents\u201d or \u201ccurling parents,\u201d after the sport in which the path of a stone gliding on ice is smoothed by an athlete armed with a broom.This took place over 15 years ago. One day, a few weeks earlier, my young son had headed off down our driveway to wait for the school bus, carrying in one hand a book report project. It was a complex mobile, a set of counterbalanced index cards attached to one another with string, listing the title, author, characters, setting and plot of \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d As he ran down our front stairs, the thing fluttered out of his hand and fell, somehow, behind a crack between the steps and the front porch. Now the book report was trapped behind the concrete stairs, which could, of course, not be moved, at least not before the bus arrived. My son looked at me in tears as we heard the school bus approaching over the hill. \u201cGo on, catch the bus,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it.\u201dTen minutes later, I was in the front yard with a shovel, slowly digging a hole next to our foundation. Dirt rose up in a pile. Ten minutes after that, I had reached into the hole, grasped the mobile and freed it. The next thing I knew I was in the car, driving to the school, where I placed it in my son\u2019s hands in home room.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said, and felt, in that moment, like a superhero. I should be wearing a cape, I thought, an S upon my chest: Supermom.But driving home, I wondered: Was what I had just done an act of love? That\u2019s how I\u2019d meant it. I\u2019d jumped into action and solved a problem. I\u2019d done it because I didn\u2019t want a random act of fate \u2014 the book report falling behind the stone stairs \u2014 to wipe out all the work that he\u2019d done.Critics of lawn mower parents, though, would have suggested I let my son suffer the consequences of his own carelessness. Let the kid learn how to dig his own hole with a shovel! A little suffering, they\u2019d say, would be good for him.That\u2019s the undertone to a lot of this criticism: Kids today have it too easy! They don\u2019t go through what we went through, all the misery that made us tough! With their safe spaces and their trigger warnings, they\u2019ve been essentially sealed off from conflict \u2014 and learning how to respond to conflict is the most important lesson a young person can learn. They\u2019d all be better people if they cried a little more. Like we did.As the product of a repressive private school, where I was frequently taunted and on one occasion beaten on suspicion of being queer, I know there are some things I don\u2019t want my children to go through. Yes, that experience made me tough, resilient and \u2014 in an odd way \u2014 forgiving. But I would still do anything to spare my children that trauma. I would rather have them coddled than scarred. Does that make me a lawn mower parent? Is it always so wrong to stand between your child and harm?But I think we should be careful when we start romanticizing \u201ctoughness\u201d \u2014 either our children\u2019s or our own. Suffering makes us strong, to be sure. But so does love. If I had to pick just one \u2014 suffering or love \u2014 I know what I\u2019d choose.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Private Equity Is Furious Over a Paper in a Dermatology Journal", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly this month, a respected medical journal published a research paper on its website that analyzed the effects of a business trend roiling the field of dermatology: the rapid entrance of private equity firms into the specialty by buying and running practices around the country.Eight days later, after an outcry from private equity executives and dermatologists associated with private equity firms, the editor of the publication removed the paper from the site. No reason was given.Furor over the publication and subsequent removal of the article has deepened a rift in the field over what some see as the \u201ccorporatization\u201d of dermatology and other areas of medicine.[The once sleepy field of dermatology is booming these days. Read our story.]The paper was published on the website of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology on Oct. 5, posted along with numerous other articles labeled \u201cIn Press Accepted Manuscript.\u201d Most articles with this designation eventually appear in a print edition of the journal; some remain online.Dr. Dirk Elston, the journal\u2019s editor, said in an email that he replaced the article with a notice of \u201ctemporary removal\u201d after receiving multiple calls and emails \u201cexpressing concerns about the accuracy of a few parts\u201d of the article.On Wednesday, nearly two weeks after removing the article, Dr. Elston told the authors they had a choice: They could correct \u201cfactual errors\u201d or retract the paper.The authors maintain that the article does not contain any factual errors and that several of the corrections requested had to do with protecting the reputation of the specialty and the leaders of the American Academy of Dermatology, the association that publishes the journal. Later on Wednesday, they submitted some revisions.The article had gone through the standard editorial process of academic journals, undergoing multiple revisions based on feedback from peer-reviewers selected by the journal, before being accepted for publication. It presents data to support a conclusion that private equity firms acquire \u201coutlier\u201d practices \u2014 that is, practices that perform an unusually high number of well-reimbursed procedures and bill high amounts to Medicare.\u201cIt was interesting when we ran the numbers and we were counting how many practices with billing outliers were being acquired by private equity,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Francis, a dermatologist in Florida who is a co-author on the paper. \u201cWith every revision of the paper, that number kept increasing. So it didn\u2019t seem like an anomaly.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear whether these investors realized that the high billing might point to anything irregular. They might have just seen that this was a practice with booming business.\u201dThe paper also notes that many practices backed by private equity firms have opened or acquired labs to process pathology specimens, potentially another source of profit.Among those who objected to the article was Dr. George Hruza, the incoming president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Hruza, whose one-year term as president begins in March, is a dermatologist in Chesterfield, Mo. In 2016 he sold his own dermatology practice to United Skin Specialists, a firm that manages dermatology practices and is backed by private equity. He currently serves on the board of directors of United Skin Specialists, which he said is an unpaid position.Dr. Hruza is not named in the journal article, but he said he is easily identified by the authors\u2019 reference to his pending presidency of the academy, and to United Skin Specialists.In an interview, Dr. Hruza said he did not ask that the paper be taken down. He did, however, confirm that he expressed his concerns to Dr. Elston, the editor, after it was posted. Two days later, Dr. Elston removed the paper. A flurry of intense conversations ensued among Dr. Elston; Dr. Hruza; the current academy president, Dr. Suzanne Olbricht; a lawyer for the dermatology academy; and the paper\u2019s authors.Specifically, Dr. Hruza said, he objected to one of the paper\u2019s conclusions: Influential dermatology leaders are being recruited to work for and promote dermatology practices backed by private-equity firms.\u201cImplying motivation is a stretch,\u201d he said. Dr. Hruza has asked for specific wording changes to that section of the paper.Among the changes the editor of the journal asked the authors to make was the removal of identifiable references to influential dermatologists, including Dr. Hruza.Interference with a scientific paper from within the ranks of a medical society is highly unusual, say experts in the medical publishing field. The sudden disappearance of the paper has others in the medical publishing world scratching their heads.\u201cThe process of science requires that people be allowed to publish their data as long as it has been reviewed by peers who find it accurate in that moment,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Katz, president and chief executive of NYC Health & Hospitals and Deputy Editor of the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.As for corrections, Dr. Katz added, \u201cusually you would post a correct copy rather than removing a paper for days on end.\u201dDr. Elston said others who objected to the article included Dr. Darrell Rigel, a prominent dermatologist in New York who is a former president of the academy and whose practice is now owned by Schweiger Dermatology, a private equity-backed practice. Dr. Rigel did not respond to requests for comment.One of the paper\u2019s five supplemental tables lists 32 dermatology practices in the United States that have been formed or acquired by private equity firms. Many are large practices with dozens of physicians.Shortly after the article disappeared from the journal\u2019s website, a copy was posted to a Facebook group composed of some 3,500 dermatologists. Several participants in the Facebook group praised the article for shining a light on the effects of private equity on their specialty, and were outraged that the article had been withdrawn.\u201cIf this were an article on psoriasis no one would be questioning it, but this was going to ruffle some feathers,\u201d said Dr. Curtis Asbury, a dermatologist in Selbyville, Del., and an active participant in the Facebook group.The lead author of the paper was Dr. Sailesh Konda, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. Dr. Konda, 34, said he first grew interested in the topic when several of his trainees went to work for private equity-backed practices and told him of clinical environments that emphasized profits at the expense of patient care. He said that over the past year he had given 16 talks around the country to medical residents and dermatology societies about private equity. Dr. Francis has joined him for some of the sessions.Dr. Konda said he and his co-authors spent a year working on the paper. After the paper went out for review, he said, \u201cwe received constructive feedback.\u201d Most of the comments, he said, were about maintaining a neutral tone.\u201cWe strived to not use any polemic words, which could be interpreted as bias,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided to just deal with the facts, which would speak for themselves.\u201dThis week a lawyer for Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, which is backed by private equity and is the largest dermatology practice in the United States, called the general counsel at the University of Florida, where two of the authors are employed, demanding specific changes to the paper. The general counsel for the university declined to comment. Dr. Matt Leavitt, the chief executive of Advanced Dermatology, did not respond to requests for a comment.Dr. Konda says he plans to continue his research into private equity. \u201cI am passionate about this topic,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize we live in a capitalist society and money is a driving force behind many decisions regardless of the industry. However, I believe there has to be a balance between profit and patient care.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave the wrong location for an office of Dr. Curtis Asbury. He has a dermatology practice in Selbyville, Del., not in Maryland. The article also misstated where Dr. Asbury practices medicine.

{"Headline": "A Cure for Political Despair", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJoin the women trying to save America from Trump.Opinion ColumnistThis week, a friend texted me, \u201cI feel a panic that won\u2019t stop.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to ask what she meant; we are, after all, less than three weeks from the midterms. \u201c#MeToo,\u201d I replied.Many women I know \u2014 though, of course, not only women \u2014 are walking around with a churning knot of terror in their stomachs. The confirmation of the cruel former frat boy Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court brought back the anguish and degradation so many of us felt after the 2016 election. Donald Trump grows more thuggish and mendacious by the day; \u201cgaslighting,\u201d a term taken from a play about an abusive husband trying to drive his wife insane, has become a byword of our national life.There is, I find, only one thing that soothes my galloping anxiety, and that is talking to women who are actually doing the work of campaigning. The people who are knocking on doors and organizing rallies tend to be much more cheerful and confident than those who spend too much time on Twitter obsessing over each new poll.\u201cOne of the things I was a little worried about was maybe enthusiasm would wane, maybe people would get numb,\u201d Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u2019s Democratic nominee for governor, told me of the huge outpouring of women\u2019s activism that followed Trump\u2019s election. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that at all. For 22 months, it\u2019s been solid or growing.\u201dThe Michigan governor\u2019s race, which Whitmer is heavily favored to win, is obviously about much more than gender. One of the things Whitmer is best known for is her promise to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d and she\u2019s made the water crisis in Flint a centerpiece of her campaign. Still, if you want to see how the gender chasm has become a defining feature of our politics, and how women incensed by Trump might transform America on Nov. 6, Michigan is a good place to look.But the demoralization didn\u2019t last. On the Sunday after Kavanaugh was confirmed, Whitmer held a packed rally with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in Birmingham, Mich. \u201cIt felt just like I was back at the Women\u2019s March,\u201d she said. The previous day had been terrible for a lot of women, \u201cbut they were showing up, and seeing one another, and saying we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201dI showed Whitmer my friend\u2019s text and asked her if she was really confident that Democrats would make the midterms a turning point. \u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it every day. I talk to people every day.\u201dNow, part of the job of a good politician is projecting optimism. But again and again over the horrible months of Trump\u2019s reign, I\u2019ve found that spending time with the women who are working their hearts out against him is at least a temporary cure for despair. So if you, too, are scared, or furious, or despondent, find a Democrat close to you and go canvass for her (or him). \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to feel good about the world and connect with people,\u201d Whitmer said.But it also shows why many women sense an existential threat from Trump that goes far beyond his personal boorishness. A great many American women seem to understand intuitively that Trump\u2019s threat to liberal democracy and his threat to gender equality are intertwined. Soon, a majority of women could rise up, repudiate him and at long last create a check on his power. Women \u2014 though, of course, not only women \u2014 could save this country and themselves. Longing for this to happen, and not being assured it will, is almost physically painful. The only way to feel better is to do something to help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Don\u2019t Think Alike. Why Do We Think They Do?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisConservative supporters of the president and Brett Kavanaugh aren\u2019t betraying their gender \u2014 they\u2019re sticking with what they believe.Ms. Chira is a senior correspondent and editor on gender issues for The New York Times.What are those women thinking?The ones who cheered President Trump\u2019s mockery of Christine Blasey Ford at a rally in Mississippi, tweeted #HimToo in support of their sons who might one day be, in their eyes, unfairly accused of assault? But women don\u2019t automatically ally with other women, as Senator Susan Collins\u2019s vote to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court demonstrated. Sisterhood doesn\u2019t override partisanship or deeply held moral views. Victims of sexual harassment didn\u2019t all believe Christine Blasey Ford. Women don\u2019t act as one.The question is why so many people are still surprised that they don\u2019t, even after the election of 2016.Political scientists have found that some of the very attacks that were supposed to alienate all women in 2016 \u2014 such as Mr. Trump\u2019s jab that Hillary Clinton was playing the \u201cwoman card\u201d \u2014 instead made a segment of women more enthusiastic about him, and more hostile to her. Some women, primarily the core loyalists of President Trump\u2019s reshaped Republican Party, hold decidedly traditional views about women\u2019s place, prerogatives and power.And in 2018, some women appear receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s midterm strategy of attacking the #MeToo movement, even if it angers some college-educated and independent women who Republicans fear they may have lost anyway.\u201cWhy is it that it\u2019s hard for us to think of women as being sexist?\u201d said Erin C. Cassese, a political scientist at the University of Delaware who assessed women\u2019s attitudes by sifting through new data on the 2016 elections. \u201cIn the common usage, a sexist is a man who has disdain for women, who objectifies and demeans women.\u201d But that\u2019s too limited a definition, she explained: \u201cSexism is a broader set of attitudes about power and relationships between men and women.\u201dNo one is saying that being a Republican woman means being a sexist. But for some conservative women, however they are labeled, political power rightly lies with men.But she embraces the idea of innate differences between men and women, and like many Republicans, does not look to government to press for gender equality.\u201cMy brand of feminism is based on the realities of human nature,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you accept that these experiences are going to present themselves, what\u2019s the best way to help young women and ourselves address them? Not by demanding some policy.\u201dSo why don\u2019t women who share the all-too-common experience of being demeaned by men find that a source of solidarity? And why would women oppose measures that promise to offer them more rights and freedoms?It depends on which identities \u2014 woman, wife, mother, race, political or religious affiliation \u2014 are more central for which woman.Psychologists measure whether women display what they call \u201chostile sexism,\u201d which sees any gains by women coming at the expense of male power. For example, those people might agree with the statement \u201cWomen demanding equality seek special favors.\u201d They also measure \u201cbenevolent sexism,\u201d which encourages the protection of women in their traditional roles \u2014 people might agree with the statement \u201cMen should be willing to sacrifice their well-being to provide for women in their lives.\u201dProfessor Cassese found that Republican men and women, especially low-income and evangelical voters, tended to express higher levels of hostile sexism than Democrats or independents.Some women, white married women in particular, have tied their fates more closely to men. That is why, in several interviews with supporters of Mr. Trump and Justice Kavanaugh, the president\u2019s branding of #MeToo as unfair to men resonated with women protective of their sons or husbands.\u201cI have two sons and I have a daughter as well,\u201d said Jill Gregory, 33, a Trump supporter who lives in Olive Branch, Miss. \u201cIf that was my daughter, I would want her to be heard. On the other side, my two boys, I would hate for them to be accused of something they didn\u2019t do.\u201dAs the 2016 election demonstrated, some women regard anything that hurts the traditional male breadwinner \u2014 or the status they gain from being white \u2014 as a blow to their standing as well.[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to economic, racial and gender resentment, and his promise to return to old hierarchies, appealed to a segment of women even as it did to men, a study by Professor Cassese and Tiffany D. Barnes of the University of Kentucky showed. Many of these women not only scored high on the \u201chostile sexism\u201d scale, they also clung to the advantage of being white as a compensation for the disadvantage of being a woman. There is no universal female experience. And, as conservative women\u2019s support for Justice Kavanaugh shows, there is no universal female response to allegations of abuse.Conservative women condemn sexual harassment, too. But several interviewed rejected the idea that women always tell the truth about it or that men are single-handedly to blame.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to believe any girl who says something happened,\u201d Mrs. Mitchell said. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe everything they say. They can\u2019t remember. They were drunk. Honestly, of course men have a responsibility not to be predators. But we have a responsibility to do our part.\u201dSeveral conversations in Mississippi revealed a profound gulf between conservatives and liberals, even among those women who recounted searing experiences with sexual harassment themselves. These women prided themselves on a certain stoicism and grit, implying that unlike elite women, they could not afford to dwell on their experiences years later.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why women are afraid to get the help they need,\u201d said Crystal Walls, 60, a waitress in Southaven, who said she had fended off abuse herself and said her daughter had been raped and beaten. \u201cI can\u2019t comprehend that. I\u2019m maybe stronger.\u201dMrs. Fitch, the 34-year-old from Walls, Miss., said her stepfather abused her for several years, beginning when she was about 9 years old and ending with his arrest and imprisonment when she was 13. She says the experience has stayed with her, but has gained comfort from her church\u2019s support, her marriage, and being a mother. She spoke on a hot October day outside her home in Mississippi, with a kitten curled up in her lap, and recounted her trauma in a calm, resolute tone.\u201cI just have a hard time believing that someone would wait that long to say something,\u201d she said of Dr. Blasey. \u201cI understand that they feel ashamed and all of that. When you\u2019re not around that person that did that to you anymore, it removes some of the fear you have that they might retaliate against you. For her not to be able to remember most of the things that happened doesn\u2019t make sense to me. There are small, minute details that stick with you no matter what. I mean the room you\u2019re in, or the smell of that person, it stays with you.\u201dAmerican politics was upended in 2016 partly because conventional candidates did not understand people like Krysta Fitch and Crystal Walls.\u201cThere are a lot of white religious women and rural women in the Republican Party,\u201d said Mirya R. Holman, a political scientist at Tulane who is a co-author of the study about the effectiveness of Mr. Trump\u2019s election attacks on women. \u201cThis sort of national dialogue of \u2018All women should hate Donald Trump\u2019\u201d is alienating, she said. Being told, in effect, that their deeply held convictions are idiotic makes it impossible to have a productive national conversation about sexual misconduct.It\u2019s not only sexual harassment, but the broader question of gender equality that plays out differently for different women. Melissa Deckman, a political scientist at Washington College, in Chestertown, Md., who has written about women in the Tea Party, surveyed likely female voters in the midterms this June and found that the issues most important to Republican women varied greatly from those most important to Democratic women. Democratic women ranked gender equality among their top political priorities. Republican women ranked it among the lowest, far behind terrorism, immigration and education.The idea of rallying women to vote for women does not resonate for all women. Some commentators, in fact, have tried to tar not only Democrats but also female candidates as unacceptably extreme.\u201cWhat the G.O.P., the far right, Fox News, has done is essentially equated women in politics with the far left,\u201d Professor Deckman said. Their message, she said, is, \u201cif you want women in politics you\u2019ll end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u201d \u2014 in a word, socialism.But the Republican embrace of Mr. Trump\u2019s gender-baiting has already alienated independent women as well as Republican college-educated and suburban women, polls and focus groups suggest. Even some former religious conservatives have balked.Ms. Gregory, the 33-year-old in Olive Branch, Miss., does not see it the same way. \u201cSince he\u2019s been president, I watched the news all the time and I\u2019ve never been offended by anything he said about a woman,\u201d she said of President Trump. \u201cI think he\u2019s not meaning it to come out the way it sounds and the way the media makes it.\u201dThese two women disagree. Many observers of this political moment think they should join forces because they both happen to be women. We don\u2019t know how women will vote in November. But we do know they won\u2019t vote as one \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to be shocked by that.Advertisement"}

The first few days are festive. My sister, who lives three miles away with her family, calls the attention to us \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cobnoxious.\u201d During our last visit, she left my parents\u2019 house exasperated. Later, she phoned my mom, and my daughters secretly listened in on the extension. My sister trash-talked me, and my mother replied neutrally: \u201cUh huh, uh huh.\u201d I know the eavesdropping was wrong, but I\u2019d like to tell my mom how hurtful and abetting her behavior was. Any thoughts?ANONYMOUSI\u2019ve always identified with the prodigal son\u2019s unheralded brother. So I have lots of thoughts here. The first, though, is that you should make time for a stern talk with your daughters. Tweens are too old to be listening in on other people\u2019s phone calls. Their behavior was sneaky, violated privacy and caused pain. Make sure the girls get that message, and that they understand how their behavior hurt you.As for your sister, try a little tenderness. She lives near your parents and probably sees them all the time, helping out in all the ordinary ways that you would if you lived nearby. I\u2019m thinking, without any justification (other than personal experience), of appointments, errands and routine dinners. She is probably logging more parental mileage than you.It\u2019s not your fault, of course, that you live far away and your visits constitute special occasions. But spare a thought for your sister at the \u201cwelcome home\u201d feast that\u2019s given in your honor. A little jealousy seems pretty natural. (And if that feeling is a pre-existing condition, there may be spite too.)But, whatever you do, don\u2019t say anything to your mom about this. For starters, you shouldn\u2019t know about the call. She was only letting your sister vent, just as she would do for you. And she can\u2019t change your sister\u2019s feelings. You don\u2019t want them to quarrel, do you? If anything, make a special plan with your sister during your next visit. Take her out and show her the perks of your coming home.My husband and I lost our home in the California wildfires. We\u2019re in our 60s, so we also lost a lifetime of personal belongings: irreplaceable photos, letters and heirlooms. We were fortunate to be well insured, but the process has been brutal. Still, when we see friends, they often compound the hurt: \u201cIt was only stuff, right?\u201d Or: \u201cThink how fun it will be to shop for all new things!\u201d They make me want to weep \u2014 or scream.

I appreciate the help, but these volunteers are often the guests who drink too much and encourage others to do the same. Any suggestions?R.I get your laissez-faire impulse with the drinks. It creates a casual mood. But as host, you have a responsibility (and in many states, a legal duty) to make sure that your guests make it home safely and without hurting others. So, I\u2019m glad you wrote.Keep an eye on the bucket of drinks and on those who may be over-serving. Ask the self-appointed bartenders to pass hors d\u2019oeuvres instead of booze.

As we headed to the heartland, I wondered what was going through his mind as he transitions from childhood to manhood \u2014 and what I would face when I returned home with my husband to an empty nest.The idea was simple. To commemorate the coming International Day of the Girl in 2018, we wanted to know what life is like for 18-year-old girls around the world, from Mexico to Mississippi, Ramallah to Russia, Bangladesh to the Bronx. But here was the catch: We wanted to see those girls\u2019 lives through the lens of other 18-year-old girls.It certainly would have been easier to assign a few professional journalists to create these profiles: We have an amazing network of correspondents and photographers in virtually every corner of the globe. But as I brainstormed with my partners in The Times\u2019s Gender Initiative and in its Styles department, we worried about the fact that we and other mainstream news outlets almost always channel the stories of young people through the eyes of adults. We wanted this project to be different, no matter the logistical challenges.So how could we find 18-year-old female photographers around the world? I reached out to a colleague and mentor, the staff photographer James Estrin. Between us, we had a large network of contacts among a close-knit community of photojournalists, editors, organizations and schools around the globe. We began by going to them one by one \u2014 about 75 individuals and organizations in all \u2014 and asking for their help: Could they recommend young female photographers in their communities? Would they be willing to act as mentors and shepherd them through the project?Over the course of a month, we received dozens of portfolios to review. I pored over them, studying each photographer\u2019s visual \u201ceye\u201d \u2014 how did these young women view their world from behind the lens of a camera? Some came from challenging backgrounds but used photography to help themselves cope. One was a refugee. Others simply loved the art of photography. At times, the photographers were dealing with their own personal problems while documenting the experiences of others. A young photographer in Saudi Arabia was struggling with family issues. It took her longer than others to complete her assignment. And though her work didn\u2019t make the final project, she would not give up. None of the photographers gave up.These budding photographers captured their subjects\u2019 authentic selves in a way that I don\u2019t think many professionals could pull off. The young women they featured were unapologetic about who they are \u2014 and so willing to allow their peers to document moments of real tragedy and joy.

{"Headline": "In Sydney, a Feud Over Night Life Intensifies", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly five years after the state government imposed a curfew and restricted alcohol sales in the city center, some residents and business owners say it is time for a change. SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The streets are no longer busy at all hours. There are fewer places to dance or hear live music, but also fewer scenes of public drunkenness and violence. Nearly five years after state legislation restricted the hours of alcohol service across the heart of Australia\u2019s largest city, Sydney is again struggling over rules, risk, fun and freedom.Supporters argue that the laws, which generally restrict access to bars and clubs after 1:30 a.m., have reduced assaults. Opponents counter that they have just pushed trouble to new places while draining the city\u2019s heart of creativity.At the core of the argument \u2014 which will intensify when state lawmakers begin considering a repeal this week \u2014 is whether Sydney can truly be a great city without a 24-hour culture, when curfews cut nights short or push the adventurous to a politically connected casino.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost confidence as a city,\u201d he added. \u201cIf a city is only good during the day, then it\u2019s really half a city, isn\u2019t it?\u201dEven Sydney\u2019s rival, Melbourne, is making an effort to embrace the night. \u201cWe are Australia\u2019s only truly 24-hour city,\u201d said John Eren, Victoria\u2019s minister for tourism and major events. But in Sydney and the state of New South Wales, moderation has been elusive. That is partly because the laws\u2019 origins are rooted in tragedy: On New Year\u2019s Eve in 2013, Daniel Christie, 18, was celebrating in the Kings Cross neighborhood, then Sydney\u2019s red light district, when a drunken stranger knocked him to the ground with a single blow that later killed him. The public outcry was swift, pinpointing the neighborhood\u2019s drunken revelry. A lobbying effort, spearheaded by the victims\u2019 families, quickly led Barry O\u2019Farrell, then the premier of New South Wales, to implement drinking restrictions and a curfew. Across Sydney\u2019s busy center, venues prohibit entry after 1:30 a.m. and stop alcohol service at 3 a.m.For patrons and business owners, who were used to a system of liquor licensing that allowed many venues to be open 24 hours, the legislation was a sudden shock. One month after Mr. Christie died, many of Sydney\u2019s bustling night life hubs fell quiet. The changes have rippled through the city. They have provided incentives for new luxury developments. They have led to shifts in policing and transportation patterns, while redefining what it means to be young here. But for a few neighborhoods, the legislation\u2019s effects are especially profound, and ongoing.For younger Sydneysiders, a night in Kings Cross was a rite of passage. Nestled just far enough from Sydney\u2019s business district, it was a freewheeling, chaotic playground where alcohol flowed freely, prostitution was regulated and cheap clubs pumped music until dawn. That fun was accompanied by crowds, fights and puddles of vomit. 1/2 mileSydney HarborSydney OperaHouseSydneytherocksbaran-garooA4royalbotanicgardensLockoutZoneM1StarCasinohydeparkkingscrosscentral businessdistrictCliff Diveoxford st.australianewtownMap data from OpenStreetMapBy The New York TimesOn a recent Saturday evening, the people strolling down the streets in Kings Cross seemed dressed more for dinner than dancing. In one pub, patrons sipped beers as a guitarist performed in the corner. Beside new eateries, a new apartment complex has sprung up, as has a putt-putt golf bar. But for hospitality workers across the lockout zone, it has come at a cost: their livelihoods. \u201cFive years ago, not one street on Kings Cross was empty,\u201d said Hassan Elzein, a security guard working outside World Bar who was scanning IDs into a machine. \u201cNow 1 o\u2019clock, we\u2019ll be shutting down.\u201dThe shift has been especially severe for those who invested just before the change. Alex Dowd, for example, opened Cliff Dive on Oxford Street just three months before the lockout laws took effect. The property\u2019s 24-hour license figured into the value of the lease and his business plan for an all-night inclusive escape. Initially, Cliff Dive opened from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m., Wednesday to Sunday. Now, it operates only two nights a week.\u201cWe immediately lost 65 percent of our revenue,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cThe laws vastly changed our live music and entertainment offerings because of what we were able to afford.\u201d Many places just shut down. As of May, 418 licensed premises in the lockout zone have closed since the lockout began, according to state regulators.Dr. Weatherburn of the Bureau of Crime Statistics said there had already been some displacement of violence. \u201cThe crucial thing to bear to mind is this is a movable feast,\u201d he said. Newtown, a trendy neighborhood just outside of the lockout zone, is inheriting the worst and best of old Sydney. It\u2019s an area with the creativity and agency Mr. Koh longs for: Music venues fill up for up-and-coming and international acts; young creatives and bohemian veterans fill the bookstores, dives and restaurants.But as people seek to avoid the curfews of the lockout zone \u2014 along with rules that ban shots after midnight and other restrictions \u2014 Newtown often feels overwhelmed. After midnight one recent Saturday, half a dozen police officers congregated outside a pub where word of a fight spread through the sweaty, dancing crowd.Outside another popular bar, the Bank Hotel, a large sign signified recent frustrations. \u201cWe have no time for homophobia, racism, sexism, transphobia, disrespect,\u201d it declared. Before the laws, the area was a safe space for the L.G.B.T. community, said Leigh Crawley, the assistant manager at The Bank. Now, the crowd leans more mainstream, and more intoxicated. \u201cA lot of people get aggressive when they get refused entry or asked to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fist fights. They\u2019ll get verbally aggressive.\u201d Violence is up here and in the other areas beyond the lockout zone: Since 2014, non-domestic assaults related to alcohol increased 12 to 17 percent in these areas, government figures show.\u201cKnowing Newtown for what it was, it\u2019s a little bit heartbreaking seeing it turn into The Cross,\u201d said Mr. Crawley at The Bank. \u201cNow that the locals know what it\u2019s like, they won\u2019t come out anymore.\u201dThere is one place in particular where partygoers are welcome late: a glitzy casino known as The Star Sydney, and its nightclub, Marquee.On most weekend nights, among the frenetic lights, dozens of club-goers wait behind a velvet rope to get in. \u201cEveryone ends up here anyway,\u201d said Mary Youkhanna, 25, who stood with a group of girlfriends. The Star has contributed to the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation, named for one of the young men killed in Kings Cross, which lobbied for the introduction of the lockout laws. In an interview, Paul Toole, the minister for racing (whose office also oversees liquor and gambling), denied that The Star\u2019s exemption was political. \u201cI\u2019d say to those people that make these conspiracy claims and these allegations, where\u2019s your evidence?\u201d Mr. Toole said. \u201cProvide your evidence or shut up.\u201dTrue or not, the casino\u2019s exemption has reinforced the public perception that \u201cthe government is soft on \u2018mates in high places\u2019\u201d and advantages the wealthy and powerful, said Murray Lee, a professor of criminology at the University of Sydney. A spokeswoman for The Star said any suggestions of foul play were \u201cinaccurate, inflammatory and ill-formed.\u201d She added: \u201cThere is also a higher level of oversight and regulation of The Star than for any other licensed venue in NSW.\u201dSetting the casino aside, the government has started to walk back some restrictions. Mr. Toole said the government is open to additional changes. The bill being introduced this week would repeal the curfews regulating when people can enter a bar or club. Whether it passes or not, a government-commissioned review and upcoming parliamentary inquiry \u2014 along with an election in March \u2014 will likely bring out new ideas. People on both sides of the divide agree that any change to the laws would allow Sydney to send a message \u2014 both to the world and to itself \u2014 about its future identity. Less clear is whether a truce can be negotiated between freedom and safety, creativity and practicality.______Advertisement"}

Cullen, the United States attorney for the Western District of Virginia. They punched, kicked, head-butted and pushed the counterprotesters, according to court papers, and were \u201camong the most violent individuals present in Charlottesville.\u201dTheir organization\u2019s propaganda contains \u201cfascistic themes of emasculated young white men needing to reclaim their identities through learning to fight and engaging in purifying violence,\u201d according to court papers. The men had also committed acts of \u201cviolence and brutality\u201d in cities in California including Huntington Beach, Berkeley and San Bernardino, the government said.The men were identified as Cole Evan White, 24; Benjamin Drake Daley, 25; Michael Paul Miselis, 29; and Thomas Walter Gillen, 24. Mr. White was arrested Tuesday in San Francisco, and the other three men were arrested in Los Angeles. Each was accused of inciting a riot and of conspiracy, counts that each carry a maximum five-year prison sentence.Photographs and videos showed the men attacking counterprotesters, prosecutors said in court papers, and the men bragged about their attacks in Facebook messages. \u201cI hit like 5 people,\u201d Mr. Daley said in one such conversation, according to court documents.Investigators sifted through a huge amount of electronic evidence in the case \u2014 more than in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing \u2014 that took 13 months to examine, law enforcement officials said.\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d said Tanesha Hudson, a community activist who appeared outside the federal courthouse in downtown Charlottesville after the announcement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing them for accountability.\u201dAt that time, white supremacist groups were protesting the removal of Confederate monuments across the South, and several hundred people gathered to demonstrate against the City of Charlottesville\u2019s decision to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee.The evening before the rally, the four men and dozens of others marched with lit torches on the grounds of the University of Virginia. The next day, the rally quickly devolved into shoving and brawling as the marchers yelled racist taunts and chanted anti-Semitic slogans. The police and the National Guard were brought in, the governor declared a state of emergency and the area was cleared.Because of incorrect information initially given out by the United States attorney\u2019s office, an earlier version of this article misstated the age of Thomas Walter Gillen.

{"Headline": "In Africa, \u2018Paper Parks\u2019 Are Starved for Cash", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a unique analysis, researchers put a price on protecting Africa\u2019s wildlife: at least $1.2 billion each year. As if illegal mining, logging and poaching weren\u2019t bad enough, Africa\u2019s national parks face another dire threat: They\u2019re vastly underfunded.According the most comprehensive analysis of conservation funding to date, 90 percent of nearly 300 protected areas on the continent face funding shortfalls. Together, the deficits total at least a billion dollars. \u201cThe assumption is that parks are just fine because they\u2019re designated as protected,\u201d said Jennifer Miller, a senior scientist at Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group, and co-author of the report. \u201cBut in many cases, they don\u2019t have the resources to do conservation. They\u2019re just paper parks.\u201dThat the parks are operating on a shoestring comes as no surprise to those working to preserve Africa\u2019s wilderness, said Peter Fearnhead, chief executive officer and co-founder of African Parks, a nonprofit that manages 15 protected areas on the continent.\u201cWhat\u2019s very helpful about this paper is that it actually puts a number to the problem,\u201d said Mr. Fearnhead, who was not involved in the study. In the new analysis, the authors used wild lions as a proxy for how Africa\u2019s national parks are faring. Because of their place at the top of the food chain, lions are considered an umbrella species \u2014 a bellwether of an ecosystem\u2019s health. Throughout much of Africa, lions are not doing well. Their numbers have dropped 43 percent over the past two decades to as few as 20,000 in the wild. They now occupy just 8 percent of their historic habitat. A growing proportion of their range is found in national parks and reserves. But according to Dr. Lindsey\u2019s and Dr. Miller\u2019s research \u2014 which they undertook while working at Panthera, a group dedicated to conserving wild cats \u2014 most protected areas are not realizing their potential as safe havens for lions. To estimate the amount of funding needed to boost populations by at least 50 percent, the researchers relied on three different financial models. Then, following a review of state wildlife and donor funding, as well as interviews with park managers and officials, the team totaled the dollars available for protected areas in the 23 countries included in their study. They found that 88 percent to 94 percent of parks operate on budgets that are less than 20 percent of that required to perform effective conservation. Parks need to invest $377 to $783 per square mile, the researchers concluded. On average, parks spend just $77 per square mile.The grand total to renew Africa\u2019s parks: $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion each year. If the funding deficits are not addressed, lions and other wildlife in affected areas will likely experience catastrophic declines, the authors warn. Protected areas that are not adequately managed inevitably succumb to poaching, illegal livestock incursions, land grabs and illegal mining and logging. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy of the commons situation,\u201d Dr. Lindsey said. \u201cIf there\u2019s open access to wildlife, you\u2019d better poach or someone else will.\u201dWildlife is already quickly declining across many parks in Africa, and \u201cthere\u2019s no reason that won\u2019t continue unless the situation changes,\u201d said Tim Tear, executive director of the Africa program at the Wildlife Conservation Society, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIf we want to see many of Africa\u2019s iconic species now and into the future, then this paper calls out pretty starkly that we\u2019re going to have to change the way we continue to invest.\u201dShould business continue as usual, people also stand to lose, Dr. Lindsey said. Healthy ecosystems provide many benefits, from watershed protection to carbon storage. In many places in Africa, parks also contribute to job creation, economic growth and rural development through tourism \u2014 a $34 billion industry on the continent, the majority of which is tied to wildlife.Other nations, on the other hand, such as Mozambique, have many lions and stunning landscapes, but have yet to profit from those assets because their tourism industries are underdeveloped.\u201cThat\u2019s an important piece of the puzzle,\u201d Dr. Tear said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t invest more in the near future, then African countries may lose the opportunity to benefit from these species in years to come.\u201dDr. Lindsey added that the benefits for nations that do invest are only set to grow. Tourism is rising globally, and as more natural areas are lost to development, the few places that retain wilderness and wildlife will increase exponentially in value. \u201cCentral Park was worth nothing when all of Manhattan was forest, but now it\u2019s an absolutely priceless asset,\u201d Dr. Lindsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme analogy, but in some places in Africa, there is already a hard edge around parks.\u201dAfrican countries, however, should not bear sole responsibility for preserving the continent\u2019s nature, the researchers write. Many nations have set aside a significantly greater proportion of land for conservation than the global average, yet are not compensated for the costs of bypassing development.\u201cThe global community needs to recognize that there\u2019s an imbalance here, and everyone needs to do their part to help fix it,\u201d Dr. Tear said. \u201cWe should not view protecting iconic species in Africa as someone else\u2019s responsibility.\u201dWhile the amount needed to renew Africa\u2019s parks may seem daunting at first, Mr. Fearnhead pointed out that it is a minuscule amount on a global scale. \u201cLiterally a single individual \u2014 admittedly a very wealthy one \u2014 could be the solution to a continental challenge, and that creates hope,\u201d he said.In addition to philanthropic donors and companies, the shortfall could be remedied if developed nations and agencies such as the World Bank stepped up their conservation commitments, Dr. Lindsey said. Africa currently receives around $51 billion in annual development aid \u2014 about 200 times more than it does for supporting its protected areas. Reallocating just 2 percent of those funds toward conservation, Dr. Lindsey and his colleagues write, could stem much of the impending crisis.\u201cWe have reached a fork in the road,\u201d Dr. Lindsey said. \u201cIt is time for the world to decide if Africa\u2019s iconic parks and reserves are worth fighting for.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But there is another, encouraging side to this depressing story: how a simple idea, born in the United States in the 19th century and now racing around the globe, may yet preserve a substantial portion of our planet in a natural state.Every one of us \u2014 citizens, philanthropists, business and government leaders \u2014 should be troubled by the enormous gap between how little of our natural world is currently protected and how much should be protected. It is a gap that we must urgently narrow, before our human footprint consumes the earth\u2019s remaining wild places.For my part, I have decided to donate $1 billion over the next decade to help accelerate land and ocean conservation efforts around the world, with the goal of protecting 30 percent of the planet\u2019s surface by 2030. This money will support locally led conservation efforts around the world, push for increased global targets for land and ocean protection, seek to raise public awareness about the importance of this effort, and fund scientific studies to identify the best strategies to reach our target.I believe this ambitious goal is achievable because I\u2019ve seen what can be accomplished. Indigenous peoples, local leaders and conservation groups around the world are already busy setting aside protected areas that reflect the conservation, economic and cultural values of nearby communities. Financial support from philanthropists and governments is critical to helping these leaders conserve places like the coral reefs of the Caribbean, the glaciers of Argentina and what is known as the \u201cplace of many elephants\u201d in Zimbabwe. We need to embrace the radical, time-tested and profoundly democratic idea of public-land protection that was invented in the United States, tested in Yellowstone and Yosemite, and now proven the world over.For the sake of all living things, let\u2019s see to it that far more of our planet is protected by the people, for the people and for all time.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re very excited! We want to protect him during the height of flu season, so I asked our parents and siblings to get flu shots. My family is onboard. But my in-laws keep saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not flu shot people.\u201d My husband and I agree that no one can see the baby without getting a flu shot. Still, I worry that my in-laws will see this as an empty threat or claim to have gotten shots when they haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve sent them many articles and videos, which they\u2019ve ignored. How do we convince them?ANONYMOUSStep away from the ultimatum! I may be wrong, but I sense that\u2019s where you\u2019re headed. Of course, you are absolutely right to insist on your son\u2019s safety \u2014 in this case, flu shots and whooping cough vaccines for anyone who comes in close contact with the baby. That\u2019s your job!But do you know what else is important? Creating a cocoon of love around your son. Your in-laws will likely be pretty huge fans of his. And few things make people edgier than the words \u201cor else.\u201d For now, take a vacation from emailing the grandparents-to-be articles about flu shots. (Your in-laws don\u2019t get it yet, so they probably thought you were a little overstimulated after the fourth message.)When you next see them, explain the idea of creating a protective bubble of health around the baby. Do it gently, and engage your husband. Say, \u201cWe understand that you don\u2019t get flu shots normally, but they\u2019re really important for keeping the baby \u2014 with his fragile immune system \u2014 healthy. We all want that, right?\u201dBy casting this in terms of your newborn\u2019s welfare, it\u2019s hard to imagine them refusing. If they do, without good medical reason, it\u2019s your call. But I\u2019d speak to your doctor again (and your husband) before banning them from the birthing suite. And unless they\u2019re pathological liars, don\u2019t worry about them faking flu shots. That would be shocking and unlikely behavior.I am a reasonably attractive 60-year-old guy. I have a close female friend who is looks obsessed. She had a face-lift and some other cosmetic procedures last year when she was 47. A few months before my birthday, I was unsure how to celebrate it. I was thinking of a party or a trip. She said, \u201cYou should get your eyes done.\u201d I was shocked! When I told her she\u2019d hurt my feelings, she apologized for making me feel bad. But she never said I didn\u2019t need an eyelift. I\u2019m still upset. What should I do?STEVEYou may need to manage your expectations of apologies, Steve. Your friend was way off-base in suggesting an eyelift for you. Still, when you told her that she\u2019d hurt your feelings, she apologized. She was sorry for making you feel bad. But a good apology doesn\u2019t include a lie. It would have been wrong (and fairly implausible) for her to say that she\u2019d changed her mind about your eyes.But who cares what she thinks? She had her whole face done when she was much younger than you! So, the question is: Can you forgive her for hurting your feelings and thinking that your eyes are a little droopy? Because that\u2019s what accepting her apology will entail.My husband and I are in our 20s. When we say hello to friends or even acquaintances, he gets to shake hands with them, while they come in for a hug with me. This happens mainly with men. It makes me uncomfortable. Why should I have to hug people to say hello, especially if I don\u2019t know them well?M.You don\u2019t! Just extend your shaking hand, and keep it extended. Their outstretched arms will fall eventually. No need to say a thing. You\u2019re not obliged to justify yourself. These guys are just following a weird norm in your social circle. (Presumably, your husband is hugging women he barely knows too, right?) You can always add: \u201cI like shaking hands!\u201d if you think it helps. It\u2019s all your call.I\u2019ve been going to the same barber every other week for 15 years. The shop\u2019s owner changed recently, but my barber is still going strong. When I settled the bill last week, the new owner said, \u201cThat will be $25.\u201d But my barber interjected that he charges me $35 (which I paid). Now, I feel like a chump.

Time for a new barber?P.W.Q.As a fellow who\u2019s gone to the same amazing barber for over 20 years (hi, Aki!), I\u2019d never advocate discarding a happy long-term relationship. Your experienced barber is entitled to charge more than a newbie straight out of school. But if the price tag bothers you, ask about it: \u201cAre you charging new clients $25?\u201d Your barber may explain the pricing structure at the shop or reduce his rate.

{"Headline": "Amazon Squeezes Out More Profit as Sales Growth Slows", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon\u2019s profits were hit or miss for its first couple of decades. But now, for the first time, they are starting to look consistent \u2014 with four consecutive quarters above $1 billion in profit.On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. But the focus on profit that investors have long sought wasn\u2019t enough to keep them happy. The company\u2019s shares dropped more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading, after Amazon also announced that revenue in its core retail business was growing more slowly than in the past.The company\u2019s sales were up 29 percent to $56.6 billion, below what analysts had predicted. In Amazon\u2019s biggest business, its online store, sales rose just 11 percent over the past year. A year ago, the pace was twice as quick.\u201cThey are saturating the core market in the U.S. for e-commerce,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who leads Amazon research for Gartner L2. \u201cThis is a company in transition right now,\u201d moving from a focus on acquiring more customers to getting more growth from people who already shop the site.Profit was up in part because Amazon\u2019s leadership has focused on trimming costs to counteract the slower growth. \u201cWe have really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters.He said the company saved money by redeploying engineers rather than hiring more new staff and being more efficient in its warehouses and data centers. About 613,000 people now work at Amazon, up 13 percent from the same time last year. Mr. Olsavsky said that over the course of 2017, the number of employees jumped 38 percent, not including its new Whole Foods workers.\u201cThe theme will be banking some of the investment from prior years,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said in a later call with analysts.Amazon has made a push in recent months to get more out of its high-margin areas, especially its industry-leading cloud computing services, a huge business with 31 percent operating margins this quarter.Its Prime memberships are another area: This year, Amazon raised the annual price of a Prime Membership by 20 percent, to $119. The number of new members signing up for Prime has been slowing, down to just 1 to 2 percent a quarter, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a firm that surveys users for brands and investors.Those lucrative markets let Amazon plow cash into new businesses that require intense physical investments and engineering talent, like expanding fast grocery delivery or building out its Alexa ecosystem. \u201cNow the investment is not a cycle \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d said Brian Nowak, who researches Amazon at Morgan Stanley.The company has been spending heavily in its international operations, in particular India, looking for its next enormous consumer market. International sales were up just 15 percent over the previous year, to $15.5 billion. Amazon\u2019s international sales are not profitable, though the margins are improving.As part of the wage increase, Amazon ended the bonus and stock grants it had been giving workers, which analysts estimated would offset some of the costs, as would increased efficiencies using robotics. Mr. Olsavsky declined to provide details of the costs associated with the new wage.\u201cOne of Amazon\u2019s weapons against competitors is the confidence of Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cto be able to show that when we start a new business in a new category, we can send the value of legacy businesses in those industries plummeting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year.

{"Headline": "When Trump Made the U.S.F.L. Great Again", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump\u2019s chaotic foray into pro football was a precursor to many of his actions today, Jeff Pearlman writes. Mr. Pearlman is the author of \u201cFootball for a Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL,\u201d and hosts the \u201cTwo Writers Slinging Yang\u201d podcast.We have been here before.Whenever President Trump says or does something outrageous, you can be certain that near-identical utterances were made, or actions taken, some three decades ago, when he was the owner of the New Jersey Generals of the long-defunct United States Football League.For those who might not recall, the U.S.F.L. was a 12-team professional spring football league that began in 1983 with a modest goal: to provide quality games with franchises stocked largely with regional players. (For example, the Philadelphia Stars had a high number of former Penn State standouts.) It was fun and flashy, and largely successful.Then Donald J. Trump bought in.Or, put differently: Past is prologue.For those convinced that Trump and Company would never have colluded with Russia to steal an election, consider this: Shortly after buying into the U.S.F.L. (and having initially praised the league), Mr. Trump arranged for a secret meeting with Pete Rozelle, the National Football League\u2019s commissioner, inside a suite at Manhattan\u2019s Pierre Hotel.According to those later briefed on the session, as well as Mr. Rozelle\u2019s 1986 testimony in a trial pitting the two leagues against each other, Mr. Trump all but begged for an N.F.L. franchise, insisting he would gladly throw the U.S.F.L. (and his fellow owners) under the bus were it to result in a place for him in the more established league.According to someone who attended part of the meeting, Mr. Rozelle rejected the offer, telling Mr. Trump, \u201cAs long as I or my heirs are involved in the N.F.L., you will never be a franchise owner.\u201dLike Trump 2018, Trump 1984 was undeterred by such setbacks. His goal was to use the U.S.F.L. to land an N.F.L. franchise. If Mr. Rozelle was unwilling to gift him one, well, he\u2019d take matters into his own hands and shift the league to fall, forcing a merger.Without seeking permission from the U.S.F.L. commissioner, Chet Simmons, Mr. Trump contacted network television executives and asked whether they would broadcast the U.S.F.L. were it to play a fall schedule. Neither ABC nor CBS nor NBC was interested.Which is why, naturally, in an August 1984 league meeting, Mr. Trump assured his fellow owners that a \u201chuge\u201d network deal awaited if they switched seasons. This was a blatant lie, though one that many of his fellow owners chose to believe.Before the U.S.F.L.\u2019s third and final season, in 1985, Trump signed Doug Flutie, Boston College\u2019s Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, to a six-year, $8.3 million deal. It was, the owner believed, the type of bold step an N.F.L. franchise would take.Doug Flutie was the wall before the wall. The U.S.F.L.\u2019s other owners were Mexico. They paid nary a dime.Throughout Trump\u2019s U.S.F.L. tenure, the thorn in his side was John Bassett, the owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits. Mr. Bassett believed in the original spring mission, and pleaded with his peers not to follow the promises of a \u201ccon man.\u201d On Aug. 16, 1984, he wrote Mr. Trump a blistering letter that included the sentence, \u201cYou are bigger, younger, and stronger than I, which means I\u2019ll have no regrets whatsoever punching you right in the mouth the next time an instance occurs where you personally scorn me, or anyone else, who does not happen to salute and dance to your tune.\u201dOnly Mr. Bassett was willing to stand up to Mr. Trump, and their fiery exchanges at league meetings are the stuff of legend. But in February 1985, Mr. Bassett was diagnosed with brain cancer. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy \u2014 then proceeded to stomp all over him, ignoring the owner or dismissing his views (\u201cWe need to stay in spring! We have to stay in spring!\u201d) as the blatherings of a sick man.Like John McCain\u2019s family, Mr. Bassett\u2019s family has not forgiven Mr. Trump for the callous way he treated their loved one as he fought a losing battle against brain cancer.With Mr. Bassett gone, Mr. Trump persuaded his fellow owners (against their better interests) to move the schedule to the fall, then spearheaded the filing of an ill-advised antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L. Trump hired Roy Cohn, the infamous McCarthy hearings attorney, to represent the league, assuring the other U.S.F.L. owners that the N.F.L. would cower in Mr. Cohn\u2019s presence and immediately seek a settlement.The N.F.L.\u2019s attorneys sought a villain, and they found one in Mr. Trump. He testified over several days, smirking and scowling and, I believe, lying under oath about Mr. Rozelle having promised him an N.F.L. franchise. \u201cHe was utterly unbelievable,\u201d a juror told me recently. \u201cJust an ugly bully trying to get his way.\u201dThe league all but died that day, and never played a fall game.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t look back, later dismissing the U.S.F.L. as \u201csmall potatoes.\u201dHe had bigger things to do.Jeff Pearlman is the author of \u201cFootball for a Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL,\u201d and hosts the Two Writers Slinging Yang podcast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rescuing Sea Turtles From Fishermen\u2019s Nets", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "An organization on the coast of Kenya tries to persuade local residents to help return the trapped reptiles to the ocean, rather than sell their meat and shells for a living. Supported byX-rays showed that the reptile\u2019s intestinal tract was clogged with plastic. Hogaar, as Local Ocean named her, floated and couldn\u2019t dive. Gas had built up in her innards after she had eaten small pieces of plastic mistaken for food such as jellyfish. Local Ocean staff members placed Hogaar in a rehab pool and gave her laxatives. She passed feces laced with shreds of packaging and had little appetite. After more than four months at Local Ocean, Hogaar died. A necropsy revealed her gut was also full of sharp shards of white, blue and pink plastic and tangles of blue and gray string. Conservationists are trying to protect turtles from a wave of threats, including pollution. Since its founding in 1997, Local Ocean has protected about 1,000 nests, conducted more than 17,000 turtle rescues and treated more than 480 turtles in its rehab center. About 60 to 70 percent of turtles are released back in the ocean. Turtles face many other dangers, including fishermen\u2019s hooks, boat accidents and habitat loss resulting from erosion and human construction \u2014 especially those obstructing nesting sites. They also suffer from ailments such as fibropapillomatosis, a mysterious disease that causes grotesque tumors possibly caused by pollution, and parasitic barnacles on their carapaces. While the plight of Africa\u2019s endangered megafauna \u2014 elephants and rhinos \u2014 captures the world\u2019s attention and resources, awareness and protection of marine life along the continent\u2019s coastal areas are \u201ccompletely overlooked,\u201d said Nicky Parazzi, a founder of Local Ocean, which was previously called Watamu Turtle Watch. \u201cWhat turtles need for their survival, we need for our enjoyment and survival as well. They represent the health of the ocean,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the canaries of the ocean.\u201d  One bright spot is the decline of poaching in the Watamu region, despite the big profit fishermen can make from selling oil and meat. A large female green turtle can yield up to 170 pounds of meat and up to 45 pounds of fat. Such a turtle can fetch $500 to $600 \u2014 a hefty sum considering the average fisherman here makes about $150 a month. Turtle oil sells on the black market for 2,000 shillings ($20) per bottle and is falsely believed to boost strength and immunity, cure asthma and serve as an aphrodisiac. Local Ocean staff members meet regularly with hundreds of fishermen to build trust and good relationships with the community. \u201cWe\u2019ve been with them 20 years now,\u201d Ms. Parazzi said. \u201cWe\u2019re not fair weather friends, we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201dOne spring morning, the fisherman Kai Shoka waited on a crescent-shaped beach here for Fikiri Kiponda, a turtle watch coordinator, after accidentally catching a juvenile hawksbill. On the beach, Mr. Kiponda measured and weighed the creature, and put metal identification tags on his flippers. Although hawksbill meat is poisonous, the turtles are prized for the painterly, amber patterns of their shells. Carapaces are made into \u201ctortoiseshell\u201d jewelry and trinkets, although trade is illegal under endangered species and Kenyan laws. Released soon afterward, this hawksbill crawled tentatively on the sand toward waves lapping the beach. Once in the water, the turtle flapped his flippers powerfully, becoming a rippling blur as he disappeared into the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean. Casper van de Geer, the organization\u2019s manager, described the token amounts not as payments but as a way of compensating the fishermen for their time, or expenses like phone calls and transportation. \u201cThis is a small difference, but it has created a totally different attitude amongst the participants,\u201d Mr. van de Geer said.While paying fishermen might seem to be an incentive for them to catch turtles, most fish by setting nets and waiting, making it unlikely that turtles are targeted for capture. Mr. Shoka, 40, said fishermen like him used to slaughter and eat turtles, but he considers the bycatch program worthwhile. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to possess turtle products,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might be fined 20 million shillings. I don\u2019t think selling the turtle is the proper thing.\u201dThe next morning, Mr. Kiponda drove to a village of thatch-roofed homes to pick up a 20-pound green turtle caught a day earlier by Mark Katama, 22, who had carried it home. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of effort because it\u2019s struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be strong.\u201d He received a $3 remuneration. With the turtle in a large box in the back of his jeep, Mr. Kiponda drove out of the village on muddy roads rutted by the country\u2019s torrential spring rains. A former accountant, Mr. Kiponda reflected on his nine years as a conservationist with Local Ocean, and how the bycatch program has changed fishing practices in the area. He gets calls from fishermen nearly every day, but doubted that the program would be as popular if they didn\u2019t get some reward.  Given the financial difficulties that fishermen face, Mr. Kiponda speculated that without compensation, they \u201cwould go back to the tradition of eating them.\u201d Poaching certainly still occurs, and there is little to stop it outside the Watamu area. A few days later, four people from Local Ocean using a harness strained to carry a massive green turtle \u2014 caught earlier by a fisherman \u2014 across the beach. Weighing 180 pounds, she exuded an all-knowing aura with her unblinking eyes set on a distinguished face. Set down on the white sand, the turtle used her foot-long, mosaic-patterned flippers to heave herself into the sea\u2019s frothy waves, seemingly eager for another chance to live a long life that could last up to 80 years. In the late 1980s, Ms. Parazzi and a friend began patrolling the beach at night by flashlight, at a time when turtle and egg poaching was rampant in Watamu. \u201cTo see a turtle was quite unusual,\u201d recalled Ms. Parazzi, who runs a crafts business.  \u201cWe were just two housewives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything scientific whatsoever.\u201d They sought out international turtle experts by email, asking such basic questions as what to do with a turtle nest. As their knowledge grew, the two women expanded their mission beyond the beach, and Local Ocean expanded to include a variety of programs, including mangrove reforestation, community economic development, outreach and education.\u201cOur mandate is the environment,\u201d Ms. Parazzi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in single-species conservation. It\u2019s a fat lot trying to save the turtle if they have nowhere to nest.\u201d At a beachfront apartment where Zachary Kibugu works as a security guard, a green turtle crawled into a cove choked with seaweed and an obstacle course of plastic garbage: sachets of juice and hair conditioner, old flip-flops, battered tubes of sunscreen, ubiquitous bottles and a medley of caps. The marine reptile dug a deep hole in the sand and laid 128 eggs, scraping sand with her flippers over the nest to hide it, and she lumbered back to the sea. Another security guard recognized the turtle\u2019s telltale tracks and marked the nesting spot with sticks before the tide could erase it. Mr. Kibugu alerted Local Ocean, which had introduced him to sea turtles when the organization visited his high school several years ago. Later that morning, conservationists carefully dug up the trove of luminous white eggs the size of Ping-Pong balls. They would soon be reburied on a safer, cleaner beach where the nests could be monitored. As the staff members gingerly stacked the eggs into a plastic bucket, Mr. Kibugu remembered a Local Ocean field trip eight years ago when his class had released a rescued turtle back into the sea. The young man smiled brightly at the memory of giving the creature another chance. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Tennessee, a Microcosm of the Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill voters pull back from Trumpian partisan warfare?Mr. Meacham is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels.\u201d NASHVILLE \u2014 It was the last question, but the answers shed light on first principles. Near the end of an hourlong debate in Knoxville, Tenn., on Wednesday, the rivals for an open Senate seat, the Democrat Phil Bredesen and the Republican Marsha Blackburn, were asked if the state would be in \u201cgood hands\u201d if the other candidate were to win. Mr. Bredesen, a former governor, was gentlemanly, saying that he\u2019d rally around a Senator Blackburn in the event of defeat. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over, it needs to be over,\u201d he said. If his opponent prevailed, \u201cit\u2019s important for all Tennesseans to gather around and support her so she can be the best senator she can be.\u201d Ms. Blackburn, a United States representative, declined to return the favor, denouncing \u201cWashington Democrats\u201d and linking a Senator Bredesen to what Republicans see as a \u201cStar Wars\u201d cantina scene of liberals: Dianne Feinstein, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Patty Murray.The contrast could not have been starker. There was the old-school former governor, speaking earnestly \u2014 and truth be told, dryly \u2014 about democratic institutions and the need to respect verdicts rendered by voters. And there was the Fox News-style representative, rattling off a fusillade of unrelenting sound bites. \u201cI know the left calls me a wing nut, or a knuckle-dragging conservative,\u201d Ms. Blackburn said in announcing her bid for the seat being vacated by the retirement of Republican Senator Bob Corker. \u201cAnd you know what? I say that\u2019s all right, bring it on.\u201d Campaigning for Ms. Blackburn in Tennessee in recent weeks, President Trump said: \u201cA vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for. It\u2019s a vote for \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019\u201dMr. Corker upended state politics last fall when he announced that he would not seek another term. Suddenly one of the great prizes in American politics \u2014 a Senate seat in a narrowly divided country \u2014 was in play, and Mr. Bredesen, 74 and happily retired, was being beseeched to get back in the arena to run against the presumptive Republican nominee, the unapologetically Trumpian Ms. Blackburn, who boasted in her announcement video that she packs a pistol in her purse.It\u2019s now commonplace to call the Bredesen-Blackburn race a microcosm of the national story of the midterms. If the Democrats are to win outside traditional blue zones, they need to nominate figures in Mr. Bredesen\u2019s moderate mold; if Ms. Blackburn triumphs, then the red Trump tide rises still. That much is already clear from national coverage of the race.For Tennesseans, though, as well as for careful students of American politics, the campaign is about something more than a Senate seat. Its outcome will shed as much light on the culture of politics as it will on the raw calculus of power. Is public life to be a perpetual Hobbesian war of all against all? Is partisan passion, stoked by cable news and aimed at keeping a reliable base energized and enraged, to overwhelm reasonable debate?These questions may seem na\u00efve, for the age of Trump has been nothing if not Hobbesian. Tennessee, however, likes to think of itself \u2014 or has, at least, until this year \u2014 as a more sophisticated place than its Deep South neighbors. In the tumult of the 1960s, Alabama sent the avowedly segregationist George Wallace to the national stage; Tennessee gave America the eminently moderate Howard Baker, who was elected to the Senate in 1966, just two years before Wallace carried five Southern states in the 1968 presidential election.At stake in the Bredesen-Blackburn race is the durability of a Tennessee tradition of electing temperamentally sound senators. From Estes Kefauver, who was nominated for vice president in 1956 on Adlai Stevenson\u2019s Democratic ticket, to the two Albert Gores to Baker and Jim Sasser and Bill Frist and Lamar Alexander, Tennesseans have thrived in Washington by tending to rise above reflexive ideology \u2014 a reflection of a state that has always been politically complicated.Ambivalence about absolutes is part of Tennessee\u2019s DNA. In the crisis over the Union in 1860-61, the state did not join the rush to secession in the wake of Lincoln\u2019s election, ultimately joining the Confederacy only after the attack on Fort Sumter. Even then, as historians have long noted, Tennesseans provided far more soldiers to the Union cause than any other Confederate state.Which makes the 2018 campaign all the more intriguing. Mr. Bredesen is offering himself as a pragmatic architect of the state\u2019s recent prosperity, Ms. Blackburn as a loyal soldier in Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing war. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t personally like about Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Bredesen said in the spring, \u201cbut he\u2019s the president of the United States, and if he has an idea and is pushing some things that I think are good for the people of Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be for it. It doesn\u2019t matter where it came from. And likewise, if I think it\u2019s not going to be good for Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be against it. I think that\u2019s what senators ought to do.\u201d Whether he gets the opportunity to give reason a chance in a tribal time will tell us much \u2014 not just about Tennessee, but about America.Jon Meacham is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drifting Dandelion Seeds Produce a Vortex Never Before Seen ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScienceTakeThe air flowing through the bristly tufts of dandelion seeds creates a vortex scientists had never viewed in nature. Dandelions and children go together. They both love to trespass on well-tended lawns. They pop up in places where you wish they wouldn\u2019t. They are irrepressible. And even though adults try to turn them against each other (I was paid per plant to destroy the so-called weeds, with a dandelion fork), come seed time, children can\u2019t resist blowing on the silvery tufted heads of dandelions so they can continue to ruin the fine sod of grown-ups. The scientists knew that the key to the seed\u2019s flight was the tuft atop the stem on which hangs the dandelion seed. This tuft, called a pappus, is made up of a sparse thicket of filaments, or bristles, that look something like the sprouting hair on the head of the Chinese crested dog. The pappus seemed to be acting like a balloon or a parachute, keeping the seed from succumbing to gravity. But it was not inflated as a balloon would be, and it did not block the air like a parachute. What they recorded surprised them. Above the pappus, the air flow took the form of something called a separated vortex ring, a kind of swirling eddy that had been considered a theoretical possibility, but was thought to be too unstable to exist in reality. It was, they wrote, \u201ca new class of fluid behavior\u201d \u2014 air being the fluid in this case.\u201cThe dandelion flies in such a way that it forms a vortex that contributes to keeping the dandelion afloat as long as possible,\u201d Dr. Viola said in an interview.That happens because of the way air currents interact as they flow among the filaments of the pappus. Those currents help keep the whole seed structure afloat by increasing the drag on the falling pappus. Dr. Cummins said the filaments make the pappus four times as efficient at staying afloat as a simple flat disc. The vortex also contributes to the support of the pappus, because it forms a low-pressure area so that air rises. On a grand scale, something like this happens in a hurricane.Other seeds and some insects use a similar kind of bristly flight. Some thrips have wings of bristles, not the membranes seen on other insects. And in water, black fly larvae may use bristly fans to suspend themselves and filter food particles out of the water. The group tested their ideas with simplified artificial models, etched silicon discs that were porous like the bristly pappus. With the right amount of porosity, the same vortex appeared.The finding is important, Dr. Nakayama said, for several reasons. \u201cThis type of bristly structure is everywhere in the biological world. It has been invented many times independently\u201d for seeds and for moving organisms, she said, but it is \u201cquite unexplored.\u201dIt is also a newly observed phenomenon in fluid mechanics and may be of use in designing the tiniest of drones. Bristles may be better than wings for very small constructions.Bristle flight does not work at a human-sized scale, however. Dr. Cummins said, \u201cYou would not want to jump out of an airplane with this kind of parachute.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most White Americans\u2019 DNA Can Be Identified Through Genealogy Databases", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe genetic genealogy industry is booming. In recent years, more than 15 million people have offered up their DNA \u2014 a cheek swab, some saliva in a test-tube \u2014 to services such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com in pursuit of answers about their heritage. In exchange for a genetic fingerprint, individuals may find a birth parent, long-lost cousins, perhaps even a link to Oprah or Alexander the Great.Within two or three years, 90 percent of Americans of European descent will be identifiable from their DNA, researchers found. The science-fiction future, in which everyone is known whether or not they want to be, is nigh.\u201cIt\u2019s not the distant future, it\u2019s the near future,\u201d said Yaniv Erlich, the lead author of the study. Dr. Erlich, formerly a genetic-privacy researcher at Columbia University, is the chief science officer of MyHeritage, a genetic ancestry website.The science involves a search for third cousins. To identify a person through a DNA sample, an investigator uploads a previously analyzed genetic sequence to a database. The goal is to find someone who shares enough DNA to place them in the third cousin or closer range. Most of us have at least 800 people out there, somewhere in the world, who fall into this category. So long as one of these people is in a database, a skilled sleuth may be able to use other publicly available information to start building a family tree and figure out the person\u2019s actual identity.Watching these developments, Dr. Erlich wondered about the odds of identifying any given person through cousins\u2019 DNA in one of these databases.His analysis is based not on the big genealogy databases such as 23andMe and Ancestry, but on two of the smallest: GEDmatch, which has around one million profiles, and MyHeritage, which had around 1.5 million at the time of the study. That\u2019s because, for legal and logistical reasons, the larger sites cannot be easily used to identify anyone other than customers who mail in saliva.But the smaller sites, set up to help genealogists maximize the odds of finding relatives, are more flexible. GEDmatch allows law-enforcement officials to search for genetic matches in its database in murder and sexual assault cases. MyHeritage does not, but it permits uploads from external labs. With both, it\u2019s hard to be sure what\u2019s being uploaded: grandma\u2019s saliva, crime scene blood, a sample from a medical study or something else entirely.To determine the odds of correctly identifying an individual from a given DNA sample, Dr. Erlich and his colleagues \u2014 from Columbia University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the New York Genome Center \u2014 analyzed 30 DNA kits chosen at random from the GEDmatch database.Their results were eye-opening. The team found that a DNA sample from an American of Northern European heritage could be tracked successfully to a third-cousin distance of its owner in 60 percent of cases. A comparable analysis on the MyHeritage site had similar results.The analysis focused on Americans of North European background because 75 percent of the users on GEDmatch and other genealogy sites belong to that demographic. To identify an individual of any ancestral background, all that is needed is a database containing two percent of the target population, according to Dr. Erlich.Some experts have raised questions about the study\u2019s methodology. Its sample size was small, and it didn\u2019t factor in that more than one match is often required to identify a suspect.CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist with Parabon, a forensic consulting firm, also expressed worry in an email that the Science paper may obscure the difficulty involved in puzzling out someone\u2019s identity; it takes a highly skilled expert to build a family tree from the initial genetic clues.Still, she said, the takeaway of the study \u201cis not news to us.\u201d In recent months Ms. Moore has been involved in a dozen murder and sexual assault cases that used GEDmatch to identify suspects.

This shows that an individual\u2019s private health data might not be so private after all.Dr. Erlich has urged genealogy companies to consider attaching some sort of cryptographic signature to the genetic profiles they analyze. This would help ensure that whoever uploads a genetic profile is who they say they are, and making it harder for anyone to abuse this data, should they, for example, want to figure out who attended a protest.Daniel MacArthur, a genomics researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, said he endorses the cryptographic signature, but that it doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cWe live in a world where people are very interested in obtaining and sharing their genetic data to learn more about themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural human instinct. But legislative protection is required to ensure that it\u2019s not used for nefarious purposes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Some Amazon Workers Are Fuming About Their Raise", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs soon as he said \u201cnew Amazon minimum wage of $15 an hour,\u201d Mr. Clark was drowned out by more than 10 seconds of cheers and high-fives.But in Amazon warehouses across the country, many longtime workers are fuming that \u2014 based on the information they have received so far \u2014 they may end up making thousands of dollars less a year.Yes, Amazon is increasing wages, which will benefit most employees. But it will no longer give out new stock grants and monthly bonuses. Some workers believe that means their total compensation will shrink.Whether Amazon finds a way to close that gap will be closely watched in Washington. On Thursday, Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, sent a letter to Jay Carney, who runs Amazon\u2019s public policy, \u201casking Amazon to confirm how the total compensation of employees who would have received stock options \u2014 those with the company for two or more years \u2014 will be affected as a result of the recent changes,\u201d according to a copy provided to The New York Times.Mr. Sanders, who was alerted to the issue by workers, has not yet received a response from Amazon, a spokesman for the senator said.The New York Times spoke to about a half-dozen workers around the country, from Texas to Kentucky, and viewed numerous employee discussions on Facebook. All of the workers shared their pay stubs, but few would allow their names to be used.Near Minneapolis, Katy Iber, who handles returned products at an Amazon warehouse, works the night shift. Her region has a tight local labor market, so she already makes more than $15 an hour.In an \u201call hands\u201d meeting at the start of her shift on Thursday \u2014 her first day at work after the pay raise was announced \u2014 she learned Amazon was raising her base pay by $1 an hour.But it was also ending monthly attendance and productivity bonuses, known as the Variable Compensation Plan, or V.C.P. And she would no longer be granted valuable Amazon shares. The trade-off meant she\u2019d be losing money, she said.It was as though the company were saying: \u201c\u2018Thanks, we appreciate you going into the holidays. Here\u2019s less money,\u2019\u201d Ms. Iber said. The Times reached Ms. Iber through the Awood Center, a nonprofit that is organizing East African workers in the region.Amazon maintained in a statement that the higher hourly wage \u201cmore than compensates for the phaseout\u201d of the stock and incentive bonuses. A traditional pay raise, the company said, is \u201cmore immediate and predictable.\u201dAmazon said more than 250,000 employees and an additional 100,000 seasonal workers would benefit from the pay changes, and announced similar changes for workers in Britain. Deutsche Bank estimated that Amazon\u2019s pay increase \u201crepresents less than 1 percent of its projected 2019 revenue.\u201dFor many workers, including those who work part time and were never eligible for stock and bonuses, the raises in base pay will certainly put more cash in their pockets.Amazon officials said that over the next week they would adjust the pay of some employees to make sure workers did not end up losing money with the changes.The difference between what some employees believe is their total compensation and what the company believes they are being paid also may come down to accounting rules. Amazon said that if employees in 2018 get stock that was granted to them two years ago, that legally counts as compensation this year. But some employees believe that was compensation for work done two years ago.The difference \u2014 whether because of miscommunication or incomplete information given to employees \u2014 has resonated in Amazon warehouses around the country, particularly with employees with a longer tenure at the company.The dispute is over two compensation programs that will end on Nov. 1. The first, the Variable Compensation Plan, is paid out each month. It offered up to a 4 percent bonus for attendance, and an additional 4 percent if a worker\u2019s building met certain production goals.Ms. Iber said someone in her warehouse wrote \u201cBRING BACK VCP!!!!\u201d on a whiteboard where employees are encouraged to communicate with management.In the three months around the holiday season, known as \u201cdouble down,\u201d the bonus doubles, meaning employees could earn as much as 16 percent on top of their regular wages.The second program gave employees shares in Amazon stock each year. They get to keep the shares if they\u2019re still working at the company after two years. Recently, employees have been getting two shares, worth about a combined $3,725 at the current market value. With the changes, workers get to keep the stock granted in previous years but will not earn new shares.Documentation that Ms. Iber provided showed that her bonus amounted to $1.28 an hour in August. In the three months around the holidays, that could be more than $2.50 an hour, far more than the $1-an-hour increase in base pay she\u2019s getting.She is down even more when stock grants are taken into account. She will keep old shares but will not be granted new ones.In a Facebook group popular with employees, workers fumed over the changes, according to screenshots from the page that were viewed by The Times.There were so many negative pending posts on the day Amazon announced the $15 wage that a moderator wrote that she had deleted them and pleaded with workers to write to the corporate offices in Seattle rather than vent online.Another poster wrote that her co-workers were contemplating a walkout on Black Friday, the big shopping day after Thanksgiving, and others said they were saddened to lose the sense of ownership that the stock compensation provided.Workers said the timing of the change, just as bonuses double for the holiday season, stings. Ms. Iber said a co-worker had told her that he regretted paying down some credit card debt in anticipation of the extra holiday bonus. He worried that without the extra holiday pay, he won\u2019t be able to cover his regular monthly bills.She could sympathize. Last year, Ms. Iber used the holiday season bonuses to pay for insulation in her attic. She was going to get a new water heater this year, but now she\u2019s holding off. She said that she would wait for the heater to break, and that when it did, she\u2019d put the repairs on a credit card.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a benefit formerly provided by Amazon to its full-time employees. The company offered restricted stock units, which are stock grants that vest over time, not stock options, which are the right to purchase shares at a specific price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Possible to Be an Anti-Abortion Democrat? One Woman Tried to Find Out", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. LOUIS \u2014 Joan Barry has been a member of the Missouri Democratic Party for 53 years. As a state legislator, she voted regularly for workers\u2019 rights, health care and programs for the poor.So when the party began writing a new platform after its crushing losses in 2016, Ms. Barry, a member of its state committee, did not think it was too much to ask for a plank that welcomed people like her \u2014 Democrats who oppose abortion.At first the party agreed and added it. Missouri\u2019s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, even called Ms. Barry to praise her.But within days, Ms. Barry began receiving angry emails and Facebook messages. People called her a dinosaur, a has-been and worse. Her children started to worry.\u201cMy daughter called me and said, \u2018Mom, your life is in danger,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barry, 77, said in her home in suburban St. Louis. \u201c\u2018You\u2019d better get some mace.\u2019\u201dFor most of its history, Missouri was a barometer of the American middle. For a century, it voted for the eventual winner of every presidential election except one.But in 2008, Missouri broke with its past, voting against the winning candidate, Barack Obama. By the end of his presidency, Democratic fortunes had declined precipitously, dragged down by raw culture war battles that plagued the state. In 2016, the party lost all but one statewide office seat, including the governorship, according to Terry Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.Democrats hold just over a quarter of the seats in the state\u2019s Legislature. None are in rural districts.This has left Ms. McCaskill \u2014 one of the most endangered Democrats this fall \u2014 in a tricky spot. To win, she must woo what is left of the conservative Democrats, as well as independents and some moderate Republicans. Meanwhile, many progressive voters in Missouri say that now is not the time to compromise, especially in the aftermath of Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court.Perhaps nowhere is this tension more clear in Missouri than on the issue of abortion.\u201cRight now it\u2019s really important to stand for something,\u201d said Carolyn McMahon, a creative director at an ad agency, who was lingering at an event held by the abortion rights group Naral in August at a bar in central St. Louis. \u201cBeing ambiguous is not the way to win votes.\u201dBut older Missouri Democrats say the party cannot rely simply on the energy of a small liberal base.\u201cThe energy of these progressive folks is a small part of the entire electoral picture,\u201d said Jay Nixon, the Democratic former governor of Missouri. \u201cI understand it\u2019s easier to see and analyze and write about, but I do not see it controlling this election or future elections here in Missouri.\u201dHe added of Ms. Barry, who tried to broaden the party\u2019s platform on abortion: \u201cI consider Joan a rational, reasonable person. She was trying to solve problems, not cause them.\u201dAfter the blowout loss in 2016, Democratic Party leaders and activists gathered in a Panera Bread in a Jackson County suburb to contemplate their fate. The talk was honest, and painful.\u201cWe were just sitting there,\u201d said Jalen Anderson, 26, chairman of the platform committee for the Missouri Democratic Party, who got his start in politics in high school volunteering for Mr. Obama. \u201cThe feeling at the time was just defeat. There wasn\u2019t a party anymore really.\u201dEventually, the party decided that the only way forward was to start from scratch, so a group of 15 party members, including Ms. Barry, began traveling the state on a listening tour. They talked to residents in community centers, libraries and union halls about what the party should stand for.Ms. Barry thought her plank might help the party reclaim some districts that seemed hopelessly lost to Republicans.She worried that the Democratic Party had moved too far left on abortion. Gone were the days when the party, under President Bill Clinton, called for abortion to be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d She also noticed fellow Democrats showing contempt for her when they learned her stance on abortion.She recalled a cocktail party conversation with a woman who asked why she was not seeking help from Naral during her run for State Senate in 2008.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cI said, \u2018Oh boy, you know I don\u2019t think that would work,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barry replied. When she explained that she opposed abortion, the woman \u201clooked at me like I had the plague. She had this horrible look on her face of just disgust and she walked away from me.\u201dOn June 30, when dozens of Democratic State Committee members gathered in a university conference room in Jefferson City to vote on the new platform, Ms. Barry nervously introduced her plank. It said that the party recognized \u201cthe diversity of views\u201d on abortion and \u201cwe welcome into our ranks all Missourians who may hold different positions on this issue.\u201dTo her surprise, it passed.Shortly after the vote, Pamela Merritt\u2019s cellphone started pinging with texts. An abortion rights activist who was a member of the platform committee, Ms. Merritt had not attended the vote, but started hearing about it almost immediately from angry friends demanding an explanation.\u201cMy stomach dropped,\u201d said Ms. Merritt, who had agreed to join the committee after the party\u2019s steep losses of 2016, thinking she needed to do more than criticize from the sidelines.In her view, Missouri Democrats needed more progressive politics, not less.\u201cI don\u2019t understand Democrats who quote Truman and F.D.R. and then act like they are terrified to run as an actual Democrat,\u201d said Ms. Merritt, 45, who lives in St. Louis. \u201cYou have to believe in something in order for somebody to believe in you. You can\u2019t be such a watered-down thing.\u201dThe fight over abortion in the party, she said, epitomized that. So she sprang into action, talking on Facebook and Twitter with hundreds of angry progressives, some of whom were threatening to stop their donations, calling her fellow committee members, and ultimately the party\u2019s chairman.\u201cI felt horrified that someone would associate me with that bizarre, regressive anti-woman language,\u201d she said.\u201cThe last thing we needed was for that language to linger,\u201d she said of the plank. \u201cIt was a foul stench that needed to be addressed sooner rather than later.\u201dOn Aug. 11, the Democratic State Committee voted to take the plank out. Ms. Barry felt sad, but she did not leave the party.\u201cI love the Democratic Party and I love what it stands for, but it\u2019s like they were saying you are not part of us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the final nail in the coffin.\u201dAfter praising Ms. Barry for her plank in a message on her home answering machine, Ms. McCaskill stayed silent. Throughout her campaign, she has tried to give the issue of abortion a wide berth, a stance that has infuriated progressives. When she weighed in against Mr. Kavanaugh \u2014 eight days before his explosive Senate hearing with Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 neither abortion nor treatment of women were among her reasons.That is simply savvy politics, said Christopher Kelly, a retired judge from Columbia who served nine terms in the Legislature, several with Ms. McCaskill. He said Ms. McCaskill has a near perfect Democratic voting record on abortion, and believes the struggle points to a larger problem among young progressives.\u201cThey operate in this fantasy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we\u2019re going to have a political renaissance or enlightenment, where everyone is going to decide that their ideas \u2014 the ideas of the lefties \u2014 are now their ideas.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou will not win seats, because even though people might agree with you on some of the issues, you will scare them away. You will seem alien to them.\u201dHe said history does not support the claim that more anti-abortion Democrats in the Legislature translates to less abortion rights. Many of the restrictions have come more recently, he said, since Republicans have gained the majority.\u201cWhen you become contemptuous of conservative Democrats, you promote the election of their opponents,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, who believes it was a mistake to scrap Ms. Barry\u2019s plank. \u201cAnd their opponents are 100 percent worse for the environment, 100 percent worse for working people, 100 percent worse for L.G.B.T. people, for women, for black people, for immigrants.\u201dMs. Merritt admits that some districts may be difficult for Democrats to win, but that is partly because the party has not really tried to persuade people. Candidates need to seize the chance this fall to teach people why Democratic ideas are better, she said.\u201cI believe 110 percent that if we run on full-throated, unapologetic progressive politics, we will win,\u201d she said.She added: \u201cAt a certain point, when you compromise your values, you are not winning. How far are we going to bend over before we tumble and fall?\u201dLynsea Garrison contributed reporting from St. Louis, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Taunt, Kavanaugh\u2019s Defense and How Misogyny Rules", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEThe battle over the Supreme Court nomination is not about truth. It is about who controls meaning. Ms. Mann is a professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon.In the first world, privileged white men get to do with impunity what other men at least have to think twice about, and for women who dare to speak of them, the punishment is swift and devastating. Aggressive sexual behavior toward women, far from disqualifying a candidate for the highest offices in the land, demonstrates the kind of manhood that is felt to be a qualification for such positions (though no one with public power can say this out loud anymore \u2014 only \u201cthe base\u201d can speak clearly).In the second epistemic world, the default position is to believe women who make sexual assault allegations, the good ol\u2019 boys\u2019 network seems ugly and out of date (#timesup), and too often moral outrage substitutes for real thinking, and more important, for real power.That photograph of the panel of 11 white men who represent the Republicans on the judiciary committee for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination provokes such unease in the second epistemic world, because it is the visual representation of the kind of institutionalized white male power that is supposed to be receding into the past. But make no mistake \u2014 the \u201cold\u201d world represented by that photograph is right here, right now, and despite the remarkable gains of the #MeToo movement, it controls every branch of our government.Much of the media spectacle around the Kavanaugh nomination has made it seem as if the epistemic battle is about the truth. She says he did this to her. He says he didn\u2019t. The very notion of a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation reduces the conflict to a battle of credibility \u2014 but we are mistaken if we think the clash of belief is over the facts of the matter. The women who\u2019ve brought the allegations forward and the Democrats who demanded an investigation from the beginning hoped that getting to the truth would break the epistemic impasse.The investigation is going ahead, but the Republicans still hope to win a battle of belief, sealed off from the truth. This suggests that both sides believe the alleged facts are likely to be true. Speakers on Kavanaugh\u2019s behalf have repeatedly betrayed this belief by saying things that imply that even if he did do these things, they are typical rambunctious male behavior and not worth ruining his career over. In identifying the response to the women who have gone public with accusations against Kavanaugh as misogynist rather than sexist, I refer to a helpful distinction made by the philosopher Kate Manne in her book \u201cDown Girl: The Logic of Misogyny.\u201d Whereas sexism justifies patriarchal social arrangements by differentiating between women and men, she points out, misogyny works by differentiating between \u201cgood women\u201d and \u201cbad women,\u201d by rewarding the good ones and punishing the bad. It \u201cshould be understood,\u201d Manne writes, \u201cprimarily as the \u2018law enforcement\u2019 branch of a patriarchal order, which has the overall function of policing and enforcing its governing norms and expectations.\u201d A central mechanism for enforcing these determinations is the deployment of misogynist attacks against women who have stepped out of line by stepping forward to intervene in national politics. These attacks take the form of an attempt to annihilate the women as epistemic subjects. Every stupid remark (\u201cShe admits she was drunk,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s mixed up,\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she report at the time?\u201d) is designed to dismantle her status as a knower. Structuring the hearing as if the accuser were on trial by hiring a sex-crimes prosecutor to question her discloses the real purpose of the process.Misogynist attacks on the one giving testimony also take on the temporal structure of a typical sexual assault, in which time is sped up and pressure to hurry up and do it right now is applied incessantly (\u201cDrink this,\u201d \u201cDrink faster,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gotta have it now,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re holding out on me,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t wait, I just start kissing,\u201d \u201cShove her in the room quick before she knows what\u2019s happening,\u201d \u201cGet her drunk,\u201d \u201cO.K., get in line\u201d). This is typical of all manner of sexual violence against women. While the Republicans made a show of giving Dr. Blasey \u201call the time she needs\u201d during the hearing itself, the entire process has involved a pitched a battle over time, in which the Republicans\u2019 determination to rush the Kavanaugh decision and their outrage over delays echoes and repeats the hurry-up temporality of sexual assault. Kavanaugh himself was enraged by having to wait. \u201cI wanted a hearing the day after the allegation came up,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wanted to be here that day!\u201d I am a 57-year-old full professor of philosophy tenured at a well-respected research institution, who might be tempted to engage in an abstract analysis of these dynamics and leave it at that. This is what we are told \u201cdoing philosophy\u201d entails. But in this case, I must evoke my own experience to get at the deep meaning of such events. So, #MeToo.I was gang raped by my sister\u2019s boyfriend and his friends at what was supposed to be a party. I was 19, a sophomore in college. They were in their 30s, graduate students at another institution. My sister\u2019s boyfriend, whom I considered a trusted friend, and his roommates had invited us to their home. They immediately started pushing shots of tequila on us (\u201churry up,\u201d \u201cdrink more\u201d). I had so little experience with alcohol at that point, I had no idea how fast I could be incapacitated.When we were drunk enough, my sister was escorted away to sleep and I remember the image of her departure and the fear that cut like a knife through the fog. My memories are broken and choppy after that. They are mostly still photographs, even today in sharp focus. At certain points there is a short video burned into my brain; these memories are surrounded by periods of blackness. I don\u2019t know everything that happened that night. I know enough. (This kind of assault is not shocking, to allege such an assault is not outrageous. Julie Swetnick\u2019s claims are not from the \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d they are from a typical American college campus.)Over time, I worked my way into another epistemic world, one which, for all of its problems, is less cruel to women. In this world such events matter because of the harm suffered, because of the injustice they inflict and because they are recognized as one mechanism among many for the reproduction of men\u2019s dominance over women. This world is perhaps bigger than it has ever been before in this #MeToo moment. In this world I can speak.When one makes one\u2019s experience public, however, particularly if one names the perpetrators, particularly if they are powerful white men, the entrenched, material, institutionalized power of that other epistemic world \u2014 as Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick are experiencing now \u2014 slams like a wrecking ball into the very heart of a life.Each of these women got legal counsel before they went public with their stories, took measures to ensure their safety before or just after they did so, and Dr. Blasey took a lie-detector test.In her opening statement for the reopened Kavanaugh hearing, Dr. Blasey described herself as \u201cterrified.\u201d All of this reinforces what their years of silence indicate, that the \u201claw enforcement\u201d branch of patriarchy is alive and well. Aided and abetted by misogyny, presidents are elected, Supreme Court justices are seated. If this nomination succeeds, women\u2019s human rights will be set back for decades. Whatever happens, we owe a debt of gratitude to the women who have stepped up as a matter of civic duty to challenge the epistemic world where such men deserve power, women who are now confronting its well-oiled machinery of misogynist annihilation.Bonnie Mann is a professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon.

{"Headline": "Selling Donald Trump: A First-Time Campaign Manager Tries to Defy the Doubters", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for President Trump\u2019s planned re-election effort in 2020, has never run another political race of any kind. Republican establishment figures are watching him closely, in some cases quietly hoping he stumbles. And he is working for a famously mercurial boss whose 2016 campaign had three shake-ups over six months.But Mr. Parscale believes he is the man for the moment, uniquely equipped to manage the potentially fractious relationships inside the campaign and sell voters on the idea of sticking with an unorthodox president.\u201cI might not be the right choice for everyone, but I am the right choice for him,\u201d Mr. Parscale said.Mr. Parscale, 42, is a professional marketer, and he plans to retain that approach \u2014 one preferred by Mr. Trump, himself the marketer in chief \u2014 heading into 2020. Mr. Parscale acknowledges the gaps in his political curriculum vitae, but says that he has filled some of them, and will enlist the help of political professionals to close the rest.\u201cI would say my weakness is the political encyclopedia, but I don\u2019t think it matters that much for what Trump needs,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Mr. Parscale was the campaign\u2019s digital director in 2016, when Mr. Trump gleefully tossed out much of that political playbook. While Mr. Trump delivered his blunt-force outsider message directly to voters through Twitter, Mr. Parscale integrated Facebook into the campaign to reach millions with finely tuned appeals.\u201cHe knows how to do it in a Trumpian way,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in a brief interview. \u201cHe has the president\u2019s trust and the trust of the family. I can\u2019t think of a better person to run the campaign.\u201dMr. Parscale, a 6-foot-8 native of Kansas whom the president jokingly refers to as an \u201cAmazon,\u201d has developed a rhythm around Mr. Trump, waiting to present and then re-present ideas that he believes in but that the president has vetoed before. On other issues, he is given the freedom to make decisions without seeking nonstop inputs, and execute on them quickly, making him an anomaly in the Trump sphere.The autonomy is a byproduct of knowing he usually has the faith of the family. And that relationship appears to explain why he seems unconcerned by the nagging questions, asked in private by Trump insiders and veteran operatives, about how long he will hold the role, given Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile style.Mr. Parscale said that one of his main roles on the campaign has been to be the person found objectionable by the fewest people. \u201cThe most amazing thing I\u2019ve done is kept everybody from attacking each other,\u201d said Mr. Parscale, a garrulous man who exudes nervous energy. \u201cI\u2019m the cog in the middle that makes it all turn together. And if you pull me out, a lot of other cogs start to fall.\u201dBut his management of those relationships has also had a few bumps \u2014 some in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit believe he has become too much of a public face, including his aggressive Twitter persona and his participation in a flattering profile on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d A recent photo he posted on Twitter of himself with Eric Trump aboard a private plane, flashing a gold watch, drew widespread scorn; Mr. Parscale said he was simply having fun with a friend, and wearing a watch that he had inherited from his father.Several prominent Republicans and some of Mr. Parscale\u2019s former colleagues on the 2016 race \u2014 all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal \u2014 suggested that he might face strong headwinds atop the campaign, given his own inexperience and the desire among political professionals and some of his own colleagues to see him fail.While Mr. Parscale\u2019s connection to the Trump family began years ago with web design work, he bristles at being labeled merely a web designer and notes that his background is in internet marketing, and that the digital strategy he oversaw has been credited by Republicans with helping Mr. Trump win.His company at the time, Giles Parscale, took in more than $90 million from the campaign, the bulk of which went to online advertising \u2014 a sum that enraged Mr. Trump, at least before he won. Since then, Mr. Parscale\u2019s new company, Parscale Strategy, has received six- and seven-figure payments by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and the super PAC supporting the president.It is not clear how much money goes to Mr. Parscale directly; he maintains it is a small percentage.None of Mr. Parscale\u2019s critics were willing to speak on the record, a reflection of the power that he now wields. By contrast, top Republicans wanted to demonstrate support: The Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, said she was in lock step with him, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 House Republican, called himself a \u201cbig fan\u201d and said that Mr. Parscale had shown it was time to abandon the orthodoxy of how campaigns should be run.He tends to think in headline-making concepts, but sometimes Mr. Parscale has failed to consider the potential problems of an unconventional approach. When Roseanne Barr was fired from her ABC show over a racist Twitter post, Mr. Parscale mused about the possibility that she be invited to appear alongside Mr. Trump at his campaign rally later that night. Others quickly rejected the idea. When the acrimonious relationship between Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, reached one of its lowest points, Mr. Parscale jumped into the fray on Twitter, denouncing the cabinet secretary in deeply personal terms and calling for his dismissal, to the dismay of some White House officials.Yet Mr. Parscale also sees the benefits at times of a more conventional approach. He was unnerved by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent Twitter post describing Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, as \u201cHorseface,\u201d according to several people. And Trump allies say Mr. Parscale, like his boss, is far less confrontational in person than the Twitter persona he has created.Mike Shields, a veteran Republican strategist and a former chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, cautioned that the political establishment was making a mistake by waiting for Mr. Parscale to slip up.\u201cPeople in the political sphere are going to underestimate him, and that really benefits him,\u201d Mr. Shields said.\u201cFor years, data and digital operatives in both parties have been fighting to move up from the basement in campaigns to have a seat at the decision-making table,\u201d added Mr. Shields. \u201cIt took President Trump to finally make it happen \u2014 he put a digital marketer in the ultimate position in politics.\u201dMr. Parscale is beginning to staff the campaign, and he expects to get off to a quicker start than previous presidential re-election efforts.Chris Carr, the former party committee political director, will be political director for the campaign. Katrina Pierson, a longtime Trump political aide, and Andy Surabian, a former campaign aide who then worked in the White House, have been hired as advisers. Justin Clark, who was the 2016 deputy political director, and Bill Stepien, who was the national field director, are expected to leave the White House and join the campaign in some capacity. Mr. Clark now leads the Office of Public Liaison, and Mr. Stepien is the White House political director.In the 2016 campaign, Mr. Parscale worked with the party committee at a time of enmity between the two camps. He forged a close working relationship with the party committee\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Katie Walsh, who is married to Mr. Shields, and who still advises the party committee.This time around, the resources will be structured from the start, with communications and digital operations housed at the campaign, in Arlington, Va., and the political, fund-raising and data operations at the party committee headquarters.Mr. Parscale divides his time between Virginia and Florida, where he has purchased personal office space. He insists that he wants to be a low-key presence.\u201cInside Trump world,\u201d Mr. Parscale said, he stays out of the center of attention \u201cbetter than anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The president\u2019s language is unlikely to be helpful to them.Although the president\u2019s comment was striking about Ms. Clifford, who has graphically described Mr. Trump\u2019s genitals in a recent memoir, it was hardly unique.Mr. Trump has accused women of having \u201cfat, ugly\u201d faces and of repelling voters because of their looks. He called one woman a \u201ccrazed, crying lowlife\u201d and said another was a \u201cdog\u201d who had the \u201cface of a pig.\u201d He said Hillary Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during a 2015 presidential debate was \u201ctoo disgusting\u201d to talk about. He has repeatedly mocked women for being overweight.\u201cThis rhetoric is the kind of thing that has turned off college-educated Republican women who voted for Trump in 2016, but have fallen away,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Calling the president\u2019s comment \u201cadolescent,\u201d Ms. Walsh said that \u201cyou cannot continue to be a party in power if the voters that you are appealing to are white men over the age of 60.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s turn toward juvenile mockery illustrates why even those Republicans who were buoyed by the bounce they received in the aftermath of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination were still cautious in their midterm forecasts: One can never guess when this president will veer off message, as he did on Tuesday with Ms. Clifford.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments came before he was elected. Voters learned just weeks before Election Day that he had bragged that he could \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy.\u201d He has continued to make crude comments about women\u2019s bodies since taking office, repeatedly testing the limits of the public\u2019s acceptance of a president\u2019s locker-room vocabulary.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.Here are some of the president\u2019s most remarkable attacks on women over the years:When he attacks women, as he did with Ms. Clifford in his tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump often goes after their faces.The president often expresses his ire by comparing women to animals, an effort to dehumanize his opponents that he also uses against men. At a campaign rally in December 2015, Mr. Trump called attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during an earlier Democratic presidential debate, eliciting cheers from his supporters.Perhaps most common is Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation on the overall appearance of women. He often uses their looks as a way of diminishing their abilities, their intelligence or their effectiveness \u2014 sometimes all three. Attacking a woman\u2019s looks has become his standard response to female critics and rivals.Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist who oversees the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political affairs, pleaded with the president on Tuesday not to get distracted by lashing out at women the way he has in the past.\u201cWe need a strong dose of message discipline out of the White House for the next 20 days,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cIf not, this midterm election becomes a crapshoot.\u201dEmily Cochrane and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Voting Should Be Easy. Why Isn\u2019t It?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor too many Americans, registering to vote is an obstacle course. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.This patchwork is a result of America\u2019s highly decentralized electoral process, which is a good design in many ways, but which leads to a wide variety of voting laws and policies from state to state. Call it the democracy gap.In the places on the wrong side of that gap, it\u2019s confusing and discouraging to potential voters, especially those most likely to have difficulty getting registered and to the polls in the first place. It\u2019s unnecessary, because states have already shown that it\u2019s not difficult to register voters up until \u2014 and on \u2014 Election Day. And it\u2019s the opposite of what the world\u2019s oldest and richest democracy should be doing, which is simple: Make voting as easy and accessible as possible.Why can\u2019t every state get with the program? Partly it\u2019s bureaucratic inertia. Partly it\u2019s incumbents protecting \u201ctheir\u201d electorate. And partly, it\u2019s that our elections are run by partisan political officials \u2014 a terrible idea, as most other modern democracies have figured out. In those countries, election administration is the job of independent commissions or other bodies that are insulated from partisan politics. Here in America, it\u2019s the job of people like Brian Kemp.The Justice Department blocked the first version of the exact-match policy, in 2009, for discriminating against black, Asian and Latino voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act. Four years later, the Supreme Court gutted the heart of the act and paved the way for the policy and other discriminatory measures like it.In the absence of meaningful federal oversight of voting laws, states can take the lead. Many have already taken steps to modernize and streamline their voter-registration systems. It\u2019s not hard, as long as your goal is ensuring that as many people as possible can participate in the political process.Voting in a democracy shouldn\u2019t be a test of your mettle or perseverance. It shouldn\u2019t depend on how much time you can take off from work, away from child care or other obligations. And in 2018, there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be made as easy as possible for everyone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Paralyzed, Three Men Take Steps Again With Spinal Implant", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn experimental, pacemaker-like device offers hope for treating spinal injuries.David Mzee broke his neck in 2010. He was a college student in Zurich at the time, an athlete who enjoyed risk and contact, and he flipped off a trampoline and onto a foam pad. \u201cThe foam pad, it didn\u2019t do its job,\u201d he said.Mr. Mzee, now 33, is one of three men who lost the use of their legs years ago after severe spinal injuries, but who now are able to walk without any supports, if briefly and awkwardly, with the help of a pacemaker-like implant, scientists reported on Wednesday.The breakthrough is the latest achievement in the scientific effort to understand and treat such life-changing injuries. Several recent studies have restored motion to paralyzed or partly paralyzed patients by applying continuous electrical stimulation to the spinal cord.The treatment is still experimental, and its effectiveness for others with complete or partial paralysis is yet to be worked out. The three men had some sensation in their legs before the trial began, and they needed months of intensive training to achieve their first awkward steps. They still rely on wheelchairs; two can walk out in the community, using walkers.Each of them has learned to move previously limp muscles without help from the implant \u2014 an indication that the electrical stimulation prompted nerves to regrow.\u201cAt first everything was new and, of course, exciting, but it took so much work to see any difference,\u201d said Mr. Mzee. \u201cI would go home after rehab, eat, then go straight to bed. Then it got easier to get the movement I wanted, and the biggest step for me was when I could move hands free, for the first time, on the treadmill. I wasn\u2019t able to do that for so many years; it was a really cool feeling.\u201dChet Moritz, a brain scientist at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study, was impressed by the results.\u201cThe exciting thing about these findings is that they hold out the promise that spinal cord injuries can be cured, to an extent that restores walking, and that many movements persist even when stimulation is turned off,\u201d he said.Other researchers cautioned that the study was small, and that the patients were only partly paralyzed. \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way from people being able to access this as standard medical care,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Anderson, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, although she added that the approach had great potential.In recent years, researchers have used brain implants \u2014 electrode chips, placed below the skull on the motor area of the cortex \u2014 to decode neural signals and restore movement in people and nonhuman primates who have lost the use of limbs. Still other scientists are investigating nerve growth factors, chemical compounds that are injected at the site of an injury to promote repair.The authors of the new report, who are based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Lausanne, previously had demonstrated that rats that had lost the use of their hind legs could be trained to run again when continuous current was applied through the spinal cord to the muscles. Other research teams recently have reported that continuous stimulation could also restore some movement in human patients.The three men in the new trial showed more rapid improvements than did most subjects in previous trials, but their injuries were also less severe.\u201cThe key now will be to optimize this technology and the positions for the nerve connections,\u201d said Gregoire Courtine, the senior author of the new report in Nature. \u201cWhen you haven\u2019t walked for many years, you have to learn to walk again.\u201dThe treatment of the men began with surgery. Doctors implanted a small patch of electrodes on the surface of the spinal cord in the lower back, below where each injury had occurred. The patch was connected to a pacemaker device, which was placed in the abdomen.The implanted device, when turned on, delivered bursts of stimulation to individual muscles as they were called into use. The intention to lift a knee generated a certain pattern of nerve firing; stepping forward generated a different one. In effect, the device provided the pattern of stimulation that the body delivered before the injury occurred. Over time \u2014 with intensive physical therapy, on a treadmill with hand supports \u2014 the stimulation appeared to engage the brain\u2019s motor cortex through nerves that were spared from injury, Dr. Courtine said.\u201cIn the animal studies, the reorganization in the brain was really massive,\u201d Dr. Courtine said. \u201cThere were a lot of new connections from the motor cortex to brain stem.\u201d The same would be expected in humans, he said.After his injury, Mr. Mzee began playing wheelchair rugby, and soon made the national team. The injury also plunged him into research of his own; through a doctor, he learned of the program in Lausanne, and the animal experiments. When he heard that a human trial was in the works, he quickly enlisted.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say what\u2019s coming next for me,\u201d Mr. Mzee said. \u201cI think the next step will have to be a huge one, and one of the problems is that I have to have some trunk control. My trunk is not well-balanced. I\u2019m trying to set up a body support system at home to do more rehab but, you know, it\u2019s expensive. I\u2019m still not steady without those supports.\u201dEven so, rehab \u2014 the hard work, sweat and discipline that have proved so helpful for many patients \u2014 will be essential to the recovery process. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for years that people\u201d with partial paralysis can respond to rehabilitation, Dr. Anderson said. \u201cThe problem comes down to access; long-term rehabilitation in the chronic setting is not paid for by very many insurers. As a result, most people with motor incomplete injuries do not recover to their fullest potential.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The moment of greatness will soon arrive for millennials. But they have to vote. Contributing Opinion Writer Mocking millennials has become a sport and a pastime. You\u2019ve heard most of the complaints: about the trophies for showing up, the Instagramming of tedium, the use of Venmo to buy street drugs.They ruined lunch, motorcycles and marriage. They gave us selfies at funerals and placenta pix from the delivery room. As they move into the dominant demographic position in American life, they\u2019ve made doorbells obsolete (better to text), vacations pass\u00e9 (too busy) and face-to-face conversations a lost art (see doorbells).They prefer liquid soap to a simple bar. They\u2019re killing the Post Office, phasing out breakfast cereal, dashing dinner dates. Ditto mayonnaise; in the era of identity condiments, it\u2019s too bland. They\u2019re the Lamest Generation. And worst of all, they don\u2019t vote.That is bogus. Boomers gave us Donald Trump, the draft-dodging, tax-evading, wife-cheating poster child for \u201960s-bred self-indulgence. It\u2019s boomers who are bankrupting the nation with a trillion-dollar deficit from a selfish tax cut.

They would see things as they are, and instead of asking why, dream of things that never were and ask why not \u2014 as Robert Kennedy promised. Allow me to burn my generational card.The numbers tell a shameful story. Barely half of all eligible millennial voters cast a ballot in the last presidential election, compared with nearly 70 percent of baby boomers and the two generations older than them.Are millennials just going to take that kind of abuse? Are they no better than that empty husk of a man, Senator Ted Cruz, who let Donald Trump insult his wife and accuse his father of involvement in the Kennedy assassination? Have they no pride?Right now we have government by an entitled, pampered and aging minority. Barely 46 percent of the popular vote put Trump in office. And senators representing 44 percent of the population just gave a man whose views are not shared by a majority a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.Government by the few and the well connected will continue so long as the emerging majority does not exercise the most powerful option for a citizen. The good news is that turnout increases by about 1 percent each year. But we can\u2019t afford to wait.

{"Headline": "How to Punish Voters", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prosecution of individual voters for fraud is a trend that seems intended to intimidate. Ms. Duffy Rice is a lawyer and a criminal justice reporter.Even as Mr. Kemp claims his draconian voting policies are intended to prevent fraud, it\u2019s clear that his real aim is to weaken black voting power in a state where political affiliation is largely dictated by race. He has warned his fellow Republicans about Democrats \u201cregistering all these minority voters.\u201d Mr. Kemp\u2019s attempts to prevent people from voting exemplify the familiar ways in which access to the ballot has been restricted for people of color across the United States. But voter suppression also happens in ways that aren\u2019t as well-known, and are even more insidious. In particular, local prosecutors have increasingly brought criminal charges against black voters and community activists for small technical infractions. They\u2019re sending the frightening message that casting a ballot is risky \u2014 a message that resonates even when the charges turn out to be baseless and the people charged are acquitted.Almost four years later, Ms. Pearson received a letter from District Attorney George Barnhill\u2019s office, informing her that she was facing felony charges for improperly assisting Ms. Robinson. The city councilwoman and community leader was arrested and booked. She had never been in trouble with the law, but now she found herself facing up to 15 years in prison.Ms. Pearson was not accused of telling Ms. Robinson whom to vote for. She didn\u2019t help her cast her ballot or even touch her machine. Prosecutors did not allege that the brief interaction between the two women impacted Robinson\u2019s decisions in the voter booth. Rather, they insisted that because Ms. Robinson was not illiterate or disabled, she had not been entitled to even minimal verbal assistance.But Ms. Pearson\u2019s case, while extreme, can nonetheless be seen as evidence of a disturbing trend. Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said prosecutors are increasingly preying on \u201crespected community leaders\u201d in rural areas where they \u201canticipate people will not be able to shine a bright spotlight on what\u2019s happened.\u201dConservatives often claim there\u2019s a need for new laws and more punishments because of voter fraud. After losing the popular vote by three million votes, President Trump claimed \u2014 without a stitch of evidence \u2014 that millions of people had voted illegally.It\u2019s not hard to conclude that what Mr. Trump, Mr. Kemp and their ilk are worried about is not voter fraud but access to the ballot for minorities and Democrats. This attitude helps explain why Ms. Pearson was apparently the first person ever tried for \u201cimproper assistance in casting a ballot,\u201d phrasing that does not even appear in Georgia\u2019s criminal statutes. (Prosecutors eventually dropped that charge, after the defense said that the state had \u201cattempted to fashion a criminal offense by cobbling together parts of four statutes.\u201d) Over the next two years, Ms. Pearson navigated two trials, two defense counsels, three dropped charges and one hung jury. Finally, in late February, after a 20-minute jury deliberation, she was acquitted of all charges. Six years after her brief interaction with Ms. Robinson, she was finally free.\u201cThis was without a doubt a racially motivated targeted prosecution of a woman who was exercising her right to get out the vote in her community,\u201d said Sarah Geraghty, managing attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights and one of Ms. Pearson\u2019s lawyers.\u201cI was tried because I\u2019m black and outspoken,\u201d Ms. Pearson told me.The acquittal was a victory for Ms. Pearson. But it was also a victory for voter suppression. As Election Day approaches, it\u2019s essential to remember that consequences of prosecutions like hers radiate far beyond the defendant, making entire communities question whether it\u2019s worth the risk to engage in one of the most sacred rights in a democratic society.As Ms. Clarke at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee put it, \u201cEven when these prosecutions result in acquittal, the damage is done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Orwell to \u2018Little Mermaid,\u2019 Kuwait Steps Up Book Banning", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid had no fig leaf, and the mermaid, alas, wore half a bikini.\u201cThere are no hijab-wearing mermaids,\u201d said Shamayel al-Sharikh, a Kuwaiti women\u2019s activist. \u201cThe powers that be thought her dress was promiscuous. It\u2019s humiliating.\u201dKuwaitis like to think of their country as an enclave of intellectual freedom in the conservative Persian Gulf, a haven that once welcomed exiled Arab writers. But that self-image is becoming harder to sustain.Responding to the demands of a growing conservative bloc in Parliament, the government is increasingly banning books.In August, the government acknowledged that it had banned 4,390 books since 2014, hundreds of them this year, including many works of literature that had once been considered untouchable, setting off street demonstrations and online protests.If all that seems rather Orwellian, George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d is also banned, in at least one Arabic translation, though it is allowed in another.Kuwaiti readers have struck back with a mix of brio and scornful mirth. Some posted photographs on Twitter and Facebook of piles of banned books they have in their home libraries.Authors suggested that online delivery services from abroad could evade the ban, which applies mostly to bookstores and local publishers. \u201cNow books are becoming like drugs,\u201d said Hind Francis, an activist with a Kuwait anti-censorship group called Meem3. \u201cYou have to have your banned-book dealer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, but we tell them we\u2019ll keep it to only an hour,\u201d said Fatima Matar, a law professor and a founder of the protest effort.With the country\u2019s book fair \u2014 the third largest in the Arab world, after Cairo and Beirut \u2014 scheduled in November, officials have pushed back. \u201cThere is no book banning in Kuwait,\u201d read a recent statement by the Ministry of Information. \u201cThere is a book censorship committee that reviews all books.\u201dAn assistant minister of information, Muhammad Abdul Mohsen al-Awash, elaborated. \u201cIn Kuwait, over the past five years only 4,300 books were banned out of 208,000 books \u2014 that means only 2 percent are banned and 98 percent are approved,\u201d he said. \u201cSome books are being banned in the U.S., Europe, Beirut and other countries, too.\u201dIn the past 11 months, he said, 3,600 books were approved by censors, while 700 were banned.Yet, he insisted, \u201csince its inception, Kuwait has always been known for its sponsorship of literature and culture.\u201d\u201cThat cultural hub just cannot happen when you have a book massacre like this, all these books being banned,\u201d said Bothyana Al-Essa, a Kuwaiti author whose book \u201cMaps of Wandering\u201d was banned. Kuwaiti censors banned the book over a child abuse scene set in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, she said, but the Saudis never banned the book in their country, where it was a best seller.Bans have for the first time extended to many international books and reference books already on Kuwaiti shelves, at least in part because of parliamentary pressure, critics say.\u201cThis year they\u2019ve gone into the ridiculous,\u201d said Ms. Sharikh. \u201cChildren\u2019s stories and books by Kuwaiti authors.\u201d Even works produced by the government\u2019s own publishing house in the Public Council for Culture, Arts and Literature have been banned, such as a scientific study of hymens, according to Ms. Francis.Kuwait\u2019s history of literary freedom is, activists say, the reason book banning is so distressing to the intelligentsia. \u201cKuwait has had a significant amount of progress when it comes to civil liberties,\u201d Ms. Sharikh said. \u201cWe are the trendsetters in the Gulf region and have been for many decades.\u201dThe Kuwaiti Parliament is the most independent in the Gulf, but that has also become the problem, bibliophiles complain. In effect, \u201cdemocracy has become the enemy of democracy,\u201d Ms. Matar said. \u201cThey believe we should all think alike.\u201dBecause Kuwait\u2019s parliament has the authority to call a vote of confidence on individual ministers, and has forced resignations, the ministers tread carefully, especially on explosive social issues.Authors and their supporters say the Ministry of Information has responded to parliamentary pressure by giving the censors sweeping powers to ban books, even though the Kuwaiti Constitution guarantees intellectual freedom.Arwa Alwagayan, a Kuwaiti author, said her book \u201cBe Well\u201d was banned because of a passage that said the Islamic State was attracting teenagers \u201cin the mosques.\u201d The censors demanded she change that to \u201cin some mosques,\u201d and she refused.For some local authors, having their books banned has created a sales opportunity. After Mohamed Ghazi\u2019s book \u201cBlue\u201d was banned over a passage on Page 56, Mr. Ghazi, an Iraqi who writes in English and lives in Kuwait, used Twitter to invite readers to buy it to find out why. His sales more than doubled, he said.Such defiance is rife. Many banned books are still on sale in bookstores in Kuwait; recently, at the country\u2019s largest, the Jarir Bookstore in Shamiya, there were books on display by M\u00e1rquez and Orwell, along with one not-very-risqu\u00e9 copy of Hans Christian Anderson\u2019s bikini-clad mermaid.But other outlets, mindful of heavy fines, are removing offending titles.\u201cIt\u2019s happening gradually, but slowly and surely books are disappearing,\u201d Ms. Matar said. New books by Kuwaiti authors are especially vulnerable, because if banned they cannot be printed and distributed. Ms. Matar\u2019s book of poetry was banned from sale when she refused to delete an offending line, she said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get to that stage where we go to our bookshops and only find cookbooks and books about Shariah law,\u201d she said.Underground banned-book dealers are already doing a brisk business serving literary scofflaws. Many use Instagram\u2019s disappearing photo feature to display their wares, take orders and stay a step ahead of the law, according to one young author who said he supplements his income that way.At a bookstore in Kuwait City, the proprietor showed off a secret cupboard full of contraband books behind the cash register and a basement storeroom with even more. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that book banning helps book sales,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a bookseller, I can tell you I would much rather have the books out on display.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.Advertisement"}

In the face of feckless and corrupt people, there are better options.Opinion ColumnistSurveying the American scene in the run-up to the midterm elections early next month, it is hard to escape that word: desperation. This time the barbarians are not shabby. They are well groomed, well heeled, loud-mouthed; and they never heard a chord, or read a phrase, or saw a sensuous line on a canvas that caused them to pause in wonder.These barbarians chose their moment well. The Empire-lite has not known a victory in far-flung wars in all the 17 years since it was attacked. The millions who served at distant, tedious frontiers were scarcely recognized on their return. They trudged their trauma home in sullen silence.They watched, these unacknowledged servants of the imperial Republic, as certainties evaporated and precariousness spread and words lost meaning and money rode roughshod over sacrifice. The mood in the Empire was restive, ripe for a self-declared savior ready to deploy the language of violence and identify scapegoats.In due course, along came the barbarian savior, marching across the ramparts, through the gates of the capital, and declaring the rapt crowd to be the largest in recorded history. He had been chosen to blow up the whole place. He set about his task with vigor.What can be said at this point about the self-styled savior? He is a man of fiendish energy and malicious intuitions who gets the blood up by appealing to the barbarian in us all. He says he wants to make the Empire great again, but all he really wants to do is to loot it on the way down. His Republican cronies enable him because their love of power blinds them to the contagion they propagate.The barbarian savior loves to see a reporter body-slammed, to parade his ignorance, to strut his lies, to broadcast his bigotry, to empower rich Middle Eastern murderers, to humiliate a woman traumatized by sexual assault, to incite his followers to violence, to sap civilization, to toy with nuclear Armageddon as a distraction from his scam.\u201cThroughout a trying period he and I have managed to behave towards each other like civilized people.

{"Headline": "Russian Meddling Is a Symptom, Not the Disease", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore worrisome than foreign interference in our elections is how our own tech and media companies feed and profit from our deepening domestic political polarization.Dr. Tufekci is a professor who studies the social effects of technology.Given the credible evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s only natural that Americans are concerned about the possibility of further foreign interference, especially as the midterms draw closer.But I worry that we\u2019re focusing too much on the foreign part of the problem \u2014 in which social media accounts and pages controlled by overseas \u201ctroll factories\u201d post false and divisive material \u2014 and not enough on how our own domestic political polarization feeds into the basic business model of companies like Facebook and YouTube.It\u2019s this interaction \u2014 both aspects of which are homegrown \u2014 that fosters the dissemination of false and divisive material, and this will persist as a major problem even in the absence of concerted foreign efforts.Consider some telling exchanges from this year\u2019s Senate hearings involving high-level executives from Facebook and Twitter. (Google, which owns YouTube, didn\u2019t bother sending a comparable representative.) In April, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, pressed Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on how much money the company had made by ads placed by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory. Mr. Zuckerberg replied that it was about $100,000 \u2014 a negligible amount of money for the company.Last month, Ms. Harris further grilled Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, on this point, demanding to know how much inauthentic Russian content was on Facebook. Ms. Sandberg had her sound bite ready, saying that \u201cany amount is too much,\u201d but she ultimately threw out an estimate of .004 percent, another negligible amount.Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have business models that thrive on the outrageous, the incendiary and the eye-catching, because such content generates \u201cengagement\u201d and captures our attention, which the platforms then sell to advertisers, paired with extensive data on users that allow advertisers (and propagandists) to \u201cmicrotarget\u201d us at an individual level.Traditional media outlets, of course, are frequently also cynical manipulators of sensationalistic content, but social media is better able to weaponize it. Algorithms can measure what content best \u201cengages\u201d each user and can target him or her individually in a way that the sleaziest editor of a broadcast medium could only dream of.Mr. Parscale said that Facebook turned out to be so useful that the Trump campaign spent most of its budget of $94 million on the platform, and in response, Facebook helpfully embedded staff members with the Trump campaign (as it does with major advertisers) to help it spend its money more effectively.Microtargeting, while lucrative for Silicon Valley, brings with it many other problems. Investigators at ProPublica found that Facebook was allowing advertisers to post job and housing ads that specifically excluded African-Americans, and even made it possible for people to select \u201cJew-haters\u201d as a category to reach with paid messaging. The American Civil Liberties Union found that Facebook was allowing employers to show jobs only to men or to younger employees \u2014 excluding women and older workers.In response to a barrage of criticism, Facebook has agreed to make all advertisements on its site available on a public database and limit some forms of microtargeting, but we still don\u2019t know exactly what happened in 2016: What features of Facebook were used to help the Trump campaign find the voters who could be subject to this \u201cvoter suppression\u201d effort? How was the platform used to test the messages that might be most effective at this?Wall Street is under no illusion about how things work for these companies. When Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would try to do better \u2014 even if it hurt profits \u2014 and when Twitter started purging bots, bringing down the number of \u201cusers\u201d the company can report, their stock prices dropped because of worries about their long-term profitability.It is understandable that legislators and the public are concerned about other countries meddling in our elections. But foreign meddling is to our politics what a fever is to tuberculosis: a mere symptom of a deeper problem. To heal, we need the correct diagnosis followed by action that treats the underlying diseases. The closer our legislators look at our own domestic politics as well as Silicon Valley\u2019s business model, the better the answers they will find.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats paid a political cost for decades after F.D.R. tried it in the 1930s. They probably would again. Packing the Supreme Court is back in the news. Frustrated with the rightward drift of the courts under President Trump, a growing number of liberals are contemplating the possibility of expanding the size of the Supreme Court should they regain power in 2020.Liberals are considering the bold step because, they argue, the rightward shift in the judiciary has been obtained by a president operating under a cloud of illegitimacy and with the benefit of minority rule in the Senate. But the political risks for such a move by Democrats would be enormous, and potentially long-lasting.An expansion of the Supreme Court is possible: The Constitution does not specify the number of justices who should serve. Even if Democrats fail in passing legislation to expand the court, proponents argue, the effort would still have a salutary effect by pressuring Chief Justice John Roberts to moderate his colleagues toward the center.For precedent, they point to a similar move by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After a Democratic landslide victory in 1936, Roosevelt tried to tame the Supreme Court. In his first term, the Democratic Congress had enacted a sweeping New Deal agenda that included economic regulations, protections for organized labor, public works spending and social safety net policies. But the Supreme Court ruled against two major programs \u2014 the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Eager to take advantage of the election results, he proposed legislation that would allow the president to appoint an additional justice, up to a maximum of six, for every member of the court who was over age 70.The proposal immediately triggered a political backlash. Conservatives were up in arms. They spoke of a \u201cdictatorship\u201d under Roosevelt, who they said was trying to achieve a \u201cbloodless coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Senator Josiah Bailey of North Carolina warned in a national radio address that the Supreme Court and the Constitution were under threat: \u201cTo weaken either is to weaken the foundations of our Republic. To destroy either is to destroy the Republic.\u201dAfter several weeks of deliberation, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10 to 8 to send the bill to the floor with a negative recommendation. \u201cThe bill is an invasion of judicial power such as has never before been attempted in this country,\u201d the majority stated upon sending its recommendation to the floor. Polls revealed that a majority of Americans consistently opposed the plan.But the benefits of the move also came, critically, with enormous political costs that liberals would pay for almost four decades.The court battle was a huge reversal of fortune for Roosevelt. Starting with the 1938 midterm elections, a coalition of Southern Democratic committee chairmen and Republicans came to power. They broke with the president by forming a powerful congressional voting bloc that had the muscle to stifle major initiatives at the high point of the liberal era.Health care and civil rights legislation, for instance, were two issues that the coalition held hostage. Southern committee chairmen worked with ranking Republicans to prevent legislation from ever reaching the floor. Senator James Eastland of Mississippi joked about special pockets that he had put into his pants to carry around the civil rights bills that he never allowed to come up for a vote. When bills did reach the Senate, the coalition joined forces to filibuster. The columnist William White called the Senate the \u201cSouth\u2019s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.\u201d The only real break for liberals finally came in 1964 and 1965, when an enormous grass-roots civil rights movement and huge Democratic majorities put into office during the 1964 election gave President Lyndon Johnson a brief window to pass Great Society legislation \u2014 a window that largely closed with the midterms in 1966. Ultimately, the conservative coalition that was born out of Roosevelt\u2019s court-packing battles came apart only when congressional reforms in the mid-1970s brought the committee era to an end.If Democrats place their bets on court-packing once again, the political backlash would probably be even more severe. The right now possesses huge institutional weapons \u2014 national news media outlets, well-established interest groups and think tanks, and vast sources of campaign money \u2014 that could quickly be deployed. They have invested heavily in reshaping the courts over the past few decades. Given that the Republicans have tended to care about the courts more than liberals, it is likely that court packing could be more effective at energizing Republicans than Democrats. Even if there is a Democratic Congress before 2020, proponents will never find the two-thirds support needed to overturn a presidential veto.If liberals want to change the direction of the courts, they should do more to replicate the kind of long-term projects their opponents have undertaken since the 1980s to nurture judicial talent and create a deep pool for future appointments. Liberals need to do better at using congressional procedure and handling open hearings to diminish political support for conservative nominees \u2014 and obviously they need to win elections, starting in November. Liberals must realize that without doing more to build effective grass-roots political campaigns in the home states of swing senators, the political logic of partisanship will rarely result in so-called moderates acting in \u201cmoderate\u201d ways.As much as liberals yearn for a dramatic plan like court packing that might in the near term break the lock that the right has on the judiciary, it would in the end strengthen the political forces fighting to dismantle voting rights, gun control, environmental regulation, abortion rights and the legacies of the New Deal and the Great Society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Genocide Incited on Facebook, With Posts From Myanmar\u2019s Military", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man.The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.Working in shifts out of bases clustered in foothills near the capital, Naypyidaw, officers were also tasked with collecting intelligence on popular accounts and criticizing posts unfavorable to the military, the people said. So secretive were the operations that all but top leaders had to check their phones at the door.Facebook confirmed many of the details about the shadowy, military-driven campaign. The company\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said it had found \u201cclear and deliberate attempts to covertly spread propaganda that were directly linked to the Myanmar military.\u201dOn Monday, after questions from The New York Times, it said it had taken down a series of accounts that supposedly were focused on entertainment but were instead tied to the military. Those accounts had 1.3 million followers.\u201cWe discovered that these seemingly independent entertainment, beauty and informational pages were linked to the Myanmar military,\u201d the company said in its announcement.\u201cThe military has gotten a lot of benefit from Facebook,\u201d said Thet Swe Win, founder of Synergy, a group that focuses on fostering social harmony in Myanmar. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Facebook is directly involved in the ethnic cleansing, but there is a responsibility they had to take proper actions to avoid becoming an instigator of genocide.\u201d\u201cWe have taken significant steps to remove this abuse and make it harder on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said. \u201cInvestigations into this type of activity are ongoing.\u201dThe information committee of Myanmar\u2019s military did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The Myanmar military\u2019s Facebook operation began several years ago, said the people familiar with how it worked. The military threw major resources at the task, the people said, with as many as 700 people on it.Those then became distribution channels for lurid photos, false news and inflammatory posts, often aimed at Myanmar\u2019s Muslims, the people said. Troll accounts run by the military helped spread the content, shout down critics and fuel arguments between commenters to rile people up. Often, they posted sham photos of corpses that they said were evidence of Rohingya-perpetrated massacres, said one of the people.Digital fingerprints showed that one major source of the Facebook content came from areas outside Naypyidaw, where the military keeps compounds, some of the people said.Some military personnel on the effort suffered from low morale, said two of the people, in part because of the need to spread unfounded rumors about people like Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and Myanmar\u2019s de facto civilian leader, to hurt their credibility. One hoax used a real photo of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi in a wheelchair and paired it with false suggestions that she had gone to South Korea for Botox injections, the people said.The Facebook page of the sniper, Mr. Ohn Maung, offers one example of the military\u2019s tactics. It gained a large following because of his descriptions of the day-to-day life of a soldier. The account was ultimately taken over by a military team to pump out propaganda, such as posts portraying Rohingya as terrorists, said two of the people.One of the most dangerous campaigns came in 2017, when the military\u2019s intelligence arm spread rumors on Facebook to both Muslim and Buddhist groups that an attack from the other side was imminent, said two people. Making use of the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, it spread warnings on Facebook Messenger via widely followed accounts masquerading as news sites and celebrity fan pages that \u201cjihad attacks\u201d would be carried out. To Muslim groups it spread a separate message that nationalist Buddhist monks were organizing anti-Muslim protests.The purpose of the campaign, which set the country on edge, was to generate widespread feelings of vulnerability and fear that could be salved only by the military\u2019s protection, said researchers who followed the tactics.Facebook said it had found evidence that the messages were being intentionally spread by inauthentic accounts and took some down at the time. It did not investigate any link to the military at that point.The military tapped its rich history of psychological warfare that it developed during the decades when Myanmar was controlled by a military junta, which gave up power in 2011. The goal then was to discredit radio broadcasts from the BBC and Voice of America. One veteran of that era said classes on advanced psychological warfare from 15 years ago taught a golden rule for false news: If one quarter of the content is true, that helps make the rest of it believable.Some military personnel picked up techniques from Russia. Three people familiar with the situation said some officers had studied psychological warfare, hacking and other computer skills in Russia. Some would give lectures to pass along the information when they returned, one person said.The Myanmar military\u2019s links to Russia go back decades, but around 2000, it began sending large groups of officers to the country to study, said researchers. Soldiers stationed in Russia for training opened blogs and got into arguments with Burmese political exiles in places like Singapore.The campaign in Myanmar looked similar to online influence campaigns from Russia, said Myat Thu, a researcher who studies false news and propaganda on Facebook. One technique involved fake accounts with few followers spewing venomous comments beneath posts and sharing misinformation posted by more popular accounts to help them spread rapidly.Human rights groups focused on the Facebook page called Opposite Eyes, which began as a blog about a decade ago and then leapt to the social network. By then, the military was behind it, said two people. The blog provided a mix of military news, like hype about the purchase of new Russian fighter jets, and posts attacking ethnic minority groups like the Rohingya.At times, according to Moe Htet Nay, an activist who kept tabs on it, the ties of the Opposite Eyes Facebook page to the military spilled into the open. Once, it wrote about a military victory in Myanmar\u2019s Kachin State before the news became public. Below the post, a senior officer wrote that the information was not public and should be taken down. It was.\u201cIt was very systematic,\u201d said Mr. Moe Htet Nay, adding that other Facebook accounts reposted everything that the blog wrote, spreading its message further. Although Facebook has taken the page down, the hashtag #Oppositeyes still brings up anti-Rohingya posts.Today, both Facebook and Myanmar\u2019s civilian leaders said they were keenly aware of the power of the platform.\u201cFacebook in Myanmar? I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Oo Hla Saw, a legislator. \u201cIt\u2019s been dangerous and harmful for our democratic transition.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}

The results of the investigation the F.B.I. is undertaking into the sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh may objectively disqualify or vindicate President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court. Regardless, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s extraordinary hearing on Thursday has already uncovered vital evidence about his suitability for the bench: the injudicious temperament he displayed. The eruption of Mount Kavanaugh raises questions about judicial temperament that may be enough on their own to resolve the nomination.Mr. Kavanaugh fulminated: The process was \u201ca national disgrace.\u201d He interrupted. \u201cWhat do you like to drink?\u201d he demanded of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He invoked old political disputes and argued that the accusations against him were fueled by \u201cpent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election\u201d and \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons.\u201d He appeared to level fresh political threats: \u201cAnd as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around.\u201dThese qualities endeared him to President Trump, at least for a while. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s performance \u201cshowed America exactly why I nominated him,\u201d the president tweeted. Retribution and distemper \u2014 even under extraordinary stress, which can obscure but also amplify a person\u2019s character \u2014 are not qualities one should seek in a Supreme Court justice or a judge of any kind. Judge Kavanaugh was not calling balls and strikes. He was swinging wildly at the ball.This is not about whether an originalist should replace Justice Anthony Kennedy. One almost certainly will. President Trump has confined himself to a list of them, and Senate Republicans have months left to confirm one, at the very least. It is about whether that justice will have both the ability and, crucially, the credibility to render neutral judgments of law. This is also true for the court as a whole, especially in an environment in which groups of justices in both wings of the institution are perceived as political factions that deliver for the parties by which they were nominated.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]Judges are permitted human emotions, of course. What they are not permitted is the expression of partisan sentiments in official settings. A judicial temperament ideally includes maintaining one\u2019s composure. Most important, it entails an ability to set aside one\u2019s preferences in favor of law and the grace to be seen as doing so.The constitutional framer and early Supreme Court Justice James Wilson said judges \u201cought to be placed in such a situation, as not only to be, but likewise to appear superior to every extrinsic circumstance, which can be supposed to have the smallest operation upon their understandings, or their inclinations.\u201d That is, being objective is not enough. One must also appear to be. Would an adverse opinion written by a Justice Kavanaugh against a Democrat be regarded as equal justice under law or what went around coming around?That is why the most revealing element of Thursday\u2019s hearing was not Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s response to sexual assault allegations \u2014 his denial was already well known \u2014 but rather his manner of delivery. It is perhaps unfair to expect Judge Kavanaugh, facing serious allegations that he asserts have slandered and disgraced him, to slow-play his response. But there is no civil right to serve on the Supreme Court. The question is not what is fair to Judge Kavanaugh but rather what is constitutionally healthiest for the republic. Judicial confirmation hearings are auditions for serving as a judge. Judge Kavanaugh showed himself to be up to fighting when attacked, but less so to judging dispassionately.There is no glory for either side in these wars. One searches in vain for combatants who had not reached conclusions that conformed to their partisan or judicial views well before either Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or Judge Kavanaugh was heard. Democrats have been silent as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made comments, some striking, that intrude clearly into the realm of politics. As Democrats set precedents now, they should remember that a Democratic president will nominate justices in the future.The contest over Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is the latest battle in a political version of Thomas Hobbes\u2019s war of all against all. The urgency of all sides trying to win at all costs is evidence of an increasingly swollen judiciary. Too much power is changing hands with each vacancy.Politically speaking, who did what to whom, and who did it first, is an unanswerable question whose pursuit will only fuel the cycle. The point at the moment is that Judge Kavanaugh had a choice between accelerating the combat \u2014 clearly Mr. Trump\u2019s method \u2014 and declining to join while still defending his name. The latter course would have accomplished dual goals: refuting the accusations while acting like an occupant of the office to which he aspires.That choice confronts any public figure, but judges are constrained in their permissible responses. It is true the accusations have indelibly tainted Judge Kavanaugh. That the truth appears to be unknowable with objective certainty adds an element of tragedy to the situation.But it is equally true that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s response to the allegations has tainted his qualifications for the office he seeks. If he is confirmed, it will also taint the institution he hopes to join and not only because his opponents \u2014 they, too, are combatants in this continual war \u2014 will use it to question every vote he casts on the court that even vaguely touches on a political issue.There is, again, no glory to be had. Perhaps the F.B.I. will uncover useful evidence about what happened 36 years ago. But to advise and consent to his nomination, the issue the Senate must resolve is not merely how Brett Kavanaugh behaved in 1982. It is how Judge Kavanaugh comported himself in 2018, on television. Whatever else we can say, he did not act like a justice of the highest court in the land.Advertisement"}

The airline said that 27 credit card numbers \u2014 but not their corresponding security codes \u2014 had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers.\u201cThe safety and security of our passengers remains our top priority,\u201d said Rupert Hogg, the carrier\u2019s chief executive.As Asia\u2019s economic might has grown over the last half-century, Cathay has become a major carrier in the region, one known globally for its customer service. Last year it carried nearly 35 million passengers to around 200 destinations in more than 50 countries or territories. But the security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder.Cathay has faced growing competition in the region from low-cost carriers and other emerging rivals, and has been losing money for the past two years. Its shares fell in Hong Kong trading on Thursday.Airlines are juicy targets for hackers, with their vast stores of information not only on people\u2019s identities and credit cards, but also on where they have been.Still, the types of information in Cathay\u2019s systems that were compromised could be particularly useful to malicious agents.

{"Headline": "Neighbor Bro Smashes My Romantic Fantasy", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveShe hoped her new apartment would lead to a relationship within its walls, not a parade of hookups outside of them.\u201cAre you sure you can afford it?\u201d she asked as I signed the contract. \u201cMaybe your boyfriend will move in and help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d I said.\u201cLili was alone when she moved in,\u201d she said, referring to the previous tenant who had shown me the apartment. \u201cBut then she met Nathan and they lived there for five years.\u201d She leaned in closer. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have a boyfriend now, but you will soon.\u201d Then she winked, as if to say: It worked for Lili; it will work for you too.The apartment was big and cheap for Bushwick, with exposed brick and wood floors that were perfectly distressed. It was a good place to live alone \u2014 on a busy street that felt safe at night, and within five subway stops of my closest friends. But it was also big enough for two people, with a bonus room in the middle of the apartment and an extra closet for spare clothing.As someone who could be described as super single, I felt optimistic about a place seemingly so eager to accommodate a couple.The apartment was also a short walk from a loft rented by two friends of mine and a rotation of roommates who occupied the extra bedrooms. Most of the people I got to know my first year in the city I had met at parties at the loft, and every man I dated or thought about dating in Brooklyn had lived there. The loft was like a gallery of romantic prospects for me, and living nearby seemed like a move in the right direction.Even though I could barely afford the rent, I treated my apartment like my forever home. I caulked the drafty windows. I hung wall art. I bought furniture for the space that was once a second bedroom and now would be an underutilized formal dining room.One day I came home to an Amazon Prime delivery in Lili\u2019s name, somehow mistakenly delivered to the address long after she moved. A couple months later, after several unsuccessful attempts to return the package, I finally opened it. Inside were two throw blankets and a teakettle similar to ones I\u2019d been planning to buy for myself. It was like a housewarming gift paid backward.Somehow, though, none of this had the desired effect on my love life. One man was so intimidated to see that I owned not only a microwave but also a table to put it on, that he immediately demanded to know my salary. (Less than his, which he took as a relief). Another tried to give his unwanted furniture to me when he moved out of the loft because I had the space for it. (I took a clothing rack and refused the rest.)On a visit home to Michigan I met up with a friend for dinner to complain about my perpetual singleness.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re supposed to meet anyone,\u201d she said.I described the loft as a factory churning out eligible men for me, when in fact it had produced only a few failed prospects.She was no stranger to romantic disappointment herself but had recently met the love of her life, quickly adopting the beatific optimism of the well paired.\u201cMaybe someone new will move in,\u201d she said. But when I told her the loft was about to be emptied of tenants and renovated, she burst out laughing despite herself.\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, repeating what was becoming a mantra. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t someone for everyone. Lots of people end up alone.\u201dSoon the new owners began their work on the loft, reconfiguring the units into smaller apartments, and everyone I knew who lived there moved out. Then I got fired. I had to ask my parents for help with rent while I collected unemployment and posted my place on Airbnb. I did everything I could to keep the apartment.And then a man did arrive.He moved into the apartment next door, and I hated him at first sound. He talked in what I called Bro Voice (like vocal fry, but for men) and rode a skateboard around the neighborhood whenever he wasn\u2019t banging heavy objects into one of our shared walls. I quickly dubbed him Neighbor Bro.Neighbor Bro smoked indoors, kept his shoes in the hallway and once woke me up by assembling Ikea furniture at 3 a.m. the night before my first day at a new job. I hated him more than any neighbor I\u2019d ever had, including one who stole my bike and one who hung an old medicine cabinet in the hallway filled with handmade clay animals.According to my landlord, Neighbor Bro had learned about the apartment from my upstairs neighbor, which made sense, because she was also fond of late-night construction projects.Soon after he moved in, I thought I could hear Neighbor Bro slipping up to her apartment some evenings for what would turn out to be exceptionally loud late-night hookups, occupying the otherwise dull hours between 2 and 5 a.m. by slamming her bed frame into the wall above my head with a vigor that seemed to threaten the structural integrity of the building.I didn\u2019t want to be the angry spinster banging on the ceiling with a broom while her neighbors had sex upstairs. But I also needed sleep, so I kept a broom in the bedroom and knocked on the ceiling whenever my upstairs neighbor made other offending noises past the quiet hour of 12 a.m. I hoped she could deduce that if I could hear her vacuuming her bedroom at midnight, I could definitely hear Neighbor Bro rattling her bed frame at 3 a.m., but this never seemed to dawn on her.Sometimes when I\u2019d knock on the ceiling, Neighbor Bro would yell \u201cWhat?\u201d \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t tell which apartment his voice was coming from.Apparently their arrangement was a casual one, and soon other women were showing up at his door late at night throughout the week, permitting little peace for me on the other side of the wall. One night he spent a couple of hours with the woman upstairs, then returned to his own apartment for his second hookup of the night, while I slept on my couch to escape the noise coming through every shared wall, floor and ceiling between us.I think anyone would be pushed to the edge by this point, but it seems like a particular torture for the interminably celibate to have another person\u2019s sex life forced on her in surround sound.So I left Neighbor Bro a note full of practical suggestions to remedy the situation \u2014 felt pads, a thick rug \u2014 and in return he left an angry screed taped to my door, signed with his phone number and instructions to \u201ctext him if he\u2019s being loud.\u201d (Um, no.)He complained about my loud vacuuming, even though I don\u2019t own a vacuum, and the sound of what he thought were my own late-night romps. Sometimes, he said, he would call his roommate into the room to bear witness to the noise before \u201cthe show was over.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. Either the sound was coming from another apartment in the building, or there were two 20-something men with their ears to my wall listening to me \u2014 put away my laundry?Indignant, I started to draft a rebuttal in my head, but there\u2019s no way to say, \u201cI can guarantee you no one is having sex in this apartment!\u201d and come out sounding like a winner. So I decided to move.A friend was separating from her husband and looking for a roommate. I had always preferred to live by myself, but living in my apartment meant for two had forced me to consider how much nicer it would be to share a home, to have someone else take turns emptying the trash and picking fights with the neighbors.She and I started looking at listings together, and I tried to feel better about giving up my apartment by thinking of all the things I didn\u2019t like about it. We would move to a quieter neighborhood where together we could afford a duplex with a yard I had always wanted, a fantasy involving neither the perfect apartment nor the perfect man.One lesson I learned: You can\u2019t will the right man into your life simply by planning for him.Rebecca Woodward is a freelance writer and social media strategist based in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Thermometer Tells Your Temperature, Then Tells Firms Where to Advertise", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of what we do \u2014 the websites we visit, the places we go, the TV shows we watch, the products we buy \u2014 has become fair game for advertisers. Now, thanks to internet-connected devices in the home like smart thermometers, ads we see may be determined by something even more personal: our health.This flu season, Clorox paid to license information from Kinsa, a tech start-up that sells internet-connected thermometers that are a far cry from the kind once made with mercury and glass. The thermometers sync up with a smartphone app that allows consumers to track their fevers and symptoms, making it especially attractive to parents of young children.The data showed Clorox which ZIP codes around the country had increases in fevers. The company then directed more ads to those areas, assuming that households there may be in the market for products like its disinfecting wipes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends disinfecting surfaces to help prevent the flu or its spread.It is unique, Kinsa says, because it comes straight from someone\u2019s household in real time. People don\u2019t have to visit a doctor, search their symptoms on Google or post to Facebook about their fever for the company to know where a spike might be occurring.\u201cThe challenge with Google search or social media or mining any of those applications is you\u2019re taking a proxy signal \u2014 you\u2019re taking someone talking about illness rather than actual illness,\u201d said Inder Singh, the founder and chief executive of Kinsa. Search queries and social media can also be complicated by news coverage of flu season, he said, while data from the C.D.C. is often delayed and comes from hospitals and clinics rather than homes.Christine Bannan, the consumer protection counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that even though Kinsa appeared to be using the information in a privacy-compliant manner, its business model highlights the need for federal regulation around how consumer data is handled.\u201cUltimately there should be a more uniform standard and it shouldn\u2019t be up to the whims of each company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s less of a privacy question and more of an ethical question on what we think is acceptable for targeting people who are ill and what safeguards we want to have around that.\u201dKinsa sells its data to other companies under the name Kinsa Insights. While Mr. Singh declined to share the names of other customers, citing confidentiality agreements, he said other companies had used the data to target advertising. It has also been used by pharmacies and manufacturers that make and distribute medicines and cough and cold products to keep retailers\u2019 shelves full with flu-related products when fevers spike in certain areas, he said.One model of Kinsa\u2019s thermometer plugs straight into phones, while another child-friendly version looks like Elmo from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d The company said that most app users opt to share their location and that Kinsa does not link the information to phone numbers or email addresses.\u201cWe take data from our users, we aggregate it, we do all sorts of machine-learning techniques with it and combine it with other data sets and what we ultimately get is a signal,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cThat\u2019s on a ZIP code basis and county-by-county basis.\u201dHe said the data provided unique insight into flu-related illness in specific areas. \u201cWe can tell you if it\u2019s high or low, whether it\u2019s rising, if it\u2019s bigger than the three- or five- year average, when it\u2019s going to peak and how severe the symptoms are, too,\u201d Mr. Singh said.Clorox used that information to increase digital ad spending to sicker areas and pull back in places that were healthier. Consumer interactions with Clorox\u2019s disinfectant ads increased by 22 percent with the data, according to a Kinsa Insights case study that tracked performance between November 2017 and March of this year. That number was arrived at by measuring the number of times an ad was clicked on, the amount of time a person spent with the ad and other undisclosed metrics, according to Vikram Sarma, senior director of marketing in Clorox\u2019s cleaning division.Being able to target ads in this way is a big shift from even seven years ago, when the onset of cold and cough season meant buying 12 weeks of national TV ads that \u201cwould be irrelevant for the majority of the population,\u201d Mr. Sarma said. The flu ultimately reaches the whole country each year, but it typically breaks out heavily in one region first and then spreads slowly to others.While social media offered new opportunities, there has been \u201ca pretty big lag\u201d between tweets about the flu or flulike symptoms and the aggregation of that data for marketers to use, he said.\u201cWhat this does is help us really target vulnerable populations where we have a clear signal about outbreaks,\u201d Mr. Sarma said.Mr. Singh, who was an executive vice president at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, said that Kinsa worked only with clients that can help with its mission of preventing the spread of illness through early detection. It made sense to work with Clorox, he said, because of the C.D.C. recommendation about disinfecting.While Kinsa has a public health mission, other smart-device companies may not have similar mind-sets, Ms. Bannan said.\u201cI can just think of how cigarette and alcohol companies could use strategies like this, or other industries that could really have more harmful effects on people,\u201d she said.Kinsa can make recommendations to individuals in certain situations, Mr. Singh said, pointing to its partnership with Teladoc, a telemedicine company. There is no financial arrangement between Kinsa and Teladoc but the two companies have an agreement that allows people with both apps to transfer their illness history from Kinsa to a Teladoc doctor, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve made the call that we don\u2019t want to target the individual unless the individual is going to be helped by the intervention,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cSo for example if you have a newborn who has a fever, you need to see the doctor right away and if it\u2019s 3 a.m., I\u2019m very happy to present you the option to talk to a telemedicine doctor.\u201d\u201cTo me,\u201d he added, \u201cthat is not advertising in the strict sense of advertising.\u201dDonald G. McNeil Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andrew Gillum, a Florida Insider Running as a Progressive Outsider", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 City Hall never did seem big enough for Andrew Gillum.It was November 2014 \u2014 Mr. Gillum\u2019s swearing-in as mayor of Tallahassee \u2014 and typical accommodations would not do. Traditionally, the city had inaugurated its new government quietly, in its municipal chambers. But Mr. Gillum, then 35, wanted a party. He wanted, colleagues groused, to be seen making a speech.And seen he was.\u201cI won\u2019t always get it right, but I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Mr. Gillum said in an outdoor address, as a constellation of lobbyists, friends and lobbyist-friends at the city\u2019s tailgate-style festival looked on \u2014 their faith and investment in him rewarded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good times ahead, y\u2019all.\u201dFour years and one long-shot campaign later, this has proved true for Mr. Gillum. With his upset victory in the Democratic primary for governor in August, Mr. Gillum, 39, has continued on a glide path to the party\u2019s upper reaches that began about a mile down the road, as a student government leader at Florida A&M University, before he was old enough to drink. He may be elected the first black governor of the nation\u2019s largest swing state in November, as his race against former Representative Ron DeSantis, a Trump acolyte who just turned 40, emerges as a national proxy for the parties\u2019 dueling futures.Mr. Gillum\u2019s admirers see in him a hybrid of Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama \u2014 an authentic progressive who supports higher corporate taxes and greater gun control, calls for the impeachment of President Trump and Medicare for all, and can inspire young and minority voters in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1994. And in recent days, he has been ubiquitous, in his city and on television, as he managed the fallout from Hurricane Michael, at one point commandeering a chain saw himself to help clear tree debris.Yet an examination of Mr. Gillum\u2019s record lays bare the central contradiction of his political life: Self-styled as an activist-minded populist, with a lunch-pail upbringing in south Miami-Dade County, he is also an avatar of the capital city he runs \u2014 a town powered by ambition, horse-trading and alliances with well-placed power players.One top campaign adviser \u2014 Sean Pittman, a close friend and mentor whom Mr. Gillum met as a student at Florida A&M \u2014 is also one of the city\u2019s subcontracted lobbyists. Another senior strategist, Sharon Lettman-Hicks, also a confidante since college, paid the mayor a salary of $71,680 in 2017 to advise her boutique public-relations consulting firm, though he spent virtually all of his non-mayoral time running for governor. Until recently, Ms. Lettman-Hicks also served as the landlord of his campaign headquarters, collecting $38,087.50 in rent from March 2017 through August of this year, according to campaign finance records.Mr. Gillum, in an interview, said he did not see these relationships or others with lobbyists as problematic. Rather, he has framed his own career arc as a triumph of within-the-system maneuvering, his approach summed up in a stock line to campaign audiences: \u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu.\u201dIn ensuring he has had a seat, for the better part of two decades now, Mr. Gillum has earned the label that most elected leaders strain to avoid: career politician. He won election to the Tallahassee city commission at age 23 and has never left public office. Though the job of mayor is largely ceremonial, representing one of five votes on the commission, Mr. Gillum has engendered fierce loyalty among working-class constituents for his emphasis on criminal justice and education for low-income students. He has also tended to relationships with a more affluent set, long before attracting progressive billionaires like Tom Steyer and George Soros to his cause.\u201cDoes he have friends who are lobbyists? You bet,\u201d said Allan Katz, a former city commissioner who served with Mr. Gillum and later became Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Portugal. \u201cDid I have friends who were lobbyists? You bet.\u201dMr. Gillum has insisted that investigators told him he is not their target, and the inquiry has yet to produce any indictments. But subpoenaed documents revealed that Mr. Gillum took two personal trips in 2016 with Mr. Corey: one to Costa Rica with a top Gillum adviser, Mr. Pittman, and another to New York with Mr. Gillum\u2019s younger brother and the agents. Mr. Gillum has said he paid his own way for most of the travel, with his brother treating him to a Broadway performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d and a hotel stay. Both trips are under investigation by Florida\u2019s state ethics commission. Mr. Gillum\u2019s younger brother, Marcus, declined to comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Corey declined to provide further case details.Mr. Gillum\u2019s defenders have said any whiff of impropriety is inconsistent with the man, and the city, they know.\u201cThere is no corruption in the city of Tallahassee,\u201d Curtis Richardson, the city\u2019s mayor pro tempore, said in an interview. (Later, he seemed to hedge slightly: \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s systemic corruption, and multiple individuals are involved, and it\u2019s from the top down. It\u2019s not that at all.\u201d)Mr. Katz, the former commissioner, said Mr. Gillum had been too ambitious, for too long, to behave recklessly. \u201cHe always was looking for a political future for himself and was therefore, I think, extremely careful,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cBut all of us who\u2019ve been involved in politics sometimes wind up in the wrong room with the wrong guy.\u201dMr. Gillum has chafed most at the labels applied to him as the investigation churns, which he believes fail to capture the totality of the affair. \u201cYou only put people in characters: \u2018lobbyist and mayor,\u2019\u201d the mayor said of the lobbyist matter during a 45-minute interview at a local coffee shop. \u201cI have a very easy time saying no to friends.\u201d\u201cWhat about me makes you think that it\u2019s appropriate?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is in the atmosphere that would suggest that I\u2019m the right person?\u201dThe other children called him \u201cThe Principal.\u201d It was not necessarily a compliment.From an early age, Mr. Gillum had always been the serious one, politically minded enough to make C-Span his appointment viewing in middle school, warming to a California congresswoman, Maxine Waters, who he long assumed was his representative because she, too, was black.At Gainesville High School, Mr. Gillum, the fifth of seven children of a bus driver and a construction worker, became vice president of the student body, standing out as one of two African-American boys in advanced placement classes.The \u201cprincipal\u201d nickname owed to his hyper-diligence in his elected role. \u201cWhen the teacher asked, \u2018What are we doing at this meeting today?\u2019 the others said, \u2018Well, Andrew has the agenda,\u2019\u201d said Cynthia Moore Chestnut, a former state representative and the mother of Mr. Gillum\u2019s best friend in high school.Once at Florida A&M, Mr. Gillum quickly announced himself as a canny organizer, working on the Senate campaign of Willie Logan and sidling up to several mentors across the state\u2019s black political establishment. In one early crusade, he helped introduce a \u201cMr. FAMU\u201d competition to complement a popular \u201cMiss FAMU\u201d pageant for women. And working with two state legislators in 2000, Mr. Gillum orchestrated a student march on the governor\u2019s office in response to then-Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s effort to turn back racial preferences in public university admissions.\u201cHe was preparing himself then,\u201d said one of the former legislators, Anthony C. Hill, then a state representative.Peers seemed to agree. \u201cAndrew Gillum is merely positioning himself for a future career as a Democrat politician,\u201d a recent Florida A&M alumnus wrote to Mr. Bush in 2002, according to email archives released when Mr. Bush ran for president, urging him to speak at the school\u2019s graduation over the protests of Mr. Gillum, the student body president. (Mr. Bush did not speak in the end.)Before graduating, Mr. Gillum was already eyeing an open seat on Tallahassee\u2019s city commission, believing he could galvanize a new bloc of student voters often disconnected from the civic arcana of the city itself. Some supporters were skeptical.\u201cI told him, \u2018Andrew, you\u2019re not from Tallahassee, you\u2019re from Gainesville,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hill remembered. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yeah, but I think I can get the students behind me.\u2019\u201dDespite meager fund-raising, he prevailed in a runoff election, moving immediately to expand his base of support. Another commissioner, Gil Ziffer, recalled an early speech from Mr. Gillum before a nearly all-white political club. He won the crowd by reciting advice he said his father had given him about the \u201cfive B\u2019s\u201d of public speaking, especially to white audiences: \u201cBe brief, brother. Be brief.\u201dMr. Gillum also kept a foothold outside of City Hall, working with other young elected officials nationally as a leader of People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group.He developed a reputation for seeing around corners politically. Mr. Gillum was an early supporter of Mr. Obama, urging fellow commissioners to keep their powder dry in the 2008 contest against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Katz, who heeded Mr. Gillum\u2019s advice, joined him in South Carolina on the state\u2019s primary night, where they encountered the future president. \u201cHe knew Andrew right away,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cObama looked at him with a big smile and said, \u2018Andrew, how\u2019s my young commissioner doing?\u2019\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton ran again, Mr. Gillum endeared himself to her team, too, becoming a top Florida surrogate and securing a place on a leaked list of about 40 potential running mates, as he has mentioned often during the campaign. But he did rebuff one request before the state\u2019s 2016 primary, according to a former Clinton aide: to attack Mr. Sanders directly. The decision proved foresighted; Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsement helped elevate Mr. Gillum in his own primary for governor this year.As mayor, Mr. Gillum\u2019s tenure has been defined often by the less glamorous trials of local government. He has confronted devastating storms \u2014 Hurricane Hermine in 2016 and Hurricane Michael last week \u2014 that left thousands of residents without power, taking care recently to remain ever-visible in the recovery efforts and document his doings in social media posts and cable news appearances.He has also faced criticism at times for crime in Tallahassee, the biggest city in Leon County, which has the highest crime rate in the state. There were 22 murders in the county last year. Colleagues say the perception is unfair to Mr. Gillum, who moved to hire dozens of new police officers as concern grew.His platform for governor has been loftier: raise the corporate tax rate, significantly boost public school funding, legalize marijuana, repeal the \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d self-defense law that has long been contentious in the state.But much of his agenda would be dictated by the pliability of the legislature, which is likely to remain under Republican control, making many of his promises difficult to honor on his own.The trouble with Tallahassee \u2014 with state capitals generally, Mr. Gillum suggests \u2014 is that people tend to assume the worst. History has given them ample reason.\u201cClearly I live in the capital city, and there are a lot of lawyer-lobbyist people,\u201d Mr. Gillum said in the interview. He argued that it was a mistake to conflate his city \u2014 a community of students, families and a striking number of mattress stores \u2014 with the political excesses of state government.But his case is complicated by recent events. Mr. Gillum\u2019s predecessor as mayor was investigated by the F.B.I. but never charged. So was a recent school district superintendent, in a separate F.B.I. inquiry, also without a charge.The city does little to discourage the smoke-filled caricature of white-collar swampiness. At its main power lunch spot, Andrew\u2019s (no relation), across from the Capitol, the sweet potato waffle fries are named for a city commissioner under investigation for an alleged pay-to-play scheme. The muses for the cheeseburger and key lime pie were recently found to be having an affair.\u201cThere are no secrets in Tallahassee,\u201d said Ed Narain, a former state representative.But there is an F.B.I. inquiry, and a mayor eager to protect his own name. Mr. Gillum supported posting online the city records subpoenaed by investigators. He shares liberally on Facebook, with direct-to-the-people messages about his work.

Julius H. McAllister Jr., said. \u201cIt\u2019s intertwined.\u201dAt times, though, Mr. Gillum has stood accused of blurring lines that others assumed were clear.His office spent about $5,000 in taxpayer dollars in 2016 to buy software from a Democratic Party vendor to send political emails, an improper purchase that Mr. Gillum defended until being forced last year to pay the city back and apologize.He voted in 2013 to give Mr. Corey, his college friend-turned-lobbyist, over $2 million in public funds to redevelop an old power plant into a high-end restaurant, after a city attorney ruled that having the mayor vote on a contract for Mr. Corey, his former campaign treasurer, did not constitute a conflict of interest.And Mr. Gillum signed off last month on extending a contract for the city\u2019s legislative lobbyist, who retains Mr. Pittman, the top campaign adviser, as a subcontracted lobbyist. Mr. Gillum said Mr. Pittman had not spoken to him about the extension.Mr. Pittman also joined Mr. Gillum and Mr. Corey on the 2016 trip to Costa Rica that is now under state ethics investigation. (Mr. Pittman was an early investor in Mr. Corey\u2019s restaurant.) Mr. Gillum \u2014 who earned $79,176 as mayor last year, in addition to his more than $71,000 in consulting income \u2014 has said he and his wife paid for their share of a $1,400-a-night villa in cash; as evidence to ethics investigators, he provided a bank statement showing a $400 withdrawal before their departure. (An attorney for Mr. Corey, who won the villa at a charity auction, said his client was not reimbursed.)In an interview, Mr. Pittman said that he and the mayor were \u201cno different from any other family friends who have been close for decades.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re a public figure, there are people who look for reasons to negatively impact your success,\u201d Mr. Pittman said, calling his bond with Mr. Gillum \u201ca beautiful relationship and not one that I think either one of us would allow someone to try to cheapen.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times.

{"Headline": "Private Businesses Built Modern China. Now the Government Is Pushing Back.", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 The comments were couched in careful language, but the warning about China\u2019s direction was clear.\u201cThe phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Wu said, \u201cis worth noting.\u201dMr. Wu gave rare official voice to a growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials: China may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen \u2014 and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government.The debate has gone all the way to the top. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader, sought to reassure private entrepreneurs that Beijing would still support them. But he also offered a full-throated defense of the country\u2019s big state-controlled companies, which many economists believe crowd out private businesses.\u201cSuch statements as \u2018there should be no state-owned enterprises\u2019 and \u2018we should have smaller-scale state-owned enterprises\u2019 are wrong and slanted,\u201d Mr. Xi said during a visit to a facility owned by China National Petroleum Corporation, a major state-controlled oil company.Today, the private sector contributes nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s growth and nine-tenths of new jobs, according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, an official business group. So pressures on private businesses could create serious ripples.Leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials are providing theoretical and practical support. In January, Zhou Xincheng, a professor of Marxism at Renmin University in Beijing, declared that private ownership should be eliminated.Last month, Wu Xiaoping, then an unknown blogger, wrote that the private sector should be ended now that it had accomplished its historic mission of achieving growth. Mr. Wu\u2019s blog went viral.Also last month, Qiu Xiaoping, a vice minister of human resources and social security, urged \u201cdemocratic management\u201d of private enterprises, saying that they should be jointly run by business owners and their employees.But entrepreneurs say the pace of change in Chinese taxes \u2014 already among the world\u2019s highest \u2014 gives them little time to prepare. For example, next year China will step up efforts to collect social-benefit payments and shift the way they are calculated, resulting in higher costs. Stricter social security tax collections could erode China\u2019s corporate profits by 2.5 percent, according to Lu Ting, an economist at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong.That could particularly hurt smaller companies, which tend to be privately owned and often have thin profit margins. Chinese officials have promised to cut overall taxes, but the details have been scant.Some struggling entrepreneurs are doing what was once considered unthinkable: selling out to the state. So far this year, 46 private companies have agreed to sell shares to state-controlled firms, with more than half selling controlling stakes, according to the Shanghai Securities News, an official government newspaper. While the number is small considering the vast Chinese economy, it reverses a two-decade trend of state companies selling shares to private entrepreneurs.One was the Changchun Sinoenergy Corporation, an oil and gas company. Its controlling shareholders agreed to sell their stakes to a company run by the government of Hunan Province after a loan was called. The government has pledged to inject nearly $150 million into the company.China has also taken steps to gain greater control over its technology sector, which flourished largely free from government influence.The authorities have also tightened rules governing online commerce. A new law requires those who run online stores to register with the government and pay taxes. That could hit Alibaba Group, also one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, because it runs an online bazaar, called Taobao, where merchants big and small have opened thousands of digital stores. In a statement, Alibaba said it hoped the introduction of the new law would bring positive development to the industry.Private entrepreneurs are loath to speak out for fear of attracting official condemnation. But signs of distress aren\u2019t hard to find.Optimists point to expressions of concern from China\u2019s top leadership as an indicator that the government will give businesses more room. Others believe the tougher environment will stay. Xiao Han, an associate law professor in Beijing, cited one of Aesop's fables, of a man trying and failing to stop a donkey from going over a cliff.\u201cBefore long,\u201d Mr. Xiao said, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably find a body of a China donkey under the cliff.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or Is it Heading There?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country stands where the spheres of influence of Moscow and Brussels meet. Contributing Opinion WriterTRIESTE, Italy \u2014 I love this place. I don\u2019t know why. I wasn\u2019t born here, I wasn\u2019t raised here, I\u2019ve never lived or run away from here. I didn\u2019t even fall in love here, strolling of an evening in the breathtaking Piazza Unit\u00e0, one of its four sides gazing out to sea.I think I like Trieste because it\u2019s a boundary of geography, the mind and more. Tucked in Italy\u2019s northeastern corner, it\u2019s Latin, Germanic, Slavic. It\u2019s Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish. It\u2019s a place of literature and trade. The south stops here: The Adriatic Sea laps Europe\u2019s shore, then decides it can\u2019t go any further. The north stops here: The Karst plateau is a terrace for the Continent, and over the centuries the people of Vienna visited to enjoy the view. The east stops here: The sighs of Russia have never gone any farther. The west stops here: NATO bases ready to beat back invaders from the Warsaw Pact remain scattered around.Trieste was created by the Hapsburg Empire, which owned little coast. In the early 1700s it was just a large village of fishermen, salters, market gardeners. The empire made it into a port, with a monopoly on imports and exports, privileged levies, soft railway tariffs \u2014 a world that wilted to a close a century ago. Since then, Trieste has been through an awful lot. It was won back by Italy in 1918, then chosen as Fascism\u2019s iconic city. It was occupied by the Nazis in 1943, then taken by the Yugoslav Communists in 1945. In 1947, Trieste was put under Anglo-American military government; only in 1954 was it restored to the Italian state.Today, at long last, it is a prosperous, peaceful European city. The seaport, shipbuilding, coffee and insurance companies and scientific research institutions provide employment for all. But it is a city forever shifting politically, sitting at the sliding fault line of European power. On Aug. 28, Matteo Salvini, leader of the Lega, was in Milan to welcome Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who proclaimed his host \u201cmy hero.\u201d A few days later, Lega deputies voted to support Budapest in the European Parliament, which was about to take measures against the Hungarian government\u2019s anti-democratic activities. The Italian government\u2019s verbal support of Vladimir Putin of Russia has been frequent and without criticism. In May, Mr. Salvini called Mr. Putin \u201ca leading statesman.\u201d Contacts between Lega and United Russia, Mr. Putin\u2019s party, are intense and continuous: conferences, congresses, meetings. Italy\u2019s European affairs minister, Paolo Savona, is not only a renowned euro-skeptic, he is also anti-German and pro-Russian. In an interview before being appointed, he said: \u201cPutin is a realist. He\u2019s against a Europe that would damage him. And this Europe does.\u201dThe new chairman of the Italian state television company RAI, the journalist Marcello Foa, like all his predecessors, was appointed by the ruling majority. He openly supports Mr. Putin and has often been a guest on RT, the Kremlin-financed television channel, where he defends Moscow on its Ukraine policies and other questions. On TV talk shows, intellectuals who side with the Italian government mention \u201cItaly\u2019s affinity with Russia\u201d and demand the closing of American military bases. And there is no lack of support for Moscow among the opposition\u2019s ranks. Silvio Berlusconi and the Russian president go back a long way, with Mr. Berlusconi often visiting Mr. Putin as well as having Mr. Putin over to his place in Sardinia. For the moment, none of this has been followed up with major foreign policy shifts. Still, Italy\u2019s traditional allies worry. A delegation from the American State Department is expected to pay a quiet visit soon to Rome to find out where Italy will stand in December, when the European Council must decide whether to continue sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. As things stand now, Eastern Europe\u2019s authoritarians and Russia are mentioned, esteemed, admired and defended by Italy\u2019s leaders at every turn. At which point who knows where we will end up?Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere Della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s about bigotry.That\u2019s the real story \u2014 to the extent there is a story at all \u2014 about the caravan of 5,000 impoverished Central Americans rampaging toward the United States border at, er, two miles an hour.So, here\u2019s some perspective, by my back-of-envelope calculations:More than 1.4 million foreigners immigrate to the United States each year. If, say, half the caravan reaches the border, and half of those people actually enter the U.S., they would represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of this year\u2019s immigrants.If the caravan proceeds by foot, during the period of its journey 16,800 Americans will die from drugs.In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, perhaps 690,000 Americans will become homeless, including 267,000 children.In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, 8,850 Americans will die from guns, including suicides and murders. In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, perhaps 9,000 Americans will die from lack of health insurance (people die at higher rates when they\u2019re uninsured, although there\u2019s disagreement about how much higher).Maybe the real \u201cNational Emergy\u201d is drugs, homelessness, gun deaths and lack of health insurance?In the 2014 elections, Republican candidates ran hundreds of ads denouncing the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Ebola. News organizations chronicled this \u201cdebate,\u201d but in retrospect they were manipulated into becoming a channel to spread fear \u2014 and win Republican votes.Politically, this was quite effective, and Republicans won sweeping gains across the country and seized control of the Senate. Yet Ebola, like the Central American caravan, is a reminder of the distinction between grandstanding and governing.Obama\u2019s technocratic Ebola program \u2014 working with France and Britain, plus private aid groups \u2014 may have worried voters, but it was effective. Instead of careening around the world to kill millions and devastate the global economy, the Ebola virus was contained and eventually burned out. Good governance often turns out to be bad politics, and vice versa.The same is true of immigration.I fear that we in the media have become Trump\u2019s puppets, letting him manipulate us to project issues like the caravan onto the agenda.Trump is right that, although there\u2019s no evidence of it, \u201cthere could very well be\u201d Middle Easterners hiding in the caravan. It\u2019s equally true that the Easter Bunny \u201ccould very well be\u201d in the caravan. Speaking of Easter, Jesus Christ \u201ccould very well be\u201d in the caravan.So let\u2019s stop freaking out about what \u201ccould very well be\u201d and focus on facts. Here are two: First, the Caravan won\u2019t make a bit of difference to America. Second, we have other problems to focus on, from drugs to homelessness to health care, that genuinely constitute a \u201cNational Emergy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Takes Cybersecurity Training on the Road", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years ago, IBM opened one of the nation\u2019s first commercial cybersecurity ranges in Cambridge, Mass., to let companies practice responding to simulated cyberattacks. It describes the experience as \u201ca game of Clue mixed with a Disney roller-coaster ride.\u201dThe experience proved so popular \u2014 about 2,000 people, including chief executives and entire corporate boards, have played IBM\u2019s game, which has an eight-month waiting list \u2014 that IBM decided to build a second range.But this time, it\u2019s going mobile.While companies are scrambling to get up to speed, they can\u2019t always send an entire team away for a few days of training on how to spot and respond to a cyberattack.Starting Monday the company is introducing its mobile cyber command center, tucked into a heavily customized semitrailer truck. What IBM calls its \u201ccyber tactical operations center\u201d will make stops at college campuses and security-focused events before heading to Europe for a lengthy tour.Officially, the trailer is intended for cybersecurity education and as a mobile response unit. Unofficially, it\u2019s also a playground packed with tech bling where geeks can experiment with ways to combat cyberattacks that have yet to be imagined.\u201cPeople have put all kinds of cool things into trailers, but nobody has ever put a cyber command center into one before,\u201d said Caleb Barlow, a vice president at IBM Security, where he leads the companys X-Force Threat Intelligence organization and created the Cambridge range.It also crammed in 20,000 feet of networking cable, two satellite dishes with cellular links, a generator-fueled power plant and a light tower with the intensity of 60 car headlights. Its data center, stuffed with server racks and multimedia controls, fits into a space the size of a large refrigerator.On the road, the truck looks like any other shipping trailer hauling goods. But when it parks, it unfolds and triples its size. Beneath an extended canopy, IBM can unfurl a command post with 22 Mac-equipped work stations and a six-seat conference room.The main training room closely resembles IBM\u2019s Cambridge range, with touch-screen monitors on three walls showing charts, video clips and forensic material like snippets of malicious computer code. From a tablet, IBM\u2019s employees can adjust the room\u2019s displays. A tap on the tablet\u2019s \u201cbreaking news\u201d button shifts the room\u2019s lighting from a soothing blue to urgent red.\u201cIt helps us get the cortisol going,\u201d Mr. Barlow said. \u201cPeople react unconsciously to the visual cues.\u201dCyber ranges take their inspiration from the military. Just as soldiers train in simulated environments for the conditions they might face in battle, cyber defenders regularly practice on virtual networks. A growing number of companies participate in cyber war games and stage mock attacks to test their defenses.Sean McKee, a senior cyber threat manager for TD Bank, visited IBM\u2019s Cambridge range this year and was intrigued enough to plan a two-day training exercise there in December for 40 TD Bank employees.The bank tests its crisis management plans at least once a year, incorporating everyone from front-line responders to its top executives, but its capabilities are less immersive than IBM\u2019s, Mr. McKee said.\u201cPeople immediately get to see the results of their actions,\u201d Mr. McKee said. \u201cIt gives them a sense that there are other forces at play here and the decisions you make in a moment of crisis are going to have a lasting impact on your organization.\u201dRegulators, lawmakers and corporate customers have responded with more stringent requirements that companies improve their defenses and practice their crisis-response plans for handling significant attacks.\u201cWe\u2019ve had growing demand from boards and C-suites, and it\u2019s hard to get those people out to Cambridge,\u201d Mr. Barlow said. \u201cThis is a way to bring training to them.\u201dIBM is still figuring out exactly what it will do with its new toy. The truck is a fully functional command center, Mr. Barlow said. It could, in theory, be sent to large events \u2014 IBM works on cybersecurity for the United States Open and Wimbledon tennis tournaments \u2014 to handle real-time threat response.But its main purpose will be training. IBM plans to re-create its Cambridge mock-attack scenarios and build custom exercises for companies looking to test their skills.Mr. McKee, a former Canadian army officer, said that his bank, like many, had responded to escalating threats by increasing the pace and complexity of its training exercises. TD Bank\u2019s session in December at the Cambridge range will mix technical challenges for the bank\u2019s security incident response team with legal, public relations and privacy trials for its top executives.\u201cI always run these exercises with the caveat that this is not a test,\u201d he said. \u201cA test is pass or fail. If you have certain areas where you go down in a flaming ball of fire, that\u2019s a success. You found a critical vulnerability in your response.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Don\u2019t say you will stop yourself before you blurt out some impatient, annoyed, controlling remark. No, I said, you can\u2019t change. You are unable to change.\u201dThe Trump administration generally and the Brett Kavanaugh hearing specifically have produced a \u201ctorrent of memories,\u201d Brown wrote, memories ofbeing dismissed, disdained, distrusted. Memories of having to endure put-downs at the office, catcalls in the parking lot, barked orders at a dinner party. And, for some reason, the most chilling memory of all, the one Christine Blasey Ford called up and that we all recognized: the laughter. The laughter of men who are bonding with each other by mocking us.We cannot afford to dismiss or fetishize or marginalize or rear back from women\u2019s anger any longer if we want this moment to be transformative. We have to look at it straight, stop hemming and hawing around it or trying to disavow it or worrying that it might offend and discomfit. It must be and always has been at the heart of social progress.She goes on:What I have glimpsed, in the moments when I have let myself give voice to the deep, rich, curdled fury that for years I tried to pretty up and make easier on everyone\u2019s stomach, is that for all the care we take to bottle it up, rage can be a powerful tonic.The anger expressed by Traister and Brown is indicative of a central phenomenon of the 2018 election: a record-setting gender gap.The question is crucial because behavior based on societal expectations is far more amenable to change through government intervention, the approach generally preferred by liberals, than behavior based on biology.Pew found, for example, that majorities of Republicans, ranging from 56 to 67 percent, said that biological differences between men and women were the prime reason for their differing \u201capproach to parenting,\u201d to \u201chow they express their feelings\u201d and their choice \u201cof hobbies and personal interests.\u201d Decisive majorities of Democrats, ranging from 65 to 68 percent, took the opposite view, that these differences were the result of societal expectations.Similarly, 56 percent of Republicans agreed that \u201cthere is too little emphasis on encouraging boys to be leaders,\u201d a view shared by a substantially smaller 30 percent of Democrats.Conversely, 64 percent of Democrats said there was too little emphasis on encouraging girls to be leaders. Far fewer Republicans, 39 percent, agreed. Asked if it was a good or bad thing that \u201csociety looks up to masculine men,\u201d Republicans said it was good by 78-20, while Democrats were split, 49-48.Asked whether they agreed that \u201cmen getting away with sexual harassment or assault\u201d was a \u201cmajor problem,\u201d 62 percent of Democrats said yes, compared with 33 percent of Republicans. Asked whether a failure to believe women who say they were harassed was a major problem, 60 percent of Democrats said yes, while 28 percent of Republicans agreed.When women did not work, they would often assume the political preferences of their husbands. When women didn\u2019t have access to income they held more socially conservative views in part because they wanted to protect the sanctity of their marriages and shore up against the possibility of divorce lest they be left without a breadwinner.That changed when women began to have their own sources of income:When women began to work, we see the beginning of the divergence of political preferences. Because women often work in jobs that are lower paying then men, they often have stronger preferences for government social services and typically tolerate higher levels of taxes that help pay for such services.When \u201cthe pill\u201d was released in the U.S. in 1960 it revolutionized women\u2019s reproductive health. For the first time in human history, women could have sex and have complete control over their own reproductive function. By the late 60s and 70s women\u2019s enrollment in four-year colleges and the work force surged and they gained economic independence.The issue of women\u2019s control over their own bodies, Jacobs argued,has shaped the social and political landscape ever since. I think the rise of Trump reflects a deep-seated insecurity over men\u2019s social role. They are no longer sole breadwinner and, as Piers Morgan would have you believe, child care is the ultimate demasculinizing act.The course of tension and conflict between the sexes after the 1960s is complex, but can be summarized as a conflict over traditional ideas about gender that preserve the privilege of white, heterosexual males and ideas that want to change gender roles and ideology.there is a persistent political gender gap in the trade-off between guns and butter: men are likelier than women to favor the more hawkish and law-and-order candidate, women the candidate who promises more social spending. The asymmetry is hardly surprising to an evolutionary biologist.This difference, Pinker wrote in an email, emerges from that fact that males of many mammalian species compete for dominance (which in traditional societies translated into more mating opportunities, hence more offspring), including the dominance of their group relative to other group. They are often willing to take lethal risks to get a shot at the jackpot of being an alpha male or part of an alpha group, especially since their offspring can survive without them, albeit at greater risk.\u201cFor females,\u201d Pinker continued,such a risk is insane: they won\u2019t bear any more offspring if they are more dominant (since unlike males, their reproductive output is fixed by the time it takes to gestate and nurse a baby), and their offspring can\u2019t survive without them.In terms of politics, Pinker argues,the asymmetry is there, and it could affect gut-level sympathies: men toward politicians that embrace violence (the police and army) to enhance the competitive formidability of their perceived group against other \u201ctribes,\u201d be they foreign countries or rival races or ethnicities within their own country; women toward politicians that promise benefits to the health and education of children.First, Buss argues, there is the mismatch between ancestral and modern work environments. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers who engaged in periodic intergroup warfare.\u201d Buss notes, \u201cWarfare was almost exclusively a male activity. There is not a single instance in all of human recorded history of women forming a war party to attack another group and capture mates or territory from another group.While \u201chighly sex-segregated work environments,\u201d Buss writes, were the rule \u201cover 99 percent of human evolutionary history,\u201d in the modern work environment \u201cwomen and men are not only expected to work together, but, dramatically, they are now competing for the same jobs.\u201dThe tensions resulting from \u201cthe increasing integration of women working with men and competing with men and each other for key positions in the workplace\u201d are exacerbated by what Buss calls \u201cinappropriate mating adaptations.\u201dBuss wrote:When men and women interact, mating adaptations get activated, because people tend to be attracted to those with similar interests, and workplaces put people with similar interests into close proximity, and mating psychology gets even more activated.\u201cAdd to this volatile mix,\u201d Buss continues,the evidence that men who attain positions of status feel \u201centitled\u201d to greater sexual access to women \u2014 in fact that access was one of the key driving forces that led men over evolutionary history to have such strong status-seeking and resource-acquisition motivations.that women\u2019s preference for men with resources and men\u2019s competitive strategies have coevolved \u2014 the outcome being a tendency for men worldwide to control more resources, power and position than women. There is strong evidence from a study of 37 cultures involving 10,047 participants that women have a greater desire for long-term mates who not only possess economic resources, but also possess characteristics that are likely to lead to resources over time, such as ambition, industriousness, and social status. These preferences, operating repeatedly over human evolutionary history, have led women to favor as mates men who possess status and resources and to exclude from mating men lacking status and resources.One source of conflict, she says, is the threat to powerful men \u2014 who are not accustomed to being challenged and who sometimes feel wrongly accused \u2014 from the outpouring of revelations about sexual harassment and sexual assault.\u201d Another source of contention, she argues, \u201cis the feelings of resentment by working- and middle-class men who have lost relative social status in the wake of a variety of social and economic changes, including the growth in workplace opportunities for women.Schlozman cautioned against exaggeration of the extent to which enhanced gender conflict implies a partisan war between women and men. At a time when American politics is characterized by deepening divisions along many fault lines, there are men and women on both sides of the chasm.Gender roles, according to Hrdy,have long been packed with tension. Nothing new. Carried to an extreme these tensions can result in oppressive restrictions, not just on women\u2019s autonomy and opportunities but really damaging subsistence-threatening losses in freedom of movement and reproductive choices.Hrdy wrote that there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that evolution is a factor, \u201chaving to do with primate male predispositions to control female reproduction,\u201d but noted that she was hesitant to go into thembecause the sources of these predispositions are really complicated \u2014 long-running evolution of female reproductive strategies and male counter-strategies, generating female counter-strategies.Hrdy voiced her worries about contemporary developments in a 2018 letter she wrote her classmates in preparation for the 50th anniversary of her graduation from Radcliffe College:Hrdy said she had been asked \u201cWhat questions or issues do you think are going to be most important for women in the future?\u201dHer answer:Control over their own reproduction. It is conceivable to me that birth control, and particularly abortion, may become defined as \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cunacceptable\u201d behavior and ruled out as options. Virtually all advances by women are linked to women having a choice over whether or not to bear and rear young.When women see that control \u2014 and their autonomy more broadly \u2014 threatened, anger becomes a rational response.Victoria Brown, quoted at the beginning of this column, described the moment when her husband, in her view, threatened her autonomy and \u201cbecame all men.\u201dDavid Buss, at the same time, strikes a cautionary note about lumping \u201call men\u201d or \u201call women\u201d together. \u201cWhen one speaks of \u2018conflict between the sexes\u2019 or \u2018a political difference between the sexes,\u2019 \u201d Buss said,one is using aggregate statistics to summarize a collection of individual phenomena. From an evolutionary perspective, each individual women is aligned in her interests with some other women (her friends, mother, daughter, niece, etc.), but also not aligned in her interests with other specific women (her mating rivals; her competitors for jobs; etc.). The same goes for men.Similarly, each individual woman is aligned in her interests with some men (e.g., her husband, her son, her father, her male friends) and also not aligned with other specific men (e.g., those who sexually harass her; a male competitor in her workplace vying for the same position; etc.).So one has to be careful when speaking about \u201cwomen as a group\u201d and \u201cmen as a group,\u201d since this erroneously implies that there is unity of interests among men in opposition to women and vice versa, which does not exist.Buss\u2019s point is well taken, but that does not diminish the reality that the divergence in male and female voting behavior has reached record levels and that this divergence may well determine the outcome of the 2018 elections.Advertisement"}

But the incident was profoundly disturbing \u2014 as a threat not just to the safety of our family, neighbors, colleagues and friends, but also to the future of American democracy.My family is no stranger to the hostilities of those who reject our philosophy, our politics and our very identity. My father grew up in the shadow of the Nazi regime in Hungary. My grandfather secured papers with false names so that they could survive the onslaught against Budapest\u2019s Jews; he helped many others do the same. After the war, as the Communists took power, my father escaped to London, where he studied at the London School of Economics before embarking on what ultimately became a hugely successful career in finance.But the lessons of his early life never left him. His biggest philanthropic endeavor, the Open Society Foundations, played a leading role in supporting the transition from Communism to more democratic societies in parts of the former Soviet Union and then expanded to protect democratic practices in existing democracies. My father acknowledges that his philanthropic work, while nonpartisan, is \u201cpolitical\u201d in a broad sense: It seeks to support those who promote societies where everyone has a voice.There is a long list of people who find that proposition unacceptable, and my father has faced plenty of attacks along the way, many dripping with the poison of anti-Semitism.But something changed in 2016. Before that, the vitriol he faced was largely confined to the extremist fringes, among white supremacists and nationalists who sought to undermine the very foundations of democracy.In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n launched an anti-Semitic poster campaign falsely accusing my father of wanting to flood Hungary with migrants. This included plastering my father\u2019s face onto the floor of trams in Budapest so that people would walk on it, all to serve Mr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s political agenda.Now we have attempted bomb attacks. While the responsibility lies with the individual or individuals who sent these lethal devices to my family home and Mr. Obama\u2019s and Ms. Clinton\u2019s offices, I cannot see it divorced from the new normal of political demonization that plagues us today.I am under no illusion that the hatred directed at us is unique. There are too many people in the United States and around the world who have felt the force of this malign spirit. It is now all too \u201cnormal\u201d that people who speak their minds are routinely subjected to personal hostility, hateful messages on social media and death threats.It is also all too normal that organizations doing important pro-democracy work face existential threats simply because they accept support from the foundations my father started. And all too normal that political leaders who swear an oath of office to protect all citizens instead pursue politics of division and hate. We are far removed from the days when Senator John McCain rebuffed his own supporters during the 2008 election to patriotically defend his opponent, Mr. Obama \u2014 all because he believed that the health of our democracy was more important than his personal political gain.We must find our way to a new political discourse that shuns the demonization of all political opponents. A first step would be to cast our ballots to reject those politicians cynically responsible for undermining the institutions of our democracy. And we must do it now, before it is too late.Alexander Soros is the deputy chairman of the Open Society Foundations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Should Address Unfair Trade With China ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorrecting currency misalignment, not imposing tariffs, should be his priority.Dr. Scott is an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization.The president\u2019s tariff approach ignores a more significant problem \u2014 the currency misalignment of the dollar and the Chinese yuan \u2014 and so could end up doing more harm than good.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign sought to channel the anger of many Americans over unfair trade. I understand this anger, having documented in my research the millions of manufacturing jobs lost in the United States as a result of flawed trading relationships with China and Mexico. But rhetoric doesn\u2019t always equal insight, and the president\u2019s approach ignores two key facts.First, trade deals on their own don\u2019t have much potential to help America\u2019s workers. Contemporary trade agreements may be nominally concerned with rules and tariffs, but their primary outcome has been to tilt the playing field in favor of foreign investors, which merely continues a cycle of outsourced production. Tinkering at the margins, as evidenced by recent rewrites of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement, alters mostly just the optics of trade policy. It sends a message that the president is \u201cbeing tough.\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely to have a meaningful impact.The second fact is that currency misalignment \u2014 not trade deals \u2014 is the single most important driver of growing United States trade deficits. From 1997 to 2014, China purchased $4 trillion in United States Treasury bills and other assets to bid up the value of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. (China sold some of its reserves in 2015 and 2016 to stabilize the yuan, but this year it again bought foreign assets to keep the yuan from rising.) This has made China\u2019s currency artificially cheap, creating what is effectively a huge subsidy for Chinese exports to the United States. It also imposes a de facto tax on all United States exports to China.Growing trade with low-wage countries like China has decimated the earnings of 100 million non-college-educated workers in the United States \u2014 two-thirds of the work force. And job losses have devastated entire regions of America\u2019s industrial heartland, especially in the upper Midwest. Not surprisingly, this includes some of the once reliably Democratic states that President Trump carried in the last election.Although China is no longer officially manipulating the value of its currency, the dollar remains significantly overvalued \u2014 in part because China is sitting on more than $3 trillion in foreign assets. The dollar is now overvalued by at least 25 to 30 percent against not just the Chinese yuan but also the Japanese yen and the euro. Notably, the dollar has risen further since Mr. Trump was elected, increasing roughly 6 percent in trade-weighted value since January 2018 alone, which further encumbers domestic manufacturers.Unfortunately, currency misalignment can\u2019t be fixed by updating trade deals. It\u2019s a global problem driven largely by continuing foreign demand for United States securities and financial assets. Since 2014, private foreign investment in American financial assets has increased the dollar\u2019s real, trade-weighted value by 20 percent. The dollar must be realigned against not just the Chinese yuan but also against the currencies of countries that have been running chronic trade surpluses for many years.Previous Republican presidents have taken steps to tackle an overvalued dollar. (In 1971, for example, Richard Nixon imposed a temporary import surcharge on all imports; it led to an agreement four months later to lower the dollar\u2019s value.) What\u2019s required is the political will to stand up to powerful actors like Walmart and Apple that benefit from continued currency misalignment. The president should apply leverage on America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 a fee on incoming foreign capital, tariff threats or coordinated currency intervention \u2014 to realign the dollar.Congress could try to force the president\u2019s hand, threatening to impose significant taxes on capital inflows to reduce demand for United States financial assets. But the authority to negotiate on currency rests in the hands of the executive. And until President Trump grasps the severity of the dollar problem, making a \u201cgreat deal\u201d on trade agreements will matter little for United States manufacturers.Robert E. Scott is a senior economist and the director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute.Advertisement"}

They were to join my grandfather, who was working in the coal mines in Alsace-Lorraine in northeastern France. It was a dangerous job, but better than the alternative many Sardinians were facing.

{"Headline": "Keith Ellison\u2019s Campaign Overshadowed by Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s Allegations", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Keith Ellison started his bid to become Minnesota\u2019s next attorney general, he had formidable advantages.An outspoken progressive who had served in Congress for more than a decade, Mr. Ellison was one of the most recognizable politicians in the state. As deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, he had a national profile that has helped him raise nearly twice as much money as his Republican challenger, Doug Wardlow, a lawyer. On top of that, there was history: Minnesota has not elected a Republican attorney general since 1966.But in recent weeks, Mr. Ellison\u2019s edge appears to be evaporating, amid claims by his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that he mistreated her during their long-term relationship. Ms. Monahan has accused him of causing emotional pain through infidelity and dishonesty when they were a couple and said he had once tried to drag her off a bed after an argument while screaming obscenities at her.A loss by Mr. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, would be a stunning blow to a leader of the ascendant progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Mr. Wardlow has pounced on the allegations, releasing an ad that portrayed Mr. Ellison as a perpetrator of domestic violence. Mr. Ellison, a champion of feminist causes, now finds himself struggling to respond amid a contentious national debate over the #MeToo movement, roiled even further after the accusations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.Mr. Ellison denies the allegations, including those of infidelity, and said in an extensive interview that he had been conflicted about how to react. He said he wanted to clear his name but did not want to demonize Ms. Monahan, 44, an environmental activist with whom he had a long-term relationship.\u201cThe #MeToo movement is a justice movement, and I don\u2019t ever want to be counted among those who in some way tried to dissuade victims from coming forward,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think the #MeToo movement has room for due process. Every social justice movement must.\u201dAs allegations against politicians emerge, voters are grappling with what behavior constitutes abuse and when it should be disqualifying. In Mr. Ellison\u2019s case, the claims are not about unwanted sexual advances, but emotional pain and a fight that Ms. Monahan said became physical when he grabbed her leg. In Minnesota, a majority of voters \u2014 57 percent \u2014 said they were unsure what to think about the accusations against Mr. Ellison, according to a Star Tribune/MPR News poll.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cAn allegation standing alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that the conduct occurred, particularly where the accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself asserts exists,\u201d wrote the investigator, Susan Ellingstad, who heads the employment law department of the firm Lockridge Grindal Nauen.Mr. Wardlow has called the investigation against Mr. Ellison \u201ca sham,\u201d noting that the law firm where Ms. Ellingstad works had donated to Mr. Ellison\u2019s campaigns.In recent days, Mr. Wardlow has championed Ms. Monahan\u2019s cause on conservative news media outlets, highlighting what he called a double standard for Democrats who have rallied around Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers while ignoring Ms. Monahan. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, and the conservative talk show hosts Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck made similar remarks.Ms. Monahan, a well-known progressive organizer in Minneapolis, recently retained Andrew Parker, a lawyer who is Mr. Wardlow\u2019s former boss, to represent her. Ms. Monahan declined to comment and referred all questions to Mr. Parker.\u201cThe fact that she has a video and people are bullying and requiring her to show it\u201d amounted to revictimizing her, said Mr. Parker, who added that he also had not seen the video. \u201cShe will not do that.\u201dMr. Parker added that there was \u201cmore than enough evidence\u201d to corroborate Ms. Monahan\u2019s claims, including her accounts of the abuse to friends and doctors.But Mr. Ellison\u2019s campaign has been consumed with Ms. Monahan\u2019s allegations.Mr. Ellison said the final stages of the relationship had been marked by frequent arguments but said he was stunned by Ms. Monahan\u2019s abuse allegations and her recent emergence as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the Republican Party. \u201cI think the question to be asked is, \u2018What is her ultimate goal?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf her goal is to frustrate my political future, maybe she\u2019ll ally with anyone who can help her achieve that.\u201dMr. Ellison\u2019s inner circle has been divided over how to respond to allegations, which Ms. Monahan has been alluding to on Twitter and Facebook \u2014 without naming him \u2014 since the couple\u2019s tumultuous breakup. Some advocated a vigorous defense, while others saw nothing to be gained by talking about her claims.Friends of the couple have described the relationship as rocky, with Ms. Monahan often accusing Mr. Ellison of infidelity. Even after they separated and she moved out of his house, Ms. Monahan continued trying to prove that he had been unfaithful to her, he said.Ms. Monahan visited him in January 2017 and searched his phone without his permission, obtaining screenshots of text messages that he had sent to two other women.

She sent him videos, articles and texts about \u201cnarcissist abuse,\u201d a nonmedical term that has gained popularity online to describe the pain experienced by partners of pathologically self-centered people. And she asked him to discuss the articles with her, saying that she wanted to help him and that she also wanted \u201crestorative justice.\u201d\u201cShe wanted to meet and talk about the relationship and try to process the issues,\u201d he said.He watched one of the videos but told Ms. Monahan he did not agree with her assessment.\u201cI think I\u2019m fairly well adjusted,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t go through the normal ups and downs of life.

{"Headline": "The Economy Is Great, Really, for Now", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe excesses that could end a boom decade for the American economy are coming into view.Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Whatever one thinks of President Trump, it\u2019s hard to deny that much of America is feeling great again.Surveys show that consumers have been this confident only twice before, at the height of the economic booms of the 1960s and 1990s, and their mood is bright across income groups, not just among the rich. Small business confidence has not been higher since the surveys began nearly five decades ago. The misery index, invented in the 1970s to describe the agonizing combination of inflation and unemployment, is now just 6 percent, matching the lowest levels of the last half century.Investors may now be expecting America to peak after a hot decade. Even with recent setbacks, the performance gap between the United States stock market and the rest of the global markets is close to a 100-year high. Money flowing into the United States has also driven up the value of the dollar, which has never been more dominant as the world\u2019s preferred currency. Trump doubters say that this boom began before he took office, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008, and they have a point. With its more flexible economic system, the United States responded faster than its peers to the debt problems exposed by the crisis. The United States forced households and troubled financial institutions to rapidly reduce their debt, and easy money provided by the Federal Reserve allowed them to start spending again. Money flowed into the giant tech companies that have underpinned the American economic surge.Just as the 1980s belonged to Japan and the 2000s to emerging nations, the last decade belonged to America. Still, the gap in performance between America and the rest of the world has widened in the last two years under Mr. Trump, as his tax cuts and deregulation turbocharged the American economy and its markets. His policies have spurred consumption, and have incentivized companies to buy back more of their stock and bring home some of the money they had stashed overseas.But economies that are hot in one decade rarely stay hot in the next. Every boom eventually creates excesses that sow the seeds of its own destruction, and the excesses that could end the American decade are coming into view.The United States economy has been expanding for nine years in a row and if this streak carries on until August next year it will be the longest economic expansion in the country\u2019s history. Within a few years after the crisis of 2008, American companies had started running up debts again. It\u2019s not unusual for companies to get overconfident and become saddled with heavy debts late in an expansion. But it is unusual to see the government follow suit, as it has this time. Owing in part to the Trump tax cuts, the United States budget deficit is now around 4 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 the highest it has been outside the immediate aftermath of a recession or a war.That will make it very hard for the government to keep stimulating the economy. Growth is expected to slow next year as the impact of the tax cuts fades and the strong dollar cuts into exports. The Fed has been raising rates, and the end of the long easy money party is starting to have an impact on the housing and stock markets, helping to explain the recent correction.Nonetheless, the United States stock market is still swollen \u2014 and it seems unlikely to keep expanding from here. The stock market is now 60 percent larger than the American economy, a scale it has reached only twice in the past century, during the manias of the 1920s and late 1990s. Moreover, the giant tech companies that have been driving the economy and markets now face a regulatory backlash that could cut into their extraordinarily high profit margins.Trump haters may be tempted to conclude from all this that he is about to lead America into a sudden decline, but that is not the point. This American decade started under President Obama, continued under Mr. Trump and survived congressional gridlock throughout, showing that the economy often rises above politics. The economy is driven less by ideology than by its own internal cycles, and this cycle has been turning in America\u2019s favor for so long that it is unlikely to last much longer.While the excesses of corporate exuberance and government debt are rising in the United States, countries from France to Brazil are in the cleanup phase that often precedes an economic comeback. Most are a long way from working out the excesses of the last decade, and they may suffer further setbacks. But they are approaching the start of a new cycle, while the United States nears the end of an old one. If history is any guide, the next decade is less likely to be great for America than it is for the rest of the world.Advertisement"}

But I keep being told that I do. Ms. Simon is a writer with bipolar II disorder. I have stopped telling doctors that I am in pain. I have stopped telling doctors that I spend days each month so dizzy I have to sit down, that I miss work because of nausea. I have stopped telling doctors that my birth control is making my day-to-day life hellish.Six years ago \u2014 three days after my Paragard IUD was inserted \u2014 my knees slammed into the linoleum floor of my kitchen as I fell to the ground in pain, screaming. I got myself to the emergency room, where nurses gave me morphine, Percocet, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. It was not enough to ease my pain. When I told the nurses, they refused to increase my dosage. The screaming didn\u2019t stop that night \u2014 and neither would the IUD\u2019s side effects, which have stayed with me to this day. I\u2019ve not only been in pain for these six years, I\u2019ve also been forced to listen to doctors\u2019 incessant lectures about removing the IUD. But I won\u2019t let them take it out of me. Let me explain.I was 19 years old when I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. At the time, I was in a severe depression, but I had also experienced manic episodes throughout my teens, sometimes staying awake for as long as five nights in a row. I immediately started the search for medication, and soon realized what millions of Americans know all too well: finding a psychiatric medication that alleviates symptoms without causing serious side effects is very, very difficult.I tried medications that gave me psychotic breaks, hallucinations, euphoria and sleeplessness, ones that made me fall asleep for hours in the middle of the day, sometimes in public, that left me nauseated for months, bile pooling in my mouth.But eventually I found medications that come with few side effects and near perfect results. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. My medication does its job \u2014 and I have the means to pay for it. It\u2019s a lifeline without which I would become manic, or else suicidal.Soon after I was stable on bipolar medication, I entered my first serious relationship. I spent my days taking walks around Lower Manhattan with the man I was falling in love with, nights spent curled up together in my twin extra-long dorm room bed. At the same time, I was faced with my next big health care decision: finding birth control.In the weeks following my visit to the emergency room, my body adjusted to the IUD as best it could \u2014 which turned out to be not very well. The pain, though no longer constant, did not end. My periods went from five days to 12. They came with cramps so strong I vomited into toilets, into sinks, into trash cans. I threw out my regular tampons and loaded up on ultra tampons, which I had to special order online. I reoriented my life around accommodating side effects, all to avoid getting pregnant. I believed, and I still believe, that it\u2019s worth it. I will take the side effects if it means preventing both pregnancy and suicide \u2014 this is my body, and this is my choice.I have accepted my reality. I have accepted that today, in this world, if I want birth control without suicide, I will be in pain, inconvenienced, incapacitated for days each month. I have accepted my choice.But my experience has shown me that doctors haven\u2019t.I ask psychiatrists to address the physical side effects of this form of birth control I am stuck with. They ignore my plea for help, repeating what they have said so many times before: \u201cYou can\u2019t take hormonal birth control \u2014 it\u2019ll completely cancel out the benefits of your bipolar meds. And hormones deregulate your mood. You would be putting your mental health at serious risk.\u201d They are unanimous. Hopeless in their soothingly lit offices on their upholstered couches, I nod. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. I know all of this.Medical doctors outside of mental health care ignore the psychiatric arguments. They assign more importance to physical health than to mental health. Again and again they repeat, \u201cJust take out the IUD. How can it be worth these side effects?\u201d Go without birth control; use condoms or Plan B. I stare at their skeletal system posters and brochures offering treatment for eating disorders and repeat, again and again, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get pregnant \u2014 or even worry about getting pregnant.\u201d\u201cJust try it,\u201d they counter. \u201cTry hormonal birth control.\u201d But \u201cjust trying it\u201d means sinking into depression so severe I can\u2019t get out of bed, brush my teeth, live my life.No doctor, not one, has provided viable options to cope with the physical side effects of my birth control. They have repeatedly refused to offer me prescription-strength anti-inflammatories or pain treatment. Neither side is concerned with symptom reduction, with soothing me. They want me to do what they say, without addressing my concerns.I am not sure why doctors refuse to believe my symptoms are really that bad. Are they simply tunnel-visioned, unable to visualize the whole picture? But whatever the cause, the result is the same. They ignore the core of my struggle \u2014 my need to balance side effects. They ignore what I tell them. They ignore me.This decidedly non-holistic health care is a problem not just for me, but for all women forced to be their own advocates in managing both their mental and sexual health. As we change the dialogue around women\u2019s physical pain, we need doctors to take into account women\u2019s priorities, too \u2014 especially women living with mental illness.There are millions of women with mental illnesses like me. We are whole people with complex, intersecting and sometimes conflicting needs. Doctors must learn to treat our pain, but also take seriously our priorities. Perhaps if we all speak, or all scream together, we\u2019ll finally be heard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and the Aristocracy of Fraud", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "OpinionGovernment of tax cheats, by tax cheats, for tax cheats.Supported byOpinion ColumnistIt turns out that I may have done Donald Trump an injustice.Specifically, that\u2019s what he was making when he was 3 years old. He was a millionaire by the age of 8. Of course, the money came from his father \u2014 who spent decades evading the taxes he was legally required to pay on money given to his children.On one side, the family engaged in tax fraud on a huge scale, using a variety of money-laundering techniques to avoid paying what it owed. On the other, the story Donald Trump tells about his life \u2014 his depiction of himself as a self-made businessman who made billions starting from humble roots \u2014 has always been a lie: Not only did he inherit his wealth, receiving the equivalent of more than $400 million from his father, but Fred Trump bailed his son out after deals went bad.One implication of these revelations is that Trump supporters who imagine that they\u2019ve found a straight-talking champion who will drain the swamp while using his business acumen to make America great again have been suckered, bigly.But the tale of the Trump money is part of a bigger story. Even among those unhappy at the extent to which we live in an era of soaring inequality and growing concentration of wealth at the top, there has been a tendency to believe that great wealth is, more often than not, earned more or less honestly. It\u2019s only now that the amounts of sheer corruption and lawbreaking that underlie our march toward oligarchy have started to come into focus.But this view always rested on shaky foundations. After all, tax evasion, almost by definition, doesn\u2019t show up in official statistics, and the super-wealthy aren\u2019t in the habit of mouthing off about what great tax cheats they are. To get a real picture of how much fraud is going on, you either have to do what The Times did \u2014 exhaustively investigate the finances of a particular family \u2014 or rely on lucky breaks that reveal what was previously hidden.Matching information from the Panama Papers and other leaks with national tax data, these researchers found that outright tax evasion actually is a big deal at the top. The truly wealthy end up paying a much lower effective tax rate than the merely rich, not because of loopholes in tax law, but because they break the law. The wealthiest taxpayers, the researchers found, pay on average 25 percent less than they owe \u2014 and, of course, many individuals pay even less.Beyond that, our trend toward oligarchy \u2014 rule by the few \u2014 is also looking more and more like kakistocracy \u2014 rule by the worst, or at least the most unscrupulous. The corruption isn\u2019t subtle; on the contrary, it\u2019s cruder than almost anyone imagined. It also runs deep, and it has infected our politics, quite literally up to its highest levels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Populists and the Rise of Right-Wing Globalization ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president and the far right want to keep the free movement of goods and money, but not of people. Mr. Slobodian is the author of \u201cGlobalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism.\u201dFor those of us who came of age in the 1990s, there was an eerie sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Then, too, there were protests against global institutions insulated from democratic decision-making. In the most iconic confrontation, my college classmates helped scupper the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999.The movement called for \u201calter-globalization\u201d \u2014 a different kind of globalization more attentive to labor and minority rights, the environment and economic equality. Two decades later, traces of that movement are hard to find. But something surprising has happened in the meantime. A new version of alter-globalization has won \u2014 from the right.We often hear that world politics is divided between open versus closed societies, between globalists and nationalists. But these analyses obscure the real challenge to the status quo.President Trump and the far right preach not the end of globalization, but their own strain of it, not its abandonment but an alternative form. They want robust trade and financial flows, but they draw a hard line against certain kinds of migration. The story is not one of open versus closed, but of the right cherry-picking aspects of globalization while rejecting others. Goods and money will remain free, but people won\u2019t.The pattern of right-wing alter-globalization is repeated in Germany and Austria, where the Alternative for Germany and the Austrian Freedom Party have recently recorded electoral wins. Neither party proposes national self-sufficiency or economic withdrawal. In their programs, the rejection of economic globalization is highly selective. The European Union is condemned, but the language demanding increased trade and competitiveness is entirely mainstream. The Alternative for Germany takes fiscal conservatism to an absurd degree with criminal charges demanded for policymakers who overspend. Both parties call for no inheritance tax and burdensome regulations, even as they make new promises for social spending.Like Hong Kong and Singapore, these zones would not be isolated but hyper-connected, nodes for the flow of finance and trade ruled not by democracy (which would cease to exist) but market power with disputes settled through private arbitration. No human rights would exist beyond the private rights codified in contract and policed through private security forces. As Mr. Hoppe argues, the alt-right and identitarian vision of \u201ca place for every race\u201d need not conflict with a global division of labor. None of this need disrupt commercial exchange and the international division of labor. As Mr. Hoppe wrote, \u201cnot even the most exclusive form of segregationism has anything to do with a rejection of free trade.\u201d The maxim would be: separate but global.The varieties of right-wing alter-globalization differ significantly in degrees of horror. What they share is a rejection not of the \u201cpostwar international order\u201d \u2014 as many pundits fruitlessly argue \u2014 but of the order of the 1990s. In the cross hairs are the products of that decade, above all, the crown jewels of neoliberal globalism: the W.T.O., the European Union and Nafta (which was recently renegotiated and renamed).The right\u2019s alter-globalizers unite in a condemnation of the structures of multilateral governance that emerged from that decade along with their implication that democracy and capitalism were twins joined at the reported \u201cend of history.\u201dInstead, in a forthright embrace of inegalitarianism, they question the ability of every country and every population to practice democratic capitalism and, in many cases, propose a departure from status quo democratic capitalism themselves. The idea that openness is under attack is too vague. The formula of right-wing alter-globalization is: yes to free finance and free trade. No to free migration, democracy, multilateralism and human equality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taylor Swift, the Grown-Up in the Room", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTennessee progressives were unhappy with their options in a close Senate race. A 28-year-old pop star explained the stakes. Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 Last Sunday night, Taylor Swift did something she had never done in her stratospheric career as a pop star: She endorsed a political candidate in Tennessee, her adopted home state.She endorsed two candidates, actually, both Democrats: Representative Jim Cooper, who is running for re-election to Congress, and former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who is running to fill the Senate seat that the Republican Bob Corker is voluntarily, sort of, vacating.There\u2019s a good reason for any female artist, especially one who got her start on country radio, to think twice about wading into politics. To understand how much courage it took for Taylor Swift to post such a statement, you need to remember what happened to the Dixie Chicks back in 2003. At the time they were one of the most popular acts in country-music history and the top-selling female group of all time. Then, in the run-up to the Iraq war, the lead singer, Natalie Maines, told a London audience that the group opposed the coming invasion: \u201cWe do not want this war, this violence,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.\u201dTo their audience, the band members became public enemies overnight. Radio stations were bombarded with calls from irate listeners. The group\u2019s tour sponsor dropped them. Fans boycotted them. They got death threats. Ever since, country-music publicists have made it clear to their artists, especially their female artists: Skip the politics.Among the newly registered, more than 6,200 live in Tennessee, and Mr. Bredesen will need every one of them to show up at the polls on Nov. 6. Last year, when Senator Corker announced that he would not seek re-election, he cited his belief in a \u201ccitizen legislator model\u201d that eschews career politicians. His real reason: This is a blood-red state, and his clashes with President Trump had left Mr. Corker, a moderate Republican, bleeding. Unwilling to face a bruising primary challenge from a Tea Party candidate, he opened the door for a Tea Party candidate to waltz right in.Enter Marsha Blackburn: \u201cI\u2019m a hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative,\u201d she said in an ad announcing her decision to run. \u201cI\u2019m politically incorrect and proud of it.\u201d The ad was so far to the right of mainstream that Twitter blocked it for inflammatory content.Progressives were hoping Mr. Corker\u2019s announcement would be their chance to energize a listless state Democratic Party. True, Hillary Clinton won only three counties in Tennessee, but the state\u2019s two largest cities, Memphis and Nashville, consistently vote for Democrats. And given that Tennessee\u2019s urban population continues to grow even as its rural population shrinks, it stands to reason that a truly progressive candidate \u2014 someone charismatic and unapologetically liberal \u2014 could bring out young voters and people of color and thus change the whole nature of politics here.Instead, state Democrats got behind Phil Bredesen, a 74-year-old business-friendly moderate who previously served two terms as both mayor of Nashville and governor of Tennessee. It was a savvy move in many ways. Mr. Bredesen won all 95 Tennessee counties when he ran for re-election in 2006, his last campaign, and he still enjoys high name recognition and approval ratings here. In May, Vanderbilt University polled a representative sampling of Tennesseans, rating Mr. Bredesen\u2019s overall favorability at 67 percent.It\u2019s hard to imagine a candidate better poised to attract disaffected Republicans. If you\u2019re an old-school conservative and you\u2019re alarmed by an erratic president with no functional institutional checks on his most outrageous ideas, the last person you want to send to the Senate on your behalf is a rabble-rousing Trump apologist with a gun in her purse.For moderate Republican voters, a calm, affable fiscal conservative is an appealing alternative, especially one who has a history of standing up to his own party. (Mr. Bredesen responded to a budget crisis inherited from his predecessor by cutting 300,000 people from the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls. Liberals responded by staging a 77-day, round-the-clock sit-in at the governor\u2019s office, and I was cheering them on every single day.) Mr. Bredesen is an option who appeals to disaffected Republicans and moderate liberals alike. He supports renewing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program for undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children. He has criticized the Affordable Care Act but doesn\u2019t support abolishing it. He wants to expand background checks for gun purchases and increase the minimum wage. He supports Planned Parenthood, as well as marriage equality and net neutrality, and he\u2019s a champion for teachers.But for Tennessee progressives, Mr. Bredesen represents a tragic lost opportunity. He avoids discussing his positions on hot-button social issues, emphasizing instead his long history of cooperating with state Republicans on bipartisan projects. And he seems to have no stomach for partisan battles.During the controversy over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Mr. Bredesen called Christine Blasey Ford \u201ca heroine\u201d and said he was \u201cdisgusted by the treatment she received at the hands of the Senate.\u201d But he also believes the president of the United States has wide latitude in appointing qualified federal judges. When he announced that he supported Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, Tennessee liberals started muttering about sitting out the election. Nationally, at least two progressive organizations \u2014 MoveOn.org and Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Party super PAC \u2014 announced that they no longer support Mr. Bredesen.Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward, two other national political action committees funding liberal candidates for the Senate, have continued their support. But the biggest boost may have come from a 28-year-old pop star who pointed out what would seem to be obvious: that our choice is not between a progressive and a conservative. Our choice is between a mild-mannered, business-friendly centrist and a Tea Party Republican who has voted with the president 91 percent of the time, who favors the repeal of Roe v. Wade, who opposes marriage equality and who is in thrall to the Koch brothers and the National Rifle Association. The list of Marsha Blackburn\u2019s assaults on liberal values goes on and on and on.FiveThirtyEight.com puts Mr. Bredesen\u2019s chances of beating Ms. Blackburn at roughly 20 percent, but with any luck Taylor Swift has shifted the race considerably. As she pointed out in her Instagram post, \u201cWe may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100 percent on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.\u201d In Tennessee, the choice is clear.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the Tennessee Senator Bob Corker\u2019s plans for voting in the midterm elections. He does not intend to vote for Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who is running to replace him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Wrong With Germany\u2019s Social Democrats?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party should be embracing the challenge of economic inequality. Instead, it\u2019s shrinking away.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 What does it take to make a major political party so frustrated with itself that it prefers therapy over governing? The German Social Democrats are mired in a sort of depression. Call it power-phobia. The party governs the country as the junior partner with the center-right Christian Democrats, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 yet many members fear that carrying on in this coalition might destroy them.The party seems to be in free fall. In recent elections in the state of Bavaria, the Social Democrats, known by their German acronym SPD, scored their worst result ever, sliding from 20.6 to 9.7 percent. There is another election due in the state of Hessen this Sunday, where polls point to a similar result.Part of the party\u2019s problem is that Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives have co-opted many of the center-left\u2019s ideas, from the introduction of the minimum wage to the establishment of same-sex marriage, and in doing so both embraced and suffocated the Social Democrats.But there\u2019s another, self-inflicted reason for the malaise of the SPD. In the past two decades the Social Democrats have shifted to the right economically, but (perhaps as a compensation) to the left culturally. This may be fine for the country\u2019s urban upper classes, but it leaves most German voters confused about the party\u2019s appeal.At the same time, the SPD has ignored an issue that a center-left party, born of the labor movement, should be eager to embrace. Germany, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and Europe\u2019s richest country, is a prosperous place \u2014 but one rived by inequality and social injustice.You have to look twice at traditional data to see the scale of the problem. Unemployment has halved in the past 20 years, from around 11 percent to around 5 percent; private wealth has nearly doubled, to 11.7 trillion euros today. Wages have risen, too. Meanwhile, the richest 10 percent of the households in Germany possess nearly 60 percent of the entire net household wealth, according to a study by the trade union-linked Hans B\u00f6ckler foundation, well over the average for developed countries. This is Ms. Merkel\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Why has SPD not attacked it?The answers is that, in order to do so, the Social Democrats would have to confront themselves with their very own shortcomings, with failures that touch the heart of their leftist self-image. Over the last two decades, largely under the auspices of the Social Democrats \u2014 either as the governing party, or as the junior party with control over domestic ministries \u2014 state-financed poverty has been replaced by privately-financed poverty.The maximum rate kicks in comparatively early, with an annual income of around 55,000 euros. But how fair is it, from a leftist point of view, that the same tax rate applies to someone earning 200,000 euros? Nor did the SPD seem to mind that the chief executive of Deutsche Post earns 239 times the salary of his average employee.Then came the refugee crisis, which hit at a time when the belief in solidarity among Germans themselves had reached a low. All of a sudden, it seemed, the Social Democrats rediscovered their empathy for the underprivileged \u2014 as long as they had come from abroad. The party showed a striking lack of interest, at least rhetorically, on the social costs imposed by the arrival of over a million refugees.Yet the SPD\u2019s moral outrage did little to answer a complex question that confronts the entire continent: How do you distribute scant resources fairly in a framework that transgresses national boundaries?To organize globalization in a fairer way, into one a system at least resembles the balances of the old nation state, is both a demanding and a highly demanded task for Social Democracy today. It is something that the center left should be ready to tackle. Instead, the Social Democrats turning inward, unable to answer the country\u2019s most pressing questions at a time when Germany needs them.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump on a Collision Course With Impeachment? ", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisDemocrats are largely ducking the topic on the campaign trail, but few people in Washington doubt that it will be on the table if they win the House.Mr. Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times and an author, with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A. Engel, of \u201cImpeachment: An American History.\u201d COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 President Trump was energized. Fresh from the fight to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, he was firing up thousands of supporters at a rally by complaining about how Democrats had treated his nominee and how they may yet try to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the bench.\u201cBesides that,\u201d Mr. Trump then added slyly, \u201cI have to go first, right?\u201d The crowd laughed. Perhaps only in the Trump era would the prospect of being impeached become a punch line for the president of the United States. But after almost two years of living under the cloud of a possible impeachment, it may soon cease to be a laughing matter. While Democrats are largely ducking the topic on the campaign trail, few in Washington doubt that impeachment will be on the table if they win the House on Nov. 6.If that happens, anyone who thought the battle over Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was ugly and divisive should buckle up, because history suggests it would provide only a small taste of what lies ahead. The impeachment drives against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton tore at the nation\u2019s fabric, but an effort to remove Mr. Trump could lead to an even more incendiary conflict, thanks to the advent of social media and Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of blowtorch politics.Impeachment, by its nature, represents the ultimate test of American democracy, a titanic clash between two branches of government over whether the nation\u2019s leader has done such damage to the integrity of the Republic that the will of the people as expressed in our complicated election system should be overturned. It is, in effect, a moment of reckoning, as the framers intended it to be, a judgment on the standards of society as they shift through time.Rather than being apprehensive about the threat, Mr. Trump, who loves a good brawl, seems almost eager for Democrats to bring it on. He has begun making his case in recent months without waiting for the election. In August, he warned that if he is impeached, \u201cthe market would crash\u201d and \u201ceverybody would be very poor.\u201d In September, he told supporters it would be their fault if he is impeached because it would mean \u201cyou didn\u2019t go out to vote.\u201dAnd in Iowa, he laid out what would undoubtedly be his public argument. \u201cYou get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we\u2019ve just finished, in the history of our country.\u201dPutting aside the hyperbole about the economy and jobs numbers, which are both strong but hardly the best ever, Mr. Trump has a certain advantage going into any impeachment fight. The history of presidential impeachments shows that they are started by the opposition party but are never successful unless the president\u2019s party buys into the effort.In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, a Democratic House might impeach him, but even if Democrats take the Senate, they would still be far from the two-thirds necessary for conviction, meaning that 15 or more Republicans would have to go along. Such a scenario seems unlikely unless the special counsel, Robert Mueller, produces a report with such damning information that it transforms the current political dynamics.But once again, the country would be confronted with the question of what the framers meant by \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201dNixon\u2019s case was a more clear-cut abuse of power and obstruction of justice: the Watergate burglary to spy on his political opposition and the resulting cover-up, including the payment of hush money and, finally, a transcript of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape of him trying to order the C.I.A. to block the F.B.I. investigation. The House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach, and Nixon resigned rather than continue to fight after fellow Republicans abandoned him.Bill Clinton\u2019s case fell somewhere in the murky middle. Charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to impede a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones and by hiding his affair with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton was impeached on a nearly party-line vote in the House and acquitted in the Senate. Defenders were left to argue that yes, he may have violated the law, but it was not such a profound violation to merit removal.But it is hard to imagine Democrats not going there if they take the House, given the enormous pressure from their liberal base to at least open an impeachment inquiry. Three-quarters of Democrats told pollsters that they want Mr. Trump impeached. Tom Steyer, the liberal billionaire who has been financing television ads advocating impeachment, announced this past week that he has collected six million signatures on a petition.Peter Baker is an author, with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A.

{"Headline": "Meet the Young Female Photographers Who Documented 18-Year-Old Girls", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSThe New York Times asked 22 young women to take photos for a project exploring daily life for girls around the world who are becoming adults this year. She\u2019s 17, competes in slam poetry events and describes herself as \u201can amalgamation of creative witticisms, music references and chocolate.\u201d Raised by a single parent from a blue-collar background, this \u201cyoung, queer, black girl\u201d attends high school in a wealthy suburb of Washington, D.C. She is, as she puts it, \u201ca square peg in a round hole.\u201d\u201cWhat surprised me is that a major news outlet that is consumed by millions of people all over the world is allowing teenagers to tell teenager stories,\u201d she said. \u201cNormally, when a story is told, especially for a major news outlet, it\u2019s told by someone who\u2019s 30 or 40 years old. It\u2019s just seen from a different lens versus when your peers get to tell your story.\u201dStaff photographers for The New York Times usually have several years of professional experience at other news organizations, and even then, they usually have to wait awhile before they get to work on projects. But the visual journalists like Ms. Wallace whom we enlisted for this project were decidedly different. They were young women, mostly teenagers.Jessica Bennett, the paper\u2019s gender editor, realized early on that the key to success for this project was going to be getting an authentic view of the lives of 18-year-old girls. She and Jodi Rudoren, associate managing editor for audience \u2014 in collaboration with a team of editors and designers in Styles \u2014 decided the best way to assure that authenticity of experience was to have teenage photographers take the pictures and conduct interviews.The project, managed by Sharon Attia, a 23-year-old photographer herself, became less hierarchal because most of the young women also choose their subjects.The team behind the project paired each photographer with a mentor to help them complete the assignment and to make it a learning experience.We asked the photographers to find the girls, photograph and interview them, and make videos of their subjects, as well. Although the photographers were mostly in their late teens, they were asked to act like professionals. And they did.So how do you find a couple dozen talented female teenage photographers from all over the world? Well, let\u2019s say it takes a village \u2014 a global village. Sandra Stevenson, the project\u2019s picture editor, and I relied on a global network of photographers, editors and teachers that we have compiled over decades. The team decided not to take a set approach, but it did try to choose 18-year-old female subjects with various experiences from a variety of places. For the most part, it was an organic process, because it was led by the young women. And it was often an educational experience for the photographers, as Ad\u00e8le Foglia, a 21-year-old photographer from Montreal, noted.\u201cWhat surprised me the most about this project was to realize how differently the world all experiences this transition to adulthood,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also it pushed me to reflect on my own experience and to see how sometimes the world may be such an unwelcoming space for women who have dreams and the determination to realize those dreams.\u201dMany of the photographers felt empowered by the project and the opportunity to highlight their own concerns in their own communities.Jessie Mirelas, 19, who grew up in Zacatecas, Mexico, has always been proud of living in \u201ca diverse multicultural country with great architecture, great destinations and an exquisite gastronomy \u2014 a place where the peoples that preceded us remain alive.\u201d\u201cI believe this project is important because it\u2019s giving us a voice, an opportunity to tell our story not only just in Mexico, but to the world,\u201d said Ms. Mirelas, who studies at the University of Veracruz and wants to become a journalist. \u201cTo be able to show the legacy and cultural heritage of our indigenous peoples who are often neglected or ignored.\u201dYasmine Malone, who turned 20 this month, grew up in Clarksdale, Miss., in the Mississippi Delta and is now a student at the University Of Mississippi in Oxford, majoring in English and political science. Using just the camera in her phone, she documented Madison Justice, a teenage mother in Clarksdale.\u201cI saw much of my mom and sister in her when she spoke about these things, being that they have all experienced being a teen mom in poverty with limited resources,\u201d she said. \u201cThe frequency of this story is where its power stems. Madison Justice is not alone in her struggle; plenty of teens deal with it. Their stories deserve to be told for not only the realness of it all, but for its humanity, perseverance and strength.\u201dWhen many think of the Delta, they think of \u201cpoverty, crime, gun violence and low health rates,\u201d Ms. Malone said. She learned that \u201cwe all have a story worth telling\u201d which, over time fosters hope in her community. \u201cIf we can find our common threads,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll realize the gaps between us are not that big, and there is where real social change can happen.\u201dSome of the young photographers already had a mentor, but for the others, we asked photographers in their country to take on the role. Sandra provided guidance on how to take photographs and monitored the progress of participants to keep them on track. For three months straight, she was like an air traffic controller on the day before Thanksgiving \u2014 with some of the pilots speaking languages she did not understand.For many participants, the project was a crash course in documentary photography and filmmaking: Make wide shots so we can see where you are, and also details. Photograph them hanging out with both friends and family and in their rooms alone. And be sure to collect family photos. Oh, and make a video of them, too.Ms. Bennett and Ms. Attia teamed up with editors from the Styles section and digital and print designers to curate all the material and present it as a zine.At the beginning, each photographer was asked to find three different 18 year olds. We asked them to not choose their friends and to send us a brief bio of each subject and a few photos of them in their rooms. The team then chose one of those subjects for each photographer.Sarah Sunday Moses, 19, hails from South Sudan but grew up in Kenya after her parents fled the instability in their country. She photographed Wanjiku Muthoni Gakuru, who is studying urban planning at the University of Nairobi. What impressed Ms. Moses \u201cthe most in doing the project was the amount of people that were required,\u201d she said, and the complexity of the forms that we asked the photographers to fill out.She hopes that readers see that \u201cdespite being from different parts of the world, we are still similar,\u201d she said.Some of the photographers documented young women who were similar to themselves, while others spent time in situations quite different from their own. Tahia Farhin Haque from Dhaka, Bangladesh, is studying biochemistry at North South University while also studying at a photography school. While she describes herself as a practicing Muslim who wears a hijab, she photographed Shama Ghosha, a young Hindu woman who lives with her husband in Chandpur and hopes to finish high school and become a teacher.\u201cI went there with my eyes shut and came back with my eyes open of an entirely different life of a girl that lived in a different state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must empathize with the world around us. And not take anything for granted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Search and Rescue Begins Amid Ruins of Florida Coast", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by[For the latest updates on Hurricane Michael, read our Friday live briefing.]MEXICO BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Search-and-rescue teams rushed on Thursday to reach communities that Hurricane Michael leveled, hoping to find survivors of the powerful storm after its rampage through the Florida Panhandle and beyond left buildings collapsed and splintered, hospitals damaged, roads and water systems compromised and more than a million homes and businesses without electricity.Although it was clear by afternoon that the storm had caused widespread damage, some areas remained largely cut off, and the authorities were trying to deploy rescuers by helicopter and boat.\u201cThis is a very dense part of the state, so it\u2019s going to be a lot of work to get to everybody,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said. \u201cBut we will get to everybody.\u201dHere are the latest developments:\u2022 Four deaths occurred in Gadsden County, west of Tallahassee, according to Lt. Anglie Hightower, a spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s office. The victims included a man who died when a tree crashed down on his home in Greensboro.\u2022 An 11-year-old girl, Sarah Radney, was killed on Wednesday when a carport was torn away and was sent hurtling into the modular home she was in, said Chad Smith, the coroner of Seminole County, Ga. \u201cShe was sitting right next to her grandmother,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who described the girl\u2019s death as a \u201chorrible accident.\u201d\u2022 Governor Scott said that 30 shelters were open, with about 4,381 people occupying them. Over a thousand search-and-rescue workers had been deployed.\u2022 In a briefing with reporters, the governor said that cities like Chipley and Bristol looked as if they had been hit by a tornado. The site of the worst damage, he said, appeared to be Mexico Beach, near where the storm made landfall. \u201cThere\u2019s just stuff everywhere,\u201d he said.The storm is the worst ever to hit the Florida Panhandle.\u2022 \u201cThe big problem with this hurricane was the tremendous power,\u201d President Trump said on Thursday, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve not seen destruction like that for a long time.\u201dTed Carranza could only watch with horror and wonder as Hurricane Michael lifted the houses all around him in the small town of Mexico Beach, Fla., then spun them around and dropped them.\u201cIt was insane,\u201d Mr. Carranza said Thursday from the town where the storm had crossed onto land a day earlier. It was a city in ruin. All around him, in places where there were once houses, now there were mere piles of lumber, junked home furnishings, mangled roofing, fishing rods, ceiling fans, sheets, clothing, bottles.\u201cThese were all block and stucco houses \u2014 gone,\u201d said Tom Bailey, 66, a former mayor of the city, gesturing to a flat beachside plain riddled with junk piles and a few bent trees.The roads became passable into town on Thursday, and it became evident that few communities had suffered more. Known for its sport fishing, the city of about 2,000 permanent residents swells to as many as 14,000 in July, and is known for having a relaxed, small-town feel compared with the brash tourist strips of Panama City Beach or tony nearby beach developments like Alys Beach or Seaside.But Mexico Beach is now a splintered, flattened wreck, with expensive boats pushed up halfway onto land, piers and docks destroyed, and the main street through town piled with the jumbled remains of permanent homes and vacation places.\u201cThe mother of all bombs doesn\u2019t do any more damage than this,\u201d said Mr. Bailey, a retired Army major, as he pushed his bicycle down the main drag, marveling at the damage.Officials were not allowing visitors to drive into town, as the roads were barely passable, but convoys of military trucks and Humvees were moving in, while hard-hatted search and rescue crews moved door to door \u2014 although often there were no doors \u2014 to search for survivors and bodies.In the late morning, two men from the New Orleans Fire Department could be seen searching the second story of a raised home, the face of which had been sheared off by the wind. From the ground level, the rescue workers looked like dolls in a dollhouse.Mr. Bailey was asked if there was anything that could be done to help.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, pushing off on his bicycle, \u201cturn back the clock two days.\u201dThe storm reached deep into the Florida Panhandle. In Marianna, more than 60 miles northeast of Panama City, roofs and walls were torn off buildings, pine trees were snapped, and piles of bricks and debris were strewn across downtown streets.\u201cThere are buildings over 100 years old where the facades were just ripped off,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cIt looks like a bomb, not a hurricane.\u201dLeroy E. Wilson Jr., who was driving from his home near Marianna to Dothan, Ala., said: \u201cThe area is totally destroyed almost. We have no power. The neighbors have no power.\u201dRescue efforts started Thursday morning, and Mr. Bishop said residents were out helping one another dig out. Some were even clearing roads. \u201cChain saws are the hot commodity here,\u201d he said.A giant oak tree had fallen through the corner of his parents\u2019 roof and snapped a power line.\u201cWe\u2019ll be without power for a while,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cThe yard? I\u2019m about to put in some sweat equity with my brothers.\u201dBay Medical Center Sacred Heart, a 300-bed hospital in the heart of Panama City, Fla., was a tumultuous mess on Thursday morning. Hurricane Michael had strafed the center, breaking windows, damaging roofs and stripping off the outsides of some buildings. Signage was strewn in the streets. Doctors, nurses and staff members wandered outside, some crying, some looking for cell service.Bay Medical was one of two hospitals in Panama City \u2014 the other being Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center \u2014 that was damaged in the storm. Both were evacuating patients.The hospital was in poor condition to take in patients. Staff members said the hospital had partial electricity from its generators; there was no water and the toilets were filling up. Windows were broken. One staff member said that the fourth floor was flooded. She had tied plastic bags over her shoes and the legs of her scrubs.Dr. Brian Roake, the head of the anesthesiology department, was among those who rode out the hurricane in the hospital. \u201cIt was like hell,\u201d he said.Some Springfield, Fla., residents were desperate for supplies, and sometimes took what they needed. At a half-ruined Dollar General store on Thursday, residents walked in and out of a shattered glass door with instant coffee, soft drinks, water and nail polish.Most came looking for something to drink or eat. \u201cWhere\u2019s the water?\u201d one man asked.\u201cDown here, dude, it\u2019s fight for yourself,\u201d said another man who walked off with an armful of sodas. \u201cIt\u2019s no water, no power nowhere.\u201dAn S.U.V. full of men pulled up. A couple entered. One of them moved through the flooded store stuffing a backpack with Gatorade bottles.\u201cI need some batteries,\u201d someone else said. \u201cWhat are you gonna do if you need something? I got toddlers at home.\u201dSomeone said the police were coming. And they were. But the cruiser drove by.Tyndall Air Force Base, which straddles a narrow spit of land jutting out into the Gulf, a dozen miles south of Panama City, \u201csustained extensive damage,\u201d a post on the base\u2019s Facebook page said.Winds topping 130 miles an hour knocked down trees, felled power lines, tore roofs from buildings, and ripped a static display of an F-15 fighter jet at the base entrance from its foundation, pitching it into the air and tipping it upside down.Fortunately, \u201cthere have been no injuries reported on Tyndall at this time,\u201d the Facebook post said.The base, which sits just nine feet above sea level, is home to a series of hangars and a runway, as well as tree-lined neighborhoods for about 600 Air Force personnel. The base hosts a number of jets, including F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, which cost well over $100 million each. The base commander ordered all jets to fly to inland bases earlier in the week.The roof of the base\u2019s largest hangar, which has been used to store jets during weaker storms, was skinned down to its steel rafters, revealing at least three small planes inside, covered in debris. Though the video did not reveal large amounts of standing water near the flight line, it showed roofs shorn off several other buildings surrounding the hangar, garage doors punched in, and cars flipped over.It was unclear Thursday if the runway was usable. Base officials said they were assessing damage. It was not known when personnel would be able to return.Other Air Force bases along the coast, as well as the Navy base in Panama City, have resumed limited operations.Governor Scott said Thursday that Michael had left a wide trail of devastation, and that the authorities had turned their immediate focus to rescue efforts.\u201cWe are deploying a massive wave of response, and those efforts are already underway,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cHelp is coming by air, land and sea.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio of Florida said he had heard from the local authorities who described extensive damage. \u201cThese are not people prone to hyperbole,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN. \u201cPanama City is catastrophic damage. Someone told me, \u2018Mexico Beach is gone.\u2019\u201dThe other areas of greatest concern were the eastern parts of Panama City, Apalachicola and around Tyndall Air Force Base, said Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Mr. Long said that he was equally concerned about communities in southwest Georgia, which received Category 2 wind speeds, because of the large number of mobile homes in that part of the state. \u201cWe are always worried about trees falling on manufactured homes and mobile homes,\u201d he said.Early reports suggested significant damage. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia said 450,000 homes and businesses were without power in the state, and that 35 hospitals or nursing homes were without electricity and operating with generators.\u201cRight now, the main focus is going to be on debris removal so that power line trucks and repair crews can access the areas that are without power,\u201d Mr. Deal said at the State Capitol in Atlanta.Mr. Long expected the search-and-rescue process to be challenging, given all the fallen trees, debris and downed power lines. He worried that the number of people killed in the storm would rise once crews reached places where people did not evacuate.\u201cPeople do not live to tell the tale about storm surge,\u201d he said.Florida officials also pleaded with residents to stay off the roads as crews tried to clear debris and emergency workers were scrambling to hard-hit areas. They asked people to avoid downed power lines, and not to drive through flooded areas. They urged residents and visitors to keep emergency phone lines open and, in some areas, to boil their water or use bottled water. They told them to position generators at least 15 feet from homes, and to stay indoors.In a somewhat unusual step, the state had activated a team from a nonprofit humanitarian aid organization that typically works in overseas disasters, the International Medical Corps, including 50 nurses, two hospital emergency department teams and one emergency hospital.After a ferocious wallop of the Florida Panhandle, the tropical storm that was once Hurricane Michael slogged up through the Carolinas on Thursday, states that have had a lifetime\u2019s worth of bad weather in the last few years. Disastrous floods swamped South Carolina in 2015, then Matthew hit in 2016, then Florence in September, and now this.\u201cFor North Carolina, Michael isn\u2019t as bad as Florence, but it adds unwelcomed insult to injury, so we must be on alert,\u201d Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement on Thursday.Michael took a very different track through the Carolinas; it is headed up through the west-central parts of the states, drenching mid-state cities and mountain towns \u2014 there was a minor landslide in far western North Carolina \u2014 while to a large degree sparing the eastern stretches that were inundated a month ago.Officials in places like Wilmington, N.C., reduced to a powerless island for days after Florence, used terms like \u201cinconvenience\u201d to describe the potential effects of Michael.\u201cThe ground is already inundated, it\u2019s been a very wet time,\u201d said Will Holt, the emergency services director in mountainous Watauga County, N.C., where firefighters have already had to rescue people from flooded areas. \u201cThe wind is projected to pick back up as well.\u201dRead more here about how the region hit by Florence is suffering again.Richard Fausset reported from Mexico Beach; Patricia Mazzei from Panacea, Fla.; and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

Then it was all work in Baden-Baden, where I had been asked to compare the town\u2019s famed Old World spa treatments with the latest high-tech spas in New York for a women\u2019s magazine (a hardship assignment, to be sure).For nearly three weeks, I meandered through the Black Forest, across the Alpenstrasse where small woodland creatures seemed to frolic beside me Snow White-style, in the early October frost, into Munich and then up north through a landscape speckled with Germany\u2019s famed castles and medieval cities (known as the Romantic Road) back to Frankfurt.These things were best appreciated by a family, and I didn\u2019t have one.Fifteen years later, I do, and the plan was to replicate, as closely as possible, my original itinerary together, a family of five. Would the magic hold up and perhaps acquire extra fairy dust in the company of three medium-size children? Was the timing right, or were we too late?Now 9, 11 and 13, my children had graduated from wooden playthings, and left behind earlier days of reading Grimm, watching the Disney versions on repeat and memorizing the lyrics from \u201cInto the Woods.\u201d They\u2019d moved on to Greek myths and J.R.R. Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons and dystopian fiction. Though the source material was clearly the same.Traveling with one or two kids is relatively straightforward: You can rent pretty much any size car. You can squeeze into a single room. Not so when you\u2019ve overdone it with three or more. Everything is more complicated at hotels, especially with three children who are at an age when asking any of them to share a bed is like putting two cats in a bag. Verboten.Unless your children have the magical combination of age, gender and disposition to sleep peacefully in the same bed (hats off), you need a room with four beds, or better yet, a room with one bed and another with three.You also need a minivan. Not a stylish European minivan that could pass for a car if you squint. No, you need a big, dumb American version \u2014 and do not confuse that with an S.U.V., which has neither the legroom for five nor the trunk capacity for five suitcases. Car rental companies do not generally get into these subtleties, which is why we found ourselves staggering with jet lag at the Frankfurt airport, filling out forms to upgrade to a decent-size minivan, one that might even fit all our suitcases if we abandoned the concept of rearview vision.We were tired. We were hungry. We set off to Heidelberg on a series of German autobahns, squeezed into what felt like a Beetle.50 milesGermanyFrankfurtRhineMainNuremburgHeidelbergRothenburg ob der TauberBaden-W\u00fcrttembergBaden-BadenFranceStuttgartBavariaGutachRustNeckar R.MunichTribergblackforestMittenwaldLake ConstanceSwitzerlandAustriaBy The New York TimesWith one more challenge \u2014 or, as a fairy tale would have it, an obstacle: One of those three children is vegan and we were in southern Germany where vegetarianism is only lightly tolerated, and vegan (we tried out various pronunciations on our waiters) is understood mostly as an insult in the land of bratwurst and schnitzel. Menus had to be scrutinized, allergen lists examined. Waiters, stumped, retreated into kitchens to consult with chefs. At one Swabian restaurant, the waiter apologetically retrieved a bowl of noodles made with eggs. At another, when we asked if we could just please get a veggie plate, the owner threw up his hands. \u201cVegetables?\u201d he huffed, motioning us out. \u201cThis is a traditional Bavarian restaurant; we don\u2019t have vegetables!\u201dDriving was less challenging, despite kids prone to backseat nausea. We kept our rides under two hours. Remaining within two regions, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria, we traveled from Heidelberg to Baden-Baden, through the Black Forest, down to the Bodensee and into Bavaria, upward to Munich and northward on the Romantic Road back to Frankfurt.Our hotels began in jetlag-friendly luxury, before downshifting to more modest, but still spacious, lodgings and a three-day Airbnb in Munich, with a strategic happy ending at a castle stay outside Rothenburg ob der Tauber.I had originally envisioned reading Grimm tales to my children at night as we roamed the Black Forest. But if I\u2019d suggested \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d at their current ages, they\u2019d have sent me off to Frau Holle to do her worst. Instead, to keep things at least somewhat within the spirit of the traditional German fairy tale, we listened to Edgar Allan Poe audiobook stories in the car. At night, my youngest read a series based on the Norse myths, but set in the Black Hills of South Dakota. My middle child picked up his first Stephen King and my eldest blitzed her way through an endless series of post-apocalyptic doom. I read a Jo Nesbo thriller to keep up the spirit.Darkness truly descended in Triberg, a touristy slice of the Black Forest set on a hill under Germany\u2019s highest waterfall. Here, I had promised my children a visit to the Cuckoo Clock Museum. I had such fond memories of the place! The museum\u2019s main room was huge, cavernous, sunken, wood-paneled. Inside, Geppetto-style, was clock after chirping clock, each more wondrously intricate than the last.And so we went to the park. Two of them. In recent decades, \u201cbarefoot parks,\u201d public spaces specifically groomed to accommodate earthy types without their Birkenstocks, have sprung up around Europe, mostly in Germany and Austria. For a small fee, visitors are provided lockers for their shoes, before setting off on a path designed to heighten one\u2019s attention to the senses, from the painful spike of walking across wood chips or on gravel, to the squishiness of traipsing through mud puddles. Along the way, visitors are encouraged to touch, smell and explore the outdoors and meditate in the shade.Europa Park is like Disneyland stripped of its commercial veneer. Organized nominally by European country, food and rides reflect each geographic region. Germany naturally covers the most territory and a lovely section is dedicated to Grimm\u2019s Enchanted Forest, where the tales are fairly represented without cuddly bunnies to offset the fright.Rather than dumping ridegoers into a character-ridden emporium after each 45-second ride, the park relegates stores largely to the background. Not once did I hear, \u201cCan we get?\u201d or \u201cI want that!\u201d The food was varied and halfway decent, but once my kids discovered the Food Loop, where patrons order by touch-screen and meals are delivered to your table via a massive marble mazelike contraption, further culinary exploration was put to a halt.A subtler fairy tale setting was found in the small town of Mittenwald, Germany\u2019s center for violin-making, with its impeccably preserved pedestrian old town, canals flowing along the cobblestone streets. The exterior walls of its whitewashed buildings are painted Bavarian-style with biblical scenes and imagery depicting the varying trades of the shopkeepers and restaurateurs within. My two cello-playing sons were entranced by visits to the studios of the celebrated luthiers, Anton Maller, who allowed my trembling older son to play a $10,000 cello, and Anton Sprenger, who gave us an impromptu concert on his own violin. (A photo on the wall showed him in the company of Angela Merkel and a grinning Barack Obama. We were likewise dazzled.)The viewer, or more accurately, the participant, enters a dark room whose walls are covered with words scrawled in chalk. Wearing a virtual reality headset with attached remote controls, you\u2019re offered various options (Ms. Anderson\u2019s gravelly voice guides you) for exploring the virtual landscape. You can fly, for example, through swirling words or plunge yourself headlong into the text. Phrases rush by, occasionally forming sentences. You are fully immersed in \u2014 and only occasionally in control of \u2014 the narrative.It\u2019s a very contemporary form of storytelling, a technologically enhanced one, a kind of modern magic, a voyage of discovery where you are at once storyteller and reader. We emerged, all of us, flushed with enchantment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriott\u2019s Merger of Hotel Rewards Programs Tests Members\u2019 Loyalty", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen Greenstein didn\u2019t expect to spend more than four hours on the phone over three days just to redeem points for a hotel booking in Boston.But Mr. Greenstein, an entrepreneur from Baltimore who travels frequently for work, got caught in the not-so-smooth merger in August of Marriott International\u2019s traveler rewards program with the Starwood Preferred Guest and Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs.\u201cPrior to this merger, it was never like that,\u201d said Mr. Greenstein, a member of Starwood\u2019s SPG program. When he went online, he said, he found that he was not the only one who couldn\u2019t get help with his account after the merger. \u201cWhat really bugged me more than anything else was when I went to Facebook and looked on the SPG page and saw how many people were having that problem,\u201d he said.Irate members posted to complain they were unable to log in to their profiles or merge their accounts, or discovered that their accounts were missing points or nights counting toward elite status. Those who called Marriott found themselves on the phone for long stretches before they could speak to a representative, and then that the agents were unable to fix the glitches immediately.\u201cI used to call and within 30 seconds they\u2019d pick up the phone,\u201d said John Metallo, a retired school administrator and elite SPG member who said he preferred to book rooms over the phone rather than electronically. \u201cIt was almost like a concierge service. That was one of the nice things about the program.\u201dHe, too, said it had taken multiple days and hours on hold to rectify an error that erased about 35,000 points from his balance of around 200,000.Although Marriott completed its purchase of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which includes brands like W, Westin and Sheraton, in 2016, it had until this summer retained the loyalty programs as three separate entities. Its plan was to merge the three in a single, seamless technological transition. That was not what happened.\u201cBringing that technology together was a very challenging undertaking,\u201d said David Flueck, Marriott\u2019s senior vice president for global loyalty. The task, which created a loyalty program with more than 110 million members, took nearly two years, he said, and entailed writing some 20 million new lines of computer code.\u201cWe ended up bringing over about four billion records from the Starwood technology systems,\u201d Mr. Flueck said. He described the merger as 99.9 percent successful, though he acknowledged that it still left millions of customer records in limbo, some for weeks before they were resolved.\u201cIt did take us a couple of weeks to figure out why those records didn\u2019t come over as they should have and solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge there for us is these are very complex questions to answer.\u201dGiven the scope of the task, there were almost bound to be some hiccups, loyalty program technology experts say. Some suggested the problems might have been mitigated if Marriott had run a test on a small group of customers before rolling out the merger to everyone at once.\u201cI don\u2019t think that they anticipated having as many problems as they did,\u201d said Flo Lugli, principal of Navesink Advisory Group, a travel technology consulting firm. \u201cThat\u2019s clear from the way the call centers were just inundated.\u201dShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they just didn\u2019t anticipate the angst of the SPG members.\u201dSome loyalty program experts pointed to airline mergers and the lessons drawn from those frequent flier program combinations.\u201cMy sense is that the US Air-American one actually went very smoothly and was also very slow and methodical,\u201d said Mark Haley, managing partner at the Prism Partnership, a hospitality consulting firm. \u201cI think some of the others were done in more of a Big Bang fashion and had more impact on the traveler. I think United-Continental had some real issues.\u201d\u201cLoyalty is a big business, but also a small enough business that consolidations of this magnitude don\u2019t happen very often,\u201d Mr. Haley said.Kenneth Sweet, who teaches management at Texas A & M University in San Antonio and spends more than 100 nights a year in Marriott hotels, said that he appreciated the greater variety of hotels in the merged program, but that interactions with the company had been frustrating.\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t announced they were fully integrated, it\u2019s about what I would have expected,\u201d he said.For SPG loyalists, the long wait for a resolution seemed to confirm their fears that being absorbed by the hotel behemoth would mean the elimination of perks and personalized customer service that were hallmarks of their previous loyalty program.\u201cTypically, I\u2019ve always been pleased with the Starwood level of customer service,\u201d said Shane Farmer, who estimated that he used to spend 60 nights a year in Starwood hotels for his job in the health care industry. \u201cThey\u2019re always polite and well versed in the policies. I haven\u2019t experienced any of that since the merger.\u201dMr. Farmer said he had run into complications trying to merge his Marriott Rewards and SPG accounts and spent more than an hour on hold on a dedicated customer service line for platinum-level members.\u201cIt was a stark change when Starwood had the platinum line and they answered on the first or second ring,\u201d he said.Nor were former Starwood members the only ones caught up. Some elite members of Marriott Rewards said they, too, felt lost in the shuffle over the merger.Mr. Sweet, the professor, said he had encountered long waits on Marriott\u2019s elite reservations line and agents unable to answer questions about his stays.\u201cDid they actually think they were turnkey ready and this was going to be seamless?\u201d he asked. \u201cI assume these are things that will work themselves out, but they made an artificial expectation for themselves.\u201dIn advance of the official merger on Aug. 18, Marriott said, it added customer service representatives and trained some of its existing call center workers to handle an expected influx of calls. Since then, the company said, it has added 225 \u201cloyalty care associates\u201d and will add more if demand warrants it. It said it had also added 200 workers to help answer merger-related emails.\u201cThe most important thing to me was the Platinum phone reservations line,\u201d said Corey Loeffelholz, who spends as many as 160 nights a year away from his home in Wisconsin for his job at a technology company.Being able to reach a live agent right away was a big advantage if he was trying to make a reservation while rushing through an airport, he said. \u201cThat was the level of service I\u2019d come to expect from Marriott and it was an advantage over other chains.\u201dMr. Loeffelholz said being routed to an automated phone tree had the potential to be a deal-breaker. \u201cThat was my No. 1 benefit. Now, I rarely get straight through to people,\u201d he said.A Marriott spokesman said that voice-activated automated call routing on its elite line was intended to help get customers\u2019 questions answered more quickly, and that callers still have the option of saying \u201cagent\u201d to reach a customer service representative. The company said its recently added enhancements had cut wait times on the elite line by nearly 75 percent since Aug. 24.Balancing efficiency with customer satisfaction is a needle Marriott will have to thread carefully to keep elite-status guests happy, said Chekitan Dev, a professor of marketing and branding at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration. High-spending travelers expect to be catered to, he said, and any reduction in the perception that elite status confers an elevated level of personal service could erode loyalty.\u201cPeople expected a certain amount of customer service and personalization,\u201d he said.While there were scattered claims across social media and on frequent-traveler message boards of rooms and affiliated credit cards being canceled out of frustration, conversations with hotel owners indicate that these threats are not being carried out on a wide scale, said Michael Bellisario, a vice president and senior analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, a financial services company that buys and sells Marriott stock.\u201cSo far, no one\u2019s seen a material change in direct bookings,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t anticipate mass defections. \u201cYou get used to certain perks. No one likes change. I feel like there\u2019s always that initial grumble factor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Handwritten cards and letters.Besides fame and success, what do all of these people have in common? Something surprisingly unglamorous and gloriously analog: a love of physical cards and letters. Of notes that need a lick and a stamp instead of a click and a swoosh. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s classy to do it with real mail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to do it on email. And it also doesn\u2019t mean as much.\u201d Not to mention, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be thought of as classy.\u201d They could write to anyone, as long as the content was positive. With each letter, the writers experienced higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and lower levels of depressive symptoms. If you want to show you care, snail mail is an effective method. Think about the last time you received a hand-addressed missive \u2014 didn\u2019t it make you smile?Since cards require more effort than email, Ms. Heshmati said recipients will likely \u201cfeel more loved because you took the time to do that for them.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s the care that comes with it that signals the love.\u201d Whereas emails are something to rush through on the way to Inbox Zero, cards and letters are something to cherish; to set on a desk, to stick to a fridge, to bind into a book for future generations. Because of snail mail\u2019s novelty, what you say \u2014 and what it looks like \u2014 often matters less than the act itself. \u201cMy husband sends handwritten notes scratched out with a pencil, and people just sit up and sing,\u201d said Ms. Shepherd, the calligrapher. \u201cThey\u2019re so happy to get something in the mail, even if it doesn\u2019t have a lot of production value.\u201dWhen one of Mr. Sedaris\u2019s friends comes out with a new book or play, he sends a card with specific details like: \u201cI loved it on Page 38 when you did this.\u201d \u201cI just realize how much it means when somebody goes into details,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it makes me feel good, and it\u2019s not that hard. \u2026 A little effort is all it takes.\u201d Mr. Sedaris is right: Although snail mail requires more work than its digital kin, it\u2019s still not hard. Then grab a book of stamps and a nice pen and toss it all into a shoe box. Now you\u2019re ready for snail mail \u2014 with minimal hassle. (You can even batch cards at the beginning of each month by scanning your calendar for upcoming birthdays and celebrations.)The next time you\u2019re tempted to send a congratulatory email or a digital birthday message, try a card instead. If you\u2019re looking for an event to kick you off, consider making this holiday season the one where you offer friends a chance to get on a holiday card list \u2014 no strings or reciprocation attached (if that\u2019s O.K. with you) \u2014 and send a personal note to each loved one who signs up.\u201cThere\u2019s something permanently charming about getting an envelope in the mail,\u201d said Ms. Shepherd. \u201cIt\u2019s as if somebody gift wrapped their words for you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Insulting Lies From Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat we face now is a test for President Trump and America itself.Opinion ColumnistAfter lying for more than two weeks about the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi government has now announced a series of new lies about his murder in ways that insult both Jamal\u2019s memory and our intelligence. It\u2019s also grotesque for the Saudi authorities to claim that a journalist whose fingers they reportedly amputated as part of their torture somehow managed to engage in a fistfight. Jamal had no fists left. I had known Jamal for more than 15 years, and I\u2019m appalled by every element of what happened: By what appears to have been his brutal torture-murder, by the cover-up afterward, by President Trump's downplaying of Jamal's killing, and now by the effort by the Saudi government to set up scapegoats to take the fall. Saudi Arabia even announced that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who almost everybody believes must have approved this operation \u2014 his initials, M.B.S., are now said to stand for \u201cMr. Bone Saw\u201d \u2014 will lead an investigation into what happened. That\u2019s like appointing O.J. Simpson to investigate the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. These lies are so blatant and implausible that they underscore how out of touch M.B.S. is, and also suggest M.B.S. believes that he will have the backing of the United States in this cover-up. That\u2019s a good bet, since Trump has lately celebrated the assault on a journalist by a Montana congressman and previously suggested that maybe a rogue killer was responsible for killing Jamal. So what we really have now is a test of Trump and of America itself. Will Trump go along with the cover-up, or will he attempt to uphold America\u2019s honor and dignity in this instance? Here\u2019s what he should do: 1. Since this happened in a NATO country, the NATO nations should jointly seek a United Nations-backed international investigation of the murder. This could be ordered by the United Nations Security Council, the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council. 2. The NATO countries should, in coordination, expel all Saudi ambassadors. 3. NATO countries should suspend all weapons sales, including of spare parts for aircraft, to Saudi Arabia. This would put substantial pressure on Saudi Arabia, which depends on the United States for its security. 4. The Trump administration should in the meantime call for the release of political prisoners in Saudi Arabia such as Raif Badawi, a blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes, and Loujain al-Hathloul, a women\u2019s rights activist. Jamal\u2019s relatives should also be allowed to leave Saudi Arabia. I also hope that some country will pursue universal jurisdiction for this murder and be ready to prosecute any killers who can be taken into custody. And Turkey should note that under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, consular officers can be arrested \u201cin the case of a grave crime\u201d; Turkey should consider prosecution. In the coming days and weeks, we also face special risks. We should be particularly alert to the risk that M.B.S. will try to divert attention by provoking some incident with Iran in the Persian Gulf, and then trying to get the American military to bail Saudi Arabia out. The White House should make it very clear that we will not let the Saudis drag us into a war with Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Democrat. Fighter. Mother.\u2019 Lucy McBath Is Redefining Social Justice in Politics.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALPHARETTA, Ga. \u2014 An air of solemnity hangs over Lucy McBath\u2019s bid for Congress.It is present in her campaign stump speech, when she recounts the 2012 murder of her son, Jordan Davis, a black teenager who was shot and killed by a white man at a gas station when the 17-year-old refused to lower the volume of the rap music playing in his car.It is present in her interactions with voters in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, who often greet Ms. McBath with weary eyes and deep condolences before discussing policy issues like health care or asking for the requisite candidate selfie.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing today is still mothering his legacy,\u201d Ms. McBath said at a meet-and-greet event in this Atlanta suburb. \u201cI\u2019m extending what I would do for my son to my community.\u201dVoters listening to Ms. McBath remark on how different she is from other politicians \u2014 how quiet the room gets when she talks, how personal her stories are.\u201cYou feel for her as a mother,\u201d said Cheryl Brown, 60, who for years before meeting Ms. McBath, kept a Jet Magazine cover featuring Jordan Davis at her Atlanta-area home. The cover read, \u201cIs Your Child Next?,\u201d and it resonated with Ms. Brown because she, too, fears her black son could fall victim to racist violence.More than anyone else running for Congress, Ms. McBath, the Democratic nominee in a Republican-leaning race, is redefining social justice in politics this year, in large part through her deep personal connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet she is also far from the only candidate this election cycle to explicitly discuss issues of racial injustice and violence against minorities.Many Democratic candidates across the country, after years of tiptoeing around issues of race out of fear of alienating white voters, are slowly adopting the language of anti-racist activists. It is an attempt to connect more closely with black voters, in particular, whose turnout will be key in several of November\u2019s most hotly contested midterm elections. Republicans have poured money into advertisements that lambaste Democrats on that move, casting their evolution as a sign of a corroding culture that\u2019s too politically correct.A new advertisement from the National Republican Campaign Committee about who \u201cowns\u201d the Democratic Party, for instance, begins with an image of Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback who knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality.\u201cPrima donna athletes protesting our anthem\u201d the advertisement begins.Ms. Brown\u2019s husband, a 59-year-old attorney named Mark Brown, said he considered his vote for Ms. McBath to be a rebuke against those who have \u201ccaricatured the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t kids protesting in the street with signs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a middle-aged black woman talking about her lived experience.\u201dRepublicans are locked into the moment, too, but from the opposite direction.Fueled by Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on protesting N.F.L. players like Mr. Kaepernick and the president\u2019s dismissals of any discussion of police brutality as anti-police, Republicans have raced to mimic his language.Senator Ted Cruz, locked in a re-election battle in Texas, in August unveiled a television advertisement touting his pledge to stand for the national anthem. Other Republicans in tough races have run similar ads, like Brian Kemp, the party\u2019s nominee for governor of Georgia, and Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Senate candidate.Representative Bruce Poliquin, a Maine Republican who is in a highly competitive fight for re-election this fall, immediately called for residents to boycott Nike on his campaign Facebook page in September after Mr. Kaepernick became the face of the shoe company\u2019s recent \u201cJust Do It\u201d marketing campaign.In Wisconsin\u2019s First Congressional District, also considered a key race, Republicans recently attacked the Democratic nominee, Randy Bryce, for once tweeting \u201cwhen the police become the terrorists\u201d in response to a local report about police misuse of power.In a television advertisement released in September, Republicans deployed Mr. Bryce\u2019s brother, a police officer, as a spokesman. He argued the tweet is a reason to vote for his brother\u2019s opponent.\u201cWhen people refer to police officers as \u2018terrorists,\u2019 that hits a little too close to home,\u201d said James Bryce, as the tweet flashed across the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be represented by someone who has shown contempt for law enforcement.\u201dMr. Trump, to big applause, alludes to Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s protest at almost every campaign rally. During a recent stop in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District, where the Democratic nominee, Dan Feehan, had previously expressed support for Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s protests, the crowd erupted when Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to stand for our national anthem.\u201dMr. Feehan is an Iraq War veteran but in an increasingly conservative portion of the state, which stretches across Minnesota\u2019s southern border. It is one of the few seats election experts think could flip from Democrats to Republicans this November, and Republicans see the line of attack as especially potent.On the Democratic side, some candidates have tried to make explicit appeals to racial justice to inspire new voters. Mandela Barnes, the party\u2019s candidate for Wisconsin lieutenant governor, donned Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s jersey while on the campaign trail, and had a Twitter row with Gov.

Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, trying to unseat Mr. Cruz, went viral with his speech to black audiences regarding the death of Mr. Jean, who was killed in his apartment after an off-duty police officer said she mistook him for a burglar.Even in fights among Democrats, Ayanna Pressley, the Boston city councilor who defeated incumbent Representative Michael Capuano, used her support of Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s protests to draw a rare point of daylight between herself and Mr. Capuano. She was battling to represent Massachusetts\u2019 only congressional district with a majority of nonwhite voters, and some in the city believe the issue helped push Ms. Pressley over the top.\u201cBoth in terms of issues and platforms, any candidate that claims to be progressive cannot have a viable campaign without centering issues of racial and economic justice,\u201d said Jana\u00e9 Bonsu, the recently named co-director for Black Youth Project 100, one of the main activist groups born out of the Black Lives Matter movement.Experts on racial justice and political science said Mr. Trump\u2019s sometimes inflammatory rhetoric is bringing glaring visibility to racial and social justice divides, but similar fights have long simmered in American politics.Carol Anderson, a professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Georgia, pointed to previous examples of how grass-roots movements about racial justice have long had an electoral impact, sometimes unintended. In the 1960s and \u201970s, for example, the Democratic Party\u2019s embrace of civil rights legislation led to Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern Strategy,\u201d which helped Republican conservatives dominate the South for decades.Professor Anderson said scholars may come to see the Black Lives Matter movement as a similarly transformative political moment, which realigned the rhetoric of both political parties and their candidates for years to come.\u201cFor those who are dealing with worrying that their babies are going to be shot by cops, that movement gave voice to that angst,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cBut I think for the Republicans, what it did is it provided another target for them to continue to troll in racism.\u201dRepublicans push back against that characterization of racial bias. In interviews, conservative political operatives said their party\u2019s willingness to attack Democrats on issues such as standing for the national anthem or supporting the police does not come from a place of bigotry, but an attempt to point out what they characterize as Democrat extremism.Even those who denounced the lines of attack on moral grounds, like Republican strategist Evan Siegfried, said it could be effective.\u201cA sizable portion of America and the Trump base feel that the country isn\u2019t what it used to be and that patriotism is under assault,\u201d said Mr. Siegfried. \u201cIt successfully preys on the feeling that America has become a strange, if not foreign, place that no longer reflects their values.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Ms. McBath remains an underdog running against the Republican incumbent, Karen Handel. However, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced a round of television advertisements supporting Ms. Handel this week, a sign that Republican officials think the race may be tightening in its final weeks.In an interview, Ms. McBath stressed that she was not a single-issue candidate, but it was nevertheless important for her to acknowledge that her son\u2019s murder, and the political activism that followed, was her entry point into politics.\u201cAt the end of the day, whatever you think about me; whatever happens or whatever I become in the future, I\u2019ll still always be Jordan\u2019s mom,\u201d Ms. McBath said.Placing her son\u2019s death at the center of her political messaging has made the campaign more special, Ms. McBath said, but will also make election night more viscerally personal.\u201cI\u2019m risking my son\u2019s legacy for the people of this district,\u201d she said, wearing a button that outlined the three titles she hopes will propel her to Congress: \u201cDemocrat.

Peter Biskind has previously explored pop culture and film history in fizzy, captivating works, including \u201cEasy Riders, Raging Bulls\u201d and \u201cDown and Dirty Pictures.\u201d But those were written from hindsight \u2014 the eras he dissected had formed, plateaued and ebbed. Biskind illuminated facets of those eras that until his books came along had remained outside the light source of accepted opinion. He excelled at this task, peppering film analysis with gossip, empathy and playfulness.Right there, on Page 5 of the introduction, is a statement that will determine whether you\u2019ll agree to take the tour he\u2019s mapped out or scoff and pass on the journey: \u201cAs an agent of change, culture has often been treated shabbily, as no more than a secondary or even tertiary factor.\u201dNow, I happen to think that culture isn\u2019t getting a shabby treatment when it\u2019s seen in this light. Pop culture, in my opinion, has always been held in correct regard \u2014 as a reflection, not a catalyst, of larger social forces. If you also think of culture \u2014 and, more to the point of this book, pop culture \u2014 in the same way, then you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cPass.\u201dFor those who agree to take it, the journey in \u201cThe Sky Is Falling\u201d isn\u2019t as propulsive or as fun as in Biskind\u2019s other books. We\u2019re given 12 chapters divided into four sections. Each section describes iconic pop culture \u201cshows\u201d \u2014 Biskind\u2019s umbrella phrase for films and TV series \u2014 as expressions of a particular political worldview. After a while it feels like being led through plodding, 4/4 time dance steps. Here are analyses of the apocalypse and its aftermath through readings of \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d of Batman and Captain America, as they reinforce centrist, liberal or conservative worldviews.Biskind, despite his journalistic \u00e9lan, is not as sure-footed a guide through 21st-century nerd culture as he was through the fascinating minefield of cocaine, conflict and creativity in \u201cEasy Riders.\u201d It\u2019s alarming how many things he flat-out whiffs in these pages \u2014 and not just textual misreadings (of the failed \u201csocial experiment\u201d at the end of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d for example, and of a crucial speech by the district attorney Harvey \u201cTwo-Face\u201d Dent in the same film). There are glaring, misremembered details of scenes and plots, which force the reader to go back or, worse, muddle Biskind\u2019s larger argument. He mixes up dialogue from the first two \u201cTerminator\u201d films (the phrase \u201cHasta la vista, baby\u201d is never uttered in the first). He gets the so-familiar-it\u2019s-reached-meme-level ending of the original \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d film wrong (Charlton Heston does not dig in the sand to discover the spikes on the crown of the Statue of Liberty). On Page 32, he cites a \u201ccrop\u201d of high-profile biblical epics that \u201cflopped\u201d \u2014 and then names only two (\u201cNoah\u201d and \u201cExodus: Gods and Kings\u201d). But 25 pages later he contradicts himself on the feebleness of Bible-centric box office when he details the blockbuster ratings \u2014 100 million viewers \u2014 of the TV mini-series \u201cThe Bible,\u201d not to mention other highly successful faith-based works like Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d and the small-budget \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d and \u201cWar Room,\u201d to which he devotes a few paragraphs. He credits Christopher Nolan with \u201crebranding\u201d Batman as the \u201cDark Knight,\u201d which in fact Bill Finger did in 1940.As a country and a culture, we aren\u2019t on the \u201cother side\u201d of the extremist upheaval we\u2019re seeing now. To bring flowers before the funeral\u2019s even started feels pointless. Or, as Biskind quotes Claire Danes, speaking about her series \u201cHomeland\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for our show to compete with the screeching absurdity of what\u2019s happening.\u201d Biskind dares to compete with it, but loses. I\u2019d love to see a man of his insights return for a rematch in, say, 10 years.

{"Headline": "Praying for Jamal Khashoggi", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia stands accused of killing him. If it did, it will be a disaster for the regime of Mohammed bin Salman.Opinion ColumnistI don\u2019t think that Saudi journalist, who was also a friend, would mind if I now identified him. His name was Jamal Khashoggi. As the year went on, Jamal came to believe that M.B.S.\u2019s dark side was completely taking over. When we last spoke in August \u2014 thanks to a chance encounter at 17th and K Streets in Washington \u2014 he told me that he was getting married to a Turkish woman, and could not go back to Saudi Arabia right now and that I must ring an alarm bell about the increasingly harsh crackdowns and the arrests of critics \u2014 left, right and center \u2014 in Saudi Arabia by M.B.S.Whatever good will M.B.S. got for empowering women to drive beginning in June, I added, was undermined by his arrests of female driving activists on charges of being related to some anti-Saudi groups in London. \u201cSeriously,\u2019\u2019 I asked, \u201cis Saudi Arabia really threatened by women driving activists?\u2019\u2019 And the Saudi-United Arab Emirates war in Yemen has been so badly botched that the Saudis have been accused of possible war crimes, even though Iran and the Houthi rebels had also contributed mightily to Yemen\u2019s destruction.The future stability of Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab Gulf depends on the reform process in Saudi succeeding, and it can\u2019t succeed without significant investments by foreigners and Saudis to create a more vibrant and diverse private sector that can offer decent jobs to all the young Saudis, men and women, coming out of universities at home and abroad. M.B.S. is still popular with many of them, but if they can\u2019t find jobs, the religious extremists in Saudi Arabia will find many recruits among them.Each M.B.S. action, I concluded, \u201dmay have been individually justifiable, but taken together they suggest that he\u2019s lost the plot; he\u2019s creating more uncertainty than respect.\u2019\u2019 President Trump and his team don\u2019t understand: \u201cThe U.S. can\u2019t just subcontract order-making in the Middle East to Israel, Russia and Saudi Arabia and write them blank checks. Their leaders actually need us to draw redlines for them, too, so they can tell their own hotheads and extremists, \u2018Hey, I am with you \u2014 but the Americans won\u2019t let me do that.\u2019\u201dThat point about the \u201cChina model\u2019\u2019 was leaked to me over the summer by people close to the Saudi crown prince, who were becoming increasingly alarmed.If Jamal has been abducted or murdered by agents of the Saudi government, it will be a disaster for M.B.S. and a tragedy for Saudi Arabia and all the Arab Gulf countries. It would be an unfathomable violation of norms of human decency, worse not in numbers but in principle than even the Yemen war. What Western leader, and how many Western investors, will want to stand alongside M.B.S. if it is proved that his government abducted or murdered Jamal? (And the truth will come out.)And those of us who were ready to see both the upsides and downsides of M.B.S.\u2019s initiatives \u2014 and sincerely wanted his reforms to succeed because the upsides, if realized, were so strategically important for the future of the whole Arab-Muslim world \u2014 will conclude that the downsides have swamped the upsides and that this Saudi regime has become a threat to Saudi Arabia\u2019s needed transformation not an engine of it.So I am praying for Jamal. Every country needs its constructive critics. The medicine they dispense is distasteful to most leaders, but it often makes them more healthy in the end. M.B.S. should be praying for him as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Senate: Affirmative Action for White People", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd why it\u2019s time to make Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., the 51st and 52nd states.Opinion ColumnistThe biggest racial preferences in this country have nothing to do with college admissions or job offers. They have to do with political power. And they benefit white Americans, at the expense of black, Asian and Hispanic Americans.These racial preferences are the ones that dictate the makeup of the United States Senate. Thanks to a combination of historical accident and racism, the Senate gives considerably more representation to white citizens than to dark-skinned ones. It allows a minority of Americans \u2014 white Americans \u2014 to wield the power of a majority.The anti-democratic tendencies of the Senate are well known: Each citizen of a small state is considered more important than each citizen of a large state. It\u2019s a deliberate feature of the Constitution, created to persuade smaller states to join the union. Over time, though, the racial edge to the Senate\u2019s structure has become much sharper \u2014 for two big reasons.First, the states whose populations have grown the most over time, like California, Texas, Florida and New York, are racially diverse. By contrast, the smallest states, like Wyoming, Vermont, the Dakotas and Maine, tend to be overwhelmingly white. The Senate, as a result, gives far more special treatment to whites than it once did.The second reason is even more frustrating, but it would also be easier to fix. Right now, about four million American citizens have almost no congressional voting power, not even the diluted power of Californians or Texans. Of these four million people \u2014 these citizens denied representative democracy \u2014 more than 90 percent are black or Hispanic.More populous states, whose power is diminished by the Senate\u2019s structure, tend to be more racially diverse. States with fewer people have a greater share of white residents.

Source: 2017 American Communities SurveyBy The New York TimesIf you think about the four youngest states \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska and Hawaii \u2014 you may notice a pattern. Like Puerto Rico and Washington, they are home to a lot of nonwhite people, which is not a coincidence. This country has historically been slow to grant full enfranchisement to people with darker skin. Try to imagine if the four million people who lacked Senate representation today were upper-middle-class white suburbanites. Or imagine the Fox News outrage if they were white evangelicals. They\u2019d have a legitimate grievance, too.The results are pretty outrageous. The Senate gives the average black American only 75 percent as much representation as the average white American. The average Asian-American has 72 percent as much representation as a white person. And the average Hispanic American? Only 55 percent as much. That\u2019s right \u2014 the structure of the United States Senate treats a Hispanic citizen as only about half as important as a white citizen.Granting statehood to Washington and Puerto Rico would not erase these racial gaps, not even close. The small states that control the Senate would still be overwhelmingly white. But adding two new states would make a meaningful dent \u2014 and make this country a fairer place. It would help revive the basic ideals of American democracy, which could very much use some reviving.Advertisement"}

A Shortage Panics Fans", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plea for Tab came across in a message on Facebook.It was Sept. 27, and Anne White saw a post from a neighbor telling her their local grocery store in Cincinnati had been stripped of the diet soda, last popular in the 1980s and now a cult favorite.Ms. White, 56, had 10 cans stashed in a cupboard and agreed to leave them on the porch. The next morning, two were gone. Since then, Ms. White has not been able to find Tab anywhere in town. She reserved a few cases online at a Target near Wilmington, N.C. But when she went to buy them, it was sold out.\u201cA friend brought me three cases from Atlanta,\u201d she said. Those are sure to go fast too.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. White said.Sad is one word for it. Fans of Tab \u2014 who often call themselves Tab addicts or Tabaholics \u2014 have another word: conspiracy. Rumors abounded in recent weeks about why their favorite fizzy drink had been whisked off shelves from Cincinnati to Charlotte, N.C.Some speculated that the Coca-Cola Company, which has been making the soft drink since 1963, had quietly discontinued it. On Wednesday, the company said this was not true.Others blamed Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated, the largest independent bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products in the United States. Devotees of the drink who called customer service in recent weeks said they were told that the bottler had discontinued offering Tab in stores in portions of its 14-state territory, which includes Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina and the District of Columbia.This, the bottler says, is true. \u201cAfter careful review, we recently removed Tab 12-pack cans from the portfolio of beverages we offer,\u201d the company said in a statement. Instead, it said, it will focus on low- and no-calorie Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca and Seagram\u2019s products.For lovers of Tab it is the latest attempt to take away their beloved soda, a steady threat since Coca-Cola introduced Diet Coke in 1982.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d said Calvin Boyd, 51, a Tab drinker for four decades who works in the cargo department at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. \u201cWe know what to do.\u201dMr. Boyd said a friend of his approached the manager of a Publix supermarket in Charlotte about restocking the shelves. The manager offered to secure a shipment from a Publix in Florida.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a drug deal,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201c\u2018Hey man, can you get me a fix?\u2019 I\u2019m a little bit traumatized.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a real cult community,\u201d said Ms. Kueneman, whose brother is an editor at The Times. \u201cI get five to 10 emails a month from people asking where they can find Tab.\u201dTab lovers refused to give up, building networks of friends and colleagues who advised them where to buy it. Ms. Kueneman said she could not find Tab in San Francisco when she lived there. So she sometimes hired a courier to drive 90 miles north to Sacramento and pick up several cases for her.Mr. Boyd of Charlotte has a group of friends who alert each other when store shipments come in. He said he occasionally buys Tab online, although it is costly. \u201cWith shipping, I once paid nearly $40 for a case,\u201d he said.Tracy Bowen, a bookkeeper from Fredericksburg, Va., has been drinking Tab since she was 15. \u201cSometimes I get a cinnamon hit,\u201d she said of the taste. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to a real cola taste without the sugar.\u201dMs. Bowen said that in 1992 she asked her then husband to go to the store to stock up on Tab ahead of a snowstorm. \u201cHe runs into another lady\u2019s husband buying some too,\u201d she recalled. But there was only one case. \u201cSo they split what was left between the two of them,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to go home without it.\u201dEllen Roddy of Lexington, Ky., has called Coca-Cola\u2019s customer service to complain and started a petition on Facebook. In the meantime, she asked a friend to pick some up for her in Alabama, but he didn\u2019t have time. She also said she was going to buy it on Amazon, but $20 for the 12-pack she saw online was too steep. She is considering driving to Indiana to see if stores carry it there.\u201cMaybe they thought us Tab people would switch over to Diet Coke,\u201d she said.Not so.

I\u2019m reluctant to admit it and astonished to say it, especially since the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford in his ugly and gratuitous way at a rally on Tuesday. Perhaps it\u2019s worth unpacking this admission for those who might be equally astonished to read it.I\u2019m grateful because Trump has not backed down in the face of the slipperiness, hypocrisy and dangerous standard-setting deployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. I\u2019m grateful because ferocious and even crass obstinacy has its uses in life, and never more so than in the face of sly moral bullying. I\u2019m grateful because he\u2019s a big fat hammer fending off a razor-sharp dagger.A few moments have crystallized my view over the past few days.The first moment was a remark by a friend. \u201cI\u2019d rather be accused of murder,\u201d he said, \u201cthan of sexual assault.\u201d I feel the same way. One can think of excuses for killing a man; none for assaulting a woman. But if that\u2019s true, so is this: Falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself. It inflicts psychic, familial, reputational and professional harms that can last a lifetime. This is nothing to sneer at.Since when did the possibility of innocence become, for today\u2019s liberals, something to wave off with an archly unfeeling \u201cboo hoo\u201d?Swetnick\u2019s claims border on the preposterous. They are wholly uncorroborated. But that didn\u2019t keep Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents, in politics and the press, from seizing them as evidence of corroboration with Blasey\u2019s allegation, which is not preposterous but is also largely uncorroborated, and with the allegation of Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez \u2014 uncorroborated again.Uncorroborated plus uncorroborated plus largely uncorroborated is not the accumulation of questions, much less of evidence. It is the duplication of hearsay.Eighth moment: Being quizzed in recent days about my teenage years at a New England boarding school \u2014 the subtext being that I must know something about elite prep schools and the mentality of the boys who attend them.I do. It was at boarding school where I first formed lasting friendships with kids of different races and economic backgrounds, and where liberal-leaning teachers showed us how to think critically, keep an open mind, and value tolerance and respect. I have no idea if Georgetown Prep was anything like that, but the facile stereotype of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d that keeps cropping up in discussions of Kavanaugh\u2019s background is yet another ugly tactic in the battle to defeat him.We will learn soon enough what, if anything, the F.B.I. has gleaned from its investigation of Kavanaugh. If the Bureau finds persuasive evidence of Blasey\u2019s charge, the judge will have to step down and answer for it. Until then, I\u2019ll admit to feeling grateful that, in Trump, at least one big bully was willing to stand up to others.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "40 Years of Hip-Hop Photos", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSThe art of making something from nothing has always been at the heart of hip-hop culture. D.J.s in South Bronx parks created a global youth culture with just records and a sound system. And in that analog world, photographers fittingly documented the emerging scene on film. Decades later, those contact sheets are a visual primary text that offer a valuable peek into how artists on both sides of the camera worked. \u201cI always loved contact sheets because they\u2019re tangible artifacts and you can mark them up,\u201d said Janette Beckman, who made early memorable images of Run-DMC, Slick Rick and other up-and-coming stars. \u201cIt really is a record of a photographer\u2019s way of working. You can\u2019t see that in digital. It shows the whole photo shoot and what took place.\u201d While some rappers today are media moguls, the early years had a potent motivation too: love of the craft. \u201cIn the old days, people were doing it because it was their passion,\u201d Ms. Beckman said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t doing it to be millionaires. Some of that purity and spirit still exists in the same way.\u201d\u201cA lot has changed over the four decades, particularly the positive messages that were such an important factor in a number of tracks,\u201d said Jamel Shabazz, known for his vintage images of street style and African-American life. \u201cHowever, what remains in this present day and time is the magnetic attraction that hip-hop continues to have on a world stage.\u201dMs. Tobak knows that appeal. She was 5 when her family migrated from the former Soviet Union to Detroit in the late 1970s. Like most youth raised in racially diverse neighborhoods after the civil rights and Black Power movements, Ms. Tobak gravitated to hip-hop. While attending New York University, she found New York\u2019s underground culture and got a job at Nell\u2019s. \u201cThe club scene at the time was an important part of hip-hop,\u201d said Ms. Tobak, who went on to work as a television producer. \u201cThe Tunnel, Lyricist Lounge, The Building, Daddy\u2019s House, that was the community. A friend I worked with at Nell\u2019s got me a job at Payday Records. Somewhere in all of this I started writing and became a journalist.\u201dThe book spans 40 years with nearly 200 images from more than 50 photographers, highlighting the evolution of hip-hop photography from analog to digital and includes personal stories by pioneers like Joe Conzo Jr., Jamel Shabazz, Martha Cooper and Ernie Paniccioli, along with the latest generation, Cam Kirk and Jorge Peniche. Classic photo shoots, contact sheets and behind-the-scenes stories by Barron Clairborne, Al Pereira and Lisa Leone are included, as well as a foreword by the Roots\u2019s Questlove.\u201cPlatforms that are curated by the culture are important,\u201d Mr. Peniche, 30, a Los Angeles based-photographer, said, reflecting on his early years photographing Kendrick Lamar. \u201cK. Dot didn\u2019t have a huge budget to work with me at the time, but hip-hop is the culture that made something from nothing. I admire people like Jay-Z who emulate an independent mentality.\u201dSome stories reveal how important mistakes can be. Mr. Conzo\u2019s flash didn\u2019t fire when he was taking pictures of b-boys at Roseland. Yet the silhouette he saw on his contact sheet turned into \u201cThe Popper,\u201d one of his signature images.\u201cShowing those mistakes shows that creativity is a process, both in the music and in the photography,\u201d Ms. Tobak said. \u201cIt\u2019s messy and that\u2019s O.K.\u201dUp to a point, especially when she learned some photographers had rolls of film tucked away. \u201cI had an almost motherly reaction to situations where images weren\u2019t processed or stored well, like, \u2018Get those things in archival boxes and sleeves, please,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to get them digitized and out into the world. It was fun to discover unseen footage and the sequencing, and it was also worrying to think about how much footage is out there in shoe boxes. A lot of times the record labels kept the photographers\u2019 work or were bought out and a lot of photos were lost.\u201dMichael A. Gonzales, a writer and cultural critic, had the idea to ask Mr. Parks to capture the moment. \u201cI had always been a fan of Gordon Parks and I was thinking, who could make this special?\u201d Mr. Gonzales recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing about hip-hop for so long I know many of the photographers in the book. Back in the day they would send the photographers to take the photos the same time I was doing the interview. They don\u2019t get the same kind of props or opportunity that the rock 'n' roll photographers get but they define the culture in the same way.\u201dAnd just like Roxanne Shant\u00e9, Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill, there were women who exuded strength behind the lens, too. \u201cThere were so many women who documented the culture, and women photographers were going deep with it,\u201d Ms. Tobak said. \u201cTheir photos often have a very personal, human portrayal of the artist. Telling that story, incorporating the women\u2019s stories in the book was intentional but also not hard to do given how actively involved women photographers were.\u201dHip-hop has provoked and galvanized its listeners from songs like \u201cThe Message\u201d by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five to, more currently, \u201cAlright\u201d by the Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar. Once dismissed as a fad, hip-hop\u2019s promotional photos and neighborhood party fliers can now be found in Ivy League archives.\u201cHip-hop ushered in so many changes socially, culturally and politically that it forced institutions and gatekeepers in our society to accept it and to recognize them,\u201d said Marcyliena Morgan, founding director of the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard University. \u201cThere are so many photographs now to treasure because the photographers recognized something wonderful was happening from the beginning. That\u2019s a true gift,\u201d Dr. Morgan said. \u201cIt represents a fierce determination by those who began their work in hip-hop. What we can expect in the future, even if it doesn\u2019t exist in the same form, is that the remnants will exist for many years to come.\u201dFayemi Shakur is a writer and visiting lecturer at Rutgers University-Newark.

{"Headline": "Where Trolls Reigned Free: A New History of Reddit", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Even then, at a moment of techno-optimism we are unlikely to see again in our lifetimes, Reddit was a toxic swamp. It was the place you went, shrouded in anonymity, for pornography, hard-core racism, revenge porn, Nazi cheerleading, Jew-baiting, creepshots, fat-shaming, mindless anarchy and pictures of dead kids or of women who had been beaten. If anyone bothered to look, Reddit was proof that on the internet, the trolls were in charge.Founded in 2005, soon after Facebook, Reddit has always been something of an anomaly among companies whose content was generated by users. Its founders, barely out of their teens, had no real vision. It wasn\u2019t even their idea. They cashed out as soon as they could. The buyer was Cond\u00e9 Nast, home of America\u2019s toniest magazines, but executives there had no vision either. Reddit was created by millions of Americans with a taste for darkness. You can\u2019t blame this one on Vladimir Putin.In the beginning, Reddit users simply shared links about interesting things they read. Then comments were added. The job of moderating was assigned to anonymous volunteers, who created and shaped \u201csubreddits\u201d to their own passions. This was a genius move: It allowed Reddit not only to keep its staff lean, but to distance the company from the sleazier content.Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, a writer for Inc. magazine, tells the Reddit story in \u201cWe Are the Nerds.\u201d The two co-founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, cooperated extensively. I admire them for doing so because despite Lagorio-Chafkin\u2019s best efforts \u2014 Ohanian is called \u201ccharismatic\u201d or celebrated for his \u201ccharisma\u201d on Pages 47, 158, 214, 223 and 330 \u2014 they come off as whiny and callow schemers, and not the sharpest of sticks. On the very first page, the two University of Virginia seniors cannot figure out what a \u201ckiosk\u201d is.The title \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d doesn\u2019t really fit the tale. \u201cWe Are the Trolls\u201d would have made much more sense. \u201cI was always kind of an [expletive],\u201d Huffman explains early on. Lagorio-Chafkin bluntly calls him \u201ca total troll.\u201d He was also a genius programmer. The great achievement of the social internet was to unleash jerkdom for many while monetizing it for a few.The Reddit tale is an indictment of Silicon Valley, something Lagorio-Chafkin seems to sense but never confronts head-on, perhaps because she is so grateful for access to Huffman and Ohanian. \u201cTwo nice guys who made it, by crafting something incredible and yet ridiculously unwieldy, with no lack of turbulence along the way,\u201d Lagorio-Chafkin writes in an author\u2019s note. A more accurate summation might be: \u201cTwo inexperienced young guys created something they didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t control.\u201dIt\u2019s all here anyway: the lack of adult oversight; the suck-up press; the growth-at-any-cost mentality; the loyal employees, by turns abused and abusive (memo from management: \u201cYou do realize you were talking about penises for 90 minutes, right?\u201d); the defense of horrendous behavior as \u201cfree speech\u201d; the jettisoning of \u201cfree speech\u201d when it served corporate purposes; the way no one seeks permission but all expect forgiveness.\u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is most compelling when it tells the story of a third young man who played a founding role at Reddit. Aaron Swartz was brilliant, troubled and impossible, but he saw the tech economy more clearly than well-medicated people. \u201cIn the old days the new money was made through theft and abuse of office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow any random computer programmer \u2014 or even the people who hung around them \u2014 could find themselves saddled with a pile of cash.\u201d In early 2013, hounded by the government over a stupid stunt involving the downloading of academic journals, Swartz committed suicide.Reddit became so offensive it was difficult to work there. A community manager who had a brief tenure in 2015 told Lagorio-Chafkin some of the reasons: \u201cChild molesters, child porn, vicious stalking, rape threats, serious harassment, people taking the harassment offline and people filing police reports on each other.\u201d One chief executive, stressed beyond endurance, simply stopped showing up for work. His replacement, Ellen Pao, tried to impose order in the office and on the site. The backlash led to her abrupt departure. Huffman returned and purged most of the staff.The charismatic Ohanian came back as well, trying a few Reddit spinoffs that fizzled. He is best known now for being Mr. Serena Williams. I wondered if any of his new relatives ever asked him about the popular subreddit called CoonTown \u2014 you can guess the contents \u2014 but \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is silent on this. CoonTown was finally banned by Reddit in 2015.I also saw a lot of ads. Reddit is worth about $2 billion, which means Advance Publications, the parent of Cond\u00e9 Nast and now Reddit\u2019s biggest investor, made good money. In Silicon Valley, that\u2019s still pretty much all that matters.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times.

Dr. Anversa popularized the idea of stem cell treatment for damaged hearts.A prominent heart researcher formerly at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston fabricated or falsified data in 31 published studies that should be retracted, officials at the institutions have concluded. The scientist, Dr. Piero Anversa produced research suggesting that damaged heart muscle could be regenerated with stem cells, a type of cell that can transform itself into a variety of other cells. Although other laboratories could not reproduce his findings, the work led to the formation of start-up companies to develop new treatments for heart attacks and stroke, and inspired a clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health. \u201cA couple of papers may be alarming, but 31 additional papers in question is almost unheard-of,\u201d said Benoit Bruneau, associate director of cardiovascular research at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. \u201cIt is a lab\u2019s almost entire body of work, and therefore almost an entire field of research, put into question.\u201dHarvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital began their review of Dr. Anversa\u2019s publications in January 2013. In April 2017, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital agreed to pay $10 million to the federal government to settle accusations that Dr. Anversa submitted fraudulent data to get research funding. His method was to take stem cells from bone marrow and inject them into the heart. As if by magic, he reported, the stem cells turned into heart cells and repaired damage. The first studies were conducted in mice, but the finding electrified researchers. Companies were formed, including one headed by Dr. Anversa, based on the claim that by injecting stem cells they could heal hearts that were damaged by heart attacks. But Dr. Anversa held firm. In effect, his response was \u201cyou guys don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d said Dr. Bruneau.\u201cMany labs said, \u2018O.K., game on. We will keep trying to do it,\u2019\u201d he added. But the list of failures grew. Dr. Anversa claimed to have discovered that bone marrow cells are not needed to repair heart muscle. The heart has its own stem cells, he reported, which can be removed, multiplied in a petri dish, and injected back into the heart to replace and repair damaged cells.No one else could get those experiments to work, either, said Jeffery D. Molkentin, a professor at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Cincinnati Children\u2019s Heart Institute.Dr. Molkentin found a way to label and trace the lineage of stem cells as they morphed into other cells. That let him investigate whether any heart cells were derived from these stem cells.A study published in the journal Circulation by Dr. Anversa was retracted in 2014 after co-authors wrote to the journal saying the data in the paper were not data they had generated. Dr. Anversa left Harvard and Brigham and Women\u2019s in 2015.The study is still enrolling patients. And there are still companies selling stem cell therapy for damaged hearts. In the past few years, however, skeptical researchers moved on to other prospects for heart treatment. \u201cThe field has backed off a lot,\u201d Dr. Molkentin said. Some scientists wondered how a questionable line of research persisted for so long. Maybe, Dr. Molkentin said, experts were just too timid to take a stand.But what about those companies selling stem cell treatments for the heart?Advertisement"}

The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny.

Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed.

Chronically late, forever losing things, utterly disorganized, Ms. Morgenstern lived in a state of chaos. Then, she had a child. She turned the lessons she learned from taking control of her time into a career as an adviser and coach. She is the author of six books, and her latest, \u201cTime to Parent,\u201d was published on Sept. 4.You won\u2019t find any corny categorization of time management personality types in her work, no Myers-Briggs- or 5 Love Languages-type buckets into which people can slot themselves. Perhaps because of her own messy past, Ms. Morgenstern avoids pigeonholing people by putting labels on them because, she said, \u201cwhen you get a label, you can feel very channeled, like there\u2019s no opportunity for change or development.\u201d But there are patterns Ms. Morgenstern has identified that can help people understand and improve the way they approach time management.There are time realists and time optimists, according to Ms. Morgenstern. Time realists look at a task and break down the math of it. They\u2019re conscious of how long things take, and they factor that in to their plans for the day. Time optimists, by comparison, are just that: hopeful about things they would like to do. It leads to them to overstuff their days and become frustrated when their list of to-dos doesn\u2019t get completed.Be a time realist. Here\u2019s how.Don\u2019t automatically say yes, no matter who is asking, according to Ms. Morgenstern. Even if it is your boss, think, \u201cHow I can fit that in?\u2019\u201d If, after calculating how long the task will take, considering what else you were going to do in that time against what you could take off your plate, you\u2019re still in need of relief, Ms. Morgenstern suggests going back to your boss and saying, \u201cI could do this, but I\u2019d then have to postpone that. Which way do you want me to go?\u201dMs. Morgenstern recommends looking ahead. She says that doing so allows you to see in advance if you planned your calendar for the next few days well, \u201csort of figuring out the puzzle,\u201d in her words.Batch activities like administrative work, creative projects, hobbies and social activities, by mental function in order to identify your concentration threshold for each. Ms. Morgenstern says that batching activities helps you to carve smaller subdivisions into your days, creating mini-deadlines that make concentrating on and completing dreaded tasks more manageable.Speaking of dreaded tasks! Here comes some good news for those of you who have 16,942 unread emails in your inbox: Ms. Morgenstern is a believer in declaring email bankruptcy. She suggests sorting all unread emails by date, moving the most current ones to a separate folder and simply deleting the rest, sight unseen. \u201cHow far back you want to go \u2014 three days, three weeks, one month \u2014 depends on your job or your life. If it\u2019s more than a month old, there\u2019s nothing in there. It\u2019s either going to come back, or it\u2019s gone forever.\u201dIf anything is going to take you more than three to five minutes to do in that moment, schedule that into your calendar, she suggests.Ms. Morgenstern takes a hard line when it comes to the proliferation of communication channels \u2014 email, text message, messaging on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, telephone calls \u2014 and the limits we need to place on them. She says that \u201ctime management is about managing your energy and brain power for peak performance, and so you have to impart control over all this chaos.\u201d \u201cNo matter how much you want to procrastinate on something big you have to do, the bell hasn\u2019t rung.\u201d Ms. Morgenstern likens the use of the alarm function to being in school \u2014 you can\u2019t leave math class and go to arts and crafts, where you really want to be, until the bell rings.According to Ms. Morgenstern, if you can remember, \u201cOh, I wrote that three pages ago in the upper left corner,\u201d you\u2019re a visual-tactile learner who should use a paper planner. If you think more chronologically \u2014 for example if someone gave you a date like April 14, and you think, \u201coh that was a Wednesday\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re more digital-technical oriented and should use an electronic calendar.To be efficient, Ms. Morgenstern advises adding work and personal obligations to the same calendar and integrating all your different planning systems into one.She explains that people\u2019s perception of time is that it\u2019s \u201cthis ethereal, relative, slippery, conceptual thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s 24-hour cycles, seven days a week. You have 168 hours to work with every week. You have to carve out the time if you really want balance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistYes, last week Kanye West went to the White House and Kanyed.The troubled rapper and Donald Trump supporter, who was invited to the White House supposedly to discuss heady, important subjects like sentencing reform, was put on display by Trump, who invited the press pool into the Oval Office to bear witness to a rambling, incoherent, cry-for-help rant from the rapper.It was all just as sad and tragic as one might have imagined. But, for me, too much of the focus afterward was placed on Kanye\u2019s spectacle and not nearly enough on the callous way Trump tried to use and exploit that moment, and the degree to which we have every right to be incredulous about Trump\u2019s manufactured concern for the criminal justice system\u2019s propensity to chew up black lives and destroy them.\u201cThere are people in jail for really long terms, who have, like Mrs. Johnson as example. She had another 22 years to serve. She was in there for 20 years. She\u2019s the most incredible woman. How this would have happened, and maybe it was a different time, a different age, but we do need reform. And, that doesn\u2019t mean easy. We\u2019re going to make certain categories tougher when it comes to drug dealing and other things. But there has to be a reform because it\u2019s very unfair right now. It\u2019s very unfair to African-Americans. It\u2019s very unfair to everybody.\u201dBut it is disingenuous for Trump to claim he doesn\u2019t know the criminal justice system mistreats and over-penalizes black people for drug crimes. This happens specifically because of an overzealous lust for punishment, the kind that Trump himself has long harbored and is now implementing.\u201cAccording to a report in The Times last year, there were a record 580,000 stop-and-frisks in the city in 2009. Most of those stopped (55 percent) were black (a large portion were also Hispanic), most were young and almost all were male. For reference, according to the Census Bureau, there were about only 300,000 black men between the ages of 13 and 34 living in the city that year. A mere 6 percent of the stops resulted in arrests.\u201dThat column continued:Stop-and-frisk, designed as a policy to get illegal guns off the street, became a blasphemy as it morphed into a policy that arrested minority men for drugs.\u201cI\u2019ve told them to work with local authorities to try to change the terrible deal the city of Chicago entered into with A.C.L.U., which ties law enforcement\u2019s hands; and to strongly consider stop-and-frisk. It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago. (Applause.) It was meant for it. Stop-and-frisk.\u201dThe spectacle wasn\u2019t really Kanye.

Bytedance says that more than half a billion people worldwide use Douyin or TikTok at least once a month.Cute pet videos. Lip-syncing to pop ear worms. Glossy digital effects ...A clip from @falcopunch on TikTok.... and people who are very good at doing the robot.A clip from @rezbkr on TikTok.\u201cThere isn\u2019t such a strong sense of purpose on Douyin,\u201d Mr. Dong said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what\u2019s so good about it.\u201dBut even for a purveyor of fluff, crossing the tech world\u2019s most treacherous divide will not be carefree. There are two major internets right now: China\u2019s and the rest of the world\u2019s. Beijing\u2019s tough rules on content and operations have long made China difficult, even impossible, terrain for American internet companies.Those rules have also largely penned in homegrown titans like Tencent, whose overseas expansion plans have been hamstrung by the unique demands of catering to China\u2019s online population.So far, Bytedance \u2014 which recently secured $3 billion in new funding from SoftBank and other heavyweight investors \u2014 has found a rare measure of success in both internets by doing things a little differently.For one, it is making no pretense to be bridging the two digital realms.Users of Douyin are entirely walled off from users of TikTok and vice versa; the better to manage the material that people in China can see. Beijing\u2019s tightening controls have made these decidedly un-fun times to be in the business of fun.Bytedance added new privacy settings and parental controls to TikTok in June. But if the company, which declined to comment for this article, cannot expand its ability to manage such issues at the same rapid clip at which it is drawing new users, its products could become the bane of many more parents and governments in many more countries.Their children might not care.Kang Sae-eun, 14, an eighth grader in Seoul, loves watching other young South Koreans on TikTok. There\u2019s the girl who makes crazy faces, and the excellent dancer. There\u2019s the cool girl with short hair \u2014 real \u201cgirl crush\u201d material, she said.They are funny and uninhibited, Sae-eun said. And best of all, they are regular kids like her.\u201cIt is much harder for young people like elementary school students to become famous on the better-known platforms, like YouTube, Facebook or Instagram, all of which I also use,\u201d she said.Sae-eun said she didn\u2019t realize that TikTok was made in China, which raises what might be the most interesting question about Bytedance: How did a company that is further democratizing self-expression come out of sternly undemocratic China in the first place?Bytedance, which was founded in 2012, did not set out to dominate the market for bite-size videos. For many years, the company\u2019s best-known product was not Douyin but a news aggregator called Jinri Toutiao, which uses machine learning to figure out what users like, then feeds them more of it.In China, few media outlets command much loyalty among readers. That means an aggregator is a valuable and timesaving way to figure out what to read.After a while, though, Beijing realized that an app that gave people exactly what they wanted ended up giving them a lot of not-very-wholesome stuff.In a lengthy letter of apology, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Zhang Yiming, vowed to increase the number of employees moderating content to 10,000 from 6,000.\u201cThe product went astray, and content appeared that did not accord with core socialist values,\u201d Mr. Zhang wrote.By then, Bytedance had another rising star in its stable.Douyin was not even Bytedance\u2019s first video app when it was released in 2016. But in the somewhat arbitrary, mildly mysterious way in which these things happen, it became huge.The app is engineered for swift, maximal addictiveness.Open Douyin or TikTok and you are plunged right into a video. Swipe up to get another, each refresh of the screen providing a dopamine jolt. The videos fill your phone display entirely, blocking the clock at the top and preventing you from seeing how many hours you have spent watching puppies and comedy skits and synchronized dancing.Satsuki Hatashita, a 20-year-old college student in western Japan, has been hooked for months. She now knows not to use the app before taking a shower. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to shower for a long time, until I finally stopped watching TikTok,\u201d she said.She, too, was surprised to learn that the app was Chinese.People like Ms. Hatashita have given Bytedance confidence in its march overseas. The company has opened offices in Japan, Brazil, India, the United States and beyond.Still, Chinese staff stationed in China oversee significant aspects of Bytedance\u2019s international apps. They even produce some culturally specific content, such as push notifications suggesting videos to watch. The company is hiring speakers of more than a dozen languages, including Portuguese, Polish, Malay and Arabic, for positions in China, according to an online posting.An episode this year points to the importance, for Bytedance, of having people on the ground in at least one area: government relations.Bytedance\u2019s recent hires suggest that it wants to avoid similar incidents. Instagram\u2019s head of public policy for the Asia-Pacific region, Helena Lersch, recently resigned to become Bytedance\u2019s director for global public policy. Facebook\u2019s public policy leads in Indonesia and Japan recently left to join Bytedance, too.Before Douyin took off, China\u2019s internet didn\u2019t have a reigning social platform dedicated to short, easy-to-make videos. In the rest of the world\u2019s internet, where Instagram, Snapchat and others are already popular, TikTok faces stiff competition.For Tao Ni, a 25-year-old newspaper reporter in eastern China, Tencent\u2019s messaging app WeChat has already become more of a tool for work than a fun way to kill time. Weibo, a popular Twitter-like platform, can be wearying. But not Douyin, Ms. Tao said.It\u2019s because each video is so short, she said, that she can end up spending hours on what amounts to channel-surfing. \u201cAnything longer than 15 seconds, and I might start to feel tired.\u201dReporting was contributed by Su-hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea, Kantaro Suzuki from Tokyo, Michael J. de la Merced from London, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.

{"Headline": "A Dark Consensus About Screens and Kids Begins to Emerge in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "\u201cI am convinced the devil lives in our phones.\u201dSupported byA wariness that has been slowly brewing is turning into a regionwide consensus: The benefits of screens as a learning tool are overblown, and the risks for addiction and stunting development seem high. The debate in Silicon Valley now is about how much exposure to phones is O.K.\u201cDoing no screen time is almost easier than doing a little,\u201d said Kristin Stecher, a former social computing researcher married to a Facebook engineer. \u201cIf my kids do get it at all, they just want it more.\u201dMs. Stecher, 37, and her husband, Rushabh Doshi, researched screen time and came to a simple conclusion: they wanted almost none of it in their house. Their daughters, ages 5 and 3, have no screen time \u201cbudget,\u201d no regular hours they are allowed to be on screens. The only time a screen can be used is during the travel portion of a long car ride (the four-hour drive to Tahoe counts) or during a plane trip. Recently she has softened this approach. Every Friday evening the family watches one movie. There is a looming issue Ms. Stecher sees in the future: Her husband, who is 39, loves video games and thinks they can be educational and entertaining. She does not.\u201cWe\u2019ll cross that when we come to it,\u201d said Ms. Stecher, who is due soon with a boy. Some of the people who built video programs are now horrified by how many places a child can now watch a video.Asked about limiting screen time for children, Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist who for years directed product for YouTube at Google, sent a photo of a potty training toilet with an iPad attached and wrote: \u201cHashtag \u2018products we didn\u2019t buy.\u2019\u201dAthena Chavarria, who worked as an executive assistant at Facebook and is now at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s philanthropic arm, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said: \u201cI am convinced the devil lives in our phones and is wreaking havoc on our children.\u201dMs. Chavarria did not let her children have cellphones until high school, and even now bans phone use in the car and severely limits it at home.She said she lives by the mantra that the last child in the class to get a phone wins. Her daughter did not get a phone until she started ninth grade.\u201cOther parents are like, \u2018Aren\u2019t you worried you don\u2019t know where your kids are when you can\u2019t find them?\u2019\u201d Ms. Chavarria said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018No, I do not need to know where my kids are every second of the day.\u2019\u201dFor longtime tech leaders, watching how the tools they built affect their children has felt like a reckoning on their life and work. \u201cOn the scale between candy and crack cocaine, it\u2019s closer to crack cocaine,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of screens. Technologists building these products and writers observing the tech revolution were na\u00efve, he said. \u201cWe thought we could control it,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cAnd this is beyond our power to control. This is going straight to the pleasure centers of the developing brain. This is beyond our capacity as regular parents to understand.\u201dHe has five children and 12 tech rules. They include: no phones until the summer before high school, no screens in bedrooms, network-level content blocking, no social media until age 13, no iPads at all and screen time schedules enforced by Google Wifi that he controls from his phone. Bad behavior? The child goes offline for 24 hours. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what we were doing to their brains until I started to observe the symptoms and the consequences,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThis is scar tissue talking. We\u2019ve made every mistake in the book, and I think we got it wrong with some of my kids,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWe glimpsed into the chasm of addiction, and there were some lost years, which we feel bad about.\u201d His children attended private elementary school, where he saw the administration introduce iPads and smart whiteboards, only to \u201cdescend into chaos and then pull back from it all.\u201d This idea that Silicon Valley parents are wary about tech is not new. The godfathers of tech expressed these concerns years ago, and concern has been loudest from the top. Those who have exposed their children to screens try to talk them out of addiction by explaining how the tech works. John Lilly, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist with Greylock Partners and the former C.E.O. of Mozilla, said he tries to help his 13-year-old son understand that he is being manipulated by those who built the technology. \u201cI try to tell him somebody wrote code to make you feel this way \u2014 I\u2019m trying to help him understand how things are made, the values that are going into things and what people are doing to create that feeling,\u201d Mr. Lilly said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018I just want to spend my 20 bucks to get my Fortnite skins.\u2019\u201dAnd there are those in tech who disagree that screens are dangerous. Jason Toff, 32, who ran the video platform Vine and now works for Google, lets his 3-year-old play on an iPad, which he believes is no better or worse than a book. This opinion is unpopular enough with his fellow tech workers that he feels there is now \u201ca stigma.\u201d \u201cOne reaction I got just yesterday was, \u2018Doesn\u2019t it worry you that all the major tech execs are limiting screen time?\u2019\u201d Mr. Toff said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Maybe it should, but I guess I\u2019ve always been skeptical of norms.\u2019 People are just scared of the unknown.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s contrarian,\u201d Mr. Toff said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m speaking for a lot of parents that are afraid of speaking out loud for fear of judgment.\u201dHe said he thinks back to his own childhood growing up watching a lot of TV. \u201cI think I turned out O.K.,\u201d Mr. Toff said. Other Silicon Valley parents say there are ways to make some limited screen time slightly less toxic.Renee DiResta, a security researcher on the board of the Center for Humane Tech, won\u2019t allow passive screen time, but will allow short amounts of time on challenging games.She wants her 2- and 4-year-old children to learn how to code young, so she embraces their awareness of gadgets. But she distinguishes between these types of screen use. Playing a building game is allowed, but watching a YouTube video is not, unless it is as a family.And Frank Barbieri, a San Francisco-based executive at the start-up PebblePost that tracks online activity to send direct mail advertising, tries to limit his 5-year-old daughter\u2019s screen time to Italian language content. \u201cWe have friends who are screen abolitionists, and we have friends who are screen liberalists,\u201d Mr. Barbieri said. He had read studies on how learning a second language at a young age is good for the developing mind, so his daughter watches Italian-language movies and TV shows. \u201cFor us, honestly, me and my wife were like, \u2018Where would we like to visit?\u2019\u201d Mr. Barbieri said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "#IAmSexist", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEIt\u2019s time that we men take responsibility for our role in the problem of violence against women. Mr. Yancy is a professor of philosophy at Emory University.Men, listen up.In light of a year of disturbing revelations from the #MeToo movement and from last month\u2019s profoundly troubling Brett Kavanaugh hearings and his eventual confirmation to the Supreme Court, it is time that we, men, act.Certainly, some of us men have spoken out on behalf of women. But many more of us have remained silent. Some have kept silent out of fear of being judged, fear of criticism or censure, others out of genuine respect. In fact, silence has become the default stance of many men who consider themselves \u201callies\u201d of women. But given all that has transpired, staying out of it is no longer enough.I\u2019ve decided not to cut corners. So, join me, with due diligence and civic duty, and publicly claim: I am sexist!In fact, perhaps it is time that we lay claim to a movement \u2014 #IamSexist. Think about its national and international implications as we take responsibility for our sexism, our misogyny, our patriarchy.It is hard to admit we are sexist. I, for instance, would like to think that I possess genuine feminist bona fides, but who am I kidding? I am a failed and broken feminist. More pointedly, I am sexist. There are times when I fear for the \u201closs\u201d of my own \u201centitlement\u201d as a male. Toxic masculinity takes many forms. All forms continue to hurt and to violate women.Despite the charity, challenge and reasonableness of the offer, I dropped the ball. That day I learned something about me. I didn\u2019t respect her autonomy, her legal standing and personhood. As pathetic as this may sound, I saw her as my property, to be defined by my name and according to my legal standing. (She kept her name.) While this was not sexual assault, my insistence was a violation of her independence. I had inherited a subtle, yet still violent, form of toxic masculinity. It still raises its ugly head \u2014 I should be thanked when I clean the house, cook, sacrifice my time. These are deep and troubling expectations that are shaped by male privilege, male power and toxic masculinity.I speak as an insider. I know about what so many of us men think about women \u2014 the language we use, the sense of power that we garner through our sexual exploits, our catcalling and threatening, our sexually objectifying gazes, our dehumanizing and despicable sexual gestures and our pornographic imaginations. This is not simply locker room banter but a public display of unchecked bravado for which we often feel no shame.We have heard many accounts from women of what it is like to live under the yoke of our self-serving construction of a violent, pathetic and problematic masculinity. It is time that we stop gaslighting their reality.By now, many of you are probably saying, this doesn\u2019t apply to me \u2014 I\u2019m innocent.It\u2019s true that many of us, including me, have not committed vile acts of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse the likes of which Harvey Weinstein has been accused of. We have not, like Charlie Rose, been accused of sexual harassment by dozens of women who worked for us; and we are not, like Bill Cosby, being sent to prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, in this case, Andrea Constand. Yet I argue that we are collectively complicit with a sexist mind-set and a poisonous masculinity rooted in the same toxic male culture from which these men emerged.I\u2019m issuing a clarion call against our claims of sexist \u201cinnocence.\u201d I\u2019m calling our \u201cinnocence\u201d what it is \u2014 bullshit. As bell hooks writes in \u201cThe Will to Change: Men, Masculinity and Love,\u201d men unconsciously \u201cengage in patriarchal thinking, which condones rape even though they may never enact it. This is a patriarchal truism that most people in our society want to deny.\u201d When women speak out about male violence, hooks writes, \u201cfolks are eager to stand up and make the point that most men are not violent. They refuse to acknowledge that masses of boys and men have been programmed from birth on to believe that at some point they must be violent, whether psychologically or physically, to prove that they are men.\u201d We have learned it. In the language of Simone de Beauvoir, \u201cOne is not born, but rather becomes\u201d masculine.We mask that vulnerability. I find hooks\u2019s description powerful and true to my own experience as a boy: \u201cLearning to wear a mask (that word already embedded in the term \u2018masculinity\u2019),\u201d as hooks writes, \u201cis the first lesson in patriarchal masculinity that a boy learns. He learns that his core feelings cannot be expressed if they do not conform to the acceptable behaviors sexism defines as male. Asked to give up the true self in order to realize the patriarchal ideal, boys learn self-betrayal early and are rewarded for these acts of soul murder.\u201dWhat does hooks mean by \u201csoul murder\u201d?When I was about 15 years old, I said to a friend of mine, \u201cWhy must you always look at a girl\u2019s butt?\u201d He promptly responded: \u201cAre you gay or something? What else should I look at, a guy\u2019s butt?\u201d He was already wearing the mask. He had already learned the lessons of patriarchal masculinity. I was in an unfortunate bind. Either I should without question objectify girls\u2019 behinds or I was gay. There was no wiggle room for me to be both antisexist and antimisogynistic and yet a heterosexual young boy. You see, other males had rewarded his gaze by joining in the objectifying practice: \u201cLook at that butt!\u201d It was a collective act of devaluation. The acts of soul murder had already begun.Yet I, too, participated in acts of soul murder. As early as elementary school, the young boys would play this \u201cgame\u201d of pushing one another into girls. The idea was to get your friend to push you into a girl that you found attractive in order to grind up against her. I was guilty: \u201cHurry up! Push me into her.\u201d He pushed, and the physical grind was obvious. She would turn around, disgusted, and yell, \u201cStop!\u201d Youthful? Yes. Was it sexist and wrong? Yes. This was our youthful collective education; this is what it meant for us to gain \u201cmasculine credibility\u201d at the expense of girls.Later, I was also made to believe that girls were \u201ctargets,\u201d objects to be chased down and owned. That is the contradiction. For example, at about 16, we used to play a game called \u201cCatch a girl, get a girl.\u201d There was no equivalent called \u201cCatch a boy, get a boy.\u201d After all, as boys, we named the game. We would count to give the girls a head start. We would then run after them. If you caught a girl, you could steal a kiss. Some of the boys attempted to grope the girls.The logic governing the game, unseen by both the boys and the girls, was predicated upon sexist assumptions that relegated the girls to positions of prey. This is what American male culture taught us early on: Women were like \u201cmeat\u201d and we must always nurture a voracious appetite. This fact alone should challenge how we construe \u201cmutual consent.\u201d The game was orchestrated around what the philosopher Luce Irigaray would call a \u201cdominant phallic economy.\u201d We chased; they ran. We were the pursuers; they were the pursued. Our objective was to \u201cget them.\u201d We gazed upon the prey and then we would strike. Though the girls played, they were not to blame. We were the \u201cwinners,\u201d possessors of conquered territory. That is part of the early training that I received when it came to my toxic masculinity.Looking back, I wish that I could speak face to face to that younger self and undo the soul murder. Yet, I am not beyond redemption. That young boy is still learning from the older me. I have tremendous love to give him, a demanding love that he learn to undo the toxicity of male masculinity.This is why Donald Trump Jr. got it all wrong when he was asked which of his children he is most concerned for and he answered, \u201cRight now, I\u2019d say my sons.\u201d This is pure obfuscation, a substitution of fictions for facts, and a form of dangerous denial regarding the reality that his daughters may one day face. With that statement, he lied to his daughters.Trump Jr. should get his priorities straight. In a male-dominated and sexist toxic world, a world where his own father grabs women\u2019s genitalia and kisses them without their permission, it is our daughters who should concern us as targets of sexual violence. Trump Jr. should be concerned about raising his sons not in the image of his own father but in the image of those of us men who are prepared to recognize our soul murder, our toxic masculinity, and to do something about it.What are we afraid of?We all recently lived through the public spectacle of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. What is at stake transcends but also includes Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school during the 1980s. The history of toxic and violent masculinity should have been enough for us to give full weight to the reasonableness and believability of Ford\u2019s testimony. But we did not.Donald Trump\u2019s cruel public mocking of Ford in Southaven, Miss., days after her testimony was despicable and must be seen as another violation of Ford\u2019s character. And as the crowd laughed and applauded, including women present, Ford\u2019s words, her emotional testimony, were denounced as the ramblings of someone without any claim on the veracity of her experiences. To add insult to injury, Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s defense that Trump was just \u201cstating the facts\u201d is both a blatant lie and a further act of cruelty, a denial of Ford\u2019s pain and denial of the collective suffering of women more generally from acts of sexual violence.I can imagine being passionate about defending myself if put in Kavanaugh\u2019s position. Kavanaugh, however, unabashedly reinforced white male machismo and aggressiveness such that even if one thinks that he is innocent of what Ford accused him of, he put on full display the performance of a cantankerous white male who is recklessly determined to seek revenge against those he claimed were out to get him.The history of male violence against women speaks to Ford\u2019s pain and suffering. The statistics regarding sexual assault are telling: One in five women are raped at some point in their lives; 90 percent of rape victims are female; in the United States one in three women experience some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime; roughly half of female victims of rape reported being raped by an intimate partner and 40 percent by an acquaintance; in eight out of 10 cases of rape, the victim knew the perpetrator. We can no longer deny this reality. Since the world is watching, we, as men, need to join in the dialogue in ways that we have failed to in the past. We need to admit our roles in the larger problem of male violence against women. We need to tell the truth about ourselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Elizabeth Warren Fiasco", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe possible Democratic front-runner plays Trump\u2019s game \u2014 and loses.Opinion ColumnistI am not a Democratic insider or a campaign professional, so for all I know Warren may indeed be impressing her intended audience. And I can certainly think of worse people for the Democratic Party to nominate than a woman who has white-working-class roots as well as academic credentials, and a half-buried past as a heterodox intellectual (go read her book \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d seriously).But running for president in the age of Donald Trump requires, above all, an ability to handle what John Heileman and Mark Halperin once called \u201cthe freak show\u201d (back when it was considerably less freaky). It requires a deftness dealing with scandals and gaffes and accidental blunders, an ability to know when you have a wrestling move that justifies getting down in the mud and when you\u2019re better off sitting on a top rail and acting superior to the pigs.So far Warren\u2019s main encounter with the freak show has involved her claim to Cherokee ancestry, which was an issue in her last Senate campaign, in 2012, before Trump started in with his nicknaming. And from her initial response to the story through the new DNA test \u201crebuttal\u201d to the president, she has demonstrated a conspicuous lack of political common sense.In the event, she didn\u2019t apologize, presumably because she thought that she did have a legitimate claim to minority status. And then she \u2014 or some too-clever strategist with her ear \u2014 set out to prove it with a DNA test, so that she could throw it back in Trump\u2019s yawping face.Warren should not have taken the test; having taken it, she should not have publicized it; having publicized it, she should quietly fire anyone who urged this gambit and move on. And liberals generally should regard this whole thing as a cautionary tale. There is an obvious appetite on the activist left for a candidate or candidates willing to take on Trump on his own brawler\u2019s terms. But if you come at him that way, you best not miss \u2014 as Michael Avenatti, the would-be Trump of the Resistance, has been missing repeatedly of late, with a Kavanaugh intervention that helped get the judge confirmed and a libel lawsuit that just got his own client ordered to pay Trump\u2019s legal fees.Now Warren has joined Avenatti in that loser\u2019s gallery, for absolutely no good reason that I can see. Her self-own isn\u2019t the biggest deal in the world, and her partisans are right that if mostly conservatives are agitated by the fiasco then it might not hurt her much. But a \u201cfront-runner\u201d who\u2019s polling at 8 percent needs to be showing reasons other candidates should be pre-emptively intimidated, and why the party should decide on her. And the fact that we\u2019re talking, for no good reason, about a fragment of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA three weeks before an essential midterm is a sign that she shouldn\u2019t exactly terrify her rivals yet.

{"Headline": "Babysitting While Black: Georgia Man Was Stalked by Woman as He Cared for 2 White Children", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorey Lewis first noticed the woman as he crossed the Walmart parking lot in Marietta, Ga., on Sunday afternoon. She was sitting in a Kia sedan, he said, as he led the two children he was babysitting back to his car.By the time he had them buckled up and ready to go, he had his phone out and was live-streaming on Facebook as he narrated a story about how the strange woman had begun stalking them after he refused to let her talk to the children, Mr. Lewis, 27, said in an interview.She followed him out of the parking lot, to the gas station across the street, and to his home, where Mr. Lewis, who is black, was questioned by a Cobb County police officer about why he had with him two young children, who are white.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, what she wanted to do,\u201d Mr. Lewis said on Tuesday, believing that the woman had called the police because he was a black man walking around with two white children. \u201cI felt like my character was being criminalized.\u201dSgt. Wayne Delk confirmed the incident, saying that an officer had responded to a call from a woman on Sunday afternoon. The police did not say whether they knew her identity.He said he had spent that afternoon watching 6-year-old Nicholas and 10-year-old Addison while their parents were out. After taking them to an indoor play area, he took them to Walmart to eat at the Subway, he said.After leaving the store, he and the children were hanging out by his car when the woman pulled up and asked if the children were all right.

Instead of taking the children home, he drove them to his house, where he knew people would be outside.Mr. Lewis continued to record as a police car pulled up, and the officer asked him what was going on. \u201cI\u2019m being followed and harassed,\u201d he says, to which the officer replied, \u201cI\u2019ve heard.\u201dThe confrontation ended without issue, with the officer seemingly convinced that the children \u2014 who offered similar explanations for what occurred \u2014 were fine, but he asked if he could check in with their parents, Mr. Lewis said.\u201cIt just knocked us out of our chair,\u201d David Parker, their father, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe felt horrible for Corey.\u201dMr. Parker and his wife, Dana Mango, were at dinner when they received the call, and his wife had to be convinced that it was not a prank, he said.Mr. Lewis is a family friend and well known in the community for working with children, Mr. Parker said, describing him as an \u201cAll-American guy.\u201dMr. Parker said that he wanted to give the woman the benefit of doubt, but that his children were having a good time with Mr. Lewis, and they were not in any apparent danger.

{"Headline": "The Results of Your Genetic Test Are Reassuring. But That Can Change. ", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLaboratories frequently \u201creclassify\u201d genetic mutations. But there is no reliable system for telling patients or doctors that the results of their genetic tests are no longer valid. The results of a genetic test may seem final \u2014 after all, a gene mutation is present or it is not. That mutation increases the risk of a disease, or it does not. In fact, those findings are not as straightforward as they might seem, and the consequences may have grave implications for patients. While a person\u2019s genome doesn\u2019t change, the research linking particular bits of DNA to disease is very much in flux. Geneticists and testing labs constantly receive new information that leads them to reassess genetic mutations. The result: The gene test you had a few years ago might yield a startlingly different result now. The lab issued new reports for nearly 60,000 of them, meaning the old results had been superseded by new data. But many patients who carry mutations that have been reclassified remain in the dark. \u201cThe system is completely chaotic,\u201d said Dr. Sharon E. Plon, a clinical geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine. There is no systematic way, she said, to tell patients and doctors that a mutation once thought harmless has been shown to be a health hazard or one thought dangerous is actually benign. \u201cSome labs report out only one-time results,\u201d said Dr. Theodora Ross, director of the cancer genetics program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. \u201cThey are not going back to reassess test interpretations from ten years ago unless doctors ask.\u201d But doctors seldom ask, she added. Normally, a doctor orders genetic testing for a person with a strong family history of, say, heart attacks, strokes or cancer. A sample of a patient\u2019s blood or saliva is sent to a lab, where the patient\u2019s DNA is scanned for unusual alterations. Not all of these are harmful. The lab compares the mutations to those shown in scientific studies to cause disease. Some patients are told they have a mutation that is meaningless. Others learn they have \u201ca variation of unknown significance\u201d in a suspect gene \u2014 meaning no one knows quite what to make of it.Still other patients have a mutation deemed dangerous, meaning there is a very high risk of developing cancer, heart disease or another condition. For those patients, such a result can mean regular monitoring and can alter a number of life decisions, including whether to have children. Reclassification is a particular problem for members of racial and ethnic minorities \u2014- populations whose genes have not been as well studied as those of white people. It can be difficult to know what a variation in DNA means for these patients. A federally-supported database, ClinVar, allows laboratories to publicly share data on genetic mutations and what they are thought to mean. But some companies, like Myriad, which host huge databases on genetic mutations, do not contribute to ClinVar. Even the terminology for DNA variants may not be widely shared. Different labs have different naming schemes. For example, ClinVar renders one DNA variant this way: NM_004004.5(GJB2):c.101T>C (p.Met34Thr). But another lab does it like this: c.101T>C, p.Met34Thr, GJB2. Patients searching for information on their own \u201cwould not be sure what to type into ClinVar,\u201d said Dr. Heidi Rehm, a clinical geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. In addition to the terminology problem, Dr. Ross said, there is a problem of discordance among labs.When one big lab \u201creports a reclassification and the other labs do not, and you have family members who get tested at different labs, we have different interpretations of the same patient data,\u201d Dr. Ross said. \u201cHow do we deal with that? What do we tell our patients?\u201dLabs like Myriad often notify a doctor who ordered a genetic test when the results were reclassified. But even when they do, doctors may not be able to reach and inform their patients.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my practice location over the years, and my patients have moved,\u201d Dr. Plon said. \u201cI have received updated reports for patients who no longer live in Houston, and we have no idea where they live.\u201dSome geneticists say the burden for getting updated results will fall on patients whose genetic alterations are rare ones. They will have to contact their doctors or genetic counselors annually to ask if there was a reclassification.A reclassification is not always good news.Dr. Jason Park, clinical director of the advanced diagnostics laboratory at Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, said he has told parents of children with severe epilepsy that a genetic mutation thought to be the cause of the disease actually is a benign change.The reclassification may not alter treatment, since there often is no specific treatment for a mutation thought to be causing severe epilepsy. But now parents who thought they had found the cause of their child\u2019s illness learn instead that the cause is unknown.\u201cFor families this can be a major social issue,\u201d Dr. Park said. \u201cThere are support groups centered around certain genes. Now they are no longer part of that group.\u201dBut for some, like Ricky Garrison, a 61-year-old firefighter who lives in Denton, Tex., reclassification can be a lifesaver. He went to a doctor a couple of years ago because a warty growth on his nose, but a pathology lab examining the tissue noticed some unusual changes in proteins linked to Lynch syndrome, a condition that greatly increases the risk for a variety of cancersHe was referred to Dr. Ross and her genetics team, who sent his blood to Invitae to test for mutations in Lynch genes.The results: Mr. Garrison had a \u201cvariant of unknown significance.\u201d And his diagnosis was confusing: \u201cLynch-like syndrome.\u201d It meant maybe he had Lynch syndrome \u2014 and maybe he did not. Doctors said he should have annual colonoscopies, endoscopies and whole skin exams. But since his was not a mutation definitely linked to Lynch syndrome, his family members \u2014 he has five children \u2014 were not tested to see if they had inherited it.\u201cNo lab that is reasonable would clinically test a family for a variation of unknown significance,\u201d Dr. Ross said. Instead, family members were told to assume they might have Lynch syndrome and to go ahead with the intense cancer surveillance.In June, though, the testing lab contacted Dr. Ross with news. Mr. Garrison\u2019s mutation was no longer of \u201cunknown significance.\u201d Research in other patients had shown it to be linked to Lynch syndrome. Everything changed. His children and direct relatives must be tested for the mutation. He must be monitored constantly for signs of cancer. He will change his plans to retire next year because he worries about the cost of health insurance for someone with Lynch syndrome. Instead he will keep his firefighter job, which comes with insurance, and wait until he is 65 to retire and get Medicare.\u201cCancer will probably get me in the end,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because of this, I probably will have a few more good years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It tells of a rural childhood idyll that ends because:The damage is done, the song says; paradise has been razed, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it now except to remember. But Mr. Prine\u2019s true story of Paradise, Ky., also spells out just what we have to lose in this gorgeous green world, and how permanent those losses are. Today, just as in 1971, the song reminds us of what happens when a gentle existence that lies easy on the land is destroyed for the profit of developers and corporations.No song on the new record is an overt protest song in the vein of \u201cSam Stone\u201d or \u201cParadise,\u201d but the album\u2019s spare production echoes the powerful simplicity of Mr. Prine\u2019s first record, and the animating spirit of that early music is threaded throughout the new work, too. There are rollicking songs about knocking on a screen door in summertime or getting to heaven and smoking \u201ca cigarette that\u2019s nine miles long,\u201d yes, but the one who\u2019s knocking on the screen door is a lonely drifter, and the one who\u2019s going to heaven is a songwriter who gave up smoking when he got throat cancer.From 1971 right through to today, John Prine has been a storyteller, not just between songs in a concert but within the songs themselves, and that\u2019s what gives them such power. His primary mode of persuasion is the story, just as the primary mode of persuasion for the biblical Jesus is the parable. A parable has many advantages over a screed or a sermon (or, it must be said, an op-ed column). A parable trusts the story to do the work of conversion, and it trusts its listeners to do the work of interpretation. A parable resists polarities: People listening to a story can\u2019t immediately know whether they belong among the speaker\u2019s \u201cus\u201d or the speaker\u2019s \u201cthem.\u201dThe mother church of country music, where the seats are scratched-up pews and the windows are stained glass, is the place where the new John Prine \u2014 older now, scarred by cancer surgeries, his voice deeper and full of gravel \u2014 is most clearly still the old John Prine: mischievous, delighting in tomfoolery, but also worried about the world.At the Ryman on Oct. 5, the night when Mitch McConnell announced he had the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, the songwriter who once called the United States on its dirty little war in Vietnam made an allusion to the controversy when he introduced \u201cAngel From Montgomery.\u201d Dedicating the song to all the women in the audience, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad, sad day when women can\u2019t be believed.\u201d This country has never needed John Prine more.Advertisement"}

Sometimes minced pork is added, sometimes it\u2019s not.My dish zeros in on the green beans and pork. It\u2019s a particularly harmonious pair, with the rich, brawny meat adding succulence and flavor to the lean, grassy beans.To maintain some of the freshness and color of the green beans, I nixed the shallow frying. Instead, I cut the beans into pieces and stir-fry them quickly, along with ginger, garlic and chiles. I also skip the Sichuan peppercorns and preserved mustard greens, adding coriander seeds and fresh cilantro for complexity, and a big splash of rice-wine vinegar for vibrancy.When I last made this dish, I served it with sliced fresh tomatoes, which has nothing to do with Sichuan cuisine and everything to do with seasonality: Along with the green beans, I had picked up one of the last good tomatoes at the farmers\u2019 market, and liked the way the flavors mingled on the plate.

{"Headline": "With Piranha-Like Teeth, This Prehistoric Predator Never Bit Off More Than It Could Chew", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesA fossil discovered in southern Germany is the earliest known flesh-eating bony fish.Some 150 million years ago, prehistoric fish swimming in the sponge and coral reefs of what is now southern Germany might not have suspected there was a piranha-like predator prowling among them. But by the time they realized the danger \u2014 CHOMP! \u2014 the sneaky creature would have bitten off one of their fins.Back then, these waters were teeming with bony fish called pycnodontiformes, which were known for their crushing teeth that were likely used for smashing snail shells and sea urchin spines. Scientists thought, for the most part, that other fish were not on their menu.This area was most likely a shallow tropical sea dotted with small islands inhabited by insects, lizards and dinosaurs when the piranha-like fish was alive, according to Dr. K\u00f6lbl-Ebert. After extracting the fossil from the rocks, they performed a micro-CT scan on the specimen.Although the Piranhamesodon pinnatomus may have looked like other colorful coral fish from the outside, there were major differences inside its mouth.Most pycnodonts had front teeth shaped like chisels that they used for grasping, as well as flat, cobble-shaped teeth for crushing. But the new species, just a few inches in length, had six long, pointed knifelike teeth that were slightly curved backward as well as six triangular teeth with serrated edges.\u201cWe were stunned that this fish had piranha-like teeth,\u201d said Dr. K\u00f6lbl-Ebert.While its pycnodont relatives mostly swallowed their prey whole, the sharp teeth of the newly discovered fish would have allowed it to munch on prey that was much larger than itself. According to the researchers, prehistoric sharks and sea turtles were the only other known flesh-eaters in those waters, known as the Solnhofen Archipelago, during the period known as the Late Jurassic. That made Piranhamesodon pinnatomus a pioneer among bony fish when it came to slicing up prey.The team said they are not certain if Piranhamesodon pinnatomus ate live fish or if it was a scavenger. But fossils of fish with missing or bitten fins suggest the fish nipped at the appendages of unwary fish while they were still alive, a practice seen in modern piranhas.\u201cIf you bite a fish in the belly it might die and then it\u2019s lost,\u201d said Dr. K\u00f6lbl-Ebert, \u201cbut if you just nibble bits from the fin it will regrow and you can do it all over again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.The practical question is whether the report might lead to tax-evasion charges. There\u2019s a fine line between avoidance and evasion, and the dodges the Trump family used often seemed to push the envelope of legality even if they didn\u2019t quite push past it. Of course, the larger issue is a tax code that\u2019s filled with so many loopholes that it allows the ultrarich to game the system. How about lower rates for all and exemptions for none?All of which is to say that you\u2019re right. Democrats really do need to come up with a forward-looking agenda for 2020, because if all they have to talk about are the Trump family\u2019s tax dodges from 30 years ago, or if they try to relitigate the 2016 election, they will lose again.Or maybe it\u2019s the Republican Party? There\u2019s a lot of talk about divisions between left and center among the Democrats, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what\u2019s happened to the Republicans. It\u2019s really two parties, with the establishment so terrified of the Trump train, they\u2019re afraid to peep.But you\u2019re right. It does feel different this time. And I think the difference is that the fights aren\u2019t really about policy. They\u2019re about our personal experiences and deepest fears. Christine Blasey Ford was electrifying because so many women said: She\u2019s me; her suffering is so much like my own.

There, he posted a signoff to his followers:There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert \u2014 or \u201cred pill,\u201d in the parlance of right-wing internet activists \u2014 a new generation to their cause.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business.\u201cThe challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,\u201d said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. \u201cIf an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren\u2019t going to think it\u2019s a good place for their baby photos.\u201dBut the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms \u2014 and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab.\u201cWe have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers and several payment processors,\u201d the statement read.In addition, GoDaddy, the domain name provider, told Gab it had 24 hours to move its domain name to another service, after finding content on the site that promoted violence.\u201cWhen a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,\u201d a PayPal spokesman said.

It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography.

{"Headline": "Think Professors Are Liberal? Try School Administrators", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ideological bent of those overseeing collegiate life is having the biggest impact on campus culture.Dr. Abrams is a professor of politics.I received a disconcerting email this year from a senior staff member in the Office of Diversity and Campus Engagement at Sarah Lawrence College, where I teach. The email was soliciting ideas from the Sarah Lawrence community for a conference, open to all of us, titled \u201cOur Liberation Summit.\u201d The conference would touch on such progressive topics as liberation spaces on campus, Black Lives Matter and justice for women as well as for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual and allied people.As a conservative-leaning professor who has long promoted a diversity of viewpoints among my (very liberal) faculty colleagues and in my classes, I was taken aback by the college\u2019s sponsorship of such a politically lopsided event. The email also piqued my interest in what sorts of other nonacademic events were being organized by the school\u2019s administrative staff members.I soon learned that the Office of Student Affairs, which oversees a wide array of issues including student diversity and residence life, was organizing many overtly progressive events \u2014 programs with names like \u201cStay Healthy, Stay Woke,\u201d \u201cMicroaggressions\u201d and \u201cUnderstanding White Privilege\u201d \u2014 without offering any programming that offered a meaningful ideological alternative. These events were conducted outside the classroom, in the students\u2019 social and recreational spaces.Today, many colleges and universities have moved to a model in which teaching and learning is seen as a 24/7 endeavor. Engagement with students is occurring as much \u2014 if not more \u2014 in residence halls and student centers as it is in classrooms. Schools have increased their hiring in areas such as residential life and student centers, offices of student life and success, and offices of inclusion and engagement. It\u2019s not surprising that many of the free-speech controversies in the past few years at places like Yale, Stanford and the University of Delaware have concerned events that occurred not in classrooms but in student communal spaces and residence halls.Intrigued by this phenomenon, I recently surveyed a nationally representative sample of roughly 900 \u201cstudent-facing\u201d administrators \u2014 those whose work concerns the quality and character of a student\u2019s experience on campus. I found that liberal staff members outnumber their conservative counterparts by the astonishing ratio of 12-to-one. Only 6 percent of campus administrators identified as conservative to some degree, while 71 percent classified themselves as liberal or very liberal. It\u2019s no wonder so much of the nonacademic programming on college campuses is politically one-sided.The severity of this trend varies among different types of academic institutions. My research found that two-thirds of administrators at public institutions and schools with religious affiliations self-identified as liberals, which was lower than the three-quarters of administrators at private, secular institutions who did. I found no real differences among school types, such as small, private liberal arts colleges as compared with large research universities. School ranking did make a small difference, with administrators at more selective institutions reporting a higher percentage of liberals than did lower-ranked schools.The most pronounced difference was regional. New England has the most liberal college administrators in the nation, with a 25-to-one ratio of liberals to conservatives. The West Coast and Southeast have ratios of 16-to-one, whereas the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes all have ratios closer to 10-to-one. The only region with anything close to a balanced ratio is the Southwest, with two-to-one.This warped ideological distribution among college administrators should give our students and their families pause. To students who are in their first semester at school, I urge you not to accept unthinkingly what your campus administrators are telling you. Their ideological imbalance, coupled with their agenda-setting power, threatens the free and open exchange of ideas, which is precisely what we need to protect in higher education in these politically polarized times.Samuel J.

Amid the turmoil, the government is trying to shore up support by giving cash back to the working class \u2014 with tax breaks next year worth 6 billion euros ($6.9 billion) for middle- and low-income earners \u2014 while reassuring investors that his designs for a \u201cnew French prosperity\u201d are on track.\u201cBut French people are skeptical,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters last week. \u201cWe need to explain that this new model will be successful, and that it takes time before seeing the full benefits.\u201dIf convincing French voters is an uphill battle, it is especially challenging for Mr. Macron, who is viewed internationally as a dynamic European leader. His policies at home have yet to help most households.Mr. Macron promised voters that he could whittle unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022. To meet that target, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory.The budget is aimed at \u201cmaking work pay\u201d by leaving more money in workers\u2019 pockets. But to keep the deficit in check, Mr. Macron is also trimming benefits for those not working, and cutting over 40,000 jobs in the public sector.Increases in pensions and family benefits would be capped at 0.3 percent a year, well below the 1.8 percent annual average inflation rate. Although 300,000 pensioners who make less than \u20ac1,200 a month will be exempted, many older voters are angry about those cuts and are taking to the streets in protest. There are 15 million pensioners in France, and three out of four voted for Mr. Macron in the second round of balloting.Yet even the business community has been grousing about Mr. Macron\u2019s changes. Some companies are upset about the government\u2019s plans to limit the use of short-term contracts, arguing that the policy ignores the needs of the modern workplace. Employers relied on short-term contracts during the financial crisis. The sort of innovative industry that France now seeks \u2014 whether digital or manufacturing-based \u2014 needs agile and fluid workers, business groups contend.Mr. Macron took pains on a tour of the French Antilles last weekend to appear more down to earth, glad-handing the public and standing in the rain for selfies with smiling crowds. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. There are things that need to be corrected,\u201d he told the French newspaper Le Monde.He also remains adamant that his approach will benefit younger voters \u2014 including the 25-year-old gardener who couldn\u2019t find work. Mr. Macron listened to his complaint that horticulture jobs were hard to find and gave a rapid-fire response: Be flexible.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing and motivated, in hotels, cafes and restaurants, construction, there\u2019s not a single place I go where they don\u2019t say they\u2019re looking for people. Not one \u2014 it\u2019s true!\u201d Mr. Macron told the man.The French president is \u201ctaking a gamble,\u201d said \u00c9ric Heyer, the director of analysis and forecasting at the French Economic Observatory. \u201cBy easing taxes on the middle class, he\u2019s trying to get away from this image that he\u2019s \u2018president of the rich.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe measures will either deepen inequality or help growth,\u201d Mr. Heyer added. \u201cBut nothing is guaranteed to be a success, so it is unclear if he will win or lose the bet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yes, we may be shocked by how heinous Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder was, and by how blatant the many lies told by the Saudis have been. Of course, many Americans, from Silicon Valley to the editorial pages of our leading papers, were snowed by the crown prince\u2019s promises of reform and the deft marketing of his leadership. But, for those willing to see past his charm offensive, Prince Mohammed had already revealed his true character through numerous impulsive and vicious actions.As this litany of lunacy shows, Prince Mohammed is not and can no longer be viewed as a reliable or rational partner of the United States and our allies. If we fail to punish him directly and target only those around him, the crown prince will be further emboldened to take extreme actions. If we do punish him, which we must, Prince Mohammed, petulant and proud, is equally likely to behave more irresponsibly to demonstrate his independence and exact retribution against his erstwhile Western partners. Either way, the Trump administration must assume that Prince Mohammed will continue to drive his country and our bilateral relationship over the proverbial cliff.Absent a change at the top, we should brace ourselves for a future in which Saudi Arabia is less stable and more difficult to govern. In this scenario, the potential risks to American security and economic interests would be grave. The United States was wrong to hitch our wagon to Prince Mohammed, but we would be even more foolish to continue to do so.Finally, we should stop following Prince Mohammed down blind alleys and bring a healthy skepticism to our dealings with him, particularly any that require relying on his word or judgment. We need to stop privileging Jared Kushner\u2019s relationship with the crown prince, and finally fill the vacant ambassadorship to the kingdom, to engage with a broader range of senior Saudi officials. President Trump\u2019s inexplicable infatuation with Prince Mohammed must end, and he must recalibrate American policy so that it serves our national interests \u2014 not his personal interests or those of the crown prince.Advertisement"}

LOS ANGELES \u2014 In a Hollywood strip mall, with a cramped kitchen and a shoestring budget, the tiny restaurant Baroo brought a singular, experimental spirit to this city\u2019s food scene.As Mr. Uh\u2019s star quickly rose, the understaffed restaurant scrambled to keep up with lines out the door. All the while, Mr. Uh and Mr. Kim kept their prices low relative to the food\u2019s quality and complexity \u2014 most dishes were around $10. \u201cIf I did the same concept in Korea, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had the same support,\u201d said Mr. Uh, who is 37 and came to the United States from Seoul in 2007 to attend the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.For local chefs, Baroo was the working model of a creative vision executed on one\u2019s own terms. Before opening Konbi, he and Mr. Montgomery ran a pop-up inside Baroo on Sundays, when the restaurant was closed. They refined and developed their own ideas there, along with one of their current best-sellers, a sandwich filled with a delicate omelet that has been poached in dashi.Mr. Uh said that while the rent had barely risen at all since 2015, and business hasn\u2019t slowed down, Baroo was never sustainable. Though he and Mr. Kim hired part-time workers to help in the kitchen and work the register, one of the partners had to be on site at all times for the restaurant to function.\u201cIf we hired more people, we could work less, but then we couldn\u2019t pay ourselves,\u201d Mr. Uh said during one of Baroo\u2019s last days, still struggling with the paradox. Being understaffed meant constant burnout, unexpected closings, general havoc and very little time to strategize and grow the business. He and Mr. Kim decided to open a small place with no outside investors, as a kind of testing ground. In Los Angeles, they found an old Thai noodle shop by a 7-Eleven on Santa Monica Boulevard, where the rent was about $2,000 a month. Their tight budget dictated Baroo\u2019s sparse aesthetic, and they used basic open shelving in the dining room for Mr. Uh\u2019s fermentations \u2014 several flavors of kombucha, chile pastes and dried fruits.Mr. Uh says he didn\u2019t expect the restaurant to remain open for more than a year.

Mr. Kim kept Baroo up and running, hiring two part-time cooks to cover for Mr. Uh.\u201cIt\u2019ll take time,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cWe need to find funding, figure out the location, and we\u2019re still talking about a few different concepts.\u201d Eventually, she and Mr. Uh want to expand with a small farm where diners can stay the night, not unlike at the temple where they met.\u201cSpirit-wise, soul-wise, it\u2019s going to be Baroo-like,\u201d Mr. Uh said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the ending.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Surgeons General Recount Political Pressure on the Job", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLOBAL HEALTHServing from 1990 to 2006, the four retired officials discussed how they were muzzled for giving medical advice that was unpopular \u2014 though time proved them right.But this was no re-enactment of Bull Run or Shiloh. It was an after-action report on America\u2019s medical wars, and it took place this month on the stage of the New York Academy of Medicine.The underlying theme was how badly the country needs independent public health leadership and how often partisan politics obstruct that.There were more than a few \u201cI told you so\u201d moments. Since the late 1990s, retired surgeons general have become an informal club, appearing together every few years when someone asks them to speak out. They have discussed transplant medicine at a surgeons\u2019 conference, cancer treatment at Lance Armstrong\u2019s Livestrong Foundation, maternal care during Women\u2019s Health Month, and so on.The four at this meeting were in office from 1990 to 2006 during the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.That was an era when \u2014 not unlike today \u2014 scientists felt they were under attack by the White House, Congressional conservatives and armies of industry lobbyists. Then, however, the fights were even more blatantly over medical issues rather than global warming. The four described battles over AIDS, smoking, teenage pregnancy and drugs.They lost most of them \u2014 but time usually proved them right.\u201cIf we had responded to the crack cocaine epidemic as we should have, we wouldn\u2019t have had the opioid epidemic,\u201d Dr. Satcher said.She also suggested legalizing drugs as a way to cut crime and jail crowding.In response, she was pilloried.\u201cI have no regrets,\u201d Dr. Elders said at the academy. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d do it the same way. I thought I did it right the first time.\u201dTheir complaints echo similar ones from other federal health officers. Privately, top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have complained for years about demands that they clear public statements and even medical advice through the Department of Health and Human Services, which is considered by some to be heavily politicized. The surgeons general described moments of equal absurdity.In Dr. Carmona\u2019s case, it involved Sesame Street.A former police officer and Special Forces medic who grew up in Harlem, he was asked by the producers of the children\u2019s show to make occasional appearances, sitting on a stoop in his uniform, chatting about health. (One tentative plotline called for him to talk Cookie Monster into trying broccoli.)  But the department, he said, decreed that the role had to go to H.H.S. Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. Sesame Street dropped the idea.In 1991, Dr. Novello said, when the basketball star Magic Johnson shocked the world by revealing that he had H.I.V., she was told that her role in the announcement had to be handed over to the H.H.S. secretary.The exception was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a renowned pediatric surgeon in office from 1982 to 1989. He was chosen by President Reagan because of his conservative political views and opposition to abortion, but he became famous for defying White House pressure.He condemned nicotine as addictive and endorsed warnings on cigarette packs. At a time when many politicians said AIDS was divine punishment for homosexuality, he sent every American household a pamphlet explaining how it was transmitted. And he refused to issue a report saying that abortions harmed the mental health of women who had them.Even he had not faced as much pressure as Dr. Carmona did, he testified.Dr. Carmona recalled that moment.\u201cOnce you put on the uniform, there\u2019s supposed to be no room for politics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t stupid \u2014 Washington is a combat zone.

{"Headline": "Heat and Drought Could Threaten World Beer Supply ", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by A new study says a warming globe will be bad news for barley, an essential ingredient in the world\u2019s most popular alcoholic beverage. A small international team of scientists considered what the effect of climate change would be for this crop in the next 80 years, and they are raising an alarm they hope will pierce the din of political posturing.They are predicting a beer shortage.Of course it may seem odd, almost irreverent, to concentrate on a cold, foamy recreational beverage, given the damage, real and potential, of climate-influenced natural disasters. Christopher Field, faculty director of the Stanford Woods Institute, who was not involved in the study, said that the report was based on a \u201csolid analysis.\u201d But he wrote in an email, given what is going on in terms of climate change, \u201cIt feels a tad trivial to talk about beer.\u201dOne can only ask: to whom?From Ireland to England, China to the Czech Republic, the love, or \u201clike\u201d of beer has made it the most popular alcoholic beverage on the planet. That is by volume consumed, and what other criterion would you use? One of the authors, Dabo Guan, of Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of East Anglia, Norwich, said the report was directed at the richer countries of the world, like the United States, to suggest that climate change will hit everyone, not just the poor, who could suffer dire food shortages.\u201cWe will suffer less,\u201d he said, but we will still suffer. Climate change \u201cmay not affect our bread,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will affect our beer.\u201dThe idea for the study came up at \u2014 where else? \u2014 a bar, Dr. Guan said. It was after a day at a scientific meeting in China, and a few participants had gotten together, including climate scientists, a crop modeler and himself, an economist. His own work, he said, is on international trade. The group had a lot in common, he said: \u201cWe all love beer.\u201d\u201cWe started talking about the agricultural impact of climate change, about food and then beer,\u201d he said. They decided to put together mathematical models of the impact of climate change on barley crops with models of international trade. Seventeen percent of barley is used for beer, he said, while the rest goes mostly to animal feed.The group even came up with a term for beer and some of the other commodities they may study in the future like coffee and chocolate: luxury essentials. You don\u2019t need them to survive, but if you are rich enough to be living in the developed world, you do need them.Dr. Guan also said that the focus should not be on the study\u2019s precise numbers, because the models assume today\u2019s economy. Many things can change. But, he said, the effects are clear.With particularly bad droughts, for example, the price of a bottle of beer in Ireland might double. In the Czech Republic, it could be six or seven times as expensive.China and the United States drink the most beer, because of their populations. \u201cUnder the worst scenario,\u201d he said, China would lose 10 percent of its beer supply and the United States 15 to 20 percent.That won\u2019t happen if Anheuser-Busch has anything to say about it, however. Jess Newman, the company\u2019s director of agronomy in the United States, said, \u201cWe take climate uncertainty very seriously.\u201d To that end, she and her staff keep an eye on climate predictions, breed new strains of barley, and collect data on their own farms and those of suppliers in Montana, Idaho and North Dakota, to determine best practices. \u201cThe barley nerds are on the case,\u201d she said. In terms of how the public should take the news, Dr. Guan was adamant on one point: \u201cOur aim is not to encourage people to drink more beer now.\u201d A good caution, since that might well be the policy solution favored by beer drinkers faced with a possible shortage 80 years in the future. No, he said, sounding a bit like a preacher in a pub: \u201cClimate change mitigation is the only way. Everybody in the world needs to fight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Holding onto a rope, they pulled themselves over the invisible line dividing Guatemala and Mexico. Others crossed with their babies and young children on crowded rafts built with tires. The migrant caravan is more than fodder for misleading claims and overreactions, and more than a tool to stoke voters\u2019 fears just before midterm elections. It\u2019s a blaring reminder that Latin America is suffering a prolonged refugee crisis that demands solutions.The vast majority are from Honduras, although some Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and Guatemalans have joined them. Since the caravan first formed in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Oct. 13, it has grown from hundreds to thousands. Its scale reflects how much Hondurans are suffering from incessant violence, political turmoil and brutal poverty. There are three distinct phenomena forcing people to move. The first is criminal violence, with murder rates at catastrophic levels, and gangs committing extortion and kidnapping. The second is a return to authoritarianism, accompanied by the use of deadly violence by security forces against those protesting autocratic rulers. The third is economic failure that has pushed people into extreme poverty. Some countries are facing all three of these at the same time.The desperation can be seen in the caravan among the families with small children sleeping in crowded plazas. People described to me how they simply saw news of the caravan on television and, within hours, decided to join it. Many are traveling with no possessions or money. Many are wearing clothes handed out on the way. Many don\u2019t know for sure where they\u2019ll end up, but are simply hoping for anywhere that can offer a better life. When it comes to the forces contributing to the refugee crisis, there are no easy solutions. Governments of the region should be meeting to discuss the refugee crisis \u2014 with, or without, the United States. Aid needs to be channeled more effectively to actually reach the poor. There must be real efforts to stop the flow of guns to the gangs terrorizing communities.Mr. Trump\u2019s call to turn away from internationalism hasn\u2019t helped. But this is an issue that will go beyond his presidency. Unless the core problems are dealt with, the lines of people wading through border rivers could grow even longer. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Talk About the N.R.A.", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "\nThe massacre of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue a week ago was terrifyingly predictable \u2014 with an equally predictable response. President Trump and members of Congress denounced the violence but show no signs of actually doing anything.Why is it that polls show that voters want more gun safety laws yet Congress can\u2019t pass any? One reason is the National Rifle Association, a heavyweight player in this election and every election. On Tuesday, the N.R.A. once again will help deflect what surveys suggest is the people\u2019s will to stop it.I write this as a former N.R.A. member who grew up on a farm \u2014 my 12th birthday present was my own .22 rifle \u2014 and I acknowledge that it once was a great organization for shooting enthusiasts.But it has been hijacked by extremist leaders committed not to their members\u2019 (much more reasonable) views, but to hard-line resistance of safety regulations. All countries have violent, hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and that\u2019s in part because of the N.R.A. and its political influence.The Second Amendment? Few talked about it. Almost everyone, in and out of the N.R.A., accepted that there should be restrictions on firearms.Visitors to Wichita, Kan., had to check their revolvers at police headquarters. And as for Dodge City, a symbol of the Wild West, a photo shows a sign on main street in 1879 warning: \u201cThe Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited.\u201dIn the 1920s and 1930s, the N.R.A. favored tighter gun laws, and its president, Karl Frederick, said that the carrying of weapons \u201cshould be sharply restricted and only under license.\u201d In 1934, the United States helped pioneer modern gun laws with the National Firearms Act, with the blessings of the N.R.A., and came close to banning handguns. As recently as the 1960s, the N.R.A. supported \u2014 more grudgingly \u2014 some limits on guns.But in 1977 there was a coup within the N.R.A. that put hard-liners in charge. The group began calling for repeal of the 1968 Gun Control Act and doubled down on a full-time lobbying arm to oppose firearm restrictions. In effect, the group took an extremist turn that continues to shape American life today.America\u2019s gun culture and Canada\u2019s had been similar in the 1950s and 60s, focused on rifles used for hunting. In 1959, a survey found that 60 percent of Americans favored a ban on handguns. Then in the post-World War II period, other countries steadily tightened gun laws, while in the United States the N.R.A. moved to emphasize handguns and personal security, building on public anxiety about crime, so the United States resisted that global trend and instead passed a series of concealed carry laws.Leaders of the N.R.A. fervently backed a new movement to reinterpret the Second Amendment, which had been regarded as a relic having to do with state militias, as protecting individual gun rights. In 1991, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, dismissed calls to reinterpret the Second Amendment as \u201cone of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word \u2018fraud,\u2019 on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201dNow that \u201cfraud\u201d is the law of the land.The reinterpretation of the Second Amendment is a tribute to the undeniable effectiveness of the N.R.A. Relentless campaigning by the N.R.A. and changing American mores have resulted in a Constitutional right to bear arms, in a blizzard of concealed carry permits, and in tough stand-your-ground laws. In contrast to Canada, the United States now has a gun culture focused on handguns, assault weapons and paranoia, and that\u2019s in large part because of the N.R.A.Even now, the N.R.A.\u2019s strategy is largely to pounce on liberal comments about \u201cgun control\u201d \u2014 one reason I prefer the less threatening term \u201cgun safety\u201d \u2014 and leverage them to frighten gun owners to become more engaged.

It is a mature business whose products last generations, and whose traditional constituency \u2014 hunters \u2014 is aging and shrinking, and it is also facing the kind of liability risks that struck the tobacco industry. Yet in fact, the gun industry has prospered in recent decades \u2014 in large part because it has been rescued by N.R.A. fear-mongering that drives gun owners to buy more weapons and accessories before they\u2019re banned. This is brilliant marketing.Consider another of the N.R.A.\u2019s current campaigns, to allow silencers. Silencers have been largely banned since the 1930s, but the N.R.A. and enthusiasts like Donald Trump Jr. argue that they should be allowed as a matter of liberty and for health reasons \u2014 to reduce hearing loss associated with gunfire.No one takes this public health argument seriously, but allowing silencers would be a huge boon for the gun industry. If five million Americans each bought a silencer for two firearms, it could amount to $1 billion in sales.Moreover, most firearms today don\u2019t have the threaded barrels needed to accommodate a silencer. So a gun owner who wanted both a rifle and a handgun with silencers would also buy two more firearms \u2014 a further benefit to the industry.Companies show gratitude in other ways. A laser sight maker called Crimson Trace donates 10 percent of certain sales to the organization, and other companies have similar initiatives.The N.R.A. has been admired and feared for decades for its political influence. When Al Gore lost the presidency in 2000, it was widely said that the N.R.A. made the difference.Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia says that the N.R.A.\u2019s power is often attributed to its financial support for candidates, but that its endorsements are far more important. The key, he says, is that many gun rights supporters are single-issue voters, while historically those against the N.R.A. have also cared about the economy, civil rights, foreign policy and so on.Yet there are signs that this is changing, and that N.R.A. influence may have peaked.Even N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.Requiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felons79% of NRA members agreeRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence6865\u2026 21 years old or olderSources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsEven N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.79% of NRA members agreeRequiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felonsRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence68\u2026 21 years old or older65Sources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsViews of the N.R.A.have been mostly positivefavorable6058555351Overall it has been positive since Gallup began tracking it \u2014 except in June 1995, two months after the Oklahoma City terror attack and one month after former president George H.W.

But today they remain legal around the country, and the public has moved on. This underscores the N.R.A.\u2019s success at blocking national regulations, but also the degree to which it is vulnerable for being out of step with public opinion.Even critics of the N.R.A. acknowledge that it also performs a significant public service that liberals rarely acknowledge: It runs gun safety classes around the country.Every year, the N.R.A. trains some 750,000 Americans in gun safety. Sometimes these classes have an ideological tinge, and they often encourage joining the N.R.A. and fighting for Second Amendment rights, but they also train new gun buyers to use a gun reasonably safely.It would be good to see progressive organizations teaching gun safety as well, rather than simply ceding the turf to the N.R.A.My first encounter with the N.R.A. was in a hunter safety class in my hometown of Yamhill, Ore., when I was in seventh grade. At the end of the class, we all received a one-year N.R.A. membership.At the time it was simply a grass-roots organization of hunters and well-meaning sportsmen. But along the way, it morphed into an extremist organization that fights any restrictions on firearms.More guns = more child deathsA comparison of child deaths in the 15 states with the highest household gun ownership and the six states with the lowest. Each group of states has a similar number of children ages 5 to 14, and those children die at similar rates from suicide and homicide where guns are not involved. But children in high-gun states are 2.2 times as likely to be murdered with guns, and almost 9 times as likely to kill themselves with guns, as children in low-gun states.Child homicides\u2026 high-gun states have:For each death in low-gun states \u20262.2By gunsOther means1.2Child suicides\u2026 high-gun states have:For each death in low-gun states \u20268.8By gunsOther means1.4Source: David Hemenway in the American Journal of MedicineThe 15 states with the highest average levels of household gun ownership: Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Utah and Louisiana.

We can do better, and one step would be to avoid demonizing gun owners, while relentlessly challenging the political influence of the N.R.A.It has overreached and is vulnerable. If we want to tackle gun violence in America, we can start by discrediting it as an extremist organization that has been a boon to the firearms industry and a catastrophe for the American public.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Death at the Crossroads: A Ragged Limo, an Anxious Driver and 17 Friends", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "The deadly limousine crash this month left in its wake mourning families, young orphans and officials trying to piece together what went wrong.Supported bySCHOHARIE, N.Y. \u2014 It was supposed to be a surprise.Axel Steenburg had been planning a birthday party for his wife, Amy, for a while. But the ever excitable Mr. Steenburg was notoriously bad at keeping secrets and, somehow, she found out.\u201cHe would try to hide it from you and then you would see him biting his cheek. It was so obvious,\u201d his mother, Janet Steenburg, said. \u201cAnd then he would say, \u2018You\u2019re not going to believe what I have for you.\u2019\u201dMr. Steenburg coordinated a passel of friends through a group chat, arranging for a tour and tasting at a popular upstate brewery and renting a party bus to make sure that anyone drinking would not be driving. He even set aside two spare bedrooms in his home in Amsterdam, N.Y., a small city northwest of Albany, in case someone was not sober enough to drive home. But the bus broke down before picking them up, so he booked whatever he could find at the last-minute: a white stretch limousine.It fit 18. They were 17. That would do.About 25 miles to the south, a professor and his father-in-law were out celebrating a family wedding and pulled over at a roadside country store to take a break from driving.All 20 would soon be dead.Mr. Hussain, 28, pleaded not guilty. Just 10 miles away, hundreds of people filled a gymnasium in Schoharie to mourn the dead and families throughout the area planned funerals.The toll of the crash has been particularly acute because of the connection between the 17 young people \u2014 all 24 to 34 years old \u2014 who had climbed into the limousine, bound for a brewery, Ommegang, a popular attraction known for its bands and its beer in Cooperstown.They were a tight-knit gang of friends and family: Among them were four sisters, two brothers and two sets of newlyweds. They hung out regularly, gathering for game nights on Saturdays at Axel and Amy Steenburg\u2019s home on a peaceful street overlooking a reservoir in Amsterdam, a Mohawk River city about 25 miles north of the crash site. Ms. Steenburg would have turned 30 on Wednesday.Why the limousine ended up at that spot \u2014 speeding down a mile-long hill, across a busy highway, clipping a parked car and hitting two pedestrians before careening into an overgrown creek bed \u2014 is one of many mysteries. The brewery was far to the west of the crash site.Whatever the reason, it was at that intersection that the lives of the limousine\u2019s passengers, its driver and the two pedestrians collided, a random convergence that resulted in the country\u2019s worst transportation-related accident in nearly a decade.That Axel Steenburg would take charge of planning his wife\u2019s birthday was no surprise, according to a neighbor, Missy Davison, who had watched with sweet awe as the young Steenburg couple had nested in the modest two-story home on Pleasant Avenue, next to Bunn Creek.\u201cThey were so ambitious and so in love,\u201d said Ms. Davison, who recalled the young couple moving in two years ago and immediately helping neighbors with errands. \u201cThey were going places.\u201dThe couple had married over the summer and their social set was guided by blood \u2014 Mr. Steenburg\u2019s brother, Rich, was also a close friend, and Amy had three sisters in the area \u2014 and the type of life\u2019s misadventures that bond young people. Ms. Davison remembers a group of Mr. Steenburg\u2019s friends trying mightily to hoist a king-size mattress through a second-floor window. (They succeeded, eventually.) There were also quiet evenings watching deer and wild turkeys in a fenced area around the reservoir across from their home.On Saturday, the plan was for guests to meet at the couple\u2019s house and take a party bus from there. But at some point that day, Mr. Steenburg received word that the bus had broken down, so he scrambled to find an alternative. He ended up booking a ride from a business called Prestige Limousine, which operated out of a budget motel in Wilton, N.Y. It was run by Mr. Hussain.When the replacement vehicle showed up, it was a disappointment: a ragged stretch limousine, an S.U.V. on steroids, so dismal that its owner didn\u2019t care if people smoked in the back. Ms. Davison remembers the limousine idling in front of the Steenburg\u2019s house shortly before 1:30 p.m., about a half an hour before the accident.\u201cI thought it was a wedding,\u201d Ms. Davison said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to ask.\u201dThe limousine driver\u2019s name was Scott T. Lisinicchia. He lived in a quiet wooded neighborhood south of the resort town of Lake George, N.Y.Mr. Lisinicchia, 53, had suffered both tragedies and self-inflicted wounds: his brother, Anthony, had died in 2017, at 42; Mr. Lisinicchia had had two drug-related arrests, making his own life more difficult. The job driving for Prestige was part-time, and perilous, according to his wife, Kim, who told CBS News that he worried about the safety of its fleet.\u201cThere were a few times where he told me, like I overheard him say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to drive this, like this, you need to give me another car,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lisinicchia told CBS.State officials have said that Mr. Lisinicchia did not have the proper license to drive the limousine involved in the crash. But Ms. Lisinicchia disputed that he was unqualified, saying he had driven tractor-trailers. \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t have the proper license,\u201d she said, \u201cthis still would\u2019ve happened.\u201d\u201cThis past summer was a great one for his family,\u201d his mother, Artra Hough, said. \u201cHe and his wife and son went to the Grand Canyon and other national parks out in the West. They were climbing on rocks, going down into the canyon \u2014 all the things you do at Yellowstone.\u201d\u201cMy kids, they all loved their Uncle Brian,\u201d Mr. Hough said. \u201cHe was one of the best uncles you could ever possibly imagine \u2014 always the goof ball, wrestling with his nieces and nephews, pretending to be Frankenstein, a real kid at heart.\u201dDuring that trip, Brian Hough mentioned a family wedding coming up in October, his wife\u2019s cousin getting married nearby.So on that Saturday, Mr. Hough, his wife, Jaclyn Schnurr, and their 8-year-old son, Ben, along with other relatives, were caravaning in several cars; J.T Hough said Ms. Schnurr told him that the family \u201cwas having the best day ever.\u201dJust before 2 p.m. the group decided \u201cto stop and stretch their legs and maybe get something to eat,\u201d said Mr. Hough\u2019s mother. They parked near the Apple Barrel Country Store, which was bustling with visitors who had flocked upstate for its scenic fall foliage and apple-picking.The red-roof country store sits at the intersection of Route 30 and Route 30A, a T-shaped junction that had long unnerved residents as a frightening stretch to navigate. Route 30 is downhill as it veers toward Route 30A, a busy byway that runs east to west. There is nothing but a stop sign to slow down motorists.Ms. Schnurr\u2019s brother took Ben into the store. Mr. Hough lingered near the car with his father-in-law, James Schnurr, 70. Ms. Schnurr was standing nearby.Up the hill, a white limousine began its descent.When the 17 friends began piling into the limousine and cramming into its tan leather seats under its mirrored roof, they never fathomed that the sunny afternoon would be their last.Just the night before, Rich Steenburg had gotten together with friends in his trailer home for a Friday night ritual \u2014 eating pizza and playing Dungeons and Dragons. His wife, Kim, had planned on going to the outing on Saturday, but stayed behind after falling ill while babysitting her niece. The couple had recently been approved for a house and were closing the deal next month.\u201cRich was so in love with the house,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWhen he found out they got approved they were so ecstatic.\u201dThe day before the crash, Patrick Cushing, who played for Team USA dodge ball, and his girlfriend Amanda Halse, a waitress at a restaurant in a senior living community, had watched the Red Sox beat their beloved Yankees in the playoffs. They had been looking forward to the postseason rivalry \u2014 and the trip on Saturday, too, his father, Kevin Cushing, said.\u201cBoth my son Patrick and his girlfriend Amanda took every day as an opportunity for an adventure,\u201d he said.Rachael Cavosie and Amanda Rivenburg, friends of the group, were also in the limousine. Matthew Coons, who had competed in fitness competitions with Axel Steenburg, had joined and brought his girlfriend, Savannah Bursese, who was saving up money to pursue a law degree in Texas.Amy Steenburg\u2019s inseparable sisters \u2014 Mary Dyson, Abigail Jackson and Allison King \u2014 were also in the car, along with two of their spouses, Robert Dyson and Adam Jackson.Ms. King, however, wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about the celebration. She had been abstaining from drinking to support her fianc\u00e9\u2019s decision to give up alcohol, her mother, Linda King, said.\u201cAllison wasn\u2019t crazy about going,\u201d said Mrs. King, who saw her daughter for the last time that Friday afternoon when she dropped off a dozen eggs from her chicken coop.And Michael Ukaj, the quiet one of the group, was also in the limousine \u2014 coincidently, it was his 34th birthday.An avid collector of arcade games, Mr. Ukaj had spent part of the previous night playing on a pinball machine he had bought for himself as a birthday present. Mr. Ukaj, a former Marine, had driven down from the forested foothills of Adirondack State Park in Caroga Lake, where he lived alone in a house that he had inherited from his grandmother and was fixing up.\u201cOne thing that Mike was is responsible,\u201d his brother, Jeremy Ashton, said. \u201cHe would always throw in the caveat that if you\u2019re going to drive don\u2019t drink. If you\u2019re going to drink don\u2019t drive.\u201dSo they didn\u2019t.But they swiftly found reasons for apprehension as the limousine rattled south from Amsterdam, past the beat-up barns along the winding curves of Route 30.Erin McGowan, who was there with her new husband, Shane McGowan, texted her best friend at 1:37 p.m., about 18 minutes before the crash. The texts were jocular, but in retrospect eerie. It was no \u201cluxury limo\u201d and it was making a racket, she wrote.\u201cThe motor is making everyone deaf,\u201d wrote Ms. McGowan, adding five emojis of a grinning face shedding tears from laughing so hard. \u201cWhen we get to brewery we will all b deaf.\u201dMinutes passed and some of the messages sent from the limousine only grew more ominous.At 1:40 p.m., 15 minutes before the crash, Allison King texted her fianc\u00e9.\u201cShe said the brakes were burning and they were coasting,\u201d her mother said.Four minutes before the fatal accident, Ms. Jackson texted her mother-in-law who was taking care of her daughters, Archer, 4, and Elle, 16 months.\u201cShe was checking to see how the girls were doing,\u201d according to her mother.The stretch of road heading toward the site of the accident is an unbroken, mile-long decline from the top of a ridge north of Schoharie. A family farm sits at the crest, with a pond and a paddle boat. Signs warn about its steepness and no trucks are allowed. About halfway down, the road narrows and curves.Traveling down might take a minute at the posted speed limit: 55 miles per hour. But it is easy to pick up speed \u2014 brake lights are on for most drivers going down the hill. There\u2019s a final turn where the Apple Barrel comes into sight, a steady line of traffic on Route 30A going east and west.

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Winning the Social Media Midterms?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "Advertisement\nAfter President Trump\u2019s popularity on social media helped propel him to an upset victory in 2016, Democrats vowed to catch up.Two years later, their efforts appear to be paying off.A New York Times analysis of data from the Facebook and Instagram accounts of hundreds of candidates in next month\u2019s midterm elections reveals that Democrats \u2014 and especially Democrats running for House seats \u2014 enjoy a sizable national lead in engagement on the two influential platforms.In Most House Races, Democrats Had More Facebook Interactions Than Their OpponentsMINNESOTA\u2019S 8th DISTRICTOutlined circles indicate the most competitive races.WISCONSIN\u2019S 1st DISTRICTFLORIDA\u2019S 27th DISTRICTTEXAS\u2019 7th DISTRICTWISCONSIN\u2019S 1st DISTRICTOutlined circles indicate the most competitive races.FLORIDA\u2019S 27thDISTRICTTEXAS\u2019 7th DISTRICTME-2UT-4VA-2NM-2FL-27FL-26RepublicanDemocratCompetitive race= 15,000 more Facebook interactions than opponentBut the analysis of the engagement data, which includes all non-advertising content, also shows that Republicans in many closely contested races for Senate and governor are faring better on Facebook than their Democratic challengers.The data, collected from more than 53,000 posts by more than 1,100 accounts, reflects a month\u2019s worth of social media activity by nearly all of the Republican and Democratic candidates running for House, Senate or governor this year. The data, which covers 30 days ending Oct. 15, was gathered using a Facebook-owned tool called CrowdTangle. The tool counts the number of times users comment on, react to or share a user\u2019s posts, a measure of popularity known as  \u201ctotal interactions.\u201dThe data includes public posts made by candidates on Facebook and Instagram. It does not include paid ads unless those ads began as organic, non-paid posts that were subsequently \u201cboosted\u201d using Facebook\u2019s advertising tools. It also does not include activity on private accounts, or posts made visible only to specific groups of followers. In instances where candidates had an official government account as well as a campaign account, both accounts were included in the calculations. In some instances, politicians who are independent, but who caucus with Democrats or Republicans, were included on those parties\u2019 lists.Together, the data amounts to a revealing picture of how those candidates\u2019 messages are resonating with a digital audience, and how social media activity both mirrors and departs from more traditional polling methods.It also shows that Democrats often dominate the conversation on Instagram, but Republican candidates are finding their biggest audiences on Facebook, the largest and most influential social network.Measuring total interactions on social media is an imperfect way to gauge a candidate\u2019s electoral chances, in part because it does not distinguish between types of engagement. A negative comment left on a Republican candidate\u2019s page by an angry Democrat would still count as an interaction, for example. In addition, it does not account for the fact that some candidates have more followers than others.\u201cFacebook is the most widespread platform, and for campaigns, it\u2019s like broadcast television,\u201d said Tim Lim, a Democratic digital consultant. \u201cYou have so much reach, and so many ad units, and probably more eyeballs than anywhere else.\u201dAt the national level, Democrats on Facebook and Instagram appear to be winning the battle for social media supremacy in a landslide.Interactions with posts on candidates\u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day periodSenate candidates10mDemocratsRepublicans2.2mHouse candidates3.5mDemocratsRepublicans1.5mGubernatorial candidates1.6mDemocratsRepublicans1.7mInteractions with posts on candidates\u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day periodSenate candidates10mDemocratsRepublicans2.2mHouse candidates3.5mDemocratsRepublicans1.5mGubernatorial candidates1.6mDemocratsRepublicans1.7mDemocrats running for House, Senate and governor\u2019s seats in this fall\u2019s elections received a combined 15.1 million interactions on Facebook in the 30-day period, roughly three times the 5.4 million interactions received by Republican candidates.Jonathan Strauss, a former advisor to Democratic campaigns who is now head of product at Swing Left, said that investments made by Democrats after Mr. Trump\u2019s election were paying dividends.\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx anything, but we\u2019re definitely doing a lot better than 2016,\u201d Mr. Strauss said.Democrats\u2019 national success on social media may not translate to the \u201cblue wave\u201d many liberals are hoping for in November.That\u2019s because much of the left\u2019s firepower is concentrated among a few of its high-profile candidates \u2014 namely, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and the Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has more than 600,000 followers on Facebook and Twitter and more than 250,000 on Instagram.Interactions with posts on Senate candidates\u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day periodDemocractic candidatesBernie Sanders6mBeto O'Rourke1.6mElizabeth Warren940kAll others1.4mRepublican candidatesOpponents of Democratslisted above916kAll others1.3mInteractions with posts on Senate candidates\u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day periodDemocractic candidatesBernie Sanders6m1.6mBeto O'RourkeElizabeth Warren940kAll others1.4mRepublican candidatesOpponents of Democratslisted above916k1.3mAll othersOf those candidates, only Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running in a competitive race this year.During the 30-day period, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. O\u2019Rourke accounted for 86 percent of Democratic Senate candidates\u2019 Facebook interactions and 92 percent of their Instagram interactions.If you strip away those three Democrats and their challengers, the left\u2019s social media advantage in Senate races virtually disappears.Excluding Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and their challengers, Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied, with Democrats getting only about 8 percent more Facebook interactions over the 30-day period.Part of the popularity of Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. O\u2019Rourke on social media is their political personas, which are punchy, passionate and tailor-made to resonate with fired-up progressive audiences online. They also have dedicated digital staff members and sophisticated tools to create custom content and test various messages for impact.Smaller campaigns often have fewer resources devoted to digital campaigning, and few have captured the attention of huge online audiences.\u201cWe only have one Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d said Mr. Lim, the Democratic consultant. \u201cIn reality, we should have 20 Beto O\u2019Rourkes.\u201dIn addition to revealing which candidates are finding the biggest audiences online, the data also hints at the partisan balance of each network.Interactions with posts on candidates\u2019 Instagramaccounts over the 30-day periodSenate candidatesDemocrats5.4mRepublicans213kGubernatorial candidatesDemocrats640kRepublicans270kInteractions with posts on candidates\u2019 Instagram accounts over the 30-day periodSenate candidatesDemocrats5.4mRepublicans213kGubernatorial candidatesDemocrats640kRepublicans270kInstagram, the Facebook-owned photo app, has a younger and more progressive crowd than its parent company\u2019s namesake social network.In the past 30 days, the number of interactions on Democrats' Instagram accounts dwarfed those on Republican accounts. These interactions were again led by Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, whose posts received a combined 5.2 million favorites and comments in the past 30 days.Instagram, by contrast, is most popular with users between ages 18 and 29, who tend to vote for Democrats.Of course, not all midterm races matter equally.The social media activity in races rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report, an independent election analyst, mirrors many recent polls, which show a slight edge for Republicans in the Senate and an edge for Democrats in the House.In five of the nine toss-up Senate races, Republicans received more interactions on Facebook than Democrats.Competitive Senate races in which Republicans\u2019 Facebook pages had moreinteractions over the 30-day periodTennesseeMarsha Blackburn138kPhil Bredesen123IndianaMike Braun92kJoe Donnelly55MissouriJosh Hawley51kClaire McCaskill38NevadaDean Heller29kJacky Rosen20ArizonaMartha McSally31kKyrsten Sinema23Competitive Senate races in which Democrats\u2019 Facebook pages had moreinteractions over the 30-day periodTexasTed Cruz820kBeto O'Rourke1.6mFloridaRick Scott102kBill Nelson105North DakotaKevin Cramer23kHeidi Heitkamp96MontanaMatt Rosendale34kJon Tester54Close Senate races in which Republicans\u2019 Facebookpages had more interactions over the 30-day periodTennesseeMarsha Blackburn138kPhil Bredesen123IndianaMike Braun92kJoe Donnelly55MissouriJosh Hawley51kClaire McCaskill38NevadaDean Heller29kJacky Rosen20ArizonaMartha McSally31kKyrsten Sinema23Close Senate races in which Democrats\u2019 Facebookpages had more interactions over the 30-day periodTexasTed Cruz820kBeto O'Rourke1.6mFloridaRick Scott102kBill Nelson105North DakotaKevin Cramer23kHeidi Heitkamp96MontanaMatt Rosendale34kJon Tester54In Tennessee\u2019s Senate race, for example, Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican who is leading in the polls by a slight margin, got 77,000 more interactions on Facebook over the 30-day period than Phil Bredesen, her Democratic opponent.

Of the 31 House races listed as toss-ups by Cook Political Report, Democratic candidates received more interactions than their Republican opponents in 23 of them.Candidates from both parties appear to have benefited from the late September fervor surrounding the contentious confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh, which galvanized conservatives in his favor and created a surge in left-wing support for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault.But Republicans in close races appear to have benefited slightly more from a \u201cKavanaugh bump\u201d than Democrats.In Indiana\u2019s Senate race, Mike Braun, the Republican running against the incumbent Democrat, Joe Donnelly, was trailing Mr. Donnelly in Facebook interactions for the two weeks leading up to Sept. 27, the day that Dr. Blasey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.For nearly three weeks following the testimony, Mr. Braun led Mr. Donnelly on Facebook by a significant margin.50kFacebook interactions40kWeek ofBlasey-KavanaughhearingChristine Blasey Ford identified30k20k10kSen.

Among the nine most competitive Senate races, interactions on Facebook for Republicans rose by 94 percent during the week of Sept. 30.

All three depend on the kingdom for revenue.Mr. Dimon, Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event, the two people said. The three executives and their staffs reached out to the Treasury Department and urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press for the event to be postponed or to publicly make his attendance conditional on more disclosure from the Saudis about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Mr. Dimon\u2019s decision follows those of Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, Bill Ford of Ford Motor and other C.E.O.s.

Saudi officials deny any involvement.Alongside the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Lampert stepped down as Sears\u2019s C.E.O. but will remain chairman.

In Representative Devin Nunes\u2019s district, California\u2019s 22nd, both candidates raised enormous sums even though Mr. Nunes, a Republican, has been widely considered safe by political watchers. Mr. Nunes raised about $3.2 million while his challenger, Andrew Janz, raked in $4.4 million. Mr. Nunes, however, had more than $5 million left in his campaign chest as of Sept. 30.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)With luxury housing developments in the works, including a $1.4 billion, 815-unit tower, the district is \u201cneck deep\u201d in gentrification and facing \u201chyper-development,\u201d said Tomie Arai, an activist and a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade.But both heritage enterprises and new establishments are working to balance change and tradition to maintain the neighborhood\u2019s cultural authenticity.\u201cI am giving back to Chinatown and the city of San Francisco,\u201d one business owner said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until I die.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Disinformation Spreads on WhatsApp Ahead of Brazilian Election", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFernando Haddad, Brazil\u2019s presidential candidate for the Workers Party. Political messages on WhatsApp have targeted voters ahead of Brazil\u2019s fiercely contested presidential election.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the past few months, the 120 million Brazilians who use WhatsApp, the smartphone messaging application that is owned by Facebook, have been deluged with political messages.One popular WhatsApp message displayed the name of a presidential candidate, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, next to the number 17. When Brazilians vote, they punch in a number for a candidate or party in an electronic voting machine.But the information in the photo was wrong. The number 17 was for Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s party. Mr. da Silva was no longer even in the race. His running mate, Fernando Haddad, had taken his place. Brazil\u2019s top electoral court ruled on Aug. 31 that Mr. da Silva, who is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption, cannot run for a third term.Whether the tide of disinformation can be curbed before the election is a crucial test for Facebook, WhatsApp\u2019s parent company. As the midterm elections in the United States grow closer, Facebook sees its handling of Brazil\u2019s election issues as a way to convince the public that it is far more prepared to deal with organized disinformation campaigns than it was before the presidential election two years ago.WhatsApp presents particular challenges for people trying to prevent disinformation, which is usually spread among small groups of up to 256 people, lending it a sense of authenticity.Jair Bolsonaro, a presidential candidate in Brazil, has played on the distrust of politics in the country.The app is also an end-to-end encrypted service, which means outsiders cannot see what is in a message \u2014 including WhatsApp and Facebook. That makes it impossible to determine the true amount of false news. Fact-checkers cannot rebut viral hoaxes and misinformation they cannot see.It does not help that many Brazilians view the work of the fact-checkers as part of a nefarious effort by big corporations like Facebook to shield Brazilians from the truth.\u201cWhen we do the debunking, a lot of times people just don\u2019t trust the debunk,\u201d said Leonardo Cazes, an editor working on the \u201cFato ou Fake\u201d news literacy project with O Globo, a Brazilian newspaper.Brazilian authorities began warning about the threat posed by online disinformation months ago. False and misleading information had already been landing on the phone screens of Brazilians with startling regularity.There were doctored photos and videos edited out of context. There were stories exaggerating Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s heroism and spreading rumors about his rivals. There were conspiracy theories promoting the rumor that Mr. Bolsonaro, who was stabbed at a rally in September, had faked his own injuries as part of a preplanned stunt.There were even accusations that George Soros, the liberal billionaire and activist who has become a lightning rod for conservatives around the world, was funding attempts to interfere in the elections.\u201cPeople entered this election with a sense of hyperpolarization,\u201d said Roberta Braga, an associate director at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cThere is a lot of distrust in politics and politicians and political establishments in general.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, who has earned many comparisons to President Trump, has played on that distrust. He has been an avid user of social media, recording daily Facebook live videos in which he implored his followers to help him \u201cmake Brazil great.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign, as well as those of competitors like Mr. Haddad, have long been suspected of spreading the misleading photos, said Fabr\u00edcio Benevenuto, a computer science professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil and the co-author of a new report on disinformation in the country.On Friday, WhatsApp said it would take legal action against the tactics, banning accounts across the service and sending cease-and-desist orders to the companies responsible.The spread of disinformation has been helped by the basic design of WhatsApp. Information shared across messaging services like WhatsApp is generally trusted more, researchers argue, because of the personal, private nature of the closed conversations.Experts, however, are skeptical that disinformation can be stemmed before the election.\u201cEven if there is an order to give someone a fine for spreading fake news, by the time you do that, it\u2019s gone, the elections are over,\u201d said Fernando Neisser, who coordinates the Brazilian Academy of Electoral and Political Law. \u201cNo one is ready to deal with the speed and the volume of this fake news problem.\u201dSamidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook\u2019s elections and civic engagement team, said the new setup had been helpful. A number of attempts at voter suppression and hate speech targeted at specific geographic areas have been quashed in a matter of hours, he said.WhatsApp is testing changes to the way its service operates. It has cut down the number of users messages that can be forwarded from 256 to 20. (In India, the limit is five.) And WhatsApp has introduced a print, television and radio advertising campaign in Brazil to reach an estimated 50 million people with tips on how to spot misinformation.WhatsApp is also working with Comprova, a consortium of Brazilian media organizations, to fact-check thousands of tips about suspicious information and verify true stories. The group has received more than 100,000 messages to vet. \u201cFato ou Fake,\u201d the news literacy project, has vetted more than 700 pieces of information.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an electoral court judge in Brazil.

There\u2019s always the survivors clutching each other, weeping in little clumps outside. And there\u2019s always one other thing.A lonely man.There\u2019s always one guy, who fell through the cracks of society, who lived a life of solitary disappointment and who one day decided to try to make a blood-drenched leap from insignificance to infamy.Guys like that are drawn to extremist ideologies, which explain their disappointments and give them a sense that they are connected to something. Guys like that convince themselves that by massacring the innocents they are serving as a warrior in some righteous cause.These mass killings are about many things \u2014 guns, demagogy, etc. \u2014 but they are also about social isolation and the spreading derangement of the American mind.Killing sprees are just one manifestation of the fact that millions of Americans find themselves isolated and alone. But there are other manifestations of this isolation, which involve far more carnage.The suicide epidemic is a manifestation. The suicide rate is dropping across Europe. But it has risen by 30 percent in the United States so far this century. The suicide rate for Americans between 10 and 17 rose by more than 70 percent between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 surely one of the most shocking trends in America today.Every year nearly 45,000 Americans respond to isolation and despair by ending their lives. Every year an additional 60,000 die of drug addiction. Nearly twice as many Americans die each year of these two maladies as were killed in the entire Vietnam War.The rising levels of depression and mental health issues are yet another manifestation. People used to say that depression and other mental health challenges were primarily about chemical imbalances in the brain.\u201cProtracted loneliness causes you to shut down socially, and to be more suspicious of any social contact,\u201d Hari writes. \u201cYou become hypervigilant. You start to be more likely to take offense where none was intended, and to be afraid of strangers. You start to be afraid of the very thing you need most.\u201dThis sounds like a pretty good summary of American politics in 2018.I keep coming back to this topic because the chief struggle of the day is sociological and psychological, not ideological or economic. The substrate layer of American society \u2014 the network of relationships and connection and trust that everything else relies upon \u2014 is failing. And the results are as bloody as any war.Maybe it\u2019s time we began to see this as a war. On the one side are those forces that sow division, discord and isolation. On the other side there are all those forces in society that nurture attachment, connection and solidarity. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re witnessing this vast showdown between the rippers and weavers.And here\u2019s the hard part of the war: It\u2019s not between one group of good people and another group of bad people. The war runs down the middle of every heart. Most of us are part of the problem we complain about.Most of us bought into a radical individualism that, as Tocqueville predicted, cuts each secluded self off from other secluded selves. Most of us buy into a workaholic ethos that leaves us with little time for community. Most of us live in insular media and social bubbles that provide us with Pravda-like affirmations of our own moral superiority. Most of us hew to a code of privacy that leads us to not know our neighbors.The good news is that most of us are part of the solution as well. Most of us admire and want to be the teacher who reaches out to the lonely boy. Most of us mentor and serve people unlike ourselves. Most of us are part of the chosen families that Americans are constructing to replace the decimated biological ones.It\u2019s easier to destroy trust than to build it, so the rippers have an advantage. But there are many more weavers, people who yearn to live in loving relationships and trusting communities. The weavers just need what any side in a war needs: training so we know how to wage it, strategies so we know how to win it and a call to arms so we know why we\u2019re in it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palestinian Kills 2 Israelis in West Bank Attack", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A Palestinian man fatally shot two Israeli co-workers and injured a third in an Israeli-run factory in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, an attack that Israeli officials described as terrorism.The killings shattered the calm in an industrial park long praised by Israelis as a symbol of peaceful coexistence.Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, praised the attack without taking responsibility for it, calling it a \u201cheroic operation.\u201d Hamas said the shooting had been a \u201cnatural response to the crimes of the Israeli occupation against the rights of our people, in all the Palestinian lands.\u201dThe Islamic Jihad group in Gaza also praised the attack.The gunman, identified by the Israeli authorities only as Ashraf Naalwa, 23, a resident of the West Bank, was captured on security cameras fleeing the scene. Mr. Naalwa, an electrician, had not shown up for work in recent days and might have harbored grievances against his employers, according to other workers in the industrial park, near the settlements of Barkan and Ariel in the central West Bank.The Israeli military and the Israeli security agency known as Shin Bet said they had determined the assault was a terrorist attack, while allowing that the assailant may also have had personal motives.The Israeli authorities pointed to a message on Facebook that the suspect had apparently posted before the attack as one indication that he was not out only for personal vengeance. According to the Israeli news media, he suggested in the post that he had been called by Allah.\u201cThis was not only an attack on innocent people going about their daily lives,\u201d President Reuven Rivlin of Israel said in a statement. \u201cIt was also an attack on the possibility of Israelis and Palestinians coexisting peacefully.\u201dLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, described the suspect as \u201carmed and considered dangerous,\u201d and said the military was searching for him and taking measures to prevent further attacks.The Israelis who were killed were identified as Kim Levengrond Yehezkel, 28, a secretary, and Ziv Hagbi, 35, an accountant. Both worked for the Alon Group, a company producing waste management systems. The name of the third victim was not released.Unlike Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed scores of Palestinians during often-violent protests along the border fence in recent months, the West Bank has remained relatively calm. Analysts have warned of a spillover of tensions, however.Israeli forces shot and killed three Palestinians on Friday, including Fares Hafez al-Sersawi, a 12-year-old boy, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Last month, a Palestinian teenager fatally stabbed Ari Fuld, a resident of the West Bank settlement of Efrat, at the Gush Etzion shopping center. Mr. Fuld, who was well known for his pro-Israel advocacy, was hailed as a hero by many Israelis for possibly helping to save other lives after security cameras showed him chasing and shooting at his assailant after being stabbed in the back.Colonel Conricus said that the assailant on Sunday appeared to have acted alone, operating without the backing of any known organization, and that he had been armed with an improvised weapon known as a Carlo. Named after the Swedish-made Carl Gustav submachine gun from the 1950s, Carlos are sometimes adapted from air guns in West Bank workshops.The West Bank settlements, constructed in territory that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, and which the Palestinians envision as part of their state, are considered a violation of international law by most of the world.But many Israelis, particularly the settler leadership, hold up the Barkan industrial park, where the attack took place on Sunday, as a model of cooperation and an important source of employment for thousands of Palestinians, who work in more than 150 factories and firms alongside an equal number of Israelis for equal salaries.Moshe Lev-Ran, an export manager at Twitto Plus, a company specializing in air-conditioning accessories and whose factory is next to the site of the attack, told reporters that the Palestinian employees \u201ccome happily to work because we provide them with a future and food.\u201dDescribing annual company fun days and barbecues, he added, \u201cI call it the island of peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A large number of Indians wondered why Aadhaar was being made mandatory and why the federal officials insisted the data collected through the program was safe despite evidence to the contrary. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment barring companies from seeking Aadhaar numbers is likely to lull the Indian middle class into believing that it has won and to slow down the movement against the invasive nature of Aadhaar and the government\u2019s attitude toward privacy and surveillance in general. Hours after the judgment, Arun Jaitley, India\u2019s finance minister, told reporters that it would be wrong to assume that sections struck down in the judgment \u201care perpetually prohibited.\u201d The government argued that Aadhaar enabled it to subvert fraud in the delivery of welfare, curb money laundering, thwart terrorism and achieve efficiency. But these justifications did not convincingly explain why Aadhaar was demanded by schools, colleges, hospitals and insurance companies.And what of technology\u2019s detrimental effects? After the judgment, Nikhil Dey, a labor rights and information rights activist who challenged the project in court, gave voice to longstanding frustrations of economists, activists and researchers who work in villages when he wished that Aadhaar \u201chad been made mandatory for something that affected the middle class the way the poor have been affected for the last four to five years.\u201dThe idea of Indians identifying themselves to participate online is a dangerous one. Anonymity in India is, as anywhere else, crucial to free expression. Indeed, it becomes particularly more important in places like India, where tolerance for free expression is low. People have been arrested for making jokes on social media and cartoonists have faced charges of sedition.Although the Supreme Court upheld the Aadhaar program, Justice Chandrachud\u2019s dissenting judgment is of great importance. It articulated the nature of the relationship between technology and power and that the collection of citizens\u2019 personal information at Aadhaar\u2019s scale could be used for surveillance.

{"Headline": "Brazil Election: Jair Bolsonaro Heads to Runoff After Missing Outright Win", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A far-right candidate who has spoken fondly of Brazil\u2019s onetime military dictatorship came close to an outright victory in the country\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, as Brazilians expressed disgust with politics as usual and endorsed an iron-fisted approach to fighting crime and corruption.Voters delivered a first-round victory to Jair Bolsonaro, who had stunned the political establishment by rising to the top of a crowded presidential field despite a long history of offensive remarks about women, blacks and gays.With 99.9 percent of votes tallied, Mr. Bolsonaro had 46 percent of the vote; he needed 50 percent to avoid a runoff. His nearest rival finished far behind, with 29 percent.With the presidency in sight, Mr. Bolsonaro said Sunday night he intended to unite a nation that is \u201con the brink of chaos\u201d and said, \u201cTogether we will rebuild our Brazil.\u201dBrazilians will now vote in the runoff election on Oct. 28 between Mr. Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad, the leftist Workers\u2019 Party candidate. The two men represent radically different visions for Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, where leftists have won the presidency in every election since 2002.However strongly Mr. Bolsonaro performed on Sunday, he remains an extremely divisive figure who alienated large segments of Brazil\u2019s highly diverse population during the campaign.But political analysts said Sunday night that Mr. Haddad faces a daunting task in the second round to rally a majority of Brazilians to his side.Laura Carvalho, an economist at University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the best bet for the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s candidate would be to focus on pocketbook issues over the next three weeks. \u201cInstead of focusing on racism and misogyny, which did not have much effect, they should focus on the economic agenda and the anti-worker aspect of the Bolsonaro candidacy,\u201d Ms. Carvalho said.While several of Brazil\u2019s neighbors have steered to the right politically in recent years, a victory by Mr. Bolsonaro, a populist conservative who stands to join a growing roster of anti-establishment leaders around the world, would be a seismic conservative shift.Critics of Mr. Bolsonaro and political analysts have watched his rise with alarm, fearing he could become an authoritarian leader in the mold of Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.Rejected by mainstream parties, Mr. Bolsonaro struggled to find a running mate until early August, when he picked a recently retired general who has advocated military intervention as a means to purge a corrupt ruling elite. He has said he intends to appoint other military leaders to central roles.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s first-round victory was all the more remarkable because he lacked the backing of a major party and campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying mainly on social media to build a base. As of mid-September, the Bolsonaro campaign reported having spent about $235,000, a small fraction of the $6.3 million the Haddad campaign disclosed having spent.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise was enabled by the political divisions that have torn the country apart in recent years.Brazilians were outraged as leaders of the traditional parties become ensnared in an ever-widening corruption investigation that began in 2014 and became ever more despondent as the economy sputtered, joblessness grew and crime soared.While some voters remained loyal to the Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 which governed from 2003 to 2016 \u2014 for its efforts to improve the lives of poor and working-class Brazilians, many came to hold it responsible for the graft and economic hardship of recent years.Georgewlany Smith, a 61-year-old public servant in Rio de Janeiro, said that an erosion of democratic norms and civil liberties is a price he is willing to pay for a more secure and prosperous Brazil.\u201cYou have to consider what were the best times for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Smith said shortly after he voted for Mr. Bolsonaro in the upscale Barra de Tijuca district. \u201cUnfortunately it was the dictatorship.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro has tapped into the simmering anger and desire for disruption of the status quo that has gripped many Brazilians. And he became the face of a growing conservative movement in a nation where evangelicals account for one in four voters and more than 90 federal lawmakers.The candidate offered little in the way of a detailed policy road map \u2014 particularly regarding the country\u2019s floundering economy. When pressed with questions, he offered up Paulo Guedes, a market-friendly economist he said he would appoint as finance minister to curtail the social spending that grew under the Workers\u2019 Party.The markets rallied as he took the lead in polls \u2014 but Mr. Bolsonaro is \u201cnot the pro-market liberal he pretends to be,\u201d warned Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist who heads the Latin American Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University.\u201cHe really stands out for having overly simplistic solutions to very complex problems, a characteristic that will certainly backfire,\u201d she said.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory will most likely be denounced by many on the left as the undemocratic outcome of an election that excluded the towering politician in recent Brazilian history: former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a rousing former steelworker and union leader who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s opposing the military dictatorship.Mr. da Silva, who served two terms and left office in 2011 with a record-high approval rating, was the front-runner for much of the past year and appeared well positioned to return to the presidential palace. But he became ineligible to run for office after an appeals court early this year upheld a corruption and money laundering conviction against him.Mr. Haddad, 55, who comes across as an earnest intellectual and lacks Mr. da Silva\u2019s fiery charisma, was unknown in much of the country and failed to galvanize core Workers\u2019 Party voters who had identified with Mr. da Silva\u2019s working-class roots and life story.Some voters remain fiercely loyal to Mr. da Silva, though.Anita Silva Lima, a 38-year-old waitress who lives in Rocinha, a low-income neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, said on Sunday morning that she and her seven immediate relatives had voted for \u201cLula\u2019s candidate,\u201d resisting pressure from her boss, who urged her to back Mr. Bolsonaro.\u201cI don\u2019t want a dictatorship \u2014 a lot of people died then,\u201d said Ms. Lima, who is originally from the impoverished northeast, a Workers\u2019 Party stronghold. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this corruption talk. Tell me the name of a politician who doesn\u2019t steal? Bolsonaro steals, too.\u201dOthers have lost faith in the Workers\u2019 Party and feel the current race leaves them with no good options.\u201cThey are all the same,\u201d said Carlos Alberto da Silva, a 59-year-old driver in Rio de Janeiro who supported the Workers\u2019 Party in 2014 and said he intended to signal his frustration by spoiling his ballot this year.Among the striking surprises of Sunday\u2019s election was the defeat of former President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers\u2019 Party, who was running for the Senate. Public opinion polls had suggested she would easily win a seat in her home state of Minas Gerais, but Ms. Rousseff came in fourth.Clara Ara\u00fajo, a sociologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said voters showed a strong disdain for the dominant political factions on Sunday.\u201cThe dissatisfaction over the economic crisis, it seems to me, was channeled along with a discourse about conservative morals,\u201d she said. Those who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro, she said, saw him as \u201cthe option for a certain order, a certain stability, even if this notion was based on easy ways out.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro warned voters that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would perpetuate a culture of graft that has been exposed in recent years and has tainted every large political party and several of the country\u2019s top companies.He also contended that under leftist rule, Brazil risked stumbling into an economic crisis like the one that has sparked a mass exodus in neighboring Venezuela.As most of his dozen rivals traveled around the country and participated in debates, Mr. Bolsonaro largely sat out the final month of the race recovering in a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo and later at his home in Rio de Janeiro.In recent days he has recorded daily videos broadcast live on Facebook weighing in on the news of the day. The unscripted, shaky clips were illustrative of a campaign that had an insurgent, improvisational feel from the start.As a Bolsonaro victory appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents protested online and in the streets under the motto: #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him, warning that the country\u2019s democratic institutions could be eroded.But influential evangelical and agribusiness lobbies rallied to his side in the final stretch, while investors and wealthy Brazilians backed him, believing that Mr. Bolsonaro would curtail social spending and implement market-friendly reforms.Outside Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s beachfront apartment in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, supporters sang the national anthem and chanted \u201cthe captain has arrived\u201d as the first results showed him winning by a large margin.\u201cGetting rid of the P.T. alone is not a solution, but it\u2019s a first step toward fixing the country,\u201d said Barbara Laureano, a 25-year-old business woman, referring to the Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cThis is not about him as a person, it\u2019s about an idea,\u201d she said.Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

About 5 percent say they feel most connected to humanity as a whole. A vast majority of the rest say their strongest attachment is to the local \u2014 their neighborhood or town.And yet I have to say my strongest attachment is to the nation, to the United States. You could take New York out of my identity and I\u2019d be sort of the same. If you took America out of my identity I\u2019d be unrecognizable to myself.What does this national attachment feel like? It feels a bit like any other kind of love \u2014 a romantic love, or a love between friends. It is not one thing that you love but the confluence of a hundred things. Yes, it is the beauty of the Rockies, but it is not just the land. It is the Declaration of Independence, but not just the creed. It\u2019s winning World War II and Silicon Valley, but it is not just the accomplishments. It is the craziness, the diversity, our particular brand of madness.The 19th-century French philosopher Ernest Renan argued that \u201ca nation is a soul, a spiritual principle\u201d: \u201cThese are the essential conditions of being a people: having common glories in the past and a will to continue them in the present; having made great things together and wishing to make them again. One loves in proportion to the sacrifices that one has committed and the troubles that one has suffered.\u201dWhen I think of the great American nationalists, I think of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, A. Philip Randolph and Walt Whitman, of course, but also the wild mixed-up urge that seizes millions to sacrifice, in sometimes opposite ways, for the common good: Gloria Steinem as much as Phyllis Schlafly, those who stand for the anthem and those who kneel.Love for nation is an expanding love because it is love for the whole people. It\u2019s an ennobling love because it comes with the urge to hospitality \u2014 to share what you love and to want to make more love by extending it to others.In a family you can feel when love is stretched and broken. And you can feel the same thing in the nation. Today, when bombs are sent and vitriol follows, our common American nationalism, our mutual loyalty, is under strain.It\u2019s threatened by extreme individualism \u2014 people who put the needs of the individual above the needs of the community. It\u2019s threatened by globalists \u2014 people whose hearts have been bleached of the particular love of place. The greatest threats come from those who claim to be nationalists but who are the opposite.Donald Trump says he is a nationalist, but you can\u2019t be a nationalist if you despise half the nation \u2014 any more than you can be a good father if you despise half your children. You can\u2019t be a nationalist if you think that groups in the nation are in a zero-sum conflict with one another \u2014 class against class, race against race, tribe against tribe.You can\u2019t be a nationalist if you despise diversity. America is diversity; if you don\u2019t love diversity, you are not an American nationalist.\u201cWe have chased metaphysical and theological abstractions from politics. What now remains?\u201d Renan asked. People remain. People with their same old need for belonging. People with their same old need to dedicate their lives to something, but with the great unifying object of love \u2014 the nation \u2014 taken away.If you stop the love songs to America, take the celebration of America out of public life, you leave people spiritually bereft, robbed of a great devotion. The results are what you see \u2014 loss of connection, a tendency to catastrophize, feelings of anger, isolation and powerlessness. People begin to feel that the injustices in American society are the whole and there is no hope of redemption. They get the urge to burn everything down.American nationalism has been one of the great joys, comforts and motivators of my life. I don\u2019t know how anybody can live without it.Advertisement"}

They don\u2019t even define \u201cinsider trading.\u201d We have a way to fix that.Mr. Bharara is a former United States attorney. Mr. Jackson is a Securities and Exchange commissioner.America\u2019s insider trading laws are hopelessly out of date. As a result, fraudsters have evaded law enforcement scrutiny, and honest market participants are sometimes confused about the rules of the road. Insider trading cases are of special significance. They are a manifestation of America\u2019s basic bargain: that the well-connected should not have unfair advantages over the everyday citizen. When regulators and prosecutors make a commitment to punish insider trading, it sends a message that you don\u2019t need special access to make an honest buck. Fighting insider trading is a refusal to accept a rigged system. But the truth is, we often struggle to hold bad actors accountable for insider trading. In large part, that\u2019s because our insider trading laws do not clearly define what the standard is.The result is a legal haziness that leaves both investors and defendants unclear about what sorts of information-sharing or other activities by investors would be considered insider trading, and what are the acceptable forms of data-gathering and research that are part of any healthy, functioning financial marketplace.The government\u2019s commitment to fairness should be unambiguous. But, while the government has brought many strong insider trading cases, a good bit of insider trading law remains ambiguous.That\u2019s why we are announcing the creation of the Bharara Task Force on Insider Trading, a panel of experts that will propose new insider trading reforms to protect American investors.The task force will be led by Mr. Bharara and will consist of eight distinguished former regulators and prosecutors, judges, academics and defense lawyers who have agreed to put forth concrete proposals to update the insider trading law.

The day we meet, in early October, the co-host of \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d is wearing pumps in a plaid felt material, like a Scottish kilt, that match her tricycle-red sheath dress. She is 5 foot 10 and carrying an iridescent bucket of a handbag that she periodically digs through, excavating her iPhone to show me photos of Tina Turner, whom she\u2019d just interviewed in Zurich, and of the disappointing eyelash extensions for which she\u2019d just paid $189. The whole idea behind \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d when it premiered, in 2012, was that it would be a beacon of seriousness in the silly sea of a.m. TV news. Set in front of Walter Cronkite\u2019s iconic map, the program was anchored by Ms. King; Charlie Rose, then of PBS News and wooden-table fame; and Norah O\u2019Donnell, previously the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent. The broadcast would have no workout demos or clumsy attempts at dancing, no gimmicky test kitchens or celebrity stunts.The industry scoffed. NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d were ratings behemoths. Did the harried millions who watched TV in the morning, as they cleaned up O.J. spills and packed school lunches, really want hard news? What would that even look like?Soon enough, we got the answer. Ms. King established a distinct brand of news delivery: chatty but not snarky, empathetic but not sappy. By 2017, the King-Rose-O\u2019Donnell formula was working, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d was regularly catching up with the competition, and Ms. King was being hailed for her own talents \u2014 no longer a sidekick.But in the past year, Ms. King\u2019s apparent triumph has collided with accusations of sexual misconduct against CBS\u2019s executives. In the swirl of #MeToo, perhaps no woman has found herself at the center of the storm quite like Ms. King. Millions of viewers have watched, again and again, as she and Ms. O\u2019Donnell have had to explain \u2014 live on air \u2014 the alleged misdeeds of executives at their own network.Ms. Winfrey returned to her normal tone. \u201cI said, \u2018Girl, pull it together!\u2019\u201dBy the time I contacted Ms. King to get a meal and talk about her career and #MeToo and how, at 63 years old, she is no longer just known as Ms. Winfrey\u2019s bestie, people had started to stop her on the street to offer condolences, like somebody had died.Ms. King has chided CBS and called for full transparency in its investigation into Mr. Moonves. She has said emphatically that she supports and believes his and Mr. Rose\u2019s accusers. But Ms. King also believes that \u201cyou can hold two ideas in your head at the same time.\u201d That is, you can believe and empathize with the women, but also think that not all men accused of wrongdoing should be banished for life.I asked Ms. King if redemption was possible for some of the #MeToo men. \u201cAmy, murderers are walking around,\u201d Ms. King said flatly. \u201cPeople who kill people are walking around. They might not be able to get [their] jobs back, but surely there must be room for some redemption somewhere.\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is to that, and it might be too soon. Maybe people don\u2019t want to hear that.\u201dAs for Mr. Rose? \u201cI don\u2019t know what his second act is, but Charlie is a very smart guy. Do I see him coming back to CBS? No.\u201dShe hasn\u2019t been shy about the fact that she remains close with Mr. Rose. \u201cI know there are two sides to every story, that\u2019s what I know,\u201d she said. The day we met at Norma\u2019s, Ms. King had just called Mr. Rose to check in after he\u2019d had a health scare. Mr. Rose is her friend and friendship is important to Ms. King, who for most of her life was known only as the professional best friend to America\u2019s best TV friend.\u201cShe lives strong,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said. \u201cHer friendships are strong and so, you know, when this happened, she said, \u2018I feel terrible, but I don\u2019t think you abandon people when they make a mistake.\u2019 You certainly don\u2019t abandon them when they\u2019re down and everybody else is turning away from them.\u201dMr. Rose has not given an interview since his termination, but in late October, I emailed him, figuring he might make an exception for Ms. King. He replied promptly. \u201cHallelujah,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe Sunday Times is profiling Gayle, there is a God in Heaven.\u201d After that, Mr. Rose \u2014 who regardless of what you now think of him knows what makes a good interview \u2014 worried that whatever he said about his former co-host would sound so \u201cover the top in unadulterated admiration\u201d that it would be unusable. I told him to give it a try.We met for lunch in a booth at Gabriel\u2019s, on the Upper West Side. Over a pillowy pasta dish that the owner had chosen for us, Mr. Rose tried to explain what it was about Ms. King that he admired so much. \u201cShe loves being Gayle King and all that goes with it,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sacrifice or a drudge. Her personality, her presence, her skill, her joy of life. She knows she is one of the lucky people on this planet, as am I, who gets to do exactly what she is cut out to do.\u201dO.K., so it\u2019s still a little over the top, but the sentiment \u2014 that Ms. King appreciates who she is and what she gets to do, even if it means her alarm goes off at 3:22 a.m. each day \u2014 helps to explain why Ms. King has been able to speak her mind without igniting a social media firestorm. Her gratitude is something that viewers can sense, even when they\u2019re rushing to get to work, or brushing their teeth, or waiting out a Cialis ad because Gayle King said \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back...\u201dIn 1992, when Ms. King\u2019s son Will was 6 and she was an \u201cEyewitness News\u201d anchor in Connecticut, he told his mom, \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t want you to be Auntie O famous. I like you how you are now, slightly rich and slightly famous.\u2019\u201d And that is how Ms. King still sees herself, slightly rich and slightly famous.Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., Ms. King spent much of her childhood attending an American school in Turkey, where her father worked as an engineer for the United States government. She had a swimming pool and a housekeeper, luxuries that were unheard-of in Ms. Winfrey\u2019s childhood in rural Mississippi, where her teenage mother worked as a maid. \u201cShe was the first black person I\u2019d ever met who wasn\u2019t hit by her parents,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said.\u201cWe were two black girls who loved being black, who loved the experience of growing up black girls in America, and we felt our value system was very much the same \u2014 our dreams were the same,\u201d Ms. Winfrey told me. They had grown up in different types of homes, but they both experienced racism and were taunted for talking and acting \u2018\u2018white.\u201d (It didn\u2019t help matters that they both loved Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond.) \u201cBoth of us,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said, \u201cgrew up as black girls striving to do better in our lives.\u201dAs Ms. Winfrey rose to supernova stardom, \u201cmy friend Gayle\u201d became a known entity to \u201cOprah\u201d viewers, along with the intimate details of her life: her children\u2019s births, her husband\u2019s infidelity. Ms. King served as a special correspondent on the program and had her own show on Ms. Winfrey\u2019s Sirius XM station, Oprah Radio. In 1999, Ms. King joined O, The Oprah Magazine as an editor-at-large and monthly columnist of \u201cThe World According to Gayle.\u201d Ms. Winfrey even asked Ms. King to take over \u201cOprah\u201d when she wanted to focus on movies, but at the time, Ms. King didn\u2019t want to leave Connecticut, where her children were close to their father, her ex-husband.She had her own short-lived \u201cGayle King Show\u201d on Ms. Winfrey\u2019s cable channel, OWN. \u201cIt was essentially Gayle sitting in a chair talking to viewers, and she was in her moment of glory,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said, noting that Ms. King is often late to meet her because she\u2019s been chatting with her cabdriver. Ms. Winfrey blamed herself for the show not catching on. \u201cNobody told me that nobody programs cable in the mornings,\u201d she said.By 2012, when Chris Licht, then the executive producer of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d asked Ms. King to audition for the show, the low-rated OWN was getting skewered in the press. \u201cI said to Oprah, \u2018Can you imagine the headlines if I leave OWN?\u2019 They\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s so bad, even her best friend is jumping ship,\u2019\u201d Ms. King told me. Ms. Winfrey insisted she do it. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, this is the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Ms. Winfrey recalled telling her friend.Mr. Licht had previously been the executive producer of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and had been impressed with Ms. King\u2019s occasional stops on the show. He thought her down-to-earth appeal could balance Mr. Rose\u2019s more cerebral approach. Today, Ms. King jokes about how odd the pairing must have seemed at the time: a staid PBS host and the woman whom millions of \u201cOprah\u201d viewers know pooped herself during childbirth.But somehow it worked. Ms. King and Mr. Rose had a palpable connection and an easy, on-camera banter. In an interview, David Rhodes, the president of CBS News, gave the example of an economist appearing on the show. \u201cCharlie could have a very different shorthand, and she\u2019s approaching it like the average viewer \u2014 \u2018What do you mean?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. Another time, when the panel interviewed a deputy C.I.A. director about ISIS, Ms. King interjected with a classic Gayle King question: \u201cCan you remind the audience, why do they hate us?\u201dMs. O\u2019Donnell, who joined the panel nine months after its debut, said Ms. King \u201cis the emotional center of our show,\u201d reacting to the news she\u2019s delivering even when producers are prodding through her earpiece that it\u2019s time to move on.Ryan Kadro, who followed Mr. Licht as executive producer, said he thought of the show as an \u201cemotional accordion\u201d and that \u201cyou really do need the right balance and melody.\u201d Five years after its debut, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d had doubled its audience to 3.8 million viewers, making it the most lucrative property in the CBS News family, according to industry analysts.\u201cCBS This Morning\u201d is still scrambling to recover from Mr. Rose\u2019s abrupt departure \u2014 a process in which Ms. King has been a somewhat passive observer. John Dickerson, a respected Washington journalist who previously hosted \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d joined the panel, and as I was reporting this article, CBS named Bianna Golodryga as a fourth co-anchor. Ms. King said she hadn\u2019t known about the move until the day it was announced.According to Nielsen, ratings have fallen by roughly half a million viewers, to 3.2 million last month. But the show has remained competitive with \u201cToday,\u201d which suffered its own #MeToo shake-up with the firing of Matt Lauer. Ms. King\u2019s contract is up in a little over a year, adding to speculation about the show\u2019s future. Ms. King said, \u201cI\u2019m excited about whatever the future may hold.\u201dA week after our breakfast, I visited Ms. King on the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d set, with its circular Lucite table and sepia-toned news memorabilia. Ms. King and her co-hosts had just finished a discussion about fathers talking to sons about the #MeToo movement, a story line the show and the network (and the country) can\u2019t escape.Earlier that morning, Ms. King had dropped off lottery tickets to the guys in the control room, a tradition whenever the pot is upward of $300 million. (She even made Ms. Winfrey buy a ticket, over the billionaire\u2019s objections. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to play the lottery, because if I ever won the lottery, people would turn on me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Winfrey said. And then Ms. King pulled over to a gas station and bought her friend a lottery ticket.)After the panel recorded the West Coast version of the show, Ms. King walked to the green room, where she sat on a sofa and ate Starbucks egg-white bites on her lap before doing a Facebook Live interview with the 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason. Typically, she leaves CBS before noon to head to what is essentially a second full-time job, at O magazine, where she writes her column and is responsible for making sure each issue reflects Ms. Winfrey\u2019s tastes. After hours, there are the extracurriculars that go with being a prominent personality in New York \u2014 the book launches and charity events and moderator gigs. Ms. Winfrey always tells her, \u201cGayle, \u2018No\u2019 is a complete sentence.\u201d But Ms. King can\u2019t say the word.Ms. King\u2019s celebrity means she has a different relationship with the people she covers than most other anchors do. Ms. King was at Ms. Winfrey\u2019s home in Hawaii one Christmas when Mitt Romney arrived for a visit in his van \u201cand all these Romneys piled out.\u201d Last year, she vacationed with Ms. Winfrey, Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen and Barack and Michelle Obama on David Geffen\u2019s yacht in Tahiti.Ms. King said Ms. Winfrey \u201cis very, very, very happy with her life, and her life would drastically change\u201d were she to run. That hasn\u2019t stopped Ms. King from urging Ms. Winfrey to do it.The day Ms. Winfrey called me from her Santa Barbara home, her dog barking in the background, she seemed a bit baffled by Ms. King\u2019s persistence. The two women had just talked, and Ms. King had, again, urged her to consider running. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really surprised me,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said. \u201cShe is still talking about \u2018the perfect ticket,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why you keep doing this? You of all people are supposed to care about my life,\u2019 and she said, \u2018The country is bigger than your life.\u2019\u201dThe rhythms of a morning TV host are brutal. Ms. King is 63, with two grown children, but when she tells me about her life, she sounds like a college student or one of those girls who moves to New York to live like a \u201cSex and the City\u201d character. The night before we first met, Ms. King had eaten only cereal for dinner, and her Fitbit reported that she slept 3 hours and 15 minutes. She and Ms. Winfrey used to talk four or five times a day, but when she started at CBS, the late-night calls began to wane. Ms. Winfrey said, \u201cI remember talking on the phone and then I\u2019m like, \u2018Gayle? Gayle? Are you there?\u201d She had fallen asleep on Oprah.Ms. Winfrey worries about Ms. King\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cThis lack of sleep thing is going to catch up with you,\u201d she tells her. She\u2019d also like her to take the time to date and find a partner, maybe a professorial, bookish type who lives a quieter life, preferably someone who could cook and stock the fridge.I asked Ms. King if the DNA of Ms. Winfrey\u2019s eponymous show, which mixed levity and heft and held unprecedented sway over its audience of mostly female viewers, informed the way she thought about \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d Ms. King seemed slightly annoyed at this question. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she said. \u201cNo.\u201dI thought back to my first meeting with Ms. King. I told her that when I mentioned to several friends that I was writing about her, they didn\u2019t initially think of her as Oprah\u2019s best friend \u2014 they think of her as atop the media ecosystem in her own right. \u201cWhere have your friends been, in a cave?\u201d she asked. (Well, kind of, the New York media bubble.) That\u2019s nice, Ms. King said, but she doesn\u2019t mind being known in the context of her richer, more famous friend.\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be her friend, and she and I are very, very, very tight, and that\u2019s never going to change, so I don\u2019t feel overshadowed by her,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I feel like there\u2019s only one of her and only one of me, and I kind of like me. I like me. I like her, too, but I really like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Rejects Italy\u2019s Budget, and Populists Dig In", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In what is becoming a dangerous game of chicken for the global economy, Italy\u2019s populist government refused to budge on Tuesday after the European Union for the first time sent back a member state\u2019s proposed budget because it violated the bloc\u2019s fiscal laws and posed unacceptable risks.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s administrative body, had repeatedly warned Italy to reduce the deficits in its 2019 draft budget to avoid heavy fines early next year. But Italy\u2019s populist government, which has bristled against Europe\u2019s austerity measures, went ahead and submitted a budget with a proposed deficit equal to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product. That figure was considered much too high for a country whose total government debt equals 131 percent of G.D.P., more than double the eurozone limit.As expected, the commission rejected the plan, saying that it included irresponsible deficit levels that would \u201csuffocate\u201d Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone. Investors fear that the collapse of the Italian economy under its enormous debt could sink the entire eurozone and hasten a global economic crisis unseen since 2008, or worse.But Italy\u2019s populists are not scared. They have repeatedly compared their budget, fat with unemployment welfare, pension increases and other benefits, to the New Deal measures of Franklin D. Roosevelt that helped America emerge from the Great Depression.\u201cThe only thing that we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u2019s vice premier and the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told reporters as it became clear that the European Commission would reject the plan.After the official rejection, Mr. Di Maio wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe know that we are on the right path, and therefore we won\u2019t stop.\u201dHis coalition partner and fellow vice premier, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, was equally scathing. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything. Let the speculators be reassured, we\u2019re not going back,\u201d he told reporters during a trip to Romania. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not attacking a government but a people. These are things that will anger Italians even more.\u201dItaly has three weeks to revise its budget under the bloc\u2019s rules, but the European Union\u2019s unprecedented response may just be the instigation to a fight that Mr. Di Maio and his coalition partners have been itching for.Both the Five Star and the League ran for election this year in direct opposition to Brussels. With European Parliament elections on the horizon in May, it doesn\u2019t hurt their cause to reintroduce the specter of a bureaucratic boogeyman preventing them from stimulating the Italian economy and delivering on their campaign promises.All of which make for strong political arguments that resonate with angry Italian voters who have yet to recover from the last debt crisis. Still, the markets are less moved by the talking points.Mr. Salvini and Mr. Di Maio have at times spoken with disgust or derision about the yield spread between Italian and German 10-year benchmark bonds as if it were just another political enemy to be demonized or ridiculed. (The \u201cspread,\u201d Mr. Salvini has joked, is what he put on his breakfast bread.)But the spread is no joke. Detested as it might be among Italy\u2019s populist politicians, it has become perhaps the international markets\u2019 most powerful judgment of the health of eurozone economies.In the 2011 European bond crises, it laid waste to the bloc\u2019s governments \u2014 including, notably, that of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign because of a lack of confidence from the international markets.Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, has suggested that leaders in Brussels have sought to raise fears about the Italian economy in order to spike the spread and force his government to bow to European rules. Mr. Di Maio has said \u201cenemies of the people\u201d were working to increase the spread.The question for Italy, and all of Europe, is how far Italy\u2019s government is willing to go. Will it be forced into submission by the gravity of economic reality? Or will Italian leaders convince their voters that the country\u2019s financial health is worth risking in order to blow up a political and economic establishment that they say is stripping Italians of their sovereignty?And Brussels must decide how strict it will be. Loath to let a member state slide for fear that it would loosen the ties that bind the union, its leaders must ask themselves if that is worse than an open revolt.\u201cBreaking rules can appear tempting at a first look,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission\u2019s vice president in charge of the euro and financial stability.\u201cIt can provide the illusion of breaking free,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018It is tempting to try to cure debt with more debt. But at some point, the debt weighs too heavy, and at the end of the day you end up having no freedom at all.\u201dMr. Dombrovskis called Italy\u2019s budget \u201cconsciously going against commitments made\u201d and said \u201cthe ball is now in the court of Italy\u2019s government.\u201dThat ball has already wrought havoc inside the Italian government.At the end of September, Italy\u2019s populists agreed on a budget that delivered on the priorities of both the Five Star, which sought a broad unemployment benefit, and the League, which wanted a flat tax for small business owners. It also included more generous pension benefits, allowing people to retire at 62 if they had contributed for 38 years, which both parties campaigned on.\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said at the time.Italy\u2019s leaders have complained they are being unfairly singled out by the European Union, and Mr. Di Maio has threatened new elections if the bloc doesn\u2019t approve the 2.4 percent deficit.The previous, center-left government had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, which would have allowed Italy to continue chipping away at its total debt.Establishment forces inside the government, including Economics Minister Giovanni Tria, sought to shrink the proposed deficit level but were outmaneuvered by the populists. At one point, a member of the League shut off Mr. Tria\u2019s microphone to keep him from talking about the budget.But the major pressure on Italy\u2019s budget has come from outside Italy. Fitch Ratings issued a negative evaluation of the budget, and Moody\u2019s dropped its rating for Italian bonds to one level above \u201cjunk\u201d last week.As the spreads rose, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of economic and fiscal affairs, provoked the government\u2019s rage when he said Italians had chosen a xenophobic government.As Mr. Moscovici left the news conference on Tuesday, a member of the European Parliament with the League party, Angelo Ciocca, snatched the commissioner\u2019s papers and pounded them with his shoe, which he later wrote on Twitter, was \u201cmade in Italy.\u201dTop members of the Five Star echoed that critique, calling the European leaders \u201cslaves of alcohol.\u201d Beppe Grillo, the movement\u2019s co-founder, wrote on his blog last week that he suspected Mr. Junker of having neurological problems, and featured a picture of him looking unwell.Mr. Conte, Italy\u2019s prime minister, sought to bring down the temperature as investor fears of a confrontation rose.On Monday, he assured reporters at the foreign press club that Italy\u2019s budget dispute with Brussels could be settled through negotiation, with a nod to President George H.W. Bush\u2019s famous \u201cread my lips: no new taxes\u201d pledge at the 1988 Republican National Convention.\u201cRead my lips,\u201d Mr. Conte said, switching to English for emphasis. \u201cFor Italy there is no chance, no way to get \u2018Italexit.\u2019 There is no way to get out of Europe, of the eurozone.\u201dMr. Bush agreed to raise taxes.Jason Horowitz reported from Rome, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.\u2022 Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.\u2022 The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT.Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. \u201cThey\u2019re making more cars,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to say if they are making money on every one.\u201dFacebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache.Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman \u2014 and it could continue.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. \u201cThese developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry\u2019s challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.)Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode. But its executives argue that the company remains a technology platform that can ride out the waxing and waning of crypto prices.

Mine is set to block Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, and I usually set it for two or three hours at a time.I also bought noise-canceling headphones this year, because my colleagues, God love them, are always talking on the phone with their sources. I\u2019m pretty into a Spotify playlist called Focus Flow, which is perfect for drowning out their lovely, incessant yakking.What are some of the trade-offs of using this tech?I like taking physical notes because I retain information better when it\u2019s written on actual paper. The downside is that I spend a lot of time scrambling around my apartment looking for the notebook I left in a jacket pocket or under the sofa.There\u2019s also a definite trade-off between security and convenience. I probably spend 30 percent of my day typing in two-factor authentication codes. But I sleep better than I used to.Recently, I\u2019ve also been spending a lot of time on Crowdtangle, a tool that allows you to see what\u2019s spreading rapidly across Facebook at any given moment. (Crowdtangle used to be an independent company, but Facebook bought it in 2016.) I have a series of dashboards set up that allow me to monitor thousands of Facebook pages on different topics and see which false claims are being shared by which people and pages.What kind of election-related tech shenanigans have you seen recently?What are you doing to combat those annoying robotexts?I actually haven\u2019t gotten that many political robotexts. I do get frequent robotexts from a Caribbean restaurant in Queens, which I\u2019ve never been to but whose promotional list I somehow got on. (I will make it to the Friday night fish fry soon, I promise.)Outside of work, what tech product are you obsessed with?I\u2019ve also been working on my sleep recently, which is very Arianna Huffington of me. Recently, I bought a $15 noise machine on Amazon, which is a little hockey-puck-size speaker that has six or seven settings. You can fill your bedroom with jungle noises, or ocean waves, or crickets on a summer night. It\u2019s phenomenal. On the recommendation of several friends, I also bought a gravity blanket, which is weighted down with heavy beads. It\u2019s meant for people with anxiety, but I just like the way it sits heavy on my body and prevents me from rolling over too much at night. I have the 25-pound version.What could be better about it?I wish the blankets came in heavier weights.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Return of the Vampire King of New York ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "The wild goth subculture of the 1990s may be gone, but as long as there are people who want fangs, Father Sebastiaan will supply them.Supported byIn the dim corner of Halloween Adventure, a two-story costume store in Manhattan, a man called Father Sebastiaan sculpts vampire fangs by hand. A Ouija board hangs crooked on the wall, near a purple crystal and an uneven pile of occult books. His work stall, no larger than a broom closet, is barely visible behind pirate and cowboy masks.A small gaggle had soon formed at the door, and Father Sebastiaan looked up. \u201cThe people who come to me are lost souls,\u201d he said to a young assistant. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m here. Fangs help them tap into their primal vampire nature. Fangs are magic.\u201dTwo women squeezed in the stall to be fitted for fangs. \u201cI\u2019m a modern-day vampire who loves life,\u201d said Christina Staib, a woman with leather boots and bat tattoos. Her friend Melanie Anderson had come for her first pair. \u201cThey give off an aura,\u201d she said. \u201cA spiritual vampire aura.\u201dFather Sebastiaan is just the man to help cultivate that aura. A 43-year-old with long hair, the fang maker once styled himself the king and spiritual guru of New York\u2019s vibrant vampire scene in the 1990s. He hosted raucous parties, wrote books and launched product lines \u2014 jewelry, contact lenses and the fangs \u2014 with financial success. It was a good time to be a vampire in New York. But he was toppled by critics and rivals and, ultimately, a city that outgrew its vampire moment. Fortunes rise and fall, but the fang maker\u2019s travails are particularly unusual \u2014 and include spirit encounters in dance clubs, the disappearance of a young journalist and feuding gangs of self-professed vampires.The New York vampire scene, like Father Sebastiaan\u2019s stature in the city, is not what it once was. But the subculture \u2014 part alternative religion, part costumed role-play \u2014 is appealing to a new generation. Unlike their predecessors who had to seek out clubs or salons, these new vampires may simply go online. With galas and plans to expand his fang empire, Father Sebastiaan is looking to re-establish his place in the culture lest it pass him by.Here, he discovered an eclectic scene of drug-fueled club parties and scattered salons where eccentrics met to discuss occult spirituality. The vampire myth was enjoying a revival in those years, thanks in part to Anne Rice, whose \u201cVampire Chronicles\u201d inspired a legion of superfans. The popular image of the vampire suddenly transformed from Old World castle-dwelling monster to svelte rock-star Lothario. \u201cThe vampire is a powerful myth of the heroic outsider, of lost beauty,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cThere is a fascination with vampires always slumbering in our culture, waiting to flare up.\u201dIn these heady times, Mr. Hoyt saw a business opportunity.In 1995, he started selling a line of ultrarealistic acrylic vampire fangs that fit snugly over the teeth. He called his fang company Sabretooth and treated each new customer as a member of his own vampire clan with ritualized, if kitschy, ceremonies. For some it was playful dress up, for others it was a spiritual path.\u201cI realized that one thing we don\u2019t have in America is coming-of-age ceremonies,\u201d he said. \u201cI made one for vampires.\u201dMr. Hoyt also approached club owners, like the Limelight impresario Peter Gatien, about hosting vampire-themed events where the growing community could congregate.If Mr. Hoyt had any doubts about his new ventures, an otherworldly experience assuaged his uncertainty. One night, he was wandering alone in a private room of Limelight, a club in a deconsecrated church notorious for freely available drugs. He recalled his body growing unnaturally warm. He felt a spirit wrap around him. \u201cYou will become the vampire king,\u201d Mr. Hoyt heard a voice whisper.\u201cIt was my Moses moment,\u201d he said.The vampire parties took off. Mr. Hoyt\u2019s galas were experimental affairs, rotating through a series of clubs, with coffins splayed out on the dance floor, performances by goth bands and leather-clad vampires who might flog one another with kink whips. Going by Father Sebastiaan or another pseudonym, he pranced through as a vampire playboy, dressed in leather pants and a top hat.As the decade wore on, Mr. Hoyt\u2019s business expanded. He ran a full vampire emporium, with half a dozen contractors, casting thousands of fangs for aspiring vampires. He wrote books \u2014 metaphysical how-to texts \u2014 that were stocked at the Hot Topic retail chain.\u201cNew York was mine,\u201d Mr. Hoyt said. \u201cI ruled from my shop.\u201dMeanwhile, internal schisms broke out. Did one have to literally drink blood to be a vampire, or could you feed off invisible human energy instead? Some vampires drank small pricks of human blood in private, but the matter remained unresolved.And Mr. Hoyt also earned the scorn of vampires who said he had abused his power and capitalized on their subculture. \u201cSebastiaan was using magic and spirituality as a guise,\u201d said Michelle Belanger, a writer who would later split with Mr. Hoyt over accusations of plagiarism. (She never took legal action.)The city was changing, too. Clubs were shuttering as rents rose. And following arguments with his contractors, in 2001 Mr. Hoyt sold the shop amid much acrimony. The community fractured. \u201cThey knocked the crown from my head,\u201d he said. Later that year he left New York.Gradually, the scene dissipated in the city, spreading instead to places like New Orleans and Los Angeles. Mr. Hoyt then drifted around European and American cities. In the next years, Mr. Hoyt took his fang-making and events company, called Endless Night, on the road, holding galas in Berlin, Paris, New Orleans.As past feuds quelled slightly, Mr. Hoyt quietly returned to Manhattan around 2006 to reboot his fang business in a more modest state at Halloween Adventure. These days he is based in Los Angeles but makes several trips to Manhattan each year to fill fang orders. In the lead up to Halloween, he is booked back-to-back making specialty teeth. Standard fangs go for $150, a price that includes a pendant, a book and a ritualized renaming ceremony.Finished with a client, Father Sebastiaan put down his tools and tidied up his little domain. Sober for seven years, he has yet to give up cigarettes and stepped outside for a smoke. Father Sebastiaan\u2019s fangs poked out as he took a drag and flipped through old photos on his phone. \u201cThe glory days,\u201d he said.\u201cAll I wanted was for my tombstone to read: \u2018Best vampire dad ever.\u2019\u201dThe feuds still linger. But by some measures, the Father Sebastiaan brand has grown larger. His online following has swelled in recent years (on Facebook he has more than 90,000 followers) as younger seekers discover him. There are plans for a mass printing system for fangs, an autobiography and a series of esoteric guides for aspiring vampires. \u201cI feel like my next big moment could be coming,\u201d Mr. Hoyt said.The vampires all wore black and bared their fangs theatrically. Sabrina Santiago, originally from the Bronx, said she discovered vampire culture on social media. \u201cI wanted something that took me out of the spectrum of the normal,\u201d she said and pointed to her fangs. \u201cThese bad boys do it.\u201dFather Sebastiaan had come here because it reminded him of the heyday of the New York vampire. Over dumplings, he regaled the table with breathless reminiscences.\u201cI did my magic rituals in that room.\u201d\u201cThis was sacred ground.\u201d\u201cYou could suck the energy right off the dance floor.\u201dThe young group listened politely, but several faces were blank. Those galas were the old days, well before their time. Plates cleared as the vampires discussed an after party, but Mr. Hoyt decided against it. It was late, after all, and Father Sebastiaan needed his rest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Indian Food Writer Breaks Free From Tradition", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn his deeply personal debut cookbook, \u201cSeason,\u201d Nik Sharma tells his story as a gay immigrant reconciling his past and present.He found a bottle of Rooh Afza, a rose-flavored concentrated syrup popular throughout South Asia, in the studio apartment in the Bandra neighborhood of Mumbai, India, where he grew up in the late 1980s. Though Rooh Afza is typically mixed into cold water or milk, Mr. Sharma had other plans. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you put the Rooh Afza in the rice so it smelled like roses?\u2019\u201d he said.The syrup turned the rice an atomic pink hue. It was disturbingly sweet. After a few bites, he threw it out.His failure was an early cooking lesson: Be bold with flavors. Don\u2019t be reckless.The light-soaked kitchen at his home here in Oakland, which he shares with his husband, Michael Frazier, their two cats and a dog, is charmingly chaotic. The spice drawer is clogged with dozens of jars: ancho chile, juniper berries, fenugreek powder. A collection of nearly 400 cookbooks spills from his living room into his kitchen. (\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, shrugging.) Pieces of black cast-iron cookware, from teakettles to Dutch ovens, dot every corner of the room.A small wooden box sitting on a high shelf contains talismans from the home he left behind: paperback cookbooks, their pages now yellowed and disintegrating, that he borrowed from his mother, along with his grandmother\u2019s recipes scribbled on notepads.\u201cIt is wrapped up in so much tradition, but it can be fluid and move across boundaries,\u201d Mr. Sharma said of paneer. \u201cI always believe that tradition is great, but it can bind you.\u201d It\u2019s no coincidence that this conflict plays out in his recipes, which are very personal \u2014 even autobiographical. They often rely on ingredients found in the Indian dishes of his youth, like that paneer. But Mr. Sharma breaks away from familiarity, putting those ingredients in conversation with the food he has encountered in America. The results defy easy categorization, like Mr. Sharma himself. \u201cMine is the story of a gay immigrant, told through food,\u201d he writes in his cookbook\u2019s introduction, which details his journey from childhood in India to his current life in California as he sought out his place in the world. His cooking helped carry him, providing both direction and comfort along the way.\u201cMy food has always been about wanting people to accept me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also looking for acceptance from myself.\u201dThrough it all, he cooked. Once he mastered rice, he moved on to a binder of recipes his mother had cobbled together from Indian lifestyle glossies and newspapers. These recipes weren\u2019t exclusively Indian: He baked a Neapolitan cake using maraschino cherries for the red layer. \u201cI know people will hate me for that,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut that\u2019s all they had in India, so that\u2019s what we used.\u201dHe never imagined that the decision to feature his hands in photographs would be an issue. Within months, anonymous comments began to appear. They were pointed and viciously personal in nature, attacking an aspect of himself he could not suppress: his race. Discouraged, Mr. Sharma temporarily stopped blogging, seized by self-doubt.\u201cOne was about the color of my skin being very ashy,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there were references made to it looking like burnt tar.\u201dBut he gathered himself and resumed writing after a few months, resolving to keep his hands in the photographs. The readers came.Among those early evangelists was Chitra Agrawal, an Indian-American chef and cookbook author. \u201cNik has a gift for spinning these flavors he grew up with into entirely new creations that are accessible yet unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t care much for Indian sweets,\u201d Ms. Agrawal added. \u201cNik reframed them in a way that was so elegant and inspired.\u201dAs his online following grew, Mr. Sharma\u2019s work caught the eye of Paolo Lucchesi, the food editor of The San Francisco Chronicle, who gave Mr. Sharma a column in 2016.\u201cNik\u2019s work \u2014 his photos and his writing \u2014 represent something new and original,\u201d Mr. Lucchesi wrote in an email. \u201cHis work is only something he could do.\u201dHe also takes dishes of personal significance to him and gives them new life, like his version of bebinca, a traditional Goan dessert of eggs and coconut milk that his grandmother made often. A bebinca usually consists of layers, but he, like his grandmother, makes it with mashed sweet potatoes, condensing them into a mass that resembles pudding. He added a dash of turmeric to accent the vivid orange of the sweet potatoes, and sweetened it delicately with maple syrup as well as jaggery, a fixture of Indian cooking. \u201cBeing gay, being brown, that\u2019s a part of me I can\u2019t hide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hope people see me as a writer and a photographer and a cook. These are the things I hope they see me as when I die.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s Why a 50-Degree Day Feels Colder in Fall Than in Spring", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat first cold spell of the season always feels especially harsh.If you\u2019ve ever wondered, from beneath several layers of clothing, whether you were overreacting to those frigid early fall days, take solace. It may not just be in your head: The human body takes time to acclimate to the cold.\u201cWe kind of get a global response over time over the winter so that a 50-degree day in, say, February, feels glorious, whereas at this time of year it feels chilly,\u201d said John Castellani, a physiologist who specializes in cold weather research at the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Massachusetts.Some experts argue that the shift in perception is mostly psychological, but others, including Dr. Castellani, say there\u2019s more to it: The evidence suggests that the body grows to tolerate the cold over time.Here\u2019s a brief look at what we do and don\u2019t know about how the body responds to the cold in, say, autumn, compared to the spring.As anyone who has fought over the thermostat knows, people experience temperature differently, sometimes dramatically so.Psychology can play a substantial role, too. As can behavior: Humans excel at limiting their exposure to wintry conditions, which can dull the effects of the cold.\u201cThere\u2019s a classic saying that \u2018man in the cold is not necessarily a cold man,\u2019\u201d said Mike Tipton, a professor of physiology at the University of Portsmouth in Britain who studies temperature regulation in the body. \u201cWe wrap up, we heat our houses, we wear clothes and we recreate our tropical origins next to the skin.\u201dWhen the temperature drops, sensors in the skin known as thermoreceptors detect that change and send signals to the hypothalamus, a small, versatile region of the brain sometimes referred to as the body\u2019s thermostat.To maintain a safe core body temperature, the hypothalamus may then direct the body to do one of two things. The main response is a process known as vasoconstriction: the tightening of blood vessels on the body\u2019s periphery to shunt warm blood away from the extremities and skin and back toward the core. The body may also shiver to generate heat.\u201cWhen the skin senses cold temperatures, its first response really is to protect the inside,\u201d Dr. Castellani said.Over time, though, those responses can change.Studies of people throughout the world have found that those frequently exposed to the cold simply begin to tolerate it more by shivering or constricting blood vessels less.Indigenous populations in the Australian and African deserts and the Arctic, for example, have been found to have a less pronounced response to the cold than those not subjected to the same frigid conditions. (Temperatures in the deserts often plummet at night.)The same has been found even among people subjected to the cold in more limited ways. For example, fishermen and fish filleters who work long hours with their hands in cold water have been found to have higher hand temperatures when their hands are placed in frigid water compared with control subjects. Similar effects have been found among slaughterhouse workers who routinely handle slabs of cold meat.That, Dr. Castellani said, explains how a person in a cool climate might adapt to winter over time.\u201cWe experience that cold air on our cheek all winter long, and basically that skin doesn\u2019t constrict as much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve habituated in that area, and because the skin\u2019s a little warmer that\u2019s why it feels warmer. That\u2019s why the cold October day feels much colder than that same day in February.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Taiwan, It\u2019s All About Food That\u2019s \u2018Q.\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaiwan DispatchNEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan \u2014 As dusk falls at Lehua Night Market, the fluorescent lights flicker on and the hungry customers start trickling in, anxious for a taste of the local delicacies that give this island its reputation as one of Asia\u2019s finest culinary capitals.Neatly arranged pyramids of plump fish balls. Bowls brimming with tapioca balls bathed in lightly sweetened syrup. Sizzling oyster omelets, hot off the griddle. Deep-fried sweet potato puffs, still dripping with oil.Take a bite of any of these dishes and you\u2019ll discover a unique texture. But how exactly do you describe that perfectly calibrated \u201cmouth feel\u201d so sought after by local cooks and eaters alike?Slippery? Chewy? Globby? Not exactly the most flattering adjectives in the culinary world.Luckily, the Taiwanese have a word for this texture. Well, actually, it\u2019s not a word, it\u2019s a letter \u2014 one that even non-Chinese speakers can pronounce.It\u2019s \u201cQ.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain what Q means exactly,\u201d said Liu Yen-ling, a manager at Chun Shui Tang, a popular teahouse chain that claims to have invented tapioca milk tea in Taiwan. \u201cBasically it means springy, soft, elastic.\u201dQ texture is to Taiwanese what umami is to Japanese and al dente is to Italians \u2014 that is, cherished and essential. Around Taiwan, the letter Q can often be glimpsed amid a jumble of Chinese characters on shop signs and food packages and in convenience stores and advertisements.The texture is found in both savory and sweet foods, and is most often used to describe foods that contain some kind of starch like noodles, tapioca pearls and fish balls. If something is really chewy or extra Q, then it could be called QQ. Often, Q and QQ are used interchangeably.\u201cYou can tell if bubble milk tea is good based on how Q the tapioca pearls are,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cIf the texture is perfect, it can be very satisfying.\u201dOne dish he was trying out for the restaurant\u2019s new menu featured langoustine, burned onion juice and white tapioca pearls that are cooked to bubbly Q perfection.\u201cIt\u2019s like al dente but not quite,\u201d Mr. Chiang said. \u201cIt\u2019s to the tooth but there\u2019s also that added element of bounciness.\u201dQ is so well established in Taiwan that many in Hong Kong and over the strait in mainland China use the term as well.Elsewhere in Asia, it is a familiar texture, though the term itself may not be used. Tteok-bokki, a Korean stir-fried rice cake, and mochi, a Japanese rice cake, for example, could also be considered Q. In Western cuisine, the texture is less commonly found, though one could describe foods like gummy bears and certain kinds of pasta as Q.The origins of the term Q are unclear. Some say it comes from the Taiwanese Hokkien word k\u2019iu. Say Q to an elderly Taiwanese, and chances are he or she will know the term. But no one can quite explain how and when the 17th letter of the English alphabet became shorthand for describing the texture of tapioca balls and gummy candies.With the rapid proliferation of bubble milk tea shops and other Asian snack shops across the United States over the years, there has emerged a broader appreciation for this once \u201cexotic\u201d texture, even if the vocabulary to describe that texture has not exactly caught up.\u201cMost of my American friends like bubble milk tea,\u201d said Tina Fong, a co-founder of Taipei Eats, which offers food tours around the city. \u201cBut when there\u2019s Q texture in a savory dish, it can still be a bit strange to them. It really depends on the person.\u201dWhen it comes to the Chinese language, the letter Q is surprisingly versatile, and not used only to describe food. For example, many in China and Taiwan are familiar with \u963fQ, or Ah Q, the protagonist of one of China\u2019s most famous novellas by the writer Lu Xun.After the publication of \u201cThe True Story of Ah Q\u201d in the early 1920s, Ah Q became a symbol of the backwardness of Chinese culture. While the story\u2019s narrator confesses to not knowing the origin of Ah Q\u2019s name, some scholars say Lu Xun may have chosen Q as an implicit reference to its homonym queue, or the braided ponytail that Chinese men were forced to wear to show their subjugation to the ruling Qing dynasty.Some have also interpreted Lu Xun\u2019s Q as a pictogram of a head with a pigtail.There are many other uses for the term Q in Chinese as well. It could be used, for example, as shorthand for the English word cute, or to refer to the once-popular QQ messaging service from Tencent or the QQ minicar model from the Chinese carmaker Chery.Among Taiwanese, the appreciation for Q texture starts at a young age. On a recent sticky evening at Lehua Night Market, crowds ambled through the carnival-like pedestrian street, which was lined on both sides with vendors hawking things like hats, cellphone cases and, of course, delicious snacks.A gaggle of mini revelers zeroed in on a stand with a neon sign that read \u201cQQ popsicles.\u201d Asked why Q texture was so appealing to Taiwanese, Lu Wei-chen, the owner of the stand, smiled as she handed a bright red jelly bar to a delighted toddler.\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you eat it, you will be in a good mood.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released data on fast food consumption gathered from 2013 to 2016 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or Nhanes, a program that continuously monitors the health and nutritional status of Americans.The Nhanes analysis relies on physical examinations and in-person interviews to produce demographic, socioeconomic and health data, including dietary information from a representative sample of about 10,000 adults over the four years. Among those who eat fast food, 44 percent do so at lunch and 42 percent at dinner. Men are more likely to grab fast food at lunch; women are more likely to snack on it. The most enthusiastic consumers are 20 to 39 years old: 45 percent of them eat fast food on any given day. That figure declines sharply with age, to 38 percent among people 40 to 59, and to 24 percent among those over age 60.Liz Weinandy, a staff dietitian at the Ohio State University Medical Center who was not involved in writing the report, said that the high rate among 20- to 39-year-olds was particularly troubling.That period \u201csets the stage for health issues later in life \u2014 heart disease, dementia and so on,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, this is the group that\u2019s having kids, and they\u2019re setting them up for a lifetime of unhealthy eating habits.\u201dThe percentage of adults who ate fast food rose with increasing income.

But 42 percent of people above 350 percent of the poverty line \u2014 $87,850 a year or more for that size family \u2014 were daily consumers. \u201cWhen we hear about a shark attack, we\u2019re scared and we avoid that beach,\u201d Ms. Weinandy said. \u201cBut what we really should be afraid of is double cheeseburgers and French fries.\u201dAn earlier version of this article miscalculated the dollar equivalent of 350 percent of the federal poverty line for a family of four. It is $87,850 a year, not $112,950.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Left Turn Is Not an Illusion", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike many overnight sensations, it has been years in the making.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from 44 to 35; the percentage of self-identified conservative Democrats has gone from 25 to 13 percent.While a substantial percentage of Democratic minorities identify as liberals, those percentages have not been growing at anywhere near the rate that they have for white Democrats, so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self-identified Democratic liberals. Over the past 17 years, for example, the percentage of black Democrats who identify themselves as liberals grew by a modest three percentage points, according to both Gallup and the Pew Research Center.In fact, white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some racial issues.Take the issue of discrimination as a factor holding back African-American advancement. White liberals are to the left of black Democrats, placing a much stronger emphasis than African-Americans on the role of discrimination and much less emphasis on the importance of individual effort.Among white liberals, according to Pew survey data collected in 2017, 79.2 percent agreed that \u201cracial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.\u201d 18.8 percent agreed that \u201cblacks who can\u2019t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition,\u201d a 60.4 point difference, according to a detailed analysis of the Pew data provided the Times by Zach Goldberg, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgia State University.Among blacks, 59.9 percent identified discrimination as the main deterrent to upward mobility for African-Americans, and 32.0 percent said blacks were responsible for their condition \u2014 in other words, blacks are more conservative than white liberals on this issue.White liberals view questions of racial inequality more uniformly than blacks do. A survey asked: Which statement comes closer to your own views even if neither is exactly right?Racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days. 79% of white liberals60% of blacksBlacks who can\u2019t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition.1832Agree with both, or neither; don\u2019t know or didn\u2019t answer28Racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.

Politically speaking, there are clear pluses and minuses to this trend.has occurred among non-Hispanic whites. Whereas just 39 percent of white Democrats said they were liberal on social issues back in 2001-2005, that has risen to 61 percent since 2015-2017. By contrast, blacks\u2019 views have hardly changed: 34 percent in the 2001-2005 period vs. 37 percent in 2015-2017.In addition, according to Gallup, social liberalism grew substantially more among Democratic women than it did among men and more among college-educated Democrats than among those without degrees.Black Democrats\u2019 self-described ideology was very different, according to Pew. 28 percent said they were liberals, 40 percent identified themselves as moderates and 30 percent as conservatives.These voters stand apart with \u201cthe highest levels of education and socioeconomic status\u201d of all the groups studied. They are \u201chighly sensitive to issues of fairness and equity in society, particularly with regards to race, gender and other minority group identities.\u201d In addition, a third of progressive activists view political correctness as having gone too far, compared with 80 percent of the population as a whole.There are a number of other areas where progressive activists differ from the average American, according to the More in Common study. Progressive activists are \u201cmore than twice as likely to say that they never pray (50 percent to 19 percent), \u201calmost three times more likely to be \u2018ashamed to be an American\u2019 \u201d (69-24), eleven percentage points more likely to be white (80-69), and \u201ctwice as likely to have completed college (59-29).Goldberg\u2019s analysis shows a surge of racial liberalism among white Democrats. In 2016,racial sympathy among white liberals soared to the highest levels ever recorded by the American National Elections Studies. Likewise, the proportion of those who believe that whites have \u2018too much\u2019 political influence and that racial discrimination is the foremost impediment to black mobility also crested in 2016.White liberal racial sympathy was, in turn, by far the strongest among the most affluent white liberals, as accompanying graphic illustrates.In the last 30 years, white Democrats have trended toward liberal explanations of discrimination against black Americans. The wealthier they are, generally, the more liberal their views.Lowestincome thirdof whiteDemocratsMiddle thirdTop thirdTop 4%LIBERALSystemic discrimination, past and present; society largely to blame34th to 67th percentile68thto 95th percentileBottom16%17thto 33rdpercentileCONSER-VATIVEBlacks are responsible for their own condition(shaded area)\u201986\u201900\u201916\u201986\u201900\u201916\u201986\u201900\u201916Lowest income thirdof white DemocratsMiddle thirdTop thirdTop 4%LIBERALSystemic discrimination, past and present; society largely to blame34th to 67th percentile68th to 95th percentileBottom 16%17th to 33rdpercentileCONSERVATIVEBlacks are responsible for their own condition(shaded area)198620002016\u201986\u201900\u201916\u201986\u201900\u201916By The New York Times | Source: analysis of American National Election Studies data by Zach Goldberg, Georgia State UniversityIn case you are wondering how racial empathy is measured, ANES uses the responses to four statements to make its determination: \u201cOver the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve; \u201cIrish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors; \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder, they could be just as well off as whites.; \u201cgenerations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.\u201dThe shift of white liberals on racial empathy, Goldberg wrote, is part of a larger movement to the left among white Democratic activists:Importantly, these drastic attitudinal changes coincide with surges in white liberal support for progressive policy positions, including higher immigration levels, affirmative action and government assistance to African Americans.According to Goldberg, 2016 marked the first year on record that \u201cwhite liberals rated ethnic and racial minorities more positively than they did other whites.\u201dIn an email, Yascha Mounk, a lecturer in government at Harvard, wrote:One of the dangers for the Democratic Party \u2014 and the left-leaning parts of the establishment more broadly \u2014 is that they confound their actual audience with a small but highly visible group of activists.Mounk argues thata majority of Americans is horrified by hate speech; disgusted by the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on immigrants; and committed to the fight against sexual harassment. But a majority of Americans also feels that \u2018call-out culture\u2019 often attacks people for innocent mistakes and that some attempts to remedy racism actually serve to divide the country further along racial lines.Strategically, Mounk contends,If Democrats couch their fight against the evident injustices that still persist in our country in universal language that has deep roots in the American tradition, they have a good chance of winning elections \u2014 and making a real difference for the most vulnerable members of our society. If, on the contrary, they become captured in language games that are only understood by the most political and best educated progressive activists, they are likely to alienate a lot of potential supporters \u2014 including a large number of women and people of color.In many respects, the issue of immigration embodies the Democrats\u2019 problem.While the immigration data suggests that Democrats should not have a significant problem with the broad issue of immigration on Election Day, the numbers mask a more subtle reality. Men and women opposed to immigration are much more likely to vote Republican on the issue than supporters are to base a vote for a Democratic candidate on a pro-immigration position.Democrats have found that in politically competitive states, particularly ones that Mr. Trump carried in 2016, the attacks can easily turn crucial voting blocs against Democrats.The ongoing mobilizing force of the immigration issue raises a question for Democrats that never disappears completely: how far can the party push an agenda of social liberalism while keeping the support of at least 50 percent of the voters, plus one?Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, wrote me by email:The danger for Democrats is that the electorate overall is probably still a little right-of-center on social issues, and older voters who vote at consistently higher rates are decidedly conservative on social issues. To the extent that these issues define elections, especially Senate elections (where conservative rural voters matter more), Democrats are at a disadvantage.And here\u2019s another cautionary note: the very nature of political polarization suggests that even as liberals pull sharply to the left, conservatives are pulling sharply to the right, and it is unclear who will win the tug of war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Nobel Heroes, in Their Own Voices ", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA collection of interviews, videos and articles about Dr. Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.Opinion ColumnistMukwege, an old friend, started out as a doctor treating women who had been raped and suffered horrific internal injuries. In his Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, eastern Congo, he tried to repair fistulas caused not only by childbirth but also sometimes by knives, guns and sticks. Increasingly, he came to believe that he needed to address the violence not just with a scalpel and stitches, but also with public advocacy.He is hailed in the West for his work, but that doesn\u2019t protect him at home and may increase the risk to him; President Kabila is simply jealous of his renown, and this won\u2019t help.Congo may finally be transitioning to democratic elections, and Dr. Mukwege has been mentioned as an interim president during that process because he is so widely recognized as genuinely committed to his country and not to self-enrichment.Nadia Murad became a humanitarian leader by a different route. The Islamic State attacked her area, near the Syria/Iraq border, in 2014 and massacred men of her Yazidi people, while kidnapping women and girls to be sex slaves. She was herself forced into sexual servitude, but eventually escaped.The Yazidi culture is conservative, and most of those who endured this experience did not want to be identified. But Murad stepped up, speaking publicly about what she and so many other women endured, repeating her heartbreaking story and leaving audiences in tears.Murad perhaps also helped change attitudes among the Yazidi as well. Traditionally, Yazidi women who had been raped found it difficult to marry, but after the horrors of the massacres and kidnappings, many Yazidi men \u2014 recognizing that the shame lay in raping, not in being raped \u2014 publicly declared themselves willing to marry those sex slaves who had returned to their homeland. Murad is herself now engaged to a fellow Yazidi.What Murad and Mukwege share is enormous courage and commitment to ending atrocities and repression. It\u2019s thrilling to see them both win the Nobel \u2014 but I know something they would like even more, and that is peace in Congo and justice for the Yazidi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alessandro Michele, Fashion\u2019s Modern Mastermind", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn just three years, Gucci\u2019s creative director has shifted the industry\u2019s course, altering the way the world sees value, gender and even identity.ON A BRIGHT May day, Alessandro Michele and I stand side by side at the same picture window gazing at the same patch of Lower Manhattan, but we don\u2019t have the same view. Where I see a riot of buildings born of utility and bereft of any unifying aesthetic, he sees a story, a timeline, a testament. While I want to tidy it up somehow, he wants to let it be and breathe. To me, it\u2019s a mess \u2014 an exciting one, but still. To him, it\u2019s a mosaic.\u201cThere is a mix-and-match of the Victorian and 1930 and everything,\u201d he marvels, and if the rapture in his voice is put on, then he\u2019s as much an actor as his friend Jared Leto. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s the result of life, of trying to find the right way to live in New York.\u201d This vantage point, about 10 stories up, is why he stays in this suite in this hotel whenever he\u2019s in New York. It\u2019s his home away from his real home in Rome.When Michele introduced Gucci Bloom, the first new fragrance under his watch, he assembled unconventional ambassadors: Dakota Johnson, best known for being trussed and teased in the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d movies; the young Canadian photographer and video director Petra Collins; and Hari Nef, a transgender actress and model. The Michele message, which never falters, is that the world of luxury is infinitely elastic, that Gucci is a palazzo with room for everybody and that the way to live is together, in harmony, in all of its overstuffed rooms.WHAT TO WEAR? Michele has on a pair of white leather sandals studded with dozens of crystals, sweat socks, frayed jeans and a bulky plaid shirt in baffling tension with the silk scarf above it. He\u2019s a fop. He\u2019s a lumberjack. He\u2019s a hipster. He\u2019s also a Christmas tree, ornamented to a fare-thee-well. He loves jewels, typically wears multiple bracelets and necklaces and has bulbous rings \u2014 one shaped like a fox, another like a wolf \u2014 on all of his fingers except for his thumbs. He\u2019s his own Manhattan, his own mosaic. He\u2019s messy and mesmerizing.Just like his ready-to-wear designs, which jumble elements, patterns, time periods and allusions that were seldom if ever jumbled before: pussy bows on men\u2019s shirts, babushkas atop power suits, sneakers under gowns, stripes with plaids, the old-fashioned meeting the space age. He\u2019s unrestrained with color, promiscuous with layers and gaga for floral patterns, animal imagery and corporate logos. Where Tom Ford\u2019s Gucci \u2014 spanning a decade, beginning in 1994 \u2014 was minimalist, emphasizing glamour, Michele\u2019s is hectic, emphasizing irreverence. I sometimes wonder if he was put on this earth to liberate fashion writers from the adjective \u201csleek\u201d and acquaint them with \u201cmagpie.\u201d\u201cBeauty doesn\u2019t have limits,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have rules.\u201d When he took over at Gucci, he says, \u201cfashion was talking about something that didn\u2019t exist anymore, this kind of posh world of beautiful legs and beautiful hair. I was just talking about humanity. I was trying to find a new energy in the street, not in the jet set.\u201d You still need a certain budget for Gucci. But you don\u2019t need a certain bearing or taste.John socializes with Michele, knows him well and says that Michele\u2019s personality also distinguishes him from others in his industry. \u201cFashion is known for people being divas and being grand,\u201d John says, \u201cand I can think of a lot of fashion designers I wouldn\u2019t want to spend five minutes with. You can probably say 90 percent of them. And he\u2019s just very down-to-earth.\u201dFord\u2019s Gucci was a sensation, its air of hedonism and hypersexuality in perfect sync with the prosperity and libido that defined Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, but during the Giannini years, from 2005 through 2014, the label lost its mooring and its luster. It didn\u2019t turn heads. It didn\u2019t prompt talk. Above all, it didn\u2019t communicate anything specific about its time. Michele\u2019s Gucci, in contrast, is engaged in a consistently spirited and occasionally profound conversation with the zeitgeist, drawing from it, adding to it and revolutionizing fashion in the process. Young consumers plant their flags and sculpt their images on social media, so Gucci, under Michele, does too. They expand and even explode the old parameters around gender, sexual identity, race and nationality, and Michele takes that journey with them, even leads them on it, giving them a uniform for it, a visual vocabulary with which to express it. The emotional genius of what he has done is to affirm their searching. The commercial genius is to create totems for it and, in the process, democratize what we historically called \u201cluxury goods,\u201d a phrase too haute and hoary for the party he\u2019s throwing.27 PhotosFran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chairman and C.E.O. of Kering, which is the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, says that before Michele took the reins, the problem at Gucci wasn\u2019t really sales, which remained respectable. \u201cThe perception of Gucci as a fashion authority, as one of the trendsetters, was declining,\u201d he said. He fired both Giannini and the company\u2019s chief executive officer, who was also her romantic partner and the father of her child, and started over, bringing in the Italian businessman Marco Bizzarri as a new chief executive officer and charging him with finding Giannini\u2019s replacement \u2014 in all likelihood, a fashion nova from another label. When Bizzarri met Michele, then 42, for coffee one day in late December 2014, he was just trying to learn more about the company. Michele, he tells me, \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t on the list of candidates.\u201dMichele was emboldened partly by his knowledge of the size and skill of the design team at Gucci. But mostly, he just didn\u2019t think about the insanity of what he was trying to pull off. \u201cSomebody gave me the chance to do something beautiful, and when you are working on something beautiful, you don\u2019t feel the pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cI work to create something that is in my brain, and I don\u2019t feel like I have to impress people outside.\u201dAt the show\u2019s end, instead of taking a solo bow, Michele brought his whole team onstage with him, which was another declaration that a new day had dawned. Only then did the nerves kick in. \u201cI\u2019m not shy in my private life, but I\u2019m really shy when I have to go out in front of a lot of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m more than shy. I\u2019m terrified.\u201d But the applause, he remembers, \u201cwas like the biggest hug I\u2019ve ever felt in my lifetime.\u201dThe gender fluidity of Michele\u2019s work was what drew the lion\u2019s share of attention at first. \u201cI was very surprised,\u201d he says, because it wasn\u2019t a considered provocation or political statement. \u201cI thought that it was such a normal thing.\u201d It was happening in the world; it needed to happen in fashion: \u201cThis is not a time when fashion can stay inside a box.\u201d Popular culture certainly wasn\u2019t staying inside that box; just a year earlier, the pioneering television dramedy \u201cTransparent\u201d had debuted to enormous interest and huge acclaim, and less than six months later, Caitlyn Jenner would appear on the cover of Vanity Fair. The L.G.B.T. consonant cluster was being elongated, litigated and traded in for more flexible banners like queer and genderqueer, and \u201cbinary\u201d was suddenly a dirty word. Fashion hadn\u2019t fully reckoned with that. Michele did \u2014 intuitively, intelligently and expansively.BUT THAT WAS hardly all that distinguished him. Both the clothes and the voluminous notes that he distributes at the shows betray an erudition and a roving, restless mind that have a lot do with his deep roots in Rome. He grew up in the heart of the city, to parents who revered the arts and had the resources to enjoy them and expose him and his sister to them. His mother was an assistant to an Italian movie executive, and thus steeped in the world of cinema, while his father, a technician for the airline Alitalia, was a sculptor in his spare time. \u201cI walked through these antique ruins from the very first day of my life,\u201d he tells me when I visit him there in June. We sit on a green velvet sofa under a dazzling coffered ceiling in his office in a palazzo that was built in the early 16th century according to plans by Raphael. It\u2019s now Gucci\u2019s design headquarters.Rome is overflowing with the archetypes and iconography of various epochs, layering them, cluttering them, bringing them into collision. When you step out of Gucci\u2019s Renaissance digs and glance to the right, you can see a bridge over the Tiber lined with Baroque sculptures designed by Bernini and, on the far side, the cylindrical hulk of Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, built in the second century by the Roman emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for his family. All of this visibly informs Michele\u2019s perspective and style. \u201cI spent time with my dad not in the park, not playing sports, but just going to museums,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo I spent time in front of these beautiful statues and all these faces and bodies.\u201d\u201cRome is in Alessandro\u2019s veins,\u201d says Elisabetta Proietti, who taught him when he was a student at the Accademia Costume & Moda, a three-year school with a single program in both fashion and costume design just a few short cobbled blocks from the Gucci headquarters. Proietti is continually struck by the impact that the school\u2019s dual focus had on his work. To produce costumes, she says, you must be fluent in the gradations of the past, and Michele\u2019s collections for Gucci are indeed like glorious excavations \u2014 the fashion equivalent of archaeological digs (here the Elizabethan, there the Victorian, a nod to czarist Russia, a wink at Ziggy Stardust) narrated in a century-hopping, decade-scrambling vocabulary of flowing caftans and boxy jumpsuits, floral and animal prints and brocades. His fascination with yesteryear is even more intense than his and other designers\u2019 more common flirtations with the present pop culture. And it\u2019s coupled with his insatiable appetite for reading, roving, learning. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in everything,\u201d Proietti says. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely, extremely curious.\u201dHari Nef recalls that when she first met Michele, at his request, over dinner in West Hollywood at the Chateau Marmont, she had recently graduated from Columbia University, \u201cthis program where I had been required to read Virginia Woolf and the Greek tragedies and Homer and Aeschylus. These were all fresh in my head, bouncing around.\u201d Michele was game. They bounced around in his head, too. \u201cFrankly,\u201d Nef tells me, \u201cthese were nerdy topics I was rarely able to engage with people in the fashion industry about.\u201dHis longtime romantic partner, Giovanni Attili, is a professor of urban planning whose scholarship has focused on such subjects as the Haida Nation, an indigenous tribe in British Columbia. Michele and Attili don\u2019t steal away to Tuscany or the Amalfi Coast for breathers. Instead, their vacation home teeters \u2014 literally \u2014 atop a gorgeous, ludicrous butte of sorts called Civita di Bagnoregio in Central Italy. The village has a year-round population of about a dozen, largely because the earth under it is crumbling and the structures require constant maintenance. \u201cI love the house because it\u2019s like it\u2019s falling down every year,\u201d Michele says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long it will be there. And you don\u2019t care. It\u2019s a reflection of our life, you know?\u201dOn the inside of his left bicep, he has a tattoo of Attili\u2019s nickname, Vanni, while his own, Lallo, is tattooed in the same writing and place on his right arm. They\u2019re a matching set. The couple met 13 years ago, over the internet, in a funny way. Michele had just gotten a new laptop, and a friend was showing him how the Facebook precursor Myspace functioned, insisting that he sign up. \u201cI was aghast at these kinds of things,\u201d he says, but he played along, connecting with one of his friend\u2019s 700 acquaintances \u2014 Attili \u2014 because of his profile picture. \u201cIt was just the view of a beautiful landscape in Canada,\u201d Michele recalls. As the two exchanged messages, Michele remarked that he had no idea what Attili looked like. Attili, amused, pointed out that his face was right there, in that landscape. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Michele says, \u201cthat if you clicked on the picture and made it larger, there was a little guy inside. I didn\u2019t know I had the possibility to get inside that picture. I was really bad.\u201dIN ROME, I WATCH Michele work with about a dozen colleagues on his spring 2019 men\u2019s wear collection, scheduled for presentation in Paris in September. Boxes upon boxes of jewelry crowd the tables where they sit. A kaleidoscope of fabric swatches dangles from the walls, and there\u2019s an easel of potential T-shirt designs that reveal a current fixation on Dolly Parton, her song \u201cJolene\u201d and the movie \u201cThe Bride of Frankenstein.\u201d I have no idea how they all hang together \u2014 but then I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m supposed to.At one point, I ask him which of his collections he was most pleased with \u2014 which one expressed exactly what he wanted it to. He cites the collection with the dragon, his fall 2018 women\u2019s and men\u2019s wear show. It was titled Cyborg, and the dragon wasn\u2019t the half of it. Several models carried replicas of their own heads. Others had masks obscuring their faces. The clothes kept pace with that eccentricity: royal blue turbans, a multitiered black pagoda hat and colorful patterned head scarves. Rhinestones galore. The plainest suit and the palest jacket had Major League Baseball insignia, just because; a ruby sweater with sleeves that looked like enormous, fuzzy dust mops had \u201cParamount Pictures,\u201d with the iconic mountaintop image, across its chest. He says that he was contemplating the nature of identity today: how everything from the poses you strike on social media to the accessibility of cosmetic surgery allows you to hide, expose or wholly transform yourself.\u201cIt\u2019s like a laboratory, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cYour life can be like a laboratory. In the past, the idea of being human was what the earth and nature gave to you.\u201d That\u2019s not so anymore. He calls this era \u201cpost-human,\u201d explaining that \u201cyou can really manipulate everything. It\u2019s pretty scary, but it\u2019s also pretty interesting. You can lead different lives. You can decide to be different things.\u201dI ask him if that makes what he is doing post-fashion. He ponders that for a few seconds, letting it sink in. \u201cProbably it\u2019s true,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause in a way, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t care about fashion. I\u2019m trying to say that fashion is a platform. The way you look is the way you live.\u201d No stranger can decree that. It comes together incrementally and sometimes haphazardly, in a fitful and imperfect process of discovery, the way every story and every city does. Why pretend otherwise? Why not just celebrate it?Models: Maryel Sousa at the Society, William De Courcy at Fusion, Tianna St. Louis at New York Models and Aleece Wilson at Elite.

{"Headline": "Facebook Removes Iranian Network That Was Spreading Disinformation", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow mischief makers in other countries appear to be following the Russian playbook.The company took down more than 82 pages, groups and accounts, including 30 Facebook pages, 33 Instagram accounts and three Facebook groups, it said. About one million users in the United States and Britain followed those accounts.The latest disinformation campaign, which Facebook said was discovered last week, was much smaller than the Russia-linked information operations before and after the 2016 presidential election. Back then, millions of Facebook and Instagram users viewed divisive ads and disinformation that investigators say were created with the aim of widening political and social divisions among Americans.But the type of material released on Friday was remarkably similar. The Iran-linked accounts frequently posted about emotionally charged topics like race relations and President Trump.The posts \u2014 or memes, as they are often called \u2014 hit other hot buttons. One included the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who became a lightning rod for conservative criticism when he protested police violence against black Americans by kneeling during the national anthem before National Football League games. Another, oddly, featured photos of the actor Tom Hanks manipulated so he appeared to be wearing shirts imprinted with various protest slogans.\u201cThe Russian playbook is out in the open,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cSocial media companies are going to have to be more proactive, and Congress is going to have to step up and enact some guardrails so that disinformation and misinformation aren\u2019t able to flourish so readily on these platforms.\u201dFacebook officials did not say on Friday how they had traced the latest batch of disinformation accounts to Iran and added that investigators had not tied them directly to the Iranian government. The company is working with British and American officials and other technology companies on its investigation.But several of the accounts had ties to Iranian state media and pushed opinions aligned with pro-government positions, the company said. Some also had links to the influence network uncovered in August.Less than $100 was spent on two separate ads by the person or people behind the influence operation, and those were paid for in American and Canadian dollars, the company said. That suggests that culprits have moved beyond relying on Facebook advertising to increase the spread of disinformation, said Renee DiResta, director of research at New Knowledge, an organization that studies disinformation campaigns.The posts meant for British users took both sides in the country\u2019s political debates. One post was a meme critical of Prime Minister Theresa May, for example, while another was supportive of the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Similar messages were part of the cache removed by Facebook last month.Calls in Washington for possible regulation of Facebook have grown louder over the past year. The company does not prohibit false news, but prohibits \u201cinauthentic accounts\u201d \u2014 when users misrepresent their identities or create legions of automated bots to spread divisive messages.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has described battling the influence campaigns as an \u201carms race,\u201d and close watchers of the campaigns believe tactics are evolving quickly. The accounts disclosed on Friday appeared to post fewer blatantly pro-Iranian messages than in August, according to a study conducted by the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international affairs.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Primaries Say About the Future of Democrats", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe progressive movement is energized, but there is not much evidence that it is taking over the party. Ms. Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of a book about presidential primaries.During the Democratic primaries this year, the headlines about what was happening in the party were both breathless and contradictory. The most common message, though, was that a segment of the Democrats had lurched far left and was engaged in a \u201ccivil war\u201d with the party establishment. These Democratic Socialists, this version goes, were \u201cconquering\u201d the Democratic Party.Now that the primaries are over, we can make some more definitive conclusions. Bottom line, the progressive movement is energized, but there is not much evidence that it is taking over the Democratic Party or pulling it far to the left.The first thing we noticed is that there were many more self-identified progressives running in 2018 than in 2014 or 2016. In those earlier two elections, 26 percent and 29 percent of Democratic House candidates called themselves progressive; by 2018, 44 percent did. This is compelling evidence of a lively progressive movement within the party.But in spite of their large numbers, progressives did not do as well at the polls as the candidates we identified as establishment Democrats. This past primary season, 140 establishment candidates, or 35 percent of the total establishment candidates, won their primaries, in contrast to 101 progressive Democrats, or 27 percent.Moreover, establishment Democrats tended to win the nomination in districts that are most likely to flip from Democratic to Republican, meaning that the House Democratic Caucus that meets next January will probably be composed of fewer progressives than would be indicated by their numbers on the ballot. In congressional districts that are evenly matched or slightly Republican, there are more establishment challengers than progressive challengers. More solid Republican districts, however, have a relatively large number of progressive nominees. In these districts, it is more difficult for a Democrat to win \u2014 unless the blue wave turns into a blue tsunami.As all this shows, the Democratic Party is not having a big left-wing shift. So what is the real news from the primary season?First, a new generation is entering Democratic politics, and many of them are female. In 2014 only 21 percent of House Democratic challengers were women, but by 2018 33 percent were. The new issue was Medicare for All. In our review of the congressional candidates, this was endorsed much more often by progressive candidates than by establishment ones. But this is not as divisive an issue as some would make it out to be. Democratic Party platforms have called for universal health care for decades.Buy-in to Medicare for those over 55 years old was considered by the Democratic Congress in 2009 and lost narrowly. Medicare for All will be debated if the Democrats return to power. But in the meantime, it is not the kind of idea that will cause a civil war inside the Democratic caucus. As we go into the November elections, the notion that the Democratic Party has been captured by the extreme left simply doesn\u2019t hold water.Elaine Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cPrimary Politics: Everything You Need to Know About How America Nominates Its Presidential Candidates.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sommelier Finds Room to Breathe", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe stresses and demands of restaurant work eventually compel many, like Patrick Cappiello, to seek out other careers in wine. Mr. Cappiello\u2019s journey from leading sommelier to wine entrepreneur is not unusual.Yet the actual hard work \u2014 schlepping boxes, stocking shelves, doing inventory and working nights on the restaurant floor \u2014 makes a career as a sommelier seem temporary at best, a means to another, longer-term job in wine or beyond.A story like Mr. Cappiello\u2019s typifies the career trajectory of the modern sommelier, who, after a decade or so of the intense, adrenaline-fueled restaurant life, capitalizes on reputation and a network of connections to find a possibly less demanding, more fulfilling niche in the wine business.Through the 1980s, few restaurants in the United States had sommeliers. The popular notion of the job was of the formal French wine server, who condescended to insecure consumers while trying to upsell them.Pretty soon no corner bistro worth its steak frites could be without a wine guru, and the status of sommeliers rose as they become crucial educators and influencers in the chain from vineyard to dining table.\u201cWe saw the transition happening with all these people,\u201d Mr. Cappiello said.Recently, he hired Roger Dagorn, himself an influential sommelier of the 1980s, most identified with Chanterelle in TriBeCa, and later on with Tocqueville and 15 East near Union Square.\u201cAfter Rebelle closed, I was kind of deflated,\u201d he said. \u201cI began to try to figure out what I was going to do with my life.\u201dWhen Gilt closed in 2012, Mr. Cappiello was already planning Pearl & Ash, which opened in 2013. Rebelle opened two doors away in 2015. By then, however, he had already seen how his mentors had begun to diversify their careers, particularly as they reached their 40s, often with young families.\u201cThe diversity of the job can be joyous but also stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly as a manager, you\u2019re driving customer service, doing Excel spreadsheets, inventory, accounting, it\u2019s a lot of things, which is invigorating but difficult for young people who think it\u2019s just talking about wine.\u201dTogether, they sought to carve out a specific role for the company by asking the question, \u201cWhat needs do our producers have that aren\u2019t being met?\u201d Their answer: logistics.For small producers in particular, whether in Europe or California, selling wine in the United States is daunting. Each state has its own rules, its own bureaucracy.\u201cThe reason wines are often hard to find has little to do with how little is made,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s paperwork. It\u2019s overwhelming, and that\u2019s why a lot of them give up. We can help small-production labels with that.\u201dHe says his philosophy is both California\u2019s past and his own. His goal is simple: refreshing wines that can sell from $15 to $20 a bottle, a much-neglected price range in California.\u201cI\u2019m influenced by everything I drank as a kid: 40 ounce malt liquor, sneaking white zin from my parents\u2019 fridge,\u201d he said.In addition to a fresh, savory syrah, he is making a white zinfandel \u2014 not the sweet, cloying mass-market kind, but a fresh, incisive style \u2014 and, most interestingly, a red made of the rubired, a little-known but common grape in the Central Valley, used primarily in cheap wines and coloring agents like Mega Purple, a ubiquitous tool in California for darkening pale reds.He said he discovered rubired while seeking out wine for a canned project, and was surprised how delicious it was.\u201cWhen they feel the stresses,\u201d he said, \u201cthey do see the future of working in a different way in the wine world.\u201d Advertisement"}

A white landowner for whom the Malcoms and the Dorseys sharecropped was driving the couples back to his farm after posting Mr. Malcom\u2019s bond when a mob seized the four African-Americans, tied them to a tree and riddled their bodies with bullets. Members of the mob wore no masks, but the farmer said he could not identify any of them. Black sharecroppers, who were virtually owned by white farmers for whom they worked, were terrified to say if they had seen anything. In the end, she wrote: \u201cTwenty-five F.B.I. agents, four months of investigation, 2,790 people interviewed, 106 people subpoenaed before the grand jury \u2014 and then no indictments.
