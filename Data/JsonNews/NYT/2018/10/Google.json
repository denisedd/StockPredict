{"Headline": "Supreme Court Weighs Google Settlement That Paid Class Members Nothing", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a lively and freewheeling argument on Wednesday, the Supreme Court considered whether it should place limits on class-action settlements in which the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers receive millions and their clients get nothing. In the process, several justices mused about the nature of privacy in the digital age.The case arose from an $8.5 million settlement between Google and class-action lawyers who said the company had violated its users\u2019 privacy rights. Under the settlement, the lawyers were paid more than $2 million, but members of the class received no money.Instead, the company agreed to make contributions to institutions concerned with privacy on the internet, including centers at Harvard, Stanford and Chicago-Kent College of Law, and AARP, the group once known as the American Association of Retired Persons.\u201cHow can you say that it makes any sense?\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked a lawyer for the members of the class.\u201cThe attorneys get money, and a lot of it,\u201d Justice Alito said. \u201cThe class members get no money whatsoever. And money is given to organizations that they may or may not like and that may or may not ever do anything that is of even indirect benefit to them.\u201dChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested that paying charities rather than plaintiffs was a recipe for abuse. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s just a little bit fishy that the money goes to a charity,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat Google had contributed to in the past?\u201dThe chief justice added that he was particularly puzzled by the award to AARP, noting that it \u201cengages in political activity, having nothing to do with the inability of elderly people to conduct searches\u201d on the internet.Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said he was concerned about \u201cthe appearance of favoritism\u201d given that some of the grant recipients were schools the lawyers in the case had attended.But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said paying money to class members was not always possible, as the sums at issue were sometimes too small to justify the cost of distributing them. Payments to charities were preferable to trying to pay pennies to members of the class, she said. \u201cPractically,\u201d she said, \u201cthe class members would get nothing, nothing at all, and here at least they get an indirect benefit.\u201dTheodore H. Frank filed an objection to the settlement, saying it provided members of the class with \u201cno money, no alteration of the defendant\u2019s allegedly injurious conduct, not even coupons.\u201dMr. Frank said few people submit claims in class-action settlements. Using typical response rates, he said, members of the class could have received $5 to $10 each.Even a lottery, Mr. Frank said, would have been a better way to compensate the class.Justice Kavanaugh seemed to agree. \u201cImperfect or strange as that may be,\u201d he said, \u201cit seems to me potentially less strange, or why isn\u2019t it less strange than giving it to people who weren\u2019t injured at all, who have affiliations with the counsel and who in many cases don\u2019t need the money?\u201dJeffrey A. Lamken, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, Frank v. Gaos, No. 17-961, said the payments to charities were sensible and proper.\u201cIt is not at all even remotely the case that this is not benefiting the class,\u201d he said. The programs supported by the grants, he said, were \u201ctargeted precisely to the type of injury and precisely the type of problem, privacy invasion, that that class is subjected to.\u201dSeveral justices appeared unsure about whether members of the class had suffered the sort of injury that gave them standing to sue. The case concerned Google\u2019s disclosure of search terms to websites, and opinions varied about whether that harmed anyone.Justice Kavanaugh said such disclosures could be a problem. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would want the disclosure of everything they searched for disclosed to other people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems a harm.\u201dJustice Alito was curious about what Google did with his search information.\u201cAll of us have probably done searches,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I do a search and search for men\u2019s shoes, I will immediately get all sorts of advertisements for men\u2019s shoes or whatever other product I am searching for.\u201dAndrew J. Pincus, a lawyer for Google, said that issue was not part of the case, which concerned what he called \u201cthe referrer header.\u201d\u201cWhen you conduct a search, you get a list of websites,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you click on one of those sites, that site gets your search.\u201dThat, Mr. Pincus said, hurts no one. \u201cThe mere disclosure of a search without more, your men\u2019s shoes search, is not a harm because there\u2019s no disclosure that you\u2019re making the search. It\u2019s a disclosure that somebody searched for men\u2019s shoes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " Paris on Foot: 35 Miles, 6 Days and One Blistered Toe", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA journey around the perimeter of Paris, exploring neighborhoods well off the tourist-beaten path, revealed a city at once familiar and yet startlingly new.I did not visit the Latin Quarter, the Marais, or Montparnasse. I skipped the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and the Eiffel Tower. I neglected to slurp oysters at Le Procope, eat ice cream at Berthillon, or stroll along the banks of the Seine \u2014 though I crossed the oxbowed river several times along un-famous bridges. In all, I notched some 35 miles (resuming my journey each morning by taking the M\u00e9tro roughly to where I\u2019d left off the previous day), a trek that included centrifugal excursions into the collar suburbs and occasional dips into the outer precincts of the city proper.During six days of wandering under miraculously cloudless skies this past May, I saw a Paris that was at turns familiar \u2014 the workaday brasseries and tabacs, the bakeries with their yeasty aromas and morning chitchat, the busy traffic circles \u2014 and eye-poppingly new to me: a vast and messy urban agglomeration that\u2019s home to the great majority of metropolitan Paris\u2019s 10 million residents.The walk had been conceived as a lark, a free-form perambulation in a city I\u2019d spent so much time in that I\u2019d ceased to see it with fresh eyes. But it turns out I\u2019d stumbled into a full-fledged civic movement. In fact, an extensive effort is afoot to redraw the political, social and cultural boundaries of Paris, to explode what the author Mira Kamdar, who lives in the suburb of Pantin, has called \u201cthe implacable logic of center and periphery, of included and excluded.\u201d The reality is more complicated, of course. The edges of Paris and the patchwork of towns just beyond are fascinating and variegated, ranging from dense immigrant enclaves and repurposed industrial sites to leafy bastions of bourgeois comfort. Yes, I encountered imposing high-rise apartment blocks, but just as often I found myself strolling through a wooded park, along a disused rail line reclaimed as a pedestrian thoroughfare, or down a sleepy main street that could have belonged to a market village in rural France.I emailed Mr. Charles and Mr. Delourme before my trip, and they invited me to meet them at their \u201ctemporary offices in petit Paris,\u201d which turned out to be a cafe on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis. Over the course of an hour and a half, the two bearded 40-somethings \u2014 one a journalist, the other a film and TV producer \u2014 engaged me in a highly caffeinated disquisition about the heralds of a new era for Le Grand Paris: a suburbs-only M\u00e9tro line under construction beyond the outskirts of the city; the extension of the 12-year-old beltway tram circuit; the recent elimination of concentric fee zones for public transportation; the new Jean Nouvel-designed Paris Philharmonic, which stands in the shadow of the P\u00e9riph; a massive government reshuffling called Le M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, which has given outer municipalities a greater voice in decision-making; and on and on. Not surprisingly, the two men also heaped upon me dozens of suggestions for my exploration.About that exploration: It yielded the kind of unexpected discoveries \u2014 virtually all of them easily accessible by M\u00e9tro or tram for those uninterested in a 35-mile ramble \u2014 that I had all but given up hope of finding in hyper-gentrified tourist magnets like Paris. To cite just a few (a handful of which I owe to the Enlarge Your Paris guys, the others to happenstance): I hiked in a forest, had a close encounter with the actual embalmed heart of Louis XVII and listened to a cumbia band in an immense former marble factory alongside French hipsters drinking American I.P.A.s. I gazed in awe at some of the most ugly-beautiful Brutalist buildings I\u2019d ever seen, ate an exquisitely poached filet of whiting with spring peas at a serene restaurant where the bread comes in a miniature burlap sack, and ambled around an empty museum filled with sleek 1930s furniture that, in the absence of any other visitors or even (as far as I could tell) a guard, I found exceedingly hard not to sit on.If a single observation stands out from that first, long day\u2019s walk, which ended just before sunset in Pantin, alongside the recently restored and promenade-lined Canal de l\u2019Ourcq \u2014 a site Mr. Delourme had referred to more than once as \u201cthe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Le Grand Paris\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that Paris\u2019s edge areas have for the past century served as a vast laboratory for bold and occasionally bonkers architecture.Inside, I explored the church\u2019s magnificently creepy necropolis, which houses the crypts of France\u2019s kings dating back to Dagobert I in the seventh century. I found being surrounded by the sarcophogi of hundreds of dead monarchs to be exponentially more interesting than my visits to Paris\u2019s more renowned basilica, Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, which receives 10.5 million visitors a year in comparison to Saint-Denis\u2019s mere 134,000. To wit: I was able to enjoy several uninterrupted minutes in the presence of a child-king\u2019s shriveled heart, so close my breath was fogging the vitrine.I should point out that not every segment of my walk was filled with such memorable moments. In fact, if I had to put a fine point on it, Day 3 was pretty much devoid of them: a sun-hammered slog along warehouse-lined streets that took me much deeper into the northwestern suburbs than I\u2019d planned to go, thanks to a series of ill-considered route choices based on cursory glances at Google Maps on my phone. That day\u2019s journey ended with a sore-footed, late-afternoon arrival at La D\u00e9fense, its sparkling glass towers rising above me with monolithic indifference. Exhausted, I descended into the M\u00e9tro and rode Line 1 for nearly its entire length, west to east, across Paris\u2019s midsection to get back to my hotel. There, I had dinner at a cheap sushi place, collapsed on my bed, and fell asleep with the TV on.By comparison, the next day \u2014 which began with another long ride on Line 1, this time east to west, depositing me back at the La D\u00e9fense terminal \u2014 brought abundant splendors and comforts. Foremost among them: the Bois de Boulogne. What a tonic this 2,000-acre urban forest and prairie is, with its coolly shaded footpaths snaking through stands of Austrian pine. The Fondation Vuitton has been elevated, rightly, in the French media as a gleaming symbol of an outer-Paris renaissance, as has the almost-as-costly Philharmonie de Paris, which opened at the opposite extremity of the city in 2015. That evening, after returning to my hotel to swap my Sauconys for a fairly new pair of Converse that would have to pass as dress shoes, I\u2019d see the Paris Orchestra perform there. Ensconced in the Parc de la Villette, Jean Nouvel\u2019s creation cuts a striking silhouette: a wedgelike, vaguely biomorphic rejection of symmetry that\u2019s approached via a wide uphill esplanade paved with tiles in the same bird shape as those cladding the orchestra hall itself. The whole setup creates a convivial feeling of pilgrimage as throngs of well-heeled, perfumed Parisians stroll en masse from the tram station to the entrance.If central Paris were a face, my route on Days 5 and 6 would look like a frilly ruff collar, swooping back and forth across the city\u2019s southern boundary. By this point, I\u2019d really hit my stride. My blister had healed, my pace had quickened and interesting things seemed to present themselves with uncanny frequency.In the suburb of Montrouge, I visited a shop earnestly named La Boutique du Futur, which sold notionally useful novelty items \u2014 made by a freelance industrial designer and a former IT professional in a cluttered workshop in the basement \u2014 like a corkscrew made from a cow bone and (their best-seller) a baby spoon shaped like an airplane. (Its name: Babyplane.) In Gentilly, the next suburb over, I discovered an enormous but impeccably curated wine-and-spirits shop, called Caves Fillot, housed in a former winery that still had the bewitching, musty smell of aging barrels.Beyond the river lay the homestretch, a jaunt of less than a mile that took me from Left Bank to Right across the Pont National, then past an immense SNCF train yard and what appeared to be a homeless encampment \u2014 complete with tents and cook fires, a sight that harkened back to Atget\u2019s photos of Roma families \u2014 and, finally, on toward the Porte Dor\u00e9e and my hotel.That night, the last of my trip, I decided to take the M\u00e9tro back to the eastern suburb of Montreuil, which I\u2019d heard described, for better or worse, as the \u201cBrooklyn of Paris.\u201d I\u2019d skirted it on my very first day but hadn\u2019t noticed much beyond takeout joints and graffiti. Now, as I popped out of the M\u00e9tro, the suburb seemed transformed: A small public park behind the town hall was heaving with young families, many of them clustered around a makeshift bar that had been strung with holiday lights and furnished with what looked like lawn furniture. A few blocks beyond that was La Marbrerie, the marble factory-turned-music venue, a spot that a Parisian friend of mine had recommended. The cumbia band was in full swing, and a few dozen people, ranging in age from 20 to 60, were dancing with the kind of joyful abandon I typically associate with weddings.After a couple of beers, the physical rigors of my weeklong trek started to make me feel like I had sandbags lashed to my limbs. So I splurged on a cab back to the hotel. As the driver eased onto the P\u00e9riph, flowing smoothly at this late hour, I had the thought that the highway, which I\u2019d crossed over and under so many times on my walk, no longer felt like much of a barrier at all.DAVID McANINCH is the author of \u201cDuck Season: Eating, Drinking and Other Misadventures in Gascony, France\u2019s Last Best Place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community.Then:During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.Toyota and Honda have both announced partnerships on autonomous vehicles \u2014 showing how difficult the technology is to develop, even for the world\u2019s biggest automakers.Driverless cars promise to redefine the multibillion-dollar auto industry, and the costs of bringing them to market are too big for almost any company to handle independently. \u201cSoftBank alone and automakers alone can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank\u2019s chief technology officer, said.The bill proposes breaking up financial institutions with exposure to more than 3 percent of America\u2019s G.D.P. \u2014 equivalent to about $584 billion in assets.

California\u2019s legislature concedes that the law could be unconstitutional. Its requirements may not apply to companies chartered elsewhere. (A big loophole: By one estimate, the only Fortune 500 company affected is Apple.) And sudden disruption could hurt companies\u2019 performance.Joe Grundfest of Stanford, a longtime advocate for increasing board diversity, said of the move, \u201cI fear the cure is worse than the disease.\u201dAndrew\u2019s suggestion? Individual investors, big and small, pressing boards to diversify:Firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, are already working to effect change. BlackRock has told companies that it wants to see at least two female board members at the companies it invests in. Calpers wrote to 504 companies in 2017 asking them to improve diversity, and has voted against directors at companies that have failed to respond to its requests. Hopefully, the constant drumbeat on this topic will only drive additional responsible companies to make progress.Mr. Flannery was supposed to turn G.E.\u2019s fortunes around. But like his predecessor, Jeff Immelt, he\u2019ll be handing over a lot of problems: G.E. says it is taking a $23 billion write-down in its power business, and its financial arm and pension fund are messes.A renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump advisers argue, removes the possibility that a trade war could break out on the continent and will make North America a more attractive place for investment.When combined with U.S. tariffs against China, which boost the costs of production there, foreign companies will start moving investment out of China, the administration calculates. That would weaken China\u2019s ability to produce next-generation technology and put additional pressure on Beijing to make trade concessions sought by the U.S.Mr. Trump appears happy to play a long game. \u201cChina wants to talk very badly,\u201d he said at a news conference yesterday. \u201cI said frankly it\u2019s too early to talk, because they\u2019re not ready.\u201dMr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options. The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Many who put down deposits may be waiting for the more affordable base model.Charles Schwab turned his budget-basement retail brokerage into an investment giant that manages over $3.6 trillion of customer money. But fintech start-ups are after those customers.While tech is becoming ever more dominant, Bettinger says the human element is what will help the company ward off the threats posed by online competitors. When it comes to financial services, he says, clients ultimately want to talk to a live person \u2014 in a web chat, on the phone, or at a branch office. In 2016, less than a year after introducing its robo-adviser, Charles Schwab began offering fee-based personal consultations for accounts of at least $25,000.Companies such as Ant Financial or Amazon, which analysts have speculated will eventually move into finance, would be challenged to build those kinds of offerings at Charles Schwab\u2019s scale, Bettinger says. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that we\u2019re a blend of Amazon and Nordstrom,\u201d he says.Harvard Business School received 9,886 applications for this fall\u2019s entering class, down 4.5 percent from last year \u2014 the biggest drop since 2005. Applications to Wharton fell 6.7 percent to 6,245. At Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, they slid 4.6 percent to 7,797. Such top schools are still receiving many more applications than they can accept, but the declines mark a reversal after years of growth.Reasons for the slump?

{"Headline": "December\u2019s Book Club Pick: Casey Gerald\u2019s memoir, \u2018There Will Be No Miracles Here\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read ThisWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.There we were, about a thousand people gathered at the 2016 TED conference, waiting for the very last speaker of a weeklong lineup of exceptional humans. The session\u2019s host announced that the speaker would be Casey Gerald, who swaggered onto the stage, an athletically built, baldheaded and clean-shaven black man dressed in all black. Gerald stood, backdropped by velvet curtains, waited for the applause to quiet, and then began sharing an anecdote about the time when, on New Year\u2019s Eve 1999, he sat in a church with his grandmother and her congregation, fearing that when the clock struck midnight, the rapture would commence.Gerald went on to share stories from a journey that began when he was a boy in a blighted Dallas neighborhood and spanned up to his role as the cynosure of a room comprising no small number of the 1 percent. Near the end of his talk, Gerald announced the disbandment of MBAs Across America, an organization he co-founded to connect business students with entrepreneurs around the country. He also proclaimed that he was shirking the role of savior that had been foisted upon him, \u201cbecause our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is, that there will be no miracles here.\u201dGerald\u2019s magnificent memoir, \u201cThere Will Be No Miracles Here,\u201d opens with the same anecdote that began his TED talk, though in the book, he punctuates the retelling by announcing a kind of thesis. \u201cMine, then, is the story of a peasant boy...and, with luck, God and His miracles or lack thereof,\u201d he writes. Indeed, in just over three decades, what a phenomenal life the self-proclaimed peasant boy has lived.He spent his early childhood in Ohio, where his father had been a football star at Ohio State University. When Gerald was 8 years old, his father moved the family, which includes his older sister and mother, back to their hometown \u2014 the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. Back home, Gerald\u2019s father began working for his father, who is, as Gerald puts it, involved in \u201cthe greatest business in America: the business of saving souls.\u201dThe successes of Gerald\u2019s grandfather proved enough to turn Gerald\u2019s father into his \u201csupplicant.\u201d Meanwhile, Gerald\u2019s mother, whom he describes as a woman of curious habits, stayed at home applying makeup for a fair amount of the day. We learn early on that she suffered from manic depression and bipolar disorder, that his father developed a drug habit, one that landed him in prison, and that his older sister assumed the role of his caretaker. Gerald\u2019s mother disappeared later, leaving him to wonder for years whether she had died.Around this time, Gerald started to explore his sexual identity with the help of a new thing called the internet. He did it in secret, since, as he puts it, \u201cI was in the early stages of crafting a new life, or a new story, in the image of perfection.\u201d He also began playing sports, although his athletic success wasn\u2019t immediate. In a hilarious passage, he describes a youth football game where the defense kept blocking his end-zone attempts right around the line of scrimmage. \u201cGoddamn it, son!\u201d his coach said. \u201cListen to me. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. You\u2019re embarrassing your family. Get your ass low, keep your eyes open, and run for your life!\u201dGerald lived an itinerant existence in high school until his sister, who had briefly escaped to college, returned to Dallas and insisted the two live together. They scraped by until Gerald came up with a scheme to supplement his sister\u2019s meager income by cashing the disability checks of their missing mother. After a year of this, the siblings discovered the account had been shut down, a fact that ended their hustle but also suggested their missing mother was alive. His sister located her in St. Louis, and they drove to pick her up.While all of this domestic chaos was going on, Gerald evolved into a celebrated scholar athlete, one recruited by the Yale University football team. And though he hadn\u2019t heard of Yale before that recruitment, he decided to attend the school in the belief that his acceptance had transmuted him into a symbol, into the great pride of his school, town, people.Fueled in part by an intent to surpass Yale\u2019s black bourgeoisie, he and a few friends established the Yale Black Men\u2019s Union. He later joined Wolf\u2019s Head, one of the college\u2019s oldest and most esteemed secret societies. Meanwhile, his football cohort matured from a crew of bench warmers into starters on some of the best teams in Yale history. Gerald became not only a team star but a finalist for the Draddy Trophy, which honors the nation\u2019s top scholar athlete, as well as a finalist for a Rhodes scholarship. One of the book\u2019s most engrossing moments involves the crisis of having his Rhodes interview scheduled on the same day as the Yale-Harvard game.At times Gerald moves too quickly to the next scene or idea, when he might have benefited from a more sustained explanation of his thinking. On the other hand, he just might have crafted a consummate 21st-century memoir for readers whose brains have been rewired by Google, their attention always under siege. Gerald also pushes stylistic conventions, with short passages where he writes about himself in the third person or directly addresses the reader. He includes metanarratives as well as letters, emails and speeches. And ever present is the enchantment of his voice, one that is at turns exuberant, humorous, unsentimental, imaginative, keen. While Gerald\u2019s style is engaging, the locus of the book is his extraordinary journey.A few years before Gerald suffered the terror of believing he\u2019d been left behind in the rapture, his fifth-grade teacher assigned him to write a speech titled \u201cI\u2019m the Mayor Now and This Is My New Plan.\u201d Gerald explains that since he was unsure whether he had to deliver the speech from memory, he \u201cassumed the worst.\u201d He enlists some of his sister\u2019s friends to help him brainstorm and writes the speech from his notes.

{"Headline": "Beto O\u2019Rourke Attacks Ted Cruz as \u2018Dishonest\u2019 in Debate in Senate Race", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who has fallen behind Senator Ted Cruz in the polls in their hotly contested Senate race, turned sharply aggressive in their second debate on Tuesday night as he attacked Mr. Cruz\u2019s honesty and character while the two clashed over abortion, climate change and other red-versus-blue divides.Using phrases like \u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201call talk and no action,\u201d and questioning whether the senator had delivered any results for Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke took his most personal shot at his opponent when Mr. Cruz expressed skepticism about climate change and argued that Mr. O\u2019Rourke supported higher taxes on oil. The congressman invoked an attack line that Donald J. Trump had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race.\u201cSenator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest, and it\u2019s why the president called him Lyin\u2019 Ted, and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2014 because it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied.In their first debate last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz\u2019s recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent \u201cthe only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.\u201d He added that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke had his way, there would be \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus\u201d aimed at ousting the president.Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.\u201cListen,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cif you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy\u2019s success.\u201cHave you noticed in this debate he doesn\u2019t talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBecause he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.\u201dOnly once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated \u2014 but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, \u201cThere is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.\u201d When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me, Jason,\u201d and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.\u201cThe personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I\u2019ve tried not to engage in,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O\u2019Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.On Wednesday morning, President Trump weighed in on the debate, declaring his support for Mr. Cruz and calling Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201ca flake\u2019\u2019 who was \u201cnot in the same league with Ted Cruz.\u2019\u2019The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were \u201cunder attack\u201d more than \u201cany other time in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian\u2019s interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to \u201cstand up\u201d to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on \u201cpolitical bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google\u201d and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.\u201cThe #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.\u201d As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O\u2019Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour \u201con national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.\u201dThe network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O\u2019Rourke campaign agreed to the change.It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night\u2019s debate was the final one.Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party\u2019s nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign\u2019s missteps.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.\u201cHe\u2019s probably running the best campaign that\u2019s been run in Texas in my lifetime,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in Texas in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m on his Facebook.

Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.On Tuesday night, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O\u2019Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pass, I don\u2019t know how to get you through,\u201d the attendant told Mr. O\u2019Rourke. His wife, Amy O\u2019Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.\u201cThis is how you know it\u2019s real,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O\u2019Rourke in.\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201dHe rolled up the window.\u201cWe passed the first hurdle,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Says It Will Sell Pentagon Artificial Intelligence and Other Advanced Technology", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the divergent paths also underscore concerns inside the American defense and intelligence establishments about how the United States will take on a rising China.In the past two years, the Chinese government has set goals for dominance in the next decade in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other technologies that it believes will allow its military and intelligence agencies to surpass those of the United States. Pentagon officials have questioned how committed domestic technology companies are to keeping the country on the leading edge, the way Raytheon, Boeing, IBM and McDonnell Douglas did during the Cold War.Even before Friday\u2019s announcement, Microsoft seemed like the only plausible alternative for the Pentagon\u2019s giant cloud project, called JEDI, in which Amazon is considered the front-runner.But the announcement by Microsoft may have a greater effect on future technologies, including warning systems and weapons powered by artificial intelligence. And the company\u2019s leadership, after brief debates this summer, concluded that by dropping out of the bidding, Google was also losing any real influence in how the weapons would be used.\u201cThis was not a hard decision,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview in his office. \u201cMicrosoft was born in the United States, is headquartered in the United States, and has grown up with all the benefits that have long come from being in this country.\u201dBut Mr. Smith seemed to be trying to strike a middle ground.He has sued the United States government repeatedly to halt Washington\u2019s efforts to gain access to customer information stored on the company\u2019s servers, and he is pressing for new international agreements to limit how the United States and its adversaries can use cyberweapons.He also argued in the blog post that \u201cto withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in a responsible way.\u201d\u201cWe are not going to withdraw from the future,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith\u2019s comments stood in sharp contrast to statements by Google this month. When the company dropped out of the competition for the JEDI cloud computing contract, officials said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be assured that it would align with our A.I. principles,\u201d a reference to a set of principles issued in June in which the company vowed not to design artificial intelligence products that would be used to harm people, or for surveillance or armaments. The contract is believed to amount to about $10 billion over a decade, but the shape of cloud computing that far into the future is hard to predict.Some industry experts saw Google\u2019s statement as an effort to gain political credit for backing out of a competition it was unlikely to win. Unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Google is missing some of the government certifications it would need to provide the software to the military.Microsoft is believed to have a good shot, in part because President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and the owner of The Washington Post. But even as Mr. Trump frequently dismisses the \u201cAmazon Washington Post,\u201d Amazon is considered the front-runner for the contract, in large part because of the company\u2019s experience in building the C.I.A.\u2019s cloud computing ability over the last five years. In an analysis published in June, Deutsche Bank Research concluded that Amazon \u201cis best positioned to win the lion\u2019s share of the JEDI contract\u201d and that Microsoft was the \u201cmain challenger.\u201dCulturally, Google and Microsoft are far different; while some Microsoft employees have expressed unhappiness with the company\u2019s government contracts, most recently with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the protests among Google engineers and other employees were far more intense and far more public.Microsoft has been far more willing, however, to challenge the government. It went to court to try to keep the United States from being able to subpoena Microsoft for the emails or other records of customers whose data was stored abroad. (The suit was rendered moot by federal legislation.) It has been pressing for a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that would, like the traditional Geneva Convention, wall off certain civilian targets. The United States government has resisted the idea so far, not wanting to limit a president\u2019s options to use cyberweapons against power grids or other targets on which civilians depend.\u201cWe can\u2019t control how the U.S. military uses our technology once we give it to them,\u201d Mr. Smith argued. \u201cBut the military is subject to civilian control. And we believe we will have an opportunity to influence those discussions \u2014 but it\u2019s not up to us.\u201dBut to a large degree, the import of Microsoft\u2019s announcement has more to do with the politics of confronting China and less to do with its immediate prospects.The Pentagon has struggled in recent years to bring the Silicon Valley innovation to new weapons systems and sensors. The acquisition and testing process is so long that many high-tech systems are outdated by the time they begin. While the Obama administration succeeded in creating an outpost in Silicon Valley, called DIUx, or Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, its budget was small and some promising off-the-shelf technologies \u2014 for example, small, inexpensive satellites that could be fired in large numbers over North Korea to detect mobile launchers \u2014 have been delayed for years.But the next challenge facing both the government and the companies is whether American-based companies will be limited in what kind of artificial intelligence technologies they can sell to China.In his interview, Mr. Smith would not indicate whether Microsoft would also provide all of its products to, say, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue we are going to have to work through,\u201d he said. But the reality, he and other executives in the technology field have noted, is that the Chinese would not accept American-made artificial intelligence code, for fear that the United States would turn off Chinese access to the cloud services in a time of conflict.Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Karen Weise from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problems With Britain\u2019s New Digital Tax", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UK\u2019s finance minister has taken the plunge with a new plan for taxing technology giants \u2014 but it is flawed.Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Monday unveiled a 2 percent tax on the revenue that big search engines, social-media platforms and online marketplaces earn in the country.The digital-services tax appears to target Amazon, Facebook and the Alphabet business Google. All of those companies have been criticized for shifting revenue and costs between jurisdictions, allowing them to minimize profit where tax would otherwise be burdensome. Operating in the virtual world \u2014 and with the resources available to three of the six largest public companies on the planet \u2014 makes that easier than for traditional businesses that have a physical presence.The European Union is considering a similar tax at 3 percent. That is billed as a stopgap, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working on a revamp of cross-border tax rules that would allow the value added to a virtual business by a country\u2019s citizens \u2014 be it via their data or online purchases \u2014 to be identified and taxed in that jurisdiction. But that\u2019s a long shot.Meanwhile, there are problems with Mr. Hammond\u2019s measure.First, the tax may not be aggressive enough. Take Facebook as an example: It generated over 2.2 billion British pounds, or about $2.9 billion, of British digital ad revenue in 2017, according to the market research company eMarketer. A 2 percent slice of that would have earned the government some \u00a345 million. Facebook\u2019s British subsidiary had a bill for cash corporate taxes of just \u00a316 million in the same year.That looks like a step in the right direction. But Facebook\u2019s consolidated pretax profit margin topped 50 percent last year. Assume the same for the United Kingdom under a new global regime with a 20 percent tax on profit, and the company could have been on the hook for well over \u00a3200 million. So it might be better for companies to take a chances with Mr. Hammond\u2019s levy.Another difficulty is that the biggest companies caught by such a tax are based in the United States. Rightly or not, that smacks of protectionism, sour grapes or both. And Washington has little incentive to negotiate, especially if it might lose some of its own tax revenue.Mr. Hammond is also risking a backlash just as Britain heads for Brexit. It\u2019s bold to try to provoke wider change \u2014 but in this case, it might not work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Blockchain Could Break Big Tech\u2019s Hold on A.I.", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pairing artificial intelligence and the blockchain might be what you would expect from a scammer looking to make a quick buck in 2018.The two concepts, after all, are two of the most buzzed about and least understood ideas in the tech universe.Despite how easy the combination is to mock, the idea of applying the blockchain to artificial intelligence is attracting a growing roster of serious entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, many of them with impressive academic credentials.Professor Song, Dr. Goertzel and other entrepreneurs say they believe the blockchain could encourage a broader distribution of the data and algorithms that will determine the future development of artificial intelligence.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have machine learning capabilities that are more under the user\u2019s control, rather than relying on these big companies to get access to these capabilities,\u201d Professor Song said in an interview.The start-ups working toward this goal are applying blockchains in a number of ways. At the most basic level, just as the blockchain allows money to be moved around without any bank or central authority in the middle, artificial intelligence experts are hoping that a blockchain can allow artificial intelligence networks to access large stores of data without any big company in control of the data or the algorithms.Several start-ups are setting up blockchain-based marketplaces, where people can buy and sell data.Unlike Google and Facebook, which store the data they get from users, the marketplaces built on Ocean Protocol will not have the data themselves; they will just be places for people with data to meet, ensuring that no central player can access or exploit the data.The goal, Mr. McConaghy said, is to \u201cdecentralize access to data before it\u2019s too late.\u201dOcean is working with several automakers to collect data from cars to help create the artificial intelligence of autonomous cars. All the automakers are expected to share data so none of them have a monopoly over it.Another start-up, Revel, will pay people to collect the data that companies are looking for, like pictures of taxis or recordings of a particular language. Users can also let their phones and computers be used to process and categorize the images and sounds \u2014 all in exchange for digital tokens. Over a thousand people already have put their computers to work.These sorts of marketplaces are only the outer layer of the blockchain-based systems that are being built to handle artificial intelligence data.One of the biggest concerns that people have about the data being collected by Google and Facebook is the access it gives these companies to the most private details of our lives.Professor Song is working on a blockchain, known as Oasis, that will use advanced techniques to secure the data being bought and sold, so that no one \u2014 not even the company using the data \u2014 will get a copy of it.In the Oasis network, all data moving through the system will be locked into encrypted bundles. Researchers will be able to run the data through their machine learning algorithms \u2014 and prove that the calculations were done correctly \u2014 without ever actually seeing the underlying data.One project building on top of Oasis, known as Kara, will allow medical researchers looking at the behavior of specific diseases to train their machine learning models with data from actual patients, without the data ever being exposed.Oasis has already raised $45 million from several big-name venture capital firms, but they have competition from another start-up created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called Enigma.Enigma got started before Oasis and is working with partners like Ocean Protocol to ensure that people contributing data to marketplaces can set the exact terms under which their data can be used.\u201cIt lets you have a network of A.I.s that nobody owns,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said.Hanson Robotics is planning to use SingularityNET to feed information into its humanoid robot, Sophia. Unlike Amazon\u2019s Alexa service, which answers questions using services approved by Amazon, Dr. Goertzel wants Sophia to reach out to other artificial intelligence providers if she can\u2019t find the right answer.\u201cWe are now using SingularityNET to upgrade Sophia\u2019s intelligence,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said. \u201cIn principle, it is much more flexible because we don\u2019t have a centrally controlled market.\u201dAs with most blockchain applications, a lot of technical work still must be done before these new systems can take off \u2014 and it is not clear that all of the roadblocks are surmountable. Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, is investing in the area, but he says he believes it will take some time before these systems can prove themselves. He is hopeful that when they do, they will play an important role in democratizing the industry.\u201cRight now the data isn\u2019t really being valued in an open market, it\u2019s just being given to a few companies,\u201d Mr. Ehrsam said. \u201cWhat if there was now a free market for data?\u201dAdvertisement"}

SocialDataHub and Fubutech have been around for at least four years, relying in part on Facebook data to build products that might alarm some civil-liberty advocates.As Facebook is taking a closer look at its own products amid increasing scrutiny and public outcry, it is finding more examples of companies that have been exploiting its global social network for questionable ends.SocialDataHub and Fubutech also present another challenge because, Facebook said, at least some of their data collection occurred through web scraping.Scraping is a rudimentary technique in which computer programmers can pull information off a website. It is difficult to detect and prevent, Facebook said. Scraping can pull any data that\u2019s left public on a Facebook profile \u2014 and, theoretically, more private data about the user\u2019s Facebook friends.Artur Khachuyan, the 26-year-old chief executive of SocialDataHub and Fubutech, said in an interview Friday that Facebook had deleted his companies\u2019 accounts unfairly.Fubutech does build facial-recognition software for the Russian government and uses Facebook data, but it scrapes Google search results for that information \u2014 not Facebook, he said. And SocialDataHub\u2019s main product \u2014 a system that assigns scores to Russian citizens based on their social-media profiles for insurers and banks \u2014 required permission from the users it rates, he said.Mr. Khachuyan said that he taught Russian journalism students how to scrape the web and that two of them had scraped Facebook for the public profiles of their classmates. He believes Facebook mistook the students\u2019 activity for his companies\u2019 work.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a reason to deactivate our accounts,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why Facebook deletes Instagram account of my dog.\u201d That account, for \u201cMars the Blue Corgi,\u201d had 176 followers.Katy Dormer, a Facebook spokeswoman, rejected Mr. Khachuyan\u2019s claim that Facebook had conflated his students\u2019 activity with the actions of his companies.\u201cWe don\u2019t take these actions lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact we took the action and sent the letter means we saw enough evidence.\u201dFacebook\u2019s removal of SocialDataHub and Fubutech reflects a larger problem for the social media company as it evaluates its relationship with third-party apps that have access to people\u2019s Facebook data.Mr. Khachuyan said the letter from Facebook had surprised him, particularly because his companies have been operating the same way for years.\u201cAll in Russia know about us for minimum four years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that Facebook sent that only now.\u201dHe said Fubutech scraped data from the web, particularly Google search and the Russian search engine Yandex, to build a database of Russian citizens and their images that the government can use for facial recognition. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what they do with it,\u201d he said.\u201cMaybe government clients connect our software to C.C. cameras,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said, referring to closed-circuit cameras. \u201cMaybe they connect it to social profiles.\u201dMr. Khachuyan compared Fubutech to Palantir, the Palo Alto, Calif., tech company that does data analysis for the American government. At one point in a 30-minute phone interview, he said the Russian Defense Ministry was a client, but later said he could not name Fubutech\u2019s government clients.His other firm, SocialDataHub, works with insurers and banks to evaluate potential customers. Between 30,000 and 50,000 Russian citizens have given SocialDataHub permission to analyze their Facebook profiles to assign a score between zero and 10, which insurers and banks use to help set rates or approve credit cards.\u201cIf you\u2019re a bad client, you have zero to three,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said.He said his companies, which share 52 employees in Moscow, complied with Facebook policies; they use Facebook data only when it is public and available on Google search, or if the user has granted them permission. He said the techniques were also legal in Russia.\u201cIt\u2019s a trick in our federal law to use that data, but that works only with Russian citizens,\u201d Mr. Khachuyan said.At the top of the SocialDataHub\u2019s website, there is a single line: \u201cWe know everything about everybody.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Digital Gap Between Rich and Poor Kids Is Not What We Expected", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "America\u2019s public schools are still promoting devices with screens \u2014 even offering digital-only preschools. The rich are banning screens from class altogether.Supported byThe parents in Overland Park, Kan., were fed up. They wanted their children off screens, but they needed strength in numbers. First, because no one wants their kid to be the lone weird one without a phone. And second, because taking the phone away from a middle schooler is actually very, very tough.\u201cWe start the meetings by saying, \u2018This is hard, we\u2019re in a new frontier, but who is going to help us?\u2019\u201d said Krista Boan, who is leading a Kansas City-based program called START, which stands for Stand Together And Rethink Technology. \u201cWe can\u2019t call our moms about this one.\u201dFor the last six months, at night in school libraries across Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., about 150 parents have been meeting to talk about one thing: how to get their children off screens.The psychologist Richard Freed, who wrote a book about the dangers of screen-time for children and how to connect them back to real world experiences, divides his time between speaking before packed rooms in Silicon Valley and his clinical practice with low-income families in the far East Bay, where he is often the first one to tell parents that limiting screen-time might help with attention and behavior issues. \u201cI go from speaking to a group in Palo Alto who have read my book to Antioch, where I am the first person to mention any of these risks,\u201d Dr. Freed said. \u201cThe digital divide was about access to technology, and now that everyone has access, the new digital divide is limiting access to technology,\u201d said Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired magazine.Some parents, pediatricians and teachers around the country are pushing back. \u201cThese companies lied to the schools, and they\u2019re lying to the parents,\u201d said Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting duped.\u201d\u201cOur kids, my kids included, we are subjecting them to one of the biggest social experiments we have seen in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens to my daughter if she can\u2019t communicate over dinner \u2014 how is she going to find a spouse? How is she going to interview for a job?\u201d\u201cI have families now that go teetotal,\u201d Dr. Burgert said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done.\u2019\u201dOne of those families are the Brownsbergers, who had long banned smartphones but recently also banned the internet-connected television.She and her husband, who runs a decorative concrete company, keep their children away from cellphones but found that even a little exposure to screen time changed the boys\u2019 behavior. Her older son, who has A.D.H.D., would get angry when the screen had to be turned off, she said, which worried her.His Christmas wish list was a Wii, a PlayStation, a Nintendo, a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.\u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Kiddo, you\u2019re not gonna get one of those things,\u2019\u201d Ms. Brownsberger said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the mean mom.\u201d\u201cIt takes a community to support this,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I was just talking to my neighbor last night \u2014 \u2018Am I the worst mom ever?\u2019\u201dMs. Boan has three pilots running with about 40 parents in each, looking at best practices for getting kids off phones and screens. Overland Park\u2019s Chamber of Commerce is supporting the work, and the city is working to incorporate elements of digital wellness into its new strategic vision.In Silicon Valley, some feel anxious about the growing class divide they see around screen-time. Kirstin Stecher and her husband, who works as an engineer at Facebook, are raising their kids almost completely screen-free.\u201cIs this coming from a place of information \u2014 like, we know a lot about these screens,\u201d she said. \u201cOr is it coming from a place of privilege, that we don\u2019t need them as badly?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a message out there that your child is going to be crippled and in a different dimension if they\u2019re not on the screen,\u201d said Pierre Laurent, a former Microsoft and Intel executive now on the board of trustees at Silicon Valley\u2019s Waldorf School. \u201cThat message doesn\u2019t play as well in this part of the world.\u201d \u201cPeople in this region of the world understand that the real thing is everything that\u2019s happening around big data, AI, and that is not something that you\u2019re going to be particularly good at because you have a cellphone in fourth grade,\u201d Mr. Laurent said.Dr. Freed, though, argues these tools are too relied upon in schools for low-income children. And he sees the divide every day as he meets tech-addicted children of middle and low-income families. \u201cFor a lot of kids in Antioch, those schools don\u2019t have the resources for extracurricular activities, and their parents can\u2019t afford nannies,\u201d Dr. Freed said. He said the knowledge gap around tech\u2019s danger is enormous.\u201cOnce it sinks its teeth into these kids, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d Dr. Freed said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Black Cat,\u2019 the Titans of Terror, Karloff and Lugosi, Face Off", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingNow considered a classic, \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d (1934) was the first movie to feature Universal\u2019s two prized assets, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and the studio\u2019s excitement was palpable. It\u2019s \u201cthe monster of \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 plus the monster of \u2018Dracula,\u2019 plus the \u2018monstrousness\u2019 of Edgar Allan Poe,\u201d the ads boasted, \u201call combined by the master makers of screen mysteries to give you the absolute apex in super-shivery.\u201dUlmer spent almost his entire career working in B movies. \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d was his only major studio production and it is nothing if not excessive \u2014 wildly expressionistic and saturated with 19th-century Romantic music. The movie is distinguished by its fluid camera, an abundance of wordless passages, and the long meaningful looks its characters exchange. Ulmer was clearly experimenting with a new sort of melodrama; Heinz Roemheld\u2019s score \u2014 mashed-up themes from Liszt, Chopin, Brahms and Schumann \u2014 is said to be present in 55 out of the movie\u2019s 69 minutes.Horror in the Hollywood movies of 1920s, \u201930s, and \u201940s generally came from abroad. Lugosi, a native Hungarian, and Karloff, born in London despite his Slavic-sounding stage name, had distinctive foreign accents. So it is with \u201cThe Black Cat,\u201d which strands a pair of na\u00efve American newlyweds (Julie Bishop and David Manners) in an Art Deco mansion somewhere in deepest Hungary. Caught up by a storm, the honeymooners become pawns in a chess game \u2014 at once ludicrous and unrelenting \u2014 between Lugosi\u2019s hysteria-prone Hungarian psychiatrist and Karloff\u2019s lisping Austrian architect.The acting is also a competition between the two stars, each trying to top the other\u2019s hammy turn. Lugosi\u2019s character is ailurophobic \u2014 his morbid fear of cats justifying the movie\u2019s title \u2014 and more than a bit sadistic. Karloff, however, gets to play the real monster, a war criminal who built his steel-and-glass castle on the site of unspeakable carnage. Suggesting more than it can show, \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d somehow eluded the moral enforcers of the Production Code despite its allusions to incest, necrophilia and human sacrifice, not to mention a black Mass staged beneath a stylized crooked cross.Lugosi (whose screentime was twice that of Karloff but was reportedly paid half as much) portrays a megalomaniacal surgeon so obsessed with Poe that he keeps a stuffed raven in his study and has reconstructed the torture machine from \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d in his basement. Karloff appears as an escaped convict foolish enough to allow Lugosi\u2019s character to surgically rearrange his features.While \u201cSon of Frankenstein\u201d would be the last movie in which Karloff played the monster, it gave Lugosi, as supporting actor, his greatest role. Almost unrecognizable behind a scraggly beard, croaking his lines through a mouth full of sharpened teeth, he exudes a gleeful Charles Manson-like malevolence as Ygor \u2014 a grave robber who survived his hanging, albeit with a broken neck. A commercial success, \u201cSon of Frankenstein\u201d jump-started a new, mediocre cycle of Universal horror films. Karloff left the studio after one, the sci-fi gangster movie \u201cBlack Friday\u201d (1940); Lugosi, who had a minor role in it, stuck around a bit longer to reprise Ygor in \u201cThe Ghost of Frankenstein\u201d (1942).Lugosi, who received second billing on the movie\u2019s posters, most likely for his diminished marquee value, has a far smaller part, appearing as the none-too-bright, lank-haired servant of Karloff\u2019s best customer. Still, their major scene together is rich with subtext. Rival creatures to the end, the pair enact a flashback to the more cosmic death struggle of \u201cThe Black Cat.\u201d\u201cThe Black Cat\u201d can be streamed via Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. \u201cThe Body Snatcher\u201d is available from Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube. \u201cThe Raven\u201d can be found on Vimeo.A picture caption with an earlier version of this column reversed the identities of two actors.

{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs. The September reading of the Conference Board index of consumer confidence, for example, was the highest since 2000.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the third quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS3RD QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS3RD QTR.++++15.20.42.10.8%+++\u20135.40.70.10.1%General stock fundsAlger SmallCap Focus++++++++51.829.548.935.730.957.747.936.5%++++++++16.416.315.213.813.813.613.113.0%Taxable bondsQuantified STFInvestorInternational stocksVirtus Zeven.InnovativeMunicipal bondsBaron DiscoveryInstl.Growth vs. ValueCongress SmallCap GrowthReturns in the third quarter.GrowthBlendValueDelaware SmidCap Growth+8%Morgan StanleyInst.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said.

An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Agriculture to Art \u2014 the A.I. Wave Sweeps In", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe internet is a technology of low-cost communication and connection. Everything from email to e-commerce to social networks has hinged on the internet\u2019s transformative role in changing the economics of communication. All those connections suddenly became both possible and cheap.Artificial intelligence is a technology of low-cost prediction and discovery. It exploits the new resource of the digital age \u2014 vast amounts of data \u2014 to identify patterns and make predictions. Much of what A.I. does today can be thought of as a prediction. What product to recommend, what ad to show you, what image is in that picture, what move should the robot make next \u2014 all are automated predictions.Imagine, the authors suggest, that Amazon\u2019s A.I. gets good enough that the company takes the next step \u2014 shipping goods before they are ordered. It knows what you want so accurately that returns would be minimal and make Amazon even more efficient.It would also change the nature of shopping \u201cfrom an opt-in experience to an opt-out experience,\u201d Mr. Agrawal said in an interview.A fanciful thought experiment? Perhaps. But Amazon was granted a patent for \u201canticipatory shipping\u201d in 2013.Just where artificial intelligence is taking us, at what pace and along what trajectory, is uncertain. The technology, of course, is raising serious questions about its potential impact on jobs, privacy and politics.Still, A.I. is marching into practically every field, from agriculture to the arts. Here are five examples:A.I. holds the promise of sharply reducing the amount of costly and lengthy trial and error in traditional drug development and testing. Deep Genomics, based in Toronto, is not only using its technology to winnow the number of target compounds to attack a particular disease, but also to predict the biological outcome in humans. \u201cThe guesswork is tremendously reduced,\u201d Mr. Frey said.It is still early for Deep Genomics and its approach. The first of its compounds will be tested in clinical trials beginning in 2020.PlantVillage and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture have developed a simple A.I. assistant, called Nuru (\u201clight\u201d in Swahili). Wave the phone over a plant leaf, and the software diagnoses the disease or pest blight and suggests low-tech treatments. Once downloaded, the app does not require wireless access to cellular data or remote computing power, which means it works in rural villages.KONE\u2019s new equipment is being made with the sensors and wireless links, while its older models are being retrofitted. Data streams off each machine, every second, providing measurements that include vibration, leveling, braking, temperature, door openings and cargo weight.The data is fed into the A.I. software, which looks for telltale signals that a machine is in need of maintenance or a new part, before it fails. \u201cYou go from being reactive to proactive and predictive,\u201d said Larry Wash, an executive vice president of KONE.The results on the elevators deploying the new technology so far are encouraging. There are 25 percent fewer breakdowns and 60 percent fewer customer reports of problems than on elevators serviced on traditional maintenance schedules.Root is a bet that with modern technology, it can do better, charging good drivers less for auto insurance, up to $100 a month less \u2014 and the start-up can still be quite profitable. Since its insurance app was introduced in the fall of 2016, Root has expanded into 20 states to date.Root uses the sensors in a smartphone to measure location, acceleration, braking and turning. The myriad sensor data is parsed by clever software for signals of risky driving behavior \u2014 lane changing, tail gating, even texting (typing generates tiny, but measurable, vibrations).Potential customers download the Root app and are monitored for a test-drive period, typically two or three weeks. The algorithmically-vetted safe drivers are approved.\u201cOur models are much more accurately predictive of accidents,\u201d Mr. Timm said.Root insists that it collects data only for its own risk analysis. \u201cWe\u2019ve never sold data and never will,\u201d he said.Deep Dream used so-called neural networks to digest millions of images, identify visual patterns and then create something new \u2014 a kind of aesthetic prediction.Today, many computer artists are using A.I. tools to create new imagery, design interactive visual experiences and probe machine intelligence. Their work benefits from a wealth of A.I. software that is freely shared among computer scientists and artists.Computer art has been around for decades, and Hollywood\u2019s digitally animated movies and special effects are marvels of rich, evocative imagery. But that is more comparable to computer-aided design, with the software serving as a supercharged pencil or paintbrush, still firmly controlled by the human artists.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Succeed as Global Growth Editor, One Viral Slide Show at a Time", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat the surprise popularity of a private slide show I put together to help women chart their career paths taught me about reaching new audiences around the world.About seven months after I posted a slide show to Google Slides, the alert popped up: \u201cWow, this file is really popular! Some tools might be unavailable until the crowd clears.\u201d I\u2019m a power user of Google\u2019s suite of tools and had never seen that, so needless to say, I was surprised.Someone had shared a screenshot with me on Twitter alerting me to the message on my presentation.Before leaving my last role as director of global adaptation at BuzzFeed, I added a few slides about how to think about your career, which was a collection of the best articles I had read over the years on the topic, then presented it to a group of women at the company. When I\u2019d talk with a friend or colleague, and our career aspirations would inevitably come up, I would quietly share it with them. I hoped the career path breakdown that had helped me understand my path might, in turn, help others understand theirs.Because it was Google Slides, I don\u2019t have any quantitative data on how many people have viewed it, besides the \u201cWow, this file is really popular!\u201d alert in that screenshot, hundreds of personal messages to me from those who saw it, and the rare in-person acknowledgment when I meet someone new.In thinking back now to why that presentation reached and resonated with so many people, it boiled down to knowing an audience, having a clear narrative, figuring out the best way to tell that story, and then getting it to the right people \u2014 which is, well, just good journalism.My background in journalism spans many skill sets and roles, and different types of organizations. I studied global studies and journalism in college, and then worked on marketing and design at a political magazine, on multimedia production at a foreign policy think tank, on editorial strategy at a journalism think tank, and then on news products and international expansion at a global digital media organization. It\u2019s that breadth of experience that informed the way I approach my job, and also the presentation.In adding the second part, my intention, audience, and tone evolved a bit, but fundamentally stayed the same: provide a concise summary of all the tidbits I\u2019ve picked up over the years of reading too many (mostly bad) articles on management and career advice and deliver it to some of my female colleagues in a fun way.What I love about the slide show format is that it forces you to be concise and simple. There\u2019s a required density in the information you\u2019re sharing. It\u2019s also interactive because you are usually making presentations to, well, present them to people, which also forces you to think about how those people will receive and experience it \u2014 the \u201caudience thinking\u201d is built-in.My stint in design didn\u2019t hurt either. The colors (mostly pink), fonts (sans serif) and emojis (of course) made it approachable, but I was clearly making this for a specific audience, namely women in their early and mid-careers. Because this lives on the internet, anyone can access it. It\u2019s been funny to hear men respond along the lines of: \u201cI know this wasn\u2019t for me, but it was useful, and I also sent it to my girlfriend or sister or colleague.\u201dKnowing your audience, telling the best story you can, in the best way you can, is still not enough. You also need to get it to people. I think about networks a lot, and that informs how I think about distribution. Within a network, there are people with a lot of connections, and you want to make sure to get it to them. Those \u201cstrong nodes\u201d will identify secondary and relevant connections better than you can, like the guy sending the presentation to his sister, for example.After Ari shared it publicly, I shared it on my Twitter account, but I also figured since it was already out there in the world, I should post it on several groups for women in journalism I\u2019m part of. You can think of those as my strong nodes. Eventually, I had women from all sorts of industries telling me it helped them. The presentation was initially about my career in journalism, but the themes and advice were applicable and adaptable to any industry.Things travel or \u201cgo viral\u201d not only because people discover them, but also because they feel compelled to share them, whether one-to-one or to their own networks. There are a lot of reasons people share things, many of them emotional \u2014 this made me laugh and I want to make someone else laugh, too; this made me feel smarter and I want others to think I\u2019m smart and also feel smarter; this made me upset, and I can\u2019t believe it, and I want others to be outraged with me.In this case, I think my presentation evoked a few emotions: It was relatable because the vulnerability and uncertainty of our careers is universal; it was useful because it offered a distillation of the best reading and advice I\u2019ve encountered; and it was inspirational because you can have a pretty fun and cool job, even when you\u2019re still in the process of figuring it out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Do You Do When You Are Anonymously Accused of Rape?", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "OpinionThe writer Stephen Elliott is suing Moira Donegan, the creator of the Media Men list.Supported byMs. Weiss is a writer and editor in the Opinion section.What do you do if you are accused of sexual misconduct and believe yourself to be innocent?If you\u2019re Brett Kavanaugh, you go nuclear. But if you\u2019re a progressive man who sees himself as a feminist ally, the politically acceptable strategy is to keep quiet and lay low. If you do anything at all, put out a statement saying you support the #MeToo movement, that it\u2019s an overdue and necessary corrective, and that you are taking some time for self-reflection. Spend some months ordering takeout and avoiding parties where everyone is whispering about what they think you did.Rape is what Stephen Elliott was accused of. His entry, along with more than a dozen others on the list, was highlighted in red to denote physical violence. It read: \u201cRape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, unsolicited invitations to his apartment, a dude who snuck into Binders\u201d (a women-only Facebook group).It may have served that purpose for some women. But did it tell the truth about all of the men on it? In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Elliott said: \u201cNo one is going to come forward and say that I raped them. I don\u2019t believe even my enemies believe I raped somebody.\u201dSo what does he want? \u201cAn apology would be good,\u201d he said. \u201cLegal fees would also be good. But maybe seeing it argued out in the court of law will help good people come to their senses and distance themselves from the rotten parts of this movement.\u201dA year ago, that\u2019s where Mr. Elliott was. \u201cMultiple people asked me at first if I was O.K. just taking a bullet for the movement,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause of their politics and, frankly, because of mine.\u201d \u201cIf I was to come out and say, \u2018Hey, I was falsely accused of rape,\u2019 it would be like I was attacking this movement which at the time, was a movement that I believed in,\u201d he said.So Mr. Elliott hid out. \u201cI sat in my apartment and got high for three months,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the closet.\u201dOver those months, he says his life started to fall apart. He lost friends. His Hollywood agent stopped calling him back. Already prone to depression, he became suicidal. I met him in early February for the first time. He had reached out to me via Facebook asking if I would read the essay he\u2019d written about his experience \u2014 it had been accepted and then rejected by New York Magazine and The Guardian, at that point. When we met for coffee in a Beverly Hills hotel lobby, I found him to be shaky and depressed.No longer.\u201cI really feel like I\u2019m happy for the first time since this started,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a politics. I know who my friends are.\u201dWhat are those politics? \u201cI still think of myself as a liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the left moved away from liberalism and I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. If you are a liberal, by definition, you believe that it\u2019s better to let a certain amount of guilty people go free than to jail one innocent man. That\u2019s almost the definition of liberalism. These people on the left aren\u2019t liberals at all, actually. What I\u2019ve come to realize is how close they are to the people on the right.\u201dOf course, none of this means he couldn\u2019t have attempted to rape someone.In the wake of his Quillette essay, two more women came forward with complaints. When I asked him about these stories, Mr. Elliott said: \u201cI\u2019ve certainly been unaware of boundaries and transgressed them without realizing.\u201d But he insists that Ms. Lenz\u2019s and Ms. Siegel\u2019s accounts are not only full of half-truths or lies, but beside the point. \u201cThese people are trying to get me to engage in any argument that is not about the fact that I was falsely accused of rape,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d He added: \u201cIf your position is that it\u2019s O.K. to falsely accuse someone of rape because you don\u2019t like them, just own that position. That\u2019s clearly what a lot of people believe.\u201dOn the one hand, Stephen Elliott v. Moira Donegan and Jane Does (1-30) is a straightforward defamation case.The complaint says that the statements on the list were \u201cabusive, vulgar, intentionally misleading,\u201d that \u201cthe Defendants\u2019 actions were malicious in nature,\u201d and that the list was \u201csent to numerous members of the parties\u2019 shared profession, the media industry to intentionally harm Plaintiff\u2019s reputation and further cause harm to Plaintiff\u2019s career.\u201dThis account of maliciousness does not at all square with how Ms. Donegan has described her aim in creating the list.\u201cI thought it was a good essay,\u201d Mr. Elliott offered when I ask him about it. \u201cThe problem with it is that it\u2019s not honest. She deliberately mischaracterizes her motivation. If you create something with the intention of hurting your enemies, that\u2019s a weapon.\u201dHe is planning to provide documents to the court that he thinks prove Ms. Donegan\u2019s intent was malicious. Chief among them are since-deleted tweets, like:That\u2019s the straightforward part.The new part is that this is a case being brought against a mostly anonymous group who created an anonymous list containing potentially defamatory statements.I asked Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment expert, about this case, and he said he had never seen one like it. Andrew T. Miltenberg, Stephen Elliott\u2019s attorney, admits he\u2019s never brought one like it.\u201cI\u2019ve had cases where we know what the allegations are and we know who said them. None of that is true here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intersection between the internet and allegations like this and anonymity is very dangerous place to be. There\u2019s no protection for the accused. It\u2019s the perfect way to assassinate someone\u2019s character without having to prove anything.\u201dThe other thing that sets this case apart is that it seems likely to snowball \u2014 perhaps more than Mr. Miltenberg appreciated when he took it on.But when he described what could qualify someone as a defendant \u2014 anyone who wrote on the list, edited the list or published it \u2014 15 or 20 seems like a fraction of what the actual number could be. I know dozens of women who have at least emailed the list or received it.I\u2019m one of them. I asked a friend to send me the list. Once I had it, I allowed a few others to look at it on my phone. Does that make me a Jane Doe? Does sharing it with other journalists count as publishing?\u201cSending an email to one person could count as publishing under certain circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Miltenberg.In that case, I suggested to him, you might have many, many more than 30 Jane Does. \u201cThis might be like a 500-person RICO case,\u201d he replied, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.That sounds a bit terrifying, not just in scope, but also in terms of free speech ramifications. If this is grounds for a suit, couldn\u2019t everyone who has ever shared an Alex Jones rant about Sandy Hook being a \u201choax\u201d be subject to civil litigation of this sort? When I asked Mr. Abrams, the first amendment lawyer, about how he would defend this case, at first he said, \u201cIf you say someone has committed rape, it\u2019s very difficult to defend the case without showing that that\u2019s true.\u201dLater, though, he drilled down on the specific language in the spreadsheet: It does not say \u201crape\u201d after all. It says \u201crape accusations.\u201d\u201cThe very first thing I would say to the jury is that she never accused him of rape, but said that he had been accused by some women of rape and that they should bear that in mind. In saying that, she protected those women and certainly didn\u2019t libel him.\u201d\u201cThis is not a \u2018save men\u2019 case for me,\u201d Mr. Miltenberg said of Mr. Elliott. \u201cThis is a case of a person having their name, reputation and future ruined by anonymous allegations that can neither be tested nor challenged.\u201dOver the past year, as #MeToo has morphed into a verb, I\u2019ve been involved in heated discussions about any number of men who have been MeTooed. About Al Franken. About Leon Wieseltier. About Louis C.K. About Brett Kavanaugh.In all of those cases, it is possible to ask: What is the appropriate punishment for behavior that is wrong but perhaps wouldn\u2019t stand up as a crime in a court of law?In the case of Stephen Elliott it is impossible to say almost anything at all about the allegation. There is no named accuser. There is no night in question. There aren\u2019t even contending memories. There is nothing other than what\u2019s written in the cell of that spreadsheet.But something that Ms. Siegel wrote in her essay struck me as one plausible explanation: \u201cWhat happened is that years of behaving badly (not criminally) caught up to him.\"\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger out there about me,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of anger that could produce a malicious allegation \u2014 especially when it\u2019s an anonymous list. I don\u2019t like this guy. So I put his name on the list, throw in a TV dinner, watch \u2018The Wire\u2019 and forget about it.\u201dAn earlier version of this essay included outdated information about Lyz Lenz.

{"Headline": "Mnuchin to Decide by Friday Whether to Cancel on Saudi Conference", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The disappearance of a Saudi dissident journalist has put Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, in an increasingly tenuous position as he prepares to attend an investment conference in Riyadh next week.Several top Wall Street executives have pulled out of the meeting, but as of Monday, Mr. Mnuchin still planned to attend. President Trump, speaking at an event in Georgia, said Mr. Mnuchin would make a final decision on whether to participate by Friday.Mr. Khashoggi has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Turkish authorities have alleged that Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi operatives.The Saudi government has denied any wrongdoing, saying Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after his arrival. However, a person familiar with Saudi plans said Monday that the kingdom was preparing an alternative explanation of the journalist\u2019s fate, saying Mr. Khashoggi died in an interrogation gone wrong.Mr. Trump said on Monday that a decision about Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s attendance would be made by Friday.\u201cHe\u2019s going to make that decision,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s going.\u201dMr. Mnuchin\u2019s top spokesman, Tony Sayegh, said in a Monday interview with the Fox Business Network that the Treasury delegation was visiting five other countries as part of a long-planned trip. He also pointed out that the secretary\u2019s agenda in Saudi Arabia extends beyond the Future Investment Initiative conference and includes meetings related to blocking terrorist financing.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was among those arguing that Mr. Mnuchin should withdraw.\u201cUnless Trump cancels Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s trip immediately, the United States is validating the likely murder of U.S. resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi government,\u201d he said.As the top economic official from the United States, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s presence would send a significant signal about how America views human rights issues.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, frankly,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush. He added that Mr. Mnuchin had little to gain from attending such a conference under the circumstances.But the timing of the conference comes at a delicate moment of economic diplomacy, making a decision to pull out fraught.The Treasury Department oversees the United States\u2019 sanctions arsenal, and Mr. Mnuchin has been aggressively urging American allies to step up pressure against Iran after Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia has supported that decision, and its influence in the region is needed to help isolate Iran.Oil is also an underlying factor. Prices have surged this year, and the prospect of higher fuel costs in the United States before the November midterm elections is problematic for Republicans. Relations between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, whom he courted lavishly last year, have been strained in recent months after the president publicly pressured Saudi Arabia to ramp up oil production. This month, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows again when he suggested that Saudi Arabia should be spending more on defense.\u201cWe protect Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said at a rally in Mississippi, adding that he told King Salman that he would not last two weeks without American military support.For Mr. Mnuchin, the tension comes on the anniversary of one of his signature policy projects: the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which was unveiled in Riyadh on his trip last year as a multinational effort to combat illicit financial activities in the Middle East.On that trip, Mr. Mnuchin was feted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, and the governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, Ahmed al-Kholifey, in a gilded conference room at the Ritz-Carlton on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative.At the conference, where chocolate truffles and cardamom coffee flowed freely, Mr. Mnuchin hailed the partnership with the Saudi government and said he looked forward to returning annually to ensure the center\u2019s success.Former Treasury officials were divided on the wisdom of Mr. Mnuchin traveling to Riyadh under the current circumstances.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot coming on right now,\u201d Morgan Ortagus, a former deputy United States Treasury attach\u00e9 in Saudi Arabia, referring to the oil and terrorist financing issues. \u201cI think if he pulled out at this point it would be because the administration felt there was not enough truthfulness or cooperation on this.\u201dMr. O\u2019Neill said the fact that Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was making his own trip to Saudi Arabia could give Mr. Mnuchin a graceful opportunity to bow out. He suggested that the conference itself would offer the secretary little value, since he has easy access to business executives from around the world.\u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s true that they caused a journalist to be assassinated, I can\u2019t imagine the secretary of the Treasury would go,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cHe is kind of a token now, in that if he pulls out, it will strengthen what the president has said, in terms of being upset with them.\u201dBut making the trip could also be an opportunity for Mr. Mnuchin.Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said more engagement was crucial during fraught diplomatic times. One option, she said, is for Mr. Mnuchin to skip the investment conference and just pay a visit to the terrorist finance center. Or the secretary, who was planning to participate in a moderated discussion with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the founder of Colony Capital, could give a speech addressing human rights.\u201cI think the U.S. Treasury secretary can still engage and not crush the credibility of the U.S. position of being a tough interlocutor,\u201d said Ms. Rosenberg, a former senior adviser to the department\u2019s Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes division.However, she added, it would be a dire mistake to attend the conference and avoid the human rights issue.\u201cIt would be particularly awkward if all these people had pulled out and then he had nothing further to say other than just a desire to participate,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Things to Leave at Home on Your Next Trip", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsMake your next trip easier by packing less. Way less. Here are some easy things to leave behind.There are few things that can help reduce travel stress like learning how to pack less. I\u2019ve watched screaming couples lug massive suitcases across the cobblestones of Sicily, and seen tiny travelers miserably dwarfed by massive backpacks in train stations as often as I\u2019ve marveled at surly ones in the street frantically gathering up acres of clothes from a broken rolling bag. The tragedy of over-packing knows no bounds.Voltage converters are pretty much a thing of the past. The power adapter (also known as the \u201cwall wart\u201d) that comes with nearly every electronic product, be it a phone, tablet, e-reader, even many laptops, likely converts all incoming voltage into what it needs. Take a look at the side of the adapter, it should say something like \u201cAC 100-240V 50/60Hz.\u201d This means it can accept any voltage between 100 and 240 at either 50 or 60 cycle. So not only our 120V/60Hz, but everything from Tokyo\u2019s 100V/50Hz to London\u2019s 230V/50Hz and even St. John\u2019s 220V/60Hz.What you need instead are cheap travel outlet adapters. These change the two vertical prongs of US-style plugs to whatever the local version is. Round in Europe, tilted in Australia, massive rectangles in the UK, and so on. For about $10 you can get a few with one region/country\u2019s plug style to fit all your power adapters. For about double that, a somewhat bulkier \u201cuniversal\u201d adapter with multiple prong styles built in should work just about everywhere.The exceptions to this? Hair dryers, most things with motors, and older laptops with big power bricks. If it doesn\u2019t have the voltage range listed above, or it has just a single cord direct from the wall to the device (as in, there\u2019s no adapter) it might not work. For those devices you may need a voltage converter, but more than likely, it may not work even if you have one.Even if I weren\u2019t bald since I was a teenager, I\u2019d still advise against bringing a hair dryer. As mentioned above, your hair dryer almost certainly isn\u2019t going to work overseas. Don\u2019t bring it. Pretty much every hotel, hostel, and most Airbnbs are going to have one available for you.The same is true for things like shampoo and soap. Hotels and Airbnbs will provide these to you for sure, although they\u2019re somewhat less common in hostels. Unless you have specific products you can\u2019t live without (and that\u2019s fine, I do too), you can probably skip these. Bringing these also creates the possibility of them leaking in your bag, and now you\u2019ve got soapy underwear.You also don\u2019t really need bottles of easily-obtained medications like over-the-counter painkillers. These are readily available at virtually any destination. Just remember the drug name, not the brand name. \u201cAdvil\u201d might be tough to find in some places, but \u201cibuprofen\u201d is everywhere. (Google is also handy when trying to find the name of a specific medicine in the local language, like Imodium or Benadryl.) Oh, and what we call acetaminophen (Tylenol) everyone else calls paracetamol. Same drug.You don\u2019t need to bring cash. A.T.M.s are everywhere and usually cheaper compared to those in the US. Yes, you might get an A.T.M. fee, but that will likely be less than the fee charged by retail currency converter shops like the ones at airports.If you pay by card, some places will let you choose to pay in local or your home currency. Paying in your home currency will likely cost more as you\u2019ll get a poor conversion rate and a transaction fee for the \u201cprivilege.\u201d Unless you know your card charges big foreign fees, paying in local currency is cheaper.Mobile payments, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, or apps like Venmo and Square where you\u2019re able to use your phone to buy things, are growing in popularity at home and abroad. However, these aren\u2019t widespread enough to rely on as a main form of payment. Their availability will depend not just on the country you\u2019re visiting, but the specific shop you\u2019re in.If you\u2019re gone for more than a week, just budget two hours sometime during your trip to do laundry. Pretty much every hotel, hostel, and Airbnb will have laundry facilities in the building or nearby. (But avoid the exorbitant cost of having the hotel do your laundry for you.) Worst case, you can hand-wash in a sink. I\u2019ve only had to do that few times. What to pack? I usually bring six shirts, underwear, and pairs of socks, plus jeans and shorts. (You might consider adding a pair of khakis or dress pants for an evening out.) I\u2019ve met people who bring less, but enough for one week seems pretty common for frequent travelers I\u2019ve met.So leave food (other than snacks for the plane), pillows, that third pair of shoes, that second belt, boots for city trips, oxfords or heels for jungle trips, and so on. Rain gear is fine, two umbrellas in case you lose the first one is excessive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the \u2018Father of Android\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "The internet giant paid Mr. Rubin $90 million and praised him, while keeping silent about a misconduct claim.Supported by\u201cI want to wish Andy all the best with what\u2019s next,\u201d Larry Page, Google\u2019s chief executive then, said in a public statement. \u201cWith Android he created something truly remarkable \u2014 with a billion-plus happy users.\u201dGoogle could have fired Mr. Rubin and paid him little to nothing on the way out. Instead, the company handed him a $90 million exit package, paid in installments of about $2 million a month for four years, said two people with knowledge of the terms. The last payment is scheduled for next month.Mr. Rubin was one of three executives that Google protected over the past decade after they were accused of sexual misconduct. In two instances, it ousted senior executives, but softened the blow by paying them millions of dollars as they departed, even though it had no legal obligation to do so. In a third, the executive remained in a highly compensated post at the company. Each time Google stayed silent about the accusations against the men.The New York Times obtained corporate and court documents and spoke to more than three dozen current and former Google executives and employees about the episodes, including some people directly involved in handling them. Most asked to remain anonymous because they were bound by confidentiality agreements or feared retribution for speaking out.The transgressions varied in severity. Mr. Rubin\u2019s case stood out for how much Google paid him and its silence on the circumstances of his departure. After Mr. Rubin left, the company invested millions of dollars in his next venture.Sam Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Rubin, disputed that the technologist had been told of any misconduct at Google and said he left the company of his own accord.\u201cThe New York Times story contains numerous inaccuracies about my employment at Google and wild exaggerations about my compensation,\u201d Mr. Rubin said in a statement after the publication of this article. \u201cSpecifically, I never coerced a woman to have sex in a hotel room. These false allegations are part of a smear campaign by my ex-wife to disparage me during a divorce and custody battle.\u201dIn settling on terms favorable to two of the men, Google protected its own interests. The company avoided messy and costly legal fights, and kept them from working for rivals as part of the separation agreements.When asked about Mr. Rubin and the other cases, Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president for people operations, said in a statement that the company takes harassment seriously and reviews every complaint.\u201cWe investigate and take action, including termination,\u201d she said. \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve taken a particularly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority. We\u2019re working hard to keep improving how we handle this type of behavior.\u201dAfter publication of this article, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Ms. Naughton wrote in an email to employees that the company had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years and that none of them received an exit package.\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that Google is a workplace where you can feel safe to do your best work, and where there are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately,\u201d Mr. Pichai and Ms. Naughton wrote.Some within Google said that was not enough.\u201cWhen Google covers up harassment and passes the trash, it contributes to an environment where people don\u2019t feel safe reporting misconduct,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer for more than a decade and an activist on workplace issues. \u201cThey suspect that nothing will happen or, worse, that the men will be paid and the women will be pushed aside.\u201dGoogle, founded in 1998 by Mr. Page and Sergey Brin when they were Stanford University graduate students, fostered a permissive workplace culture from the start.David C. Drummond, who joined as general counsel in 2002, had an extramarital relationship with Jennifer Blakely, a senior contract manager in the legal department who reported to one of his deputies, she and other Google employees said. They began dating in 2004, discussed having children and had a son in 2007, after which Mr. Drummond disclosed their relationship to the company, she said.Google then took action. Ms. Blakely said Stacy Sullivan, then the head of human resources and now chief culture officer, told her that Google discouraged managers from having relationships with subordinates.\u201cOne of us would have to leave the legal department,\u201d Ms. Blakely said. \u201cIt was clear it would not be David.\u201dSince the affair, Mr. Drummond\u2019s career has flourished. He is now Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer and chairman of CapitalG, Google\u2019s venture capital fund. He has reaped about $190 million from stock options and awards since 2011 and could make more than $200 million on other options and equity awards, according to company filings.Ms. Blakely was transferred to sales in 2007 and left Google a year later. The company asked her to sign paperwork saying she had departed voluntarily. She said she \u201csigned waivers, releases and whatever else they wanted.\u201dIn late 2008, she said, Mr. Drummond left her. They later fought a custody battle for their son, she said, which she won.How Mr. Drummond, 55, was treated \u201camplifies the message that for a select few, there are no consequences,\u201d said Ms. Blakely, 54. \u201cGoogle felt like I was the liability.\u201dGoogle\u2019s sexual harassment policy states that violators may be terminated \u2014 but it was flexible in how it enforced the rules.Ms. Simpson went with her mother and said she thought it was an opportunity to talk to Mr. DeVaul about the job. She said she brought conservative clothes suitable for a professional meeting.At Mr. DeVaul\u2019s encampment, Ms. Simpson said, he asked her to remove her shirt and offered a back rub. She said she refused. When he insisted, she said she relented to a neck rub.\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough spine or backbone to shut that down as a 24-year-old,\u201d said Ms. Simpson, now 30.A few weeks later, Google told her she did not get the job, without explaining why.\u201cWe would never tell a complainant to stay quiet,\u201d Chelsea Bailey, the head of human resources at X, said in a statement, adding that officials investigated and \u201ctook appropriate corrective action.\u201d She declined to say what that was, citing employee confidentiality.In a statement, Mr. DeVaul apologized for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d He said X decided not to hire Ms. Simpson before she went to Burning Man and that he did not realize she had not been informed.In another harassment case, Google paid Amit Singhal, a senior vice president who headed search, millions of dollars on the way out.In 2015, an employee said Mr. Singhal groped her at a boozy off-site event attended by dozens of colleagues, said three people who were briefed on the incident. Google investigated and found that Mr. Singhal was inebriated and there were no witnesses, they said.Google found her claim credible, they said. The company did not fire Mr. Singhal, but accepted his resignation and negotiated an exit package that paid him millions and prevented him from working for a competitor, said the people.Uber and Mr. Singhal declined to comment. In a statement last year, he said that \u201charassment is unacceptable in any setting\u201d and that he had not engaged in any such behavior.Mr. Rubin joined Google in 2005 when it acquired his start-up, Android, for $50 million. Over the next few years, he helped build Android \u2014 the software now used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones \u2014 into a huge success.That success gave Mr. Rubin more latitude than most Google executives, said four people who worked with him.Mr. Rubin often berated subordinates as stupid or incompetent, they said. Google did little to curb that behavior. It took action only when security staff found bondage sex videos on Mr. Rubin\u2019s work computer, said three former and current Google executives briefed on the incident. That year, the company docked his bonus, they said.Mr. Singer, the spokesman for Mr. Rubin, said the executive \u201cis known to be transparent and forthcoming with his feedback.\u201d He said Mr. Rubin never called anyone incompetent.Mr. Rubin, 55, who met his wife at Google, also dated other women at the company while married, said four people who worked with him. In 2011, he had a consensual relationship with a woman on the Android team who did not report to him, they said. They said Google\u2019s human resources department was not informed, despite rules requiring disclosure when managers date someone who directly or indirectly reports to them.In a civil suit filed this month by Mr. Rubin\u2019s ex-wife, Rie Rubin, she claimed he had multiple \u201cownership relationships\u201d with other women during their marriage, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to them. The couple were divorced in August.The suit included a screenshot of an August 2015 email Mr. Rubin sent to one woman. \u201cYou will be happy being taken care of,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeing owned is kinda like you are my property, and I can loan you to other people.\u201dHe remained highly valued. That year, Google offered Mr. Rubin a one-time bonus of $40 million in stock and an additional $72 million of stock over the next two years, said two people with knowledge of the terms.Around that time, Mr. Rubin was casually seeing another woman he knew from Android, according to two company executives briefed on the relationship. The two had started dating in 2012 when he was still leading the division, these people said.By 2013, she had cooled on him and wanted to break things off but worried it would affect her career, said the people. That March, she agreed to meet him at a hotel, where she said he pressured her into oral sex, they said. The incident ended the relationship.The woman waited until 2014 before filing a complaint to Google\u2019s human resources department and telling officials about the relationship, the people said. Google began an investigation.In September 2014, a few weeks into the inquiry, Google\u2019s board awarded Mr. Rubin a stock grant worth $150 million, to be paid out over several years, said three people briefed on the decision. It was an unusually generous sum, even by Google\u2019s standards.Mr. Page typically recommends how much senior executives are paid, said three former Google executives. Over the years, Mr. Page had told people he felt Mr. Rubin was never properly compensated for his contribution to Android, two people who spoke to him said.It is unclear if Mr. Page or the board knew of the investigation into the harassment complaint when Google approved the $150 million grant for Mr. Rubin. Mr. Page, 45, did not respond to a request for a comment; Mr. Doerr and Mr. Shriram declined to comment.Google\u2019s inquiry ultimately found the complaint against Mr. Rubin credible, said the two company executives familiar with the incident. Mr. Rubin denied the accusation, but it became clear that \u2014 at the very least \u2014 the relationship was inappropriate, they said. Mr. Page decided Mr. Rubin should leave, they said.The $150 million stock grant gave Mr. Rubin an enormous bargaining chip when he started negotiating his exit package about a month later. That is because an executive\u2019s stock compensation \u2014 and how much of it they would leave behind \u2014 is often taken into consideration during settlement talks.When Google fires lower-level employees, it typically marches them out immediately and pays little, if any, severance. But for senior executives, Google weighs other factors, said former executives. A wrongful termination lawsuit could mean unwanted media attention for Google and the victims of a misconduct case, with a loss resulting in significant damages.In the end, Google paid Mr. Rubin $90 million, said two people with knowledge of the terms. The package was structured so that he received $2.5 million a month for the first two years and $1.25 million a month for the following two years.A provision in the separation agreement precluded Mr. Rubin from working for rivals or disparaging Google publicly, they said. Google also delayed repayment of the $14 million loan.Afterward, Google invested in Playground Global, a venture firm Mr. Rubin started six months after leaving the company. Playground has raised $800 million. He also founded Essential, a maker of Android smartphones.Mr. Rubin\u2019s wealth, fueled by Google, has increased by 35 times in less than a decade. According to his ex-wife\u2019s suit, his net worth is now about $350 million, up from $10 million in 2009.Claire Cain Miller contributed reporting from Portland, Ore.

{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuh Se Ok, 89, uses a traditional ink brush to paint heavily blotted calligraphic abstractions, some composed of just a few strokes, on knobby mulberry paper. (Postwar Korean art schools, following the Japanese tradition, strictly divided oil painting from ink painting, which Mr. Suh studied.) The majority of the 16 paintings here come from his \u201cPeople\u201d series, dating from 1978 to the early 2000s, and each suggests, but never properly represents, human forms through a few bravura strokes: two crisscrossed curves topped by a sagging ellipse, or a sequence of ribbons darting up and looping back down. His \u201cpeople\u201d are not people at all but signs \u2014 and this calligraphic approach places these abstract ink paintings within a centuries-long tradition of Asian literati painting, in which verisimilitude has less importance than personal expression and philosophical insight.Through Oct. 14. Z\u00fcrcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, East Village, 212-777-0790, galeriezurcher.com.Now in her mid-60s, the painter Kyle Staver has lately had several impressive shows, but her display of new work at Z\u00fcrcher exceeds its predecessors in confidence, ease and even a kind of perfection. And for the first time, the artist is also showing the small, incredibly deft clay studies for some of the canvases here.Ms. Staver is a late-blooming member of the generation of appropriation artists and Neo-Expressionist painters that dominated the early 1980s. In many ways, she uses their various interests in existing narratives and images, gender stereotypes and irreverent painting-making to revive older traditions. Her scenes from Greek mythology and occasionally the Bible unfold with a combination of visual humor, fast, toothy brushwork and a complex allure that is new and entices you to look and look again, thinking through what\u2019s happening, in paint, compositions and story.Her figures, which are nearly life-size or bigger, are usually seen in midair \u2014 where the gods mostly dwell \u2014 and their levitation itself is exciting, often tinged with lust. For example, Cupid plucks Psyche from the fires of hell intimated by the orange undersides of the fluffy little clouds that also imply another kind of heat.The key to the exhibition, according the gallery, is knowing that Alexa also responded to Ms. Baga using the name \u201cMollusca.\u201d This verbal slippage, between Alexa and Mollusca, serves as a trap door to thinking about language, time, history and human consciousness.After watching the 37-minute video, the amiable ceramic sculptures placed around the gallery feel more like relics. A ceramic drum kit occupies one corner; portraits of Ms. Baga and the drag star RuPaul flank the entrance to the video. Elvis Presley\u2019s brain, pyramid-shaped dog heads and Nicole Kidman in \u201cThe Hours\u201d also appear in glazed and fired clay.It\u2019s all a little too much, but the piano parts make it work. Each odd-looking wooden mechanism is itself made up of nearly a dozen separate pieces, not counting conical springs or spongy green cushions, and so the sculptor\u2019s own elaborate assemblage is no more complicated or ridiculous than its found components \u2014 only more overtly so. It comes across less as a gesture of imaginative whimsy than as a feat of observation.The same overstuffed delicacy characterizes the show as a whole. Three untitled recent sculptures, five-foot cubic wooden frames draped with socks, plastic shopping bags, and a Home Depot yardstick, though they\u2019re an interesting take on what it means to occupy space, may be a little too clever. But eight installations from 1987 are extraordinary: Each starts with a humble object like a cheese grater, colander or found chunk of concrete meander sitting on the floor on another modest little wooden platform. Looming over it on the wall is an enormous, close-up black-and-white photo portrait in the overbearing style of early fascist propaganda.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet Shrugs Off Bad News With Big Quarter", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those clouds have done little to darken Alphabet\u2019s earnings \u2014 a testament to the enduring strength of Google\u2019s core search business. In 2018, Google is expected to capture about 60 percent of global search advertising spending, according to the research firm eMarketer.On Thursday, Alphabet reported a net profit of $9.19 billion in the third quarter, up 37 percent from a year earlier. Quarterly revenue was $33.74 billion, an increase of 21 percent but slightly lower than analysts expected, pushing the company\u2019s stock price down about 5 percent in after-hours trading.Alphabet\u2019s profits, however, exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, reflecting a lower tax rate that it attributed to the impact of tax cuts passed in the United States last year. Alphabet\u2019s quarterly tax rate was 9 percent versus 16 percent a year earlier.The company appeared to be trying to demonstrate that those tax cuts are benefiting American workers. Google said 80 percent of its capital spending during the third quarter was used in the United States. Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September, an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.In a conference call with analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said it was still too early to determine the potential impact of new policies that the company was putting in place in Europe.The European Union fined Google $5.1 billion in July for abusing its market dominance in smartphone software. Last week, the company said it would start charging handset manufacturers a licensing fee to install popular applications such as Gmail and Google Maps for phones running Android in the European Union.In a sign of Google\u2019s online dominance, Alphabet said Google Drive \u2014 its suite of productivity software \u2014 was now its eighth product to have more than one billion monthly active users. The others include YouTube, Google search and Gmail.Alphabet said it continued to see an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees Google pays companies like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone. Google said it had paid out $6.58 billion in such costs, compared with $5.5 billion in the year-earlier period.Alphabet also said it has logged a $1.4 billion gain on equity investments made by the company\u2019s venture capital arms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Shouldn\u2019t Use Facebook to Log In to Other Sites", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI\u2019m going to quit using Facebook to log in to apps and sites online. You should, too.But the mere possibility is highly troubling \u2014 and if the hack allowed access to any other sites, Facebook should be disqualified from acting as your sign-on service.This is a classic you-had-one-job situation. Like a trusty superintendent in a Brooklyn walk-up, Facebook offered to carry keys for every lock online. The arrangement was convenient \u2014 the super was always right there, at the push of a button. It was also more secure than creating and remembering dozens of passwords for different sites. Facebook had a financial and reputational incentive to hire the best security people to protect your keys; tons of small sites online don\u2019t \u2014 and if they got hacked and if you reused your passwords elsewhere, you were hosed.But the extensive hack vaporizes those arguments. If the entity with which you trusted your keys loses your keys, you take your keys elsewhere. And there are many more-secure and just-as-convenient ways to sign on to things online.If for some reason you don\u2019t want to use a password manager, you can use another tech giant\u2019s sign-on service. When presented with different ways to sign on to sites, you can choose Google or Microsoft instead of Facebook.Yes, it\u2019s possible those companies could be hacked one day, too. After all, Yahoo was hacked, as was LinkedIn, as was Equifax. But at this moment, a sign-on service by Google or Microsoft has one big advantage over Facebook\u2019s: Those companies did not lose control of 50 million people\u2019s accounts, and Facebook did.Mr. Polakis allowed that there are tremendous convenience benefits and even some security benefits to a single sign-on. \u201cObviously, big companies like Facebook and Google have amazing engineers, and their security practices are generally ahead of the curve compared to other, smaller websites,\u201d he said.But no company, not even one as big and wealthy as Facebook or Google, can guarantee perfect security.And in some ways, Mr. Polakis said, Facebook\u2019s size and complexity work against its security. The Facebook hack, for instance, seems to have been caused by three different bugs acting in concert.\u201cThe codebase of these services is massive,\u201d Mr. Polakis said. \u201cYou have different teams working on different components, and they can interplay in different ways, and you can have a crazy hack that no one expects.\u201dThe other danger to signing on to everything with Facebook is the threat of phishing. Even if millions of Facebook accounts hadn\u2019t been hacked, people\u2019s individual accounts are hacked all the time through online trickery. Single sign-on compounds the damage \u2014 whoever hacks your Facebook account gets access to everything else you tied to Facebook.Why is a password manager a better way to protect yourself than signing on through a big platform? Password managers can also be hacked, Mr. Polakis said, but \u201ccompared to massive platforms that have millions of different lines of codes and different functionalities, a password manager has one specific job, and so it minimizes the chances of something going wrong.\u201dI asked Facebook for a counterargument to stop using it for signing on. A spokesman said Facebook\u2019s sign-on was still more secure than the weak passwords that people create and reuse for everything.That\u2019s not a bad point. Password managers aren\u2019t as convenient to use as Facebook\u2019s button; if people respond to the Facebook hack by rolling their own passwords instead of using Facebook, that may be worse for everyone.I don\u2019t argue otherwise. I believe Facebook is taking this seriously. At some point, maybe, Facebook will regain my trust enough to handle my digital keys.But it will do so only if there\u2019s some cost to losing them. For now, that cost is: When I see the blue Facebook button offering an easy way to sign up for this or that digital doodad, I\u2019m not tapping it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bust Magazine Is on a Mission", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "Jane is gone. Teen Vogue (the print version) is gone. The Village Voice, gone. How has this feminist lifestyle publication survived for 25 years?Supported by\u201cThe blood\u2019s not real,\u201d said a staffer at the Brooklyn headquarters of Bust, the independent, feminist lifestyle magazine and website. Her tattooed and bare arms were streaked with red, as were those of an intern, who quipped, \u201cJust another day at the office.\u201d They had been working on a photo shoot for a Halloween-themed haunted house feature.It was a symbolic moment. You don\u2019t need to be a shrink to associate red with power and boldness, as well as with important womanly issues, much as Bust does.Bust is a rarity, having kept its cult following while staying afloat in a media sea of bankruptcies, mergers and buyouts. Founding editors Debbie Stoller and Laurie Henzel started the magazine with a Riot Girls sensibility in 1993. Twenty-five years later, they are still here.\u201cWe started Bust because women\u2019s magazines were crap and made people feel bad about themselves,\u201d Ms. Stoller, 55, said from her office, located in Sunset Park\u2019s Industry City. \u201cI wanted to make women feel better and make a different kind of women\u2019s magazine.\u201dTheir aim was not purely political though; they wanted the magazine to be fun. \u201cBust has never asked readers to divide ourselves into politics versus fashion or seriousness versus adventure,\u201d said Gloria Steinem, the political activist who co-founded Ms. Magazine in 1972, in an email.In the early \u201990s, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel started asking friends \u201cto write stories they didn\u2019t see reflected in the media about their lives,\u201d Ms. Stoller recalled. \u201cWe Xeroxed 500 copies at work, and that was our first issue.\u201dThe magazine was a good 15 years ahead of the outspoken and unapologetic feminist content that would happen online in the aughts, said Anna Holmes, editorial director at Topic.com, a visual storytelling platform, which is part of First Look Media.\u201cBust was an examination of gender politics,\u201d said Ms. Holmes, who was also the founder of the feminist blog Jezebel and its editor in chief for three years. \u201cBust has legitimacy and authenticity because they predate all of the feminist websites, newsletters and verticals that cropped up in 2009 through today.\u201dThe scrappy magazine has endured financial struggles (it still does); being bought by a tech company and then having to buy itself back; the bursting of the internet bubble; Sept. 11; losing business partners; multiple office moves around New York as the city became more expensive; and perhaps most importantly, the implosion of the magazine print business. Old print competitors like Jane and Teen Vogue are long gone. Other downtown alternative outfits, like The Village Voice, have also stopped publication.A Trump bump in 2016 helped, as enraged women took to the web, each looking for ways to lend their support. They donated money to Bust; its subscriptions increased. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. The website is particularly hard to finance because of changing Facebook algorithms and Google ads that don\u2019t bring in much revenue.All that said, since Bust\u2019s inaugural issue, not much has changed in terms of its goals or content, or even its funding. Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel didn\u2019t have money then; they don\u2019t have much now.\u201cThese are passion projects. We\u2019re scrappy. We barter,\u201d Ms. Henzel, 54, said.When times are especially lean, Ms. Stoller explained, she and Ms. Henzel cut their own salaries so as not to bring on debt (the magazine has always been debt-free, she said). \u201cWe never spend more than we have. We find cheaper ways to do things, we learn new skills so we don\u2019t have to outsource. And we make sure we balance out.\u201dSometimes that works, sometimes not. Over the past two months, neither Ms. Henzel nor Ms. Stoller have paid themselves at all.\u201cIf we did, we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay our staff. There isn\u2019t enough money,\u201d Ms. Stoller said. \u201cOur salaries are the first things we cut. We did it once before in 2008, and now again. It\u2019s harder and harder to get people to pay for anything, especially when people are producing all this content and giving it away for free and living off investors\u2019 dollars.\u201dThe Bust team is small. There are six full-time employees and a handful of part-timers; a web editor, a freelance ad sales person, an editor on the West Coast, and rotating interns. Together, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel wear various professional hats, including editor in chief, publisher, creative director, circulation and distributions manager, web design, human resources and senior finance officer.The magazine, which is published six times a year, has approximately 10,000 subscribers. There are also newsstand sales and a pass-along circulation rate bringing it up to 70,000. The website fetches an average of 500,000 unique visitors every month.\u201cI learned so much from Bust\u2019s website,\u201d said Rachele Merliss, 21, a senior at Wesleyan University in Connecticut who was an intern this past summer. \u201cI\u2019ve been really interested in feminist and social justice issues since middle school.\u201d Ms. Merliss was able to write every day, she said, publishing articles about the culture of inappropriate behavior by male counselors at summer camps; the controversy over banning straws; and equal pay for black women.Bust has provided opportunities for young writers to stretch their muscles and build their brands. But there\u2019s a caveat.Interns and web writers write for free, and freelancer rates are humble. \u201cPeople pitch us and don\u2019t realize we only pay $150-$200 for features in the magazine. When we tell them, sometimes they don\u2019t care; sometimes they take it elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t place it, they come back,\u201d she said, explaining that clips from Bust still hold cachet in the publishing world.Aileen Gallagher, an associate professor of magazine journalism at Syracuse University, agrees that Bust is respected.\u201cI interviewed Samantha Bee in 2003 for them. I was 25. It was my first national clip, and it meant I was legit,\u201d said Ms. Gallagher, who was paid $150. Today, she still writes the occasional unpaid book review for Bust simply because she wants to. \u201cI became a feminist from reading Bust,\u201d she said. \u201cThey take chances on writers and publish a lot of women of color. Writing reviews for nothing is how I support them,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a financially sound business model, but it is socially responsible.\u201dMany celebrities still seem game to be on Bust's cover, too. Bjork, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Solange Knowles, Amy Sedaris and Cher, among many other big names, have made appearances. The comedian Jenny Slate recently hosted Bust\u2019s 25th anniversary party, with performances by Phoebe Robinson of 2 Dope Queens, the singer-songwriter Erykah Badu and the actress Amber Tamblyn.\u201cThere\u2019s more and more competition within the craft fair space, and we really count on these to generate income. Without them we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this magazine,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cThen other people started doing them too, so we had to get creative in addition, like offering classes at the event.\u201dAh, the paradox of being rebellious in a capitalistic world.\u201cBust was one of the original resistance magazines,\u201d Mr. Husni said. \u201cThey never let an ad influence their decision, they remained in touch with their audience, and they provided an antidote for women before it was the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of financial trouble, but they were on a mission. When you\u2019re on a mission, you\u2019re not going to let anyone stop you. Their subscribers feel the magazine is like a membership card to a community. That keeps the magazine going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Suspiria\u2019: Stream the Original and 8 Other Italian Horror Classics", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of us spend the Halloween season revisiting our favorite horror movies or tracking down hidden gems. Often, our watch lists are filled with the familiar names of directors who have shaped the genre from North America: Carpenter, Craven, Cronenberg, Romero. But the release this weekend of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s remake of \u201cSuspiria\u201d recalls another group of filmmakers who were just as influential: Italians working in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, whose fingerprints can be seen all over recent horror films like \u201cHereditary,\u201d \u201cThe Nun\u201d and \u201cApostle.\u201dItalian horror borrows heavily from giallo, or the Italian thriller \u2014 a genre term that repurposes the Italian word for yellow, a reference to the cheap paperback crime novels of postwar Italy. To the giallo, Italian horror directors added surreal and supernatural elements: masked stalkers, witches\u2019 covens and blood by the bucketful. As important, they also added distinctive stylistic flourishes: Their bold lighting, bright colors, jarring scores and unconventional narrative structures defied the norms of American and British horror.Some of the films were so over-the-top and gruesome that until recent years, the only versions available to most audiences were heavily edited \u2014 if available at all. Here are a few suggestions on some of the best films from that Golden Age of Italian horror, all of which are available to stream. (Streaming service information was good as of late October.)Before seeing the remake by Luca Guadagnino, there is arguably no better place to enter the realm of Italian horror film than Dario Argento\u2019s original \u201cSuspiria.\u201d Blending the supernatural with elements of the so-called giallo films that defined the early part of his career, Argento creates a phantasmagoric fairy tale that is equal parts beautiful and horrific. The plot, in which a ballerina named Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) encounters murder and witchcraft at a German dance academy, is simple enough, but the lavish set designs and Rube Goldberg-like murder sequences offer complex and sensual thrills. Aided by the cinematographer Luciano Tovoli and the prog rock score by Goblin, Argento pushes past the starker aesthetics of German Expressionism that influenced so much of the horror in this period, presenting instead a chic surrealist Pop Art nightmare.Irene Miracle in \u201cInferno.\u201dA thematic sequel to \u201cSuspiria,\u201d this second installment in Argento\u2019s Three Mothers trilogy didn\u2019t earn the same acclaim upon release as its predecessor. But it has since come to be regarded as one of the filmmaker\u2019s finer works, at least visually. \u201cInferno\u201d centers on the search by Mark Elliot (Leigh McCloskey) for his sister, Rose (Irene Miracle), who has disappeared from her New York apartment building, which is inhabited by a witch. While \u201cInferno\u201d builds up the mythology of Argento\u2019s Three Mothers, its plot isn\u2019t as engaging as that of \u201cSuspiria.\u201d Where \u201cInferno\u201d excels is in its visual effects, for which Argento invited his mentor, the Italian horror director Mario Bava, to assist. An underwater ballroom scene shot in a water tank is the highlight of the film and one of the best moments in all of Italian horror. Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cSuspiria\u201d remake incorporates some elements of \u201cInferno,\u201d making this essential prior viewing as well.Cristina Marsillach in \u201cOpera.\u201dBarbara Steele in \u201cBlack Sunday.\u201dOne of Italy\u2019s foremost horror movie sensations, Mario Bava\u2019s \u201cBlack Sunday,\u201d is often considered by many horror aficionados to be the essential gothic horror feature. Centered on a resurrected witch (Barbara Steele) who was burned at the stake alongside her vampiric lover, \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d was inspired by the Nikolai Gogol story \u201cViy\u201d and by the classic Universal Pictures films \u201cDracula\u201d (1931) and \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (1931). But where the Universal films managed to achieve a lot with very little gore, \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d is surprisingly gruesome for the period, leading to a number of banned versions and edits over the years. The influence of Bava\u2019s aesthetics can be seen on the Dracula films of the \u201960s and \u201970s starring Christopher Lee, on Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d (1992), and on films as recent as Corin Hardy\u2019s \u201cThe Nun\u201d (2018), proving the broad influence of Italy\u2019s early films in the genre.Mario Bava also left his mark on his son Lamberto, who proved his knack for the sinister and salacious as well. While the senior Bava had a more classical approach to horror, one born from literature, Lamberto Bava\u2019s films are punk rock \u2014 popcorn movies with imagery and attitude derived from comic books. Structurally, \u201cDemons\u201d utilizes a film within the film as a gateway into the supernatural. When the movie theater audience begins turning into demons as a result of a cursed mask in the theater lobby, \u201cDemons\u201d becomes a gore fest so repulsive and slick with blood that it\u2019s a true marvel of practical effects. Set to a soundtrack featuring Billy Idol, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Rick Springfield, \u201cDemons\u201d is a fun and occasionally nauseating viewing experience that still feels shocking, even by contemporary standards.Director Michele Soavi finds the sweet spot between Mario Bava\u2019s occult curiosity and Lamberto Bava\u2019s gory excess for this film set in a gothic cathedral that was built over the mass grave of Satanists. \u201cThe Church,\u201d which is the second sequel to \u201cDemons,\u201d takes a page from that film by trapping people in a single location and following their efforts to keep the evil contained. Inspired by M.R. James\u2019s \u201cThe Treasure of Abbot Thomas,\u201d the film provides more than mere shock value though, offering commentary on the nature of innocence and on the generational consequences of sin. Despite the heavy Bava influence, Soavi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Argento\u2019s, deploys his mentor\u2019s affinity for elaborate architecture and the musical talents of Goblin, who score the film alongside Keith Emerson, Fabio Pignatelli and Philip Glass. Coming near the end of Italy\u2019s Golden Age of horror film production, \u201cThe Church\u201d feels like a culmination, featuring some of the country\u2019s most prominent voices in the genre.Alongside Mario Bava and Dario Argento, the best-known director in Italian horror is the \u201cGodfather of Gore,\u201d Lucio Fulci. While Bava, Argento and their families often collaborated with one another, Fulci stood apart for most of his career, critical of Argento\u2019s success. Like Argento, Fulci was inspired by George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (1978), and he created his own follow-up, \u201cZombi 2,\u201d since retitled \u201cZombie\u201d in hopes of finding similar success within the zombie subgenre. Taking place on a Caribbean island and one of the few post-Romero zombie films explore the Haitian roots of the concept, \u201cZombie\u201d follows Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who alongside a journalist and a couple on a sailing trip, journeys to an island to find her missing father. What ensues is a showcase of Fulci\u2019s reputation for blood and guts, a talent that brought the filmmaker international attention and controversy. While the story is perhaps not unique, \u201cZombie\u201d is the most accessible of Fulci\u2019s films, which went on to get only more experimental and grisly.Daniela Doria in \u201cCity of the Living Dead.\u201dThe first installment of Fulci\u2019s \u201cGates of Hell Trilogy,\u201d \u201cCity of the Living Dead\u201d is narratively unfocused but filled with the filmmaker\u2019s unbridled ambition to shock audiences and make them squirm. Taking place both in the fictional American village of Dunwich and in New York City, the film shows what happens when one of the three gates of hell are opened and the dead begin to walk the Earth. While the film\u2019s title may suggest otherwise, this isn\u2019t a zombie film. Instead, it\u2019s a hellish take on the end of the world. The key to appreciating this film, and much of Fulci\u2019s filmography, is abandoning the need for answers, or for a plot that proceeds logically. While so much \u201980s horror came down to formula, Fulci\u2019s work never made it that simple, relying instead on a wide range of horror subgenres and the idea that the most startling horror stories aren\u2019t able to be categorized or confined. In this case, neither are internal organs.A scene from \u201cThe Beyond.\u201dConsidered by many horror filmmakers and critics to be Fulci\u2019s finest film \u2014 his \u201cSuspiria\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Beyond\u201d is a journey into surrealism, one that takes a tour of the American South by way of nightmare logic. Set in Louisiana, the film follows Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl), who inherits a hotel that houses the second gate of hell. More of a mystery than \u201cCity of the Living Dead,\u201d this second installment in Fulci\u2019s \u201cGates of Hell\u201d trilogy is slower paced but hits harder when it comes to his infamous knack for mutilating bodies \u2014 notably in one scene involving acid, and another involving flesh-eating spiders. While Fulci\u2019s work has often been defined as pulp schlock, here he blends it with an artful approach that creates parallels between the filmmaker and the artist believed to be a warlock, whose lynching sets off the events of this horrific and beautiful film.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Credit Card Giants Flout India\u2019s New Law on Personal Data", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 When the clock struck midnight in Delhi at the end of Monday, Visa, Mastercard and American Express were suddenly in violation of the law every time an Indian swiped a credit or debit card.The spark for the current fight is a new regulation, issued in April and in effect starting Tuesday, that requires payments companies to store all information about transactions involving Indians solely on computers in the country. The rule and the hubbub over it are part of a debate over a concept known as \u201cdata localization,\u201d in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies. American firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world.In India, Visa, Mastercard and American Express, as well as other financial players like Amazon and PayPal, said they needed more time to comply with the order by the country\u2019s banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.The companies told the R.B.I. that their fraud detection and other data processing systems were distributed on machines across the world and could not be quickly redesigned to work in India alone. As an alternative, they offered to store copies of the Indian data in the country for easy access by regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement.But the R.B.I. would have none of it. In recent phone calls to the top Indian executives of the major payments companies and in letters to the companies last week, the banking regulator warned that it would take action, including imposing fines, if they missed the Monday night deadline.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the payments companies were frustrated with the regulators. \u201cThey refuse to sit down and have a discussion,\u201d said Dr. Aghi, whose policy group counts the head of Mastercard on its board.Spokesmen for Visa and American Express declined to comment on their response to the local storage rule. Representatives of Mastercard and the R.B.I. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Amazon, which operates an India-only payments service that uses elements of its global technology platform, said in a statement: \u201cCompliance with local laws and regulation is a top priority for us in all the countries we operate in. We continue to work closely with the regulator towards this.\u201dIts policy changed as other arms of the Indian government \u2014 spurred by both a privacy ruling from the Supreme Court and India-first nationalists in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 had begun deliberating over much bigger changes to the country\u2019s data, e-commerce and privacy laws.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has portrayed himself abroad as a pro-business leader who welcomes foreign investment. At the same time, the right wing of his party has pushed him to adopt more protectionist, India-first policies to appeal to voters, and law enforcement officials have urged him to make sure they can easily get data on residents when they need it.The Trump administration and the bipartisan India caucus of the United States Senate have both urged India to reconsider its data localization campaign, in part because India\u2019s own outsourcing companies depend on moving data across borders to offer their services.On Friday, the co-chairmen of the India caucus, Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote to Mr. Modi warning that data localization \u201cwill have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens\u2019 data.\u201dDr. Aghi, who has helped American financial firms press their case with the Indian government, said top executives of the big payments companies were summoned to a meeting on Wednesday with B. P. Kanungo, who oversees regulation of payments at the R.B.I.At that meeting, the payments companies asked for 12 more months to fully localize Indian financial data. But R.B.I. officials insisted that the companies meet the Monday night deadline.In a follow-up letter to India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, Dr. Aghi said the R.B.I. had improperly suggested that the foreign financial firms seek assistance from iSpirt, a technology think tank in Bangalore with close ties to the government and Indian financial-services players.Advertisement"}

To truly understand Bologna, though, you need to go to the bustling, tiny Via del Pratello, one block from the decumano (the grand Via San Felice). It\u2019s where we were sitting, downing Campari and sodas, and envisioning night life here centuries ago.\u201cImagine just alcohol and prostitution, basically,\u201d Armando said. He loved using the word \u201cimagine\u201d as he showed me around his city. \u201cImagine that just 10 years ago this was a street just for a little slice of pizza and kebabs,\u201d he said, marveling at the teeming outdoor cafes. Imagine, he went on, being a student in the 11th century at the University of Bologna, the oldest in the Western world, or during the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, when Bologna was the most left-wing city in Italy, and producing the country\u2019s most iconic pop musicians. \u201cImagine Bologna from the eyes of someone who came from a really provincial situation as in the south of Italy where you find nothing interesting,\u201d he said. Armando is from Calabria and has lived in Bologna for 20 years. \u201cYou come here because it is not a city, it is a legend.\u201d\u201cHow much time can you spend with us?\u201d Francesco wanted to know.I was open, I said. I\u2019d been waiting all week to see how the Bolognese spend their Saturday nights.\u201cThat\u2019s a little dangerous,\u201d said Francesco, predicting we\u2019d be out until the wee hours, hopping from pub to restaurant to bar to hole-in-the-wall-snack spot, surrounded by others doing the same thing. Such is what happens when you have 100,000 students in a city with 500,000 citizens, many of them former students.Everyone talks about the food in Bologna, capital of the region of Emilia-Romagna (the entirety of which was on the 52 Places list). This is the land that brought you balsamic vinegar and rag\u00f9 Bolognese. But what gets lost in Instagram filters is the kind of rebel spirit you feel on the ground: the intensity it takes to achieve simplicity and craftsmanship; the discourse on history and religion and relationships and vices that leaves you buzzing long after a delicious meal. This region\u2019s greatest product might be its endless stream of maniac geniuses.I\u2019d been charmed by Bologna earlier in my trip, the pink buildings that glowed even pinker at sunset. The pace of living that seemed so slow and unforced. But with Armando and Francesco that night, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time. Did you know that those porticos were a genius way of expanding the city\u2019s housing stock \u2014 building apartments on top of the porticos \u2014 without losing sidewalk space? Or that you can find three arrows stuck in the roof of a portico on Strada Maggiore from a robbery gone wrong? Or that there\u2019s a canal in the middle of town if you just know where to find the right window to peer upon it?That night, Bologna felt like home, with endless surprises. But maybe that was the negronis talking.At the moment, though, I had more pressing things to think about, namely if I was going to have to sleep on that balcony.Matera lies in the far south region of Basilicata, at the arch of Italy\u2019s boot. Getting there had been so logistically exhausting \u2014 a four-hour, delayed train trip from Bologna, to an overnight pit stop in Salerno (the southern entrance to the Amalfi Coast), to a three-hour bus ride at 5 a.m. \u2014 that I was almost there, on a bus without Wi-Fi or cell signal, when I realized I\u2019d neglected to book a place to stay.Simona, a woman in her early 30s who speaks little English, greeted my arrival with cheek kisses. I got a two-story apartment to myself, with a private roof overlooking all of Sasso Barisano for 70 euros a night. The other rooms are in refurbished caves, as are most lodging options in the Sassi. The shower in at least one of Simona\u2019s rooms is built into a former Roman grain silo from many years before Christ. Simona, her husband, her father and her mother, all of whom I met over breakfast (her mother makes homemade cake for the guests) spent three years turning fetid, pitch-black caves into cozy, white-painted havens.I had arrived in Matera with grand ambitions to explore the Basilicata countryside, but soon found myself too engrossed to want to go anywhere else. That, and getting myself up and down Matera\u2019s pedestrian-only streets proved so tiring I couldn\u2019t even fathom how I\u2019d get to a car rental.Slowing down, too, allowed for relationships to blossom, which, in the end, is where Matera\u2019s true magic lies. On my first night, I met a photographer, Cosimo Martemucci, who was born and raised here, and, over two incredible evenings, showed me the visual playground \u2014 such as the hilltop cave church Chiesa Madonna della Idris \u2014 where he learned his trade. The most magical evening of all, though, might have been when an art restorer named Angelica Malizia took me across a canyon \u2014 Le Gravine di Matera \u2014 to a lookout called Belvedere in Parco di Murgia Timone for a complete view of the city with all its lights. We had come with her friend, Mariangela Fugliuolo, a tour guide, and their two boyfriends, Alessandro and Marcello, delightful jokesters both.In a few months, the cultural capital events would begin and the whole city might change, but I felt grateful to have had this night, and the kind of warm Matera welcome I hope will last for eons to come.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "3 Ways to Create a Climate Change Investment Strategy", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersScientist have been sounding the alarm about global warming for decades, but the report hit a chord: Time is running out before serious and possibly irreversible effects are felt.Debate on the causes and effects will continue, but money managers say this stake in the ground gives investors a concrete guide to understand how climate change will affect their investments.\u201cWhen you lay out what the challenge is, you\u2019re in a better position to attack it,\u201d said Stephen M. Liberatore, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Nuveen who manages $9 billion with an environmental, social and governance mandate.\u201cA report like that lays out the solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we need $2 trillion to invest to save the planet, here\u2019s what we need to do. I think it allows people to see what they need to do to accomplish their goals.\u201dIt has been getting easier for individuals to invest with climate change as a focus. Since 1995, assets in sustainable and responsible investments have grown 18-fold, to more than $11 trillion, according to US SIF, a membership organization of sustainable investors.There are two main approaches to creating a climate change investment strategy. One is investing in alternative energy. This can be done in a variety of areas, including solar, wind or geothermal production and distribution, or companies that make the infrastructure, like battery cells that power electric cars.The other way is what some call climate-proofing a portfolio. The premise is that a warmer Earth will create economic disruption and that companies need to prepare for this.In another example, Toyota, the maker of the Prius, has sold bonds whose proceeds were used to promote its hybrid technology.Here are three ways to consider climate change as a criterion for making investments:Investing in publicly traded equity and debt is an easy way to express a view on climate change. And their availability, along with the increasing number and size of mutual funds with a focus on the environment, offer plenty of choices.Yet these investments, like any other, carry risk. \u201cYou still have to do your homework,\u201d said Lloyd Kurtz, head of social impact investing for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cIf you buy an expensive stock with bad fundamentals, it could be green but it\u2019s still going to perform badly.\u201dThat was the case with many early solar investments and the selections that early green energy funds made, Mr. Kurtz said. But he said the case for renewable energy had been bolstered by companies, like Apple and Google, that adopted these sources to power their operations in the United States.The debt market has developed to a level that there are offerings for retail investors.Louise Herrle, managing director and head of socially responsible investing at Incapital, which underwrites bond offerings, said she had seen an increased interest from baby boomers who want a portfolio aligned with their values. This could mean offerings from the World Bank to fund water projects or bonds like the one from Toyota.\u201cRetail is going to drive this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to put their money where their mouth is. People are talking about the financial return and the social return.\u201dConstructing sustainable buildings is a major source of green investment, as are wind farms and solar arrays. But there are plenty of companies in a middle ground, working to retrofit buildings or using alternative energy to add to existing power sources.Kevin Walenta, who manages Fidelity\u2019s select environment and alternative energy portfolio, said he followed companies that saved energy in more traditional ways. These companies, like Ingersoll Rand, Lennox International, Honeywell and Johnson Controls, install efficient lighting or heating and cooling systems in commercial buildings. The result is significantly less energy consumption, higher green ratings for a building and returns in just two or three years.Mr. Walenta said he looked at both parts of investing, the environmental impact and the total return.\u201cI am looking for the companies that are driving environmental change but have a durable business model, good returns, positive cash flow and strong balance sheets,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the context of environmental change, I want them to drive profits over long periods of time.\u201dAnother area for investors is electrical utilities, he said. In regions like Southern California and Arizona, the cost of solar energy makes it competitive with traditional energy. The same, he said, holds true for wind power in parts of the Midwest like Oklahoma.\u201cA decade ago, they weren\u2019t the best investments because you had significant premium for a wind turbine or a solar panel relative to the other options, like natural gas and coal,\u201d Mr. Walenta said. \u201cToday, that difference is nonexistent.\u201dSuch strategies aim to rebut the common belief that investing with an environmental focus reduces returns. There are examples of inferior investments made to achieve a social good, but there are companies focused on green initiatives that are profitable and may be more so as climate change intensifies.\u201cThere are three main misperceptions that I talk to every investor about: You give up performance to be responsible investors, responsible investing isn\u2019t mainstream, and you can\u2019t make an impact in public market securities,\u201d Mr. Liberatore said.Our investors are \u201clooking for return potential and impact,\u201d he added.Its decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement was big news, but the United States\u2019 pollution of the environment has stayed roughly consistent over the past 25 years, and Europe has decreased its carbon levels. The big polluters have been countries in Asia, China in particular.Vivek Tanneeru, portfolio manager of the Matthews Asia ESG Fund, said that 85 percent of the growth in emissions had happened in Asia, and that China had accounted for 61 percent of that growth.On the positive side, he said, the solar panels that China installed in the first nine months of 2017 exceeded all the solar panels in the United States up to 2016.\u201cIt tells you the Chinese government has the political will to do this,\u201d Mr. Tanneeru said. \u201cAnyone who is serious about addressing climate change needs to begin in Asia to have any global impact.\u201dHis investment focus is not in renewable energy. That industry, and solar panels in particular, has not had a great track record over the past decade, largely because of government support and low barriers to entry, which led to oversupply.Mr. Tanneeru said he was focused more on battery technology, which is produced almost entirely in Asia. Tesla uses Panasonic battery cells, BMW\u2019s i3 runs on Samsung technology, and GM used batteries from LG Chemical. It\u2019s also an area, he noted, that has high barriers to entry.Another climate strategy in Asia is investing in the companies that run high-speed rail networks, like MTR in Hong Kong. In a decade, China went from zero to 125,000 kilometers of high-speed rail, making living outside polluted cities like Shanghai a possibility.Regardless of the investment type, most investors suffer from home-country bias, which is a tendency to invest more where they live even if concentrating their money there increases their risk. The same holds true for climate change investing, a fact that seems baffling given that by definition, rising temperatures are a global problem.\u201cThe U.S. has walked out of the Paris climate accord, but all of Asia is in,\u201d Mr. Tanneeru said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of appreciation of Asia\u2019s leadership in addressing these challenges. That\u2019s the big constraint in my mind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Addicts come from all over, and many never leave.Supported byMark had never heard of it, but it was easy to find, not too far off I-95. The streetlights were broken or dim, and the alleyways were dark. Most of the blocks were lined with two-story rowhouses, abandoned factories and vacant lots. Kensington Avenue, the neighborhood\u2019s main drag, was a congested mess of Chinese takeouts, pawn shops, check-cashing joints and Irish pubs. Missing-person posters hung from storefront windows. The dealers were all out in the open, calling out brand names, even handing out free samples. Many people smoked crack or meth or injected heroin. They stuck needles in their arms, necks and the skin between toes. They were limp and nodding off. Some people lay on the ground looking dead.Mark got addicted to oxycodone after he was injured by an I.E.D. while on deployment in Iraq. A friend taught him to shoot up heroin because it was a lot cheaper than taking painkillers. And the heroin in Kensington was very cheap. As little as $5 a bag. Mark was used to the high he got from drugs in Massachusetts, but this was different. \u201cWe thought it was real dope,\u201d he said. But the heroin had been cut with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that the couple had never taken before. The withdrawal was the worst Mark and Sarah had ever gone through.\u201cI\u2019ve never been so sick in my life,\u201d Mark said. \u201cIt was like the alien in the movie was going to pop out of my chest, things I\u2019ve never experienced going through detox before.\u201d They tried dosing themselves with Suboxone, a synthetic opioid that eases the pain of withdrawal. They had used it before to get sober. Now it wasn\u2019t helping. The addiction was too powerful and the withdrawal too excruciating. \u201cI knew then that I wasn\u2019t going to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we couldn\u2019t leave.\u201dIn the summer of 2017, when I first toured the area with Patrick Trainor, a special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, he called Kensington the largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast. It\u2019s known for having both the cheapest and purest heroin in the region and is a major supplier for dealers in Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland. For years, the heroin being sold in Kensington was pure enough to snort, but that summer, it was mixed with unpredictable amounts of fentanyl. In Philadelphia, deaths related to fentanyl had increased by 95 percent in the past year.Philadelphia County has the highest overdose rate of any of the 10 most populous counties in America. The city\u2019s Department of Health estimates that 75,000 residents are addicted to heroin and other opioids, and each day, many of them commute to Kensington to buy drugs. The neighborhood is part of the largest cluster of overdose deaths in the city. In 2017, 236 people fatally overdosed there.\u201cWe have not only people from other parts of the state,\u201d Trainor said, \u201cwe have people from other parts of the country who come here.\u201d Every year, \u201cdrug tourists\u201d from all over the United States visit Kensington for the heroin. Eunice Sanchez, a local pastor, put it more succinctly: the area, she said, was the \u201cWalmart of heroin.\u201dOnce a blue-collar factory neighborhood, Kensington was especially devastated when deindustrialization swept through the area in the 1950s. (Philadelphia neighborhoods don\u2019t have officially designated boundaries, and the northeast section of the city, including West Kensington, East Kensington, Fairhill, Port Richmond and Olde Richmond, is often referred to as \u201cKensington.\u201d) As the white population fled for the suburbs, Hispanic and African-American people moved in, and with few investments from the city, the drug market filled the economic vacuum. Houses transformed into drug dens, factories into spaces to shoot up, rail yards into homeless encampments. Most residents, many of them immigrant families who had come to Kensington for a better life, did not have the means to move.In the early 2000s, Dominican gangs started bringing in Colombian heroin that was not only purer but much cheaper than heroin imported from Asia, which historically predominated. Kensington\u2019s decentralized market kept competition high and prices low. Most corners were run by small, unaffiliated groups of dealers, making the area difficult to police; if a dealer was arrested, there was always someone there to replace him. The Philadelphia prison system has become the largest provider of drug treatment in the city. The police have realized that they can\u2019t arrest the problem away, and they spend many of their calls reviving drug addicts with Narcan, an overdose-reversal spray. The D.E.A. focused on the high-level drug traffickers, not the guys working the streets, but the arrests did little to curb the growing demand.\u201cThey call this the Badlands,\u201d Elvis Campos, 47, said about Kensington. \u201cGood people are held hostage in their homes.\u201d Campos, who moved to the neighborhood 22 years ago, lives on a small, crumbling block next to a demolished crack house. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the drugs when I came,\u201d he said. \u201cI found the house, and it was cheap.\u201d No one on his block used or sold drugs, he said, and his neighbors worked hard to keep it clean. But dealers were always around their homes trying to sell. \u201cI tell them to leave,\u201d Campos said. \u201cI served in Iraq, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at telling drug dealers to get off the block.\u201dLike Campos, many residents had come to Kensington simply because they couldn\u2019t afford housing anywhere else, and though many expressed empathy for the users, they also wanted them to leave. People cleared needles off their lawns, their front steps and the sidewalks where their children played. Some wouldn\u2019t go anywhere unless they were in a car, but a lot of families were too poor to afford a car. They organized cleanups, lobbied City Council members and state representatives and asked for help from church groups, but the problem seemed insurmountable. The drug market, institutional racism, joblessness and the ravages of the war on drugs in the \u201980s left the community struggling. \u201cYou see everything here,\u201d one female resident told me. \u201cOverdoses, shootings, killings. We are exposed to trauma every day just living here. It\u2019s constant.\u201dDealers fought for territory and intimidated police informants. The area has one of the highest rates of shootings and murders in the city. Less than two-thirds of the residents have a high school diploma, and only a fraction have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Nearly half the residents live below the poverty line. And yet parts of the neighborhood were solidly working-class, and the edges of the neighborhood were gentrifying. \u201cThe narrative of the opioid crisis is focused on big-pharma greed,\u201d Zo\u00eb Van Orsdol, a public-health specialist, told me, \u201cbut in Kensington the reality is far more complicated.\u201dCrystal\u2019s ankle was fractured, and her hair was damp with rainwater. She grew up just a few blocks away, and many of her relatives were addicted to heroin. Crystal started shooting up after her husband lost his job. They had split up, but she still wore her wedding ring. Narcan kept bringing her back. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing Russian roulette with your life,\u201d she told me. Crystal sobbed and folded her body over her knees while people walked by her.A lot of people first came to Kensington because a car accident or surgery had left them addicted to painkillers. Later, when they could no longer afford them, they switched to heroin. Those deep in addiction were using 10 or more times a day. People cycled in and out of Kensington\u2019s recovery houses, treatment centers and shelters. After years of this, women often ended up as prostitutes. They offered oral sex for $25 so they could buy a few bags. They had been raped, tied up and held up. They had nowhere to go to shower. They feared telling the cops about the abuse because they had already been busted on drug or prostitution charges. They slept curled with their purses between their knees and their chests.When I met Jax, a prostitute with curly blond hair, she apologized about her appearance. She had smoked crack and scratched up her face. It was speckled with wounds. Jax started using opioids in college and ended up in Kensington shooting heroin. She had checked herself into a lot of rehab centers, but she couldn\u2019t stay sober. Her boyfriend tried to help, but he got fed up. In 2009, she became pregnant and used heroin the whole nine months. Recently she spent 24 days in jail, then went right back to the streets and overdosed nine times in two weeks. \u201cSometimes I just don\u2019t ever want to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cJust let me die.\u201d\u201cWhat about your son?\u201d I asked.\u201cHe\u2019s better off without me.\u201dAt the bottom of the station steps, I met John, a 55-year-old man who lived with his parents. John was a \u201cguide\u201d: He guided customers from the train to the drugs. He could help you find heroin, cocaine, PCP, marijuana, Xanax, Percocet virtually any time of day or night. He could help you shop around, compare prices and quality. His own drug of choice was heroin, which he sniffed. John carried a grocery bag filled with clean needles. He got them from Prevention Point, a nonprofit on Kensington Avenue that exchanged dirty needles for clean ones. Needle exchanges helped stop the spread of H.I.V. and hepatitis C. But John was smart and made a small business out of it. He sold clean needles for $2. \u201cYou don\u2019t come from our world,\u201d he told me, \u201cand we don\u2019t come from your world.\u201dA few steps away, I met Shiz, a redhead dressed all in blue. Like most everyone else, Shiz was in Kensington to buy heroin. He was with his friend Kevin, a short man with a wild beard. Opioids often make people itch, and Kevin wouldn\u2019t stop scratching his arms. There was so much dead skin it looked as if his arm were foaming.\u201cI only do about 20 bucks a day,\u201d Shiz told me. He worked as a cook, making Philly cheesesteaks, and commuted into Kensington to buy drugs. Sometimes he ended up in jail and got clean. He always wanted to stay clean, but it was too hard. He tried locking himself in his house and not talking to anyone, but the boredom drove him crazy. It drove him right back to the drugs.\u201cDo you wish you could stop?\u201d I asked.He and Kevin laughed.\u201cEverybody wishes they could stop,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always in this web. You\u2019re in the web for the rest of your life.\u201dThe first order of business was to clear the railroad gulch. For decades, a mile-and-a-half-long stretch of tracks in a ravine had been a magnet for heroin users, with 300 or so people using the tracks to shoot up every day. Near a bridge over the gulch, an encampment of dozens of homeless addicts had grown up. There were mattresses piled beneath the bridge, along with tables where users cut, snorted and cooked drugs together. A Hispanic addict known as the Doctor worked behind a folding table in a shack called \u201cthe hospital.\u201d He charged a couple of dollars to shoot up those who couldn\u2019t do it themselves. People sometimes pushed the bodies of users who had overdosed and died into the bushes instead of calling the police. Residents complained about the smell.The plan was ambitious: El Campamento, as the encampment was known, would be bulldozed, the trees removed and the tracks sealed with fences. The cost was more than $1 million. Conrail, the company that owned the tracks, agreed to dispose of used needles, clear the vegetation from around the tracks and remove trash, including televisions, recliners, mattresses and hundreds of tires. The city would contribute funds for waste removal, some fences and security. It would also remove all the homeless heroin users from the site and offer them medical care and drug-treatment services.Months before the official cleanup in August 2017, the Office of Homeless Services and the Department of Behavioral Health began sending daily outreach teams to the encampment. They wanted to get as many users into treatment and supportive housing as were willing to go. Kensington Hospital expanded its treatment facilities. Housing and treatment slots opened up for those removed from the encampment. Transportation was provided for those who were willing to accept treatment, and the Office of Homeless Services paid for ID cards for those who didn\u2019t have them. Social workers and community groups set up trailers on a corner, right outside El Campamento, ready with volunteers who would help connect the homeless heroin addicts to treatment.That August, just before the demolition was scheduled to begin, I walked along the edges of the tracks and could hear people moving around in the vegetation below. Streams of users walked to and from the tracks to buy and use drugs. Two cops patrolled the area, as drug-dealing kids on trick bikes looped around to run their own surveillance. A man with thick hair and camo pants came up the street and started waving his arms. \u201cNever see this in Texas, man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis place is crazy.\u201d\u201cAre you homeless?\u201d I asked.\u201cNah, I\u2019m down here for the summer,\u201d he said.He had traveled from Texas to sniff the heroin. After two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said, he started taking painkillers recreationally. He said he learned about Kensington from the National Geographic docu-series \u201cDrugs Inc.,\u201d in its 2013 episode \u201cPhilly Dope.\u201d At first he threw up because the heroin was so strong. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I won\u2019t end up like these people. I do other things with my life. I race dirt bikes. I do jujitsu. I take a shower every day.\u201dA few days later, Conrail\u2019s team started clearing El Campamento. On a bridge overlooking the encampment, crowds of spectators gathered to watch the destruction. Machines ripped trees from the ground and pulverized them on the spot. Cars honked in celebration. An avalanche of garbage stretched from the top of the slope to the bottom of the ravine.Two E.M.S. workers chatted about the addicts who overdosed. \u201cIf you were on the street having a heart attack and you were dying, and I left you and you died, that\u2019s on me,\u201d one said. \u201cI come and wake you up from an overdose, and you walk away, and I get you again three hours later? That is insanity. I\u2019m like: Make them go to rehab.\u201d He nodded toward a machine that scooped up trash. \u201cSometimes you need to take a different approach.\u201dIn October, outside the Rev. Billy Cortes\u2019s trailer church, a bin overflowed with trash, and the ground was covered with syringes. Homeless men pushed grocery carts, and addicts shuffled up and down the sidewalk. None of the neighbors were out playing dominoes as they usually did. \u201cPeople are afraid to go outside,\u201d Cortes said. He blamed the city for working too quickly to clear El Campamento. There were more drunk people, more needles in front of his house and on the street. Every day, for weeks, he saw someone overdose. Every corner of his block was littered with trash.\u201cLook at all these people,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at my neighborhood. See all this trash. Trash everywhere. It\u2019s all dirty now! You think this is fair? This is the reality of this neighborhood. The job the city made is not good. These people don\u2019t have a plan. The cleanup is good for the future, but at the moment it\u2019s not a good thing.\u201dWinter arrived, and the addicts took shelter in four railroad underpasses beneath elevated sections of Conrail\u2019s railroad tracks, at Kensington Avenue, Emerald Street, Frankford Avenue and Tulip Street. These new encampments were all within a half-mile corridor, just a short walk from where El Campamento had been. In general, the cleanup had pushed the market and the users east toward Olde Richmond and Port Richmond, where the population tended to be less Hispanic and more white. Areas that hadn\u2019t seen a lot of activity in the past were now busy with drug use.Desiree Gilman, a 34-year-old nurse with shoulder-length blond hair, lived in a rowhouse with her children about a block away from the Tulip Street underpass. Gilman was raised in the neighborhood and did everything she could to stay away from heroin. She focused on her career and raising a family. \u201cBut still,\u201d she told me, \u201cabout 80 percent of my friends are either in jail or dead.\u201dSince the cleanup, her car\u2019s battery had been stolen three times, and she had found a man sleeping in the back seat. She pointed at the tracks across the street. \u201cI see people up there sleeping. I see clothes in the trees. You just see people crunching through the leaves. It\u2019s creepy.\u201d In the mornings, she got her 5-year-old son ready for school and waited with him until the school bus came. \u201cI feel bad for them,\u201d she said about the users. \u201cI really do, but I can\u2019t have them shooting up on my steps. I don\u2019t want my kids to see it.\u201dA 40-year-old man who went by the nickname Country looked at me with blue eyes and droopy brows. He used to be at the Kensington underpass but moved to Frankford after people found out he had H.I.V. They didn\u2019t want him around. Country slept on two flattened boxes. In the middle of the tunnel, where it was dark, I watched Country try to inject a man in the neck. Country was high and missed the vein. He kept going unconscious with the needle still in his hand.A man named George sat on a soggy mattress, next to a rug with a tiger on it. He was a new arrival from South Philly. His eyes looked as if someone had scooped them out and filled them with mud. The night before, he said, two cars collided outside the underpass and a man was ejected through the windshield.\u201cWhy come up here?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be homeless here,\u201d George said. \u201cYou get help up here. You get food. Everything I have I was given from somebody. The drugs are here \u2014 they are closer and cheaper.\u201d George wiped his nose with his sleeve. \u201cPeople think we are having fun down here. Are you insane? I live under a bridge.\u201dI didn\u2019t go to Kensington at night on Code Blue days in December, when the temperatures were dangerously cold. But the addicts were still there. They set up burn barrels to keep fires going, and the city opened emergency warming rooms. Even when the temperatures dropped to single digits, many of the addicts refused go to a shelter. For some users, opioid withdrawal was worse than the possibility of freezing to death.Shanta Schachter, a community development consultant who was hired by Conrail during the cleanup as a liaison between the company and neighborhood organizations, watched the new encampments grow throughout the winter. Months before the Conrail cleanup began, she attended community meetings and chatted with neighbors. She had encouraged residents to take control of Kensington by planting trees in vacant lots, building fences, painting abandoned buildings, installing streetlights. During the cleanup, she was hopeful, but after she drove through the tunnels, she was worried about the addicts living there. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an incredible amount of suffering,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are getting better. There aren\u2019t resources to help the people who are addicted now. I don\u2019t think anybody really knows how to get the addicts off the streets. It can\u2019t just be new beds, or recovery services, or anything else. It has to be everything.\u201dThe city was willing to try almost anything. In January, the Department of Public Health announced that the city would \u201cencourage organizations to develop\u201d supervised-injection sites, where people can bring their own drugs without fear of arrest and inject under the care of a medical team. There are roughly 120 of these injection sites around the world \u2014 although none in the United States \u2014 and research has shown that they reduce overdose deaths, connect addicts to long-term care and help keep neighborhoods clean of needles. There has never been a fatal overdose at an official safe-injection site. The Justice Department made it clear that it would view any such place to be in violation of federal drug laws, but Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor, threw his support behind a nonprofit group trying to establish one.At one community meeting this March, city officials explained the idea to residents. The clinic would be located where the most overdose deaths occurred, and that very likely meant Kensington. Many of the overdose victims were white men, though, and some of the minority residents didn\u2019t think it was fair. They worried that establishing a supervised-injection site in the neighborhood would condemn it to a permanent future of drug use. Brooke Feldman, a social worker, had planned to bring a homeless user named Johnny to the meeting, but when she went to the Tulip Street underpass that morning, he had already died of an overdose. \u201cHe said he would use the site and wanted to be a part of the conversation,\u201d Feldman told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even live to be able to do that.\u201dDan Martino, a community organizer who put together a march for overdose awareness, had been lobbying for a supervised-injection site for years. \u201cWe already have unsafe injection sites on every street corner in the city, and it\u2019s not working out,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to be easier to get help than heroin.\u201dFrom the stoop, the Kensington underpass looked dark, like the opening to a rat hole. \u201cThe screaming at all hours of the night is way out of control,\u201d Dawn said. \u201cIt basically sounds like they are killing each other.\u201dNancy\u2019s nephew was an eighth-grade student at Visitation Blessed Virgin Mary, a Catholic school just on the other side of the tracks. Every day he walked back and forth through the tunnel, along with hundreds of other schoolchildren, while the addicts continued to shoot up beneath the dim lights. Some children avoided the tunnel by walking north to the B Street bridge and then swinging back around to Kensington Avenue.The sisters\u2019 family had lived on Tusculum Street for five generations, and the kids had always been able to play on the street. The underpass used to be empty, and they took care of the vacant lot to make sure it didn\u2019t turn into a dumping site. Now they woke up to find feces and urine on their stoops. They swept needles off their steps, and they took their plants inside because the pots filled with syringes. They wouldn\u2019t let the children play in the snow because of the buried needles.Dawn lived one door closer to the tunnel than Nancy. \u201cIn all the years we have been here, it was never like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey lived on the railroad, like way up that way, where there are no houses. But you know, we don\u2019t count, so whatever.\u201d\u201cThey eat, like, six times a day,\u201d Nancy said. \u201cThey eat more than I do. They get coffee and doughnuts in the morning. They brought them tents and blankets. Their drug dealer is two blocks away.\u201d\u201cThey have no reason to go when everyone is giving them absolutely everything,\u201d Dawn said. \u201cThe only thing we wish they had is a bathroom.\u201d\u201cThere is one girl down there with blond hair,\u201d Nancy said. \u201cI literally see her go to the bathroom at least four times a day right there. She walks 10 steps out from the tunnel, with her back facing us, pulls her pants down and goes. I can\u2019t deal with it anymore. We were thinking about opening that fire hydrant and letting that water go. Just flood them out.\u201d She looked east. \u201cTulip is already starting to fill up. If the addicts migrate to Port Richmond, the neighbors are going to riot.\u201dWith pressure from the neighborhood, the city agreed to remove the homeless addicts from the Tulip Street and Kensington Avenue tunnels. A deadline was set for the end of May. In a news release about the removals, the city\u2019s managing director said the camps \u201cpose a health and safety threat to those who stay there as well as to the neighbors.\u201d As for the other two encampments, the city didn\u2019t have the resources. The residents would have to wait.Liz Hersh, the director of the Office of Homeless Services in the city, described the underpass encampments as one of the most complex and challenging aspects of Philadelphia\u2019s opioid crisis. The city wanted to respond to the needs of the residents, she told me, \u201cin a way that was also humane for those suffering from addiction,\u201d even when those needs were not always one and the same. The goal was to get as many people as possible into treatment or a shelter by the end of May, but a new approach was needed.The city realized it needed to help get people into treatment more quickly. Outreach workers began evaluating people for treatment in the tunnels and on the streets, ushering them into vans for privacy. They were able to dose some users immediately with Suboxone and transport them to care. In just two weeks, more users agreed to go into treatment than had in the previous six months. \u201cAt the Conrail cleanup,\u201d Hersh told me, \u201cwe all thought everyone should go into treatment, and it turned out that offering them homeless services, and specifically low-barrier housing, gave us better results.\u201dBut as the city worked to clear the encampments, the drug dealers seemed to become more aggressive. On a small block off Kensington Avenue, someone threw a Molotov cocktail through a resident\u2019s window. Dealers were looking for turf, but residents were demanding that they stay off their blocks. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of danger and violence we face,\u201d Eduardo Esquivel, a resident, told me. His wife was threatened by a panhandler, and his neighbor was surrounded in his car with a young child when users swarmed his block for free samples. \u201cMy worry,\u201d Esquivel said, \u201cis we are being asked to face this epidemic as a neighborhood, but the threat of violence is very high and very real, and it\u2019s only getting worse.\u201dAt Tulip Street, two men dragged a tent into the trees on top of the viaduct. The younger man started popping his boils in a side mirror of a school bus while the other man called his mother. \u201cHey Mom, it\u2019s Nathan,\u201d he said. \u201cJust letting you know I\u2019m alive. I love you. Bye.\u201dNathan put down the phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to rehab,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf there is anytime to go, then now is the time.\u201d\u201cWill this be your first time?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the ninth time.\u201dAnother homeless man came out of the trees behind us. He looked down at himself. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take my photo,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family would be devastated.\u201dNancy, Dawn and a neighbor pulled out butterfly chairs to watch the removals unfold at the Kensington Avenue tunnel. \u201cI have two children in addiction, and this is ridiculous,\u201d the neighbor said. \u201cThat\u2019s a life choice.\u201dIn a lot in front of their homes, the police dragged a shirtless man off a mattress. A young woman with a pink backpack kept going unconscious with a cigarette in her mouth. On the other side of the tunnel, people waited in line at One Pound Cheese Steaks while users shot up in the adjacent lot. Next to the counter, a man lay unconscious. \u201cWe are trying to keep it together for the community,\u201d an employee told me, \u201cand it\u2019s not working out.\u201dMark and Sarah, the couple who stopped in Kensington to buy drugs and never left, were being removed from the Tulip underpass. Mark wore an American-flag tank top and his sandy-colored hair curled beneath a baseball hat. \u201cSapper school,\u201d he said, referring to the Army training course for combat engineers, \u201cwas probably the hardest thing I did in life. I don\u2019t know how I did something like that but I can\u2019t get my [expletive] together out here.\u201d He and Sarah filled a shopping cart with damp clothes and a moldy sleeping pad tied with a bungee cord. They were going to push the shopping cart to a shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a hike from here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s where we go to cop drugs anyway.\u201dCountry was out wandering the avenue. He was almost unrecognizable, with thin limbs and sunken cheeks and a shaved head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said.\u201cWhere\u2019s your stuff?\u201d I asked.\u201cThis is my stuff.\u201d He had a pocketful of syringes. He turned his back to me and began to cry. He cried for a minute, until the train rushed overhead and drowned him out.By noon, the Kensington Avenue underpass was empty. Dark clouds made the early afternoon feel like twilight. Dawn waited on her stoop with her arms crossed. She pointed to the empty lot behind a factory just east of her block. \u201cThey are building a new camp right over there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told me they are going to come right back.\u201dThere were already about 30 people in the lot, injecting, defecating and sleeping. One of them, Krista, 30, told me she started using heroin after she was raped in college. She was crouched over a lavender purse cleaning a crack pipe and wore a T-shirt that said \u201cPerfect is Boring.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m a little further away, I have this nervous feeling that I need to come back to Kensington,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big dysfunctional family. I guess this is the one place I belong.\u201dA portion of the factory, on the corner of East Somerset and Ruth Streets, was being converted into a $17.8 million office building with low-income housing. Residents were already living there. It was supposed to be a sign of hope. But Country had told me it was one of his new favorite places to shoot up. Someone had spray-painted \u201cGentrification Is Genocide\u201d on the wall.In a single weekend over the summer, 173 people overdosed from the same bad batch of heroin. It was called Santa Muerte, or Saint Death, and witnesses said people were responding in ways they hadn\u2019t seen when waking up from an overdose. They were agitated and scratched the air in pain.The city plans to clear the other two encampments in the coming months. This time, activists are worried that the users will go deeper into hiding, that more of them will die alone. \u201cWe are still not done,\u201d Devin Reaves, who participated in the mayor\u2019s opioid task force, told me. \u201cUntil we see a decrease in overdose deaths year after year, I don\u2019t know if you can say we have done enough,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can we say we made an impact if people are still dying?\u201dSometimes addicts died in Kensington and no one claimed the bodies. Investigators searched for loved ones, but if none could be found, the remains were buried without a funeral. Some residents mourned in their own way. They wrote the names of the dead on walls or sewed patches with portraits onto a quilt. Small memorials began appearing on land near the railroad tracks and in gardens along Kensington Avenue, close to the place the addicts had called home.Advertisement"}

Other people\u2019s screens are everywhere, once you start to notice them. They\u2019re collectively most obvious at night, as they bob through the city, creating a new, hand-height layer to the ambient lights, or when held up at concerts, like lighters. During the day, other people\u2019s screens hover around us as we wait in line for coffee, or as we sit and drink our coffee, or as we take our coffee on the bus or train.Other people\u2019s screens are windows into their lives, and brains, and relationships and work \u2014 into their politics, anxieties, failures and addictions. They tend to appear between one and three feet away from other people\u2019s faces, depending.Other people\u2019s screens are also a lot smaller than they used to be, when they were perched almost exclusively on desks and tables at offices and in homes, where the presence of strangers is rare or worrying by default. In 2010, 27 percent of the American people carried portable screens; by the end of 2016, it was more than 80 percent. Over the same period, the largest iPhone screen grew from 3.5 inches, from one corner to the other, to 5.5. Other people\u2019s screens got clearer and brighter, from a wider range of angles: flat on a desk; held low, for a glance during dinner; held out for a group to see; and of course, spied over a shoulder, on the way to work.Vic and Cas, who, disarmingly, \u201ccould both be you or anyone else\u201d are shown as stick figures to help participants respond to prompts like: \u201cDo you know of a **real** situation in which this happened?\u201d and \u201cWhat exactly could Vic see on the screen (e.g. text, pictures, passwords/PINs, maps, videos, apps, games, etc.)?\u201dOther people also do not enjoy being asked about other people\u2019s screens, in my experience, in part because they know what they\u2019ve seen, and that they probably shouldn\u2019t have seen it. (Fellow journalists seem somewhat less conflicted about catching a glimpse of a screen on the subway or a bus.) It\u2019s a global phenomenon, of course, but stories abound in New York, the American capital of other people\u2019s screens. On the subway, and on the bus, other people\u2019s screens join distinguished company: ads, the floor, the covers of books, and \u2014 a closer relation \u2014 accidental eye contact. Other people\u2019s screens on the subway were, until recently, glimpses of an archive: there was little access to cell service, or Wi-Fi. That was a more leisurely era, on other people\u2019s screens; the Candy Crush years, the reading-in-apps years, the phone-as-book-or-magazine years, and the tiny television years. Other people\u2019s screens found the fabled end-of-the-feed, at least for the duration of an underground commute. Then came the signal, and with it everything else. In 2018, other people\u2019s screens are habitually, frantically refreshed. Other people\u2019s screens are works in progress: they are tense and short texts with no context, typed and retyped, and then, for those underground, sent at the next stop; they are extraordinarily long messages, exchanges of lengths I was not aware were possible on a phone, from which one instantly turns away in shame after spotting the word \u201cdivorce;\u201d they are selfies getting touched up, and then discarded; they are seemingly infinite group message chains full of religious affirmations; they are work emails with a lot of talk about clients, and the client, and our client, because the train is a place of work now, just like the office, just like the home. Other people\u2019s screens may also be a brief historical aberration. Phones now unlock by scanning their owners\u2019 faces, and, separately, can tell if you\u2019re smiling in a photo; it is not much of a jump that they could tell when other people are watching, too, on a train or elsewhere. More broadly, it may just seem strange, someday, according to a few conceivable futures, that other people\u2019s screens were in their hands for a while, out in the world, instead of in front of their eyes, or attached to their brains.

{"Headline": "Google Plus Will Be Shut Down After User Information Was Exposed", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it would shut down Google Plus, the company\u2019s long-struggling answer to Facebook\u2019s giant social network, after it discovered a security vulnerability that exposed the private data of up to 500,000 users.The decision to stay quiet, which raised eyebrows in the cybersecurity community, comes against the backdrop of relatively new rules in California and Europe that govern when a company must disclose a security episode.Up to 438 applications made by other companies may have had access to the vulnerability through coding links called application programming interfaces. Those outside developers could have seen user names, email addresses, occupation, gender and age. They did not have access to phone numbers, messages, Google Plus posts or data from other Google accounts, the company said.Google said it had found no evidence that outside developers were aware of the security flaw and no indication that any user profiles were touched. The flaw was fixed in an update made in March.Google looked at the \u201ctype of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance,\u201d Ben Smith, a Google vice president for engineering, wrote in the blog post.The disclosure made on Monday could receive additional scrutiny because of a memo to senior executives reportedly prepared by Google\u2019s policy and legal teams that warned of embarrassment for the company \u2014 similar to what happened to Facebook this year \u2014 if it went public with the vulnerability.In May, Europe adopted new General Data Protection Regulation laws that require companies to notify regulators of a potential leak of personal information within 72 hours. Google\u2019s security issue occurred in March, before the new rules went into effect.California recently passed a privacy law, which goes into effect in 2020, allowing consumers in the event of a data breach to sue for up to $750 for each violation. It also gives the state\u2019s attorney general the right to go after companies for intentional violations of privacy.Steven Andr\u00e9s, a professor who lectures about management information systems at San Diego State University, said there was no obvious legal requirement for Google to disclose the vulnerability. But he added that it was troubling \u2014 though unsurprising \u2014 to see that the company was discussing how reporting the vulnerability might look to regulators.There is no federal law requiring companies to disclose a security vulnerability. Companies must wade through a patchwork of state laws with different standards.Just last month, Google was criticized for not sending Mr. Pichai to a hearing attended by top executives from Facebook and Twitter.Introduced in 2011, Google Plus was meant to be a Facebook competitor that linked users to various Google products, including its search engine and YouTube. But other than a few loyal users, it did not catch on. By 2018, it was an afterthought.Google would not say how many people now frequent Google Plus, but it said in the blog post that the service had low usage \u2014 90 percent of users\u2019 sessions are less than five seconds long.When Google\u2019s engineers discovered the vulnerability, they concluded that the work required to maintain Google Plus was not worth the effort, considering the meager use of the product, the company said.Google said it planned to turn off the consumer version of Google Plus in August 2019, though a version built for corporate customers will still exist.The failure of Google Plus has relieved Google of some pressure on issues faced by Facebook and Twitter, particularly Russian disinformation efforts.When Google announced in August that it had deleted accounts suspected of ties to Iranian influence campaigns, the company disclosed that it had deleted 13 Google Plus accounts \u2014 compared to 652 accounts that Facebook had deleted for the same concerns.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Made My Puzzle?", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bypuzzle makingThis month\u2019s spotlight shines on Sam Ezersky.New York City, N.Y.The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, March 25, 2012.I was maybe six years old, waiting around in a Hair Cuttery, and I noticed a half-completed Fill-It-In puzzle in an open magazine. It was like a crossword, except that instead of clues, every answer was alphabetized by length, presented as a word bank. I was so fascinated by this display of interlocking words, and although I didn\u2019t know what 75 percent of them meant, I was able to fill the grid successfully. I loved the experience so much, and still remember parts of the puzzle today! Thus began an obsession with crossword-style grids that has lasted 17 years and counting.Not only did I enjoy solving Fill-It-In puzzles throughout elementary school, but I was always intrigued by their construction, so there was never a real transition between being a constructor versus a solver. On long car rides, I would draw up grids in crayon, and they were half-decent; \u201chalf-decent\u201d in the sense that maybe half my answers were acceptable for current standards. Because it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m good at.I use CrossFire on my Mac, Crossword Compiler on my PC, and Crossword Maker for Cruciverbalists on my iPhone. That sounds like a lot, but I only use them so as not to do anything by hand.Zero. All my filling is done manually by querying databases using strings of known and unknown letter patterns. I enjoy this approach to construction as it allows me to get creative when no results are returned, and the increased challenge of pulling off a wide-open grid is so exciting. If it\u2019s not real, it\u2019s not going in my puzzle. OON and INI are common suffixes? People say E-MAG? \u201cThe three R\u2019s\u201d is the same thing as RRR? Come on, now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Efforts to Acknowledge the Risks of New A.I. Technology", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July, two of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence labs unveiled a system that could read lips.Designed by researchers from Google Brain and DeepMind \u2014 the two big-name labs owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet \u2014 the automated setup could at times outperform professional lip readers. When reading lips in videos gathered by the researchers, it identified the wrong word about 40 percent of the time, while the professionals missed about 86 percent.But the researchers did not discuss the other possibility: better surveillance.\u201cThe computer industry can become like the oil and tobacco industries, where we are just building the next thing, doing what our bosses tell us to do, not thinking about the implications,\u201d said Brent Hecht, a Northwestern University professor who leads the group. \u201cOr we can be the generation that starts to think more broadly.\u201dWhen publishing new work, researchers rarely discuss the negative effects. This is partly because they want to put their work in a positive light \u2014 and partly because they are more concerned with building the technology than with using it.And, with more dangerous technologies, the A.I. community may have to reconsider its commitment to open research. Some things, the argument goes, are best kept behind closed doors.If machines can generate believable photos and videos, we may have to change the way we view what winds up on the internet.Can Google\u2019s lip-reading system help with surveillance? Maybe not today. While \u201ctraining\u201d their system, the researchers used videos that captured faces head-on and close-up. Images from overhead street cameras \u201care in no way sufficient for lip-reading,\u201d said Joon Son Chung, a researcher at the University of Oxford.Stavros Petridis, a research fellow at Imperial College London, acknowledged that this kind of technology could eventually be used for surveillance, even with smartphone cameras. \u201cIt is inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, no matter what you build, there are good applications and bad applications.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it stays here.\u201dBut one Liedy\u2019s regular stands out: Ahmed Shareef. At 21, he\u2019s about 40 years younger than the average patron, who tends to be born-and-bred in Staten Island. Mr. Shareef is a refugee from Iraq. One day in April 2004, when he was 7, Ahmed was walking home from school in Baghdad when an explosion blew off half his right arm and burned his eyes, blinding him.Despite his disabilities, Mr. Shareef leads a rotating cast of musicians in Blind Ambition, a band he named that frequently performs at Liedy\u2019s on Wednesdays and weekends. Mr. Shareef plays the keyboard and melodica, a strange-looking keyboard with a tube that he blows into like a recorder, while singing bar band standards and originals he\u2019s written in a classic rock style.When the tempo quickens, and Mr. Shareef feels good, he uses his right-side stump to play chords in hard-charging, rhythmic stabs. Head tilted back, singing to the ceiling, he will mash his way to a crescendo.Mr. Shareef isn\u2019t aware of other pianists incorporating a maimed limb into performance. He might have invented the technique. \u201cAs a person who\u2019d like to do something and have fun, you\u2019re going to try everything,\u201d he said.Liedy\u2019s stalwarts revere Mr. Shareef\u2019s grit. \u201cHe\u2019s just a real inspiration,\u201d said a bandmate, Bill Moser, 59. \u201cMy kid starts bitching about stuff, I say: \u2018Shut up. You have an arm, you know, and you can see it.\u2019\u201dYet Mr. Shareef is not entirely accepted at Liedy\u2019s. Well-meaning regulars at the bar appear not to have connected their admiration for Mr. Shareef personally with their general view of his background.\u201cNot all Muslims are terrorists; all the terrorists were Muslims,\u201d said Mr. Galante, the bassist. \u201cMy question is \u2014 and I will ask any person this question \u2014 why don\u2019t the good people stand up against the bad people?\u201dMr. Galante looks like most people drinking at Liedy\u2019s: a middle-aged white man in the only borough in the city that went for Donald Trump. Gerry Di Costanzo, 59, a drummer who\u2019s played with Mr. Shareef, said he agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of Muslims during the 2016 campaign. \u201cI felt that way \u2014 that they\u2019re terrorists, with all this garbage going on.\u201dMr. Shareef, who started playing at the bar three years ago, has noticed a rise in Islamophobia. \u201cPeople say stuff, but they don\u2019t say it directly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hear it, and they know you\u2019re there.\u201dMr. Shareef\u2019s religion isn\u2019t usually discussed at Liedy\u2019s, but it can make people uneasy. \u201cIs he a Muslim?\u201d asked Larry Liedy, 67, the bar\u2019s owner and a great-grandson of its founder. \u201cWell, he loves Catholics, and he loves me, and he loves everybody in here. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s practicing.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Shareef started going to mosque this year. Since the election, he has become worried about being under surveillance, especially when contacting his mother, father and siblings, who still live in Iraq. \u201cI went through days and days of being nervous to talk to my family, and say hello. I have these thoughts: What if the cops come now and take me?\u201dOnstage at Liedy\u2019s, Mr. Shareef hears the sounds of inclusion. One patron, Donna Fagan, is nicknamed \u201cYeah Yeah Yeah\u201d for her rowdy chants during his sets. As Mr. Shareef\u2019s songs reach a climax, a bartender, John Grecsek, rings a mounted silver bell in clangorous approval.Yet Mr. Shareef acts restrained. He can name who in this audience voted for Trump and the Muslim travel ban. If he says anything after a song, it\u2019s often less the statement of a rock star or hometown hero, and more that of a polite guest: \u201cThank you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Gadget Is a Video-Chat Screen With a Camera That Follows You", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2004, Facebook has said it wants to bring the world closer together. To accomplish that goal, the company has relied mostly on the web and smartphone apps.But software is no longer enough. On Monday, Facebook introduced a pair of video-calling devices \u2014 Portal and Portal Plus \u2014 to help expand its reach into people\u2019s living rooms.Portal, which has a 10-inch screen, will sell for $199, while the other model, with a 15-inch display that can be rotated, will be priced at $349. Facebook plans to offer the gadgets on a stand-alone website in time for the holidays, and has a major marketing campaign in the works.The devices are Facebook\u2019s first major foray into designing, building and selling consumer hardware from scratch. If the Portals are successful, the company could encourage more people to use its social network regularly to keep in touch with friends and family, as well as for apps like Spotify and Pandora.To address privacy concerns with Portal and Portal Plus, Facebook said the products include an electronic kill switch for the front-facing camera, as well as a cover for the lens. In addition, video calls are encrypted, and the camera\u2019s A.I. technology runs on the device itself, not on Facebook\u2019s servers, the company said.The company said the utility of the devices, which work on a household Wi-Fi connection, would convince people of their importance in a home. The devices are built atop Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, and the communication software is hooked into a user\u2019s web of Facebook connections. Once Portal is connected to a Messenger account, people can video chat with anyone in their network across devices, be it on Portal, a tablet, a smartphone or a desktop computer.Instead of building its own virtual assistant three years after Alexa\u2019s debut, Facebook worked with Amazon. Like other Amazon-powered products, Portal can be controlled by speaking the word \u201cAlexa\u201d before a question or a request, like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d or \u201cSet a timer for 10 minutes.\u201dJonathan Collins, a research director for ABI Research, said it was wise for Facebook to collaborate with Amazon. While creating a digital assistant has helped Apple, Google and Amazon make their products look more attractive, there was no clear benefit for Facebook to make one of its own, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an obvious link to what they do for people at present,\u201d which is to deepen people\u2019s relationships, Mr. Collins said.Facebook had worked on hardware previously, though its involvement with Portal goes much deeper and further. In 2013, the company and the manufacturer HTC produced the HTC First, a smartphone that ran on a new Facebook-based operating system. The phone flopped.The company also sells virtual-reality goggles, which it got into when the start-up Oculus was already building those products. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014.Rafa Camargo, Facebook\u2019s vice president who oversees Portal, said that when his team said it wanted to work on a smart home product with a large screen, his peers reacted in disbelief \u2014 especially since Amazon and Apple were focused on speakers and not video.\u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\u2019re nuts. The whole thing is just about smart speakers and just voice,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Camargo, who joined Facebook about two years ago.But he said that voice was just one feature of the product and that Facebook could offer customers a different type of experience.\u201cWe come from focusing on people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Hawkins Is Finally Ready to Explain His Brain Research", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 In the global race to build artificial intelligence, it was a missed opportunity.Jeff Hawkins, a Silicon Valley veteran who spent the last decade exploring the mysteries of the human brain, arranged a meeting with DeepMind, the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab.Scientists at DeepMind, which is owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, want to build machines that can do anything the brain can do. Mr. Hawkins runs a little company with one goal: figure out how the brain works and then reverse engineer it.The meeting, set for April at DeepMind\u2019s offices in London, never happened. DeepMind employs hundreds of A.I. researchers along with a team of seasoned neuroscientists. But when Mr. Hawkins chatted with Demis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind, before his visit, they agreed that almost no one at the London lab would understand his work.Mr. Hawkins says that before the world can build artificial intelligence, it must explain human intelligence so it can create machines that genuinely work like the brain. \u201cYou do not have to emulate the entire brain,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you do have to understand how the brain works and emulate the important parts.\u201dAt his company, called Numenta, that is what he hopes to do. Mr. Hawkins, 61, began his career as an engineer, created two classic mobile computer companies, Palm and Handspring, and taught himself neuroscience along the way.Now, after more than a decade of quiet work at Numenta, he thinks he and a handful of researchers working with him are well on their way to cracking the problem.On Monday, at a conference in the Netherlands, he is expected to unveil their latest research, which he says explains the inner workings of cortical columns, a basic building block of brain function.How a larger community of researchers react to Mr. Hawkins\u2019s work is hard to predict: Will they decide his research is worth exploring? Or will they write him off as too unorthodox in his methods and much too sure of himself?Mr. Hawkins has been following his own, all-encompassing idea for how the brain works. It is a step beyond the projects of most neuroscientists, like understanding the brain of a fruit fly or exploring the particulars of human sight.His theory starts with cortical columns. Cortical columns are a crucial part of the neocortex, the part of the brain that handles sight, hearing, language and reason. Neuroscientists don\u2019t agree on how the neocortex works.Mr. Hawkins says cortical columns handle every task in the same way, a sort of computer algorithm that is repeated over and over again. It is a logical approach to the brain for a man who spent decades building new kinds of computing devices.All he has to do is figure out the algorithm.A number of neuroscientists like the idea, and some are pursuing similar ideas. They also praise Mr. Hawkins for his willingness to think so broadly. Being a maverick is not easily done in academia and the world of traditional research. But it\u2019s a little easier when you can fund your own work, as Mr. Hawkins has.Still, some wonder if his self-funded operation, isolated from the rigors of academic interaction, is a quixotic adventure. They have been researching the brain one little piece at a time for a good reason: Piecing how it all works together is a monumental, hard-to-fathom task.\u201cIt is clear we need a better understanding of intelligence,\u201d said Tomaso Poggio, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who introduced Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Hassabis. \u201cBut Jeff is doing this the hard way.\u201d\u201cThe brain is by far the most complex piece of highly excitable matter in the known universe by any measure,\u201d said Christof Koch, the chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science. \u201cWe don\u2019t even understand the brain of a worm.\u201dIn 1979, with an article in Scientific American, Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize winner for his DNA research, called for an all-encompassing theory of the brain, something that could explain this \u201cprofoundly mysterious\u201d organ.Mr. Hawkins graduated from Cornell in 1979 with a degree in electrical engineering. Over the next several years, he worked at Intel, the computer chip giant, and Grid Systems, an early laptop company. But after reading that magazine article, he decided the brain would be his life\u2019s work.He proposed a neuroscience lab inside Intel. After the idea was rejected, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. His doctoral thesis proposal was rejected, too. He was, suffice to say, an outlier.In 1992, Mr. Hawkins founded Palm Computing. A decade and a half before the iPhone, he had created a hand-held computer for the masses. When he hired the company\u2019s chief executive, Donna Dubinsky, he warned that whenever possible, he would drop his work with Palm and return to neuroscience. \u201cThat was always there, simmering in the background,\u201d Ms. Dubinsky said.Around the time of the second sale, Mr. Hawkins built his own neuroscience lab. But it was short-lived. He could not get a lab full of academics focused on his neocortical theory. So, along with Ms. Dubinsky and an A.I. researcher named Dileep George, he founded Numenta.The company spent years trying to build and sell software, but eventually, after Mr. George left, it settled into a single project. Funded mostly by Mr. Hawkins \u2014 he won\u2019t say how much he has spent on it \u2014 the company\u2019s sole purpose has been explaining the neocortex and then reverse engineering it.Inside Numenta, Mr. Hawkins sits in a small office. Five other neuroscientists, mostly self-taught, work in a single room outside his door.Mr. Hawkins said a moment of clarity came about two and a half years ago, while he was sitting in his office, staring at a coffee cup.He touched the cup and dragged his finger across the rim. Then he leapt to his feet and ran through the door.As Mr. Hawkins looked at that cup, he decided that cortical columns did not just capture sensations. They captured the location of those sensations. They captured the world in three dimensions rather than two. Everything was seen in relation to what was around it.If cortical columns handle sight and touch in this way, Mr. Hawkins thought, they handle hearing, language and even math in similar ways. He\u2019s been working on proving that ever since.\u201cWhen the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThat is how it understands everything.\u201dThe source of tension between Mr. Hawkins and other brain and A.I. researchers is not that they necessarily think he is wrong. It\u2019s that they simply don\u2019t know because what he has been trying to do has been so different. And so wildly ambitious.For the science to advance, what Mr. Hawkins has been working on can\u2019t stay in a silo. His ideas could benefit from extensive experimentation with other neuroscientists, said Nelson Spruston, a senior director at the Janelia Research Campus, a research lab in Virginia that focuses on neuroscience. \u201cA continuous cycle of testing and revising biologically inspired models of neural computation is the key to developing insightful theories of the brain,\u201d he said.Translation: Mr. Hawkins will have to open his work to rigorous scrutiny and find a way to interact with researchers who most likely have never looked at the brain the way he does.Advertisement"}

Trump announced his candidacy for president, there has been plenty of investigation into his financial history \u2014 especially because he broke with tradition and declined to release his tax returns.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to dive into what you think is an extremely well-covered subject and to find so much completely new stuff, stuff that just is astonishing,\u201d Mr. Barstow said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great reminder that even things that you think are well described, there are these other deeper layers.\u201dMr. Barstow, Ms. Craig and Mr. Buettner dug into the fortune that Fred C. Trump, the prolific New York City builder who died in 1999, passed on to President Trump and his surviving siblings, Maryanne Trump Barry, Robert Trump and Elizabeth Trump Grau.\u201c\u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d Ms. Craig remembered thinking. \u201cThat was the first inkling we had that, hey, there\u2019s something to do with this company that we need to figure out.\u201dThe trio began to talk to people familiar with the president\u2019s father and his empire. Those people told them that the company was a middleman entity created by President Trump and his siblings essentially to move cash from Fred Trump\u2019s companies to his children. After All County bought various items for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, like boilers and cleaning supplies, a secretary would bill the items to Fred Trump\u2019s buildings with a 20 to 50 percent markup. The siblings would then pocket the difference.\u201cWhen we came to that realization, that was a big day for us,\u201d Mr. Buettner said. \u201cIt was like these two puzzle pieces came together \u2014 one from the lawsuit and the other from the FOIA request,\u201d Ms. Craig said. \u201cWe call it the Perry Mason moment.\u201dMr. Barstow then tracked down the man who sold that boiler to Fred Trump: Leon Eastmond, the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. Mr. Eastmond said he remembered the lunch meeting during which Fred Trump negotiated the price of 60 boilers, and later receiving checks in the mail from All County. He said that he had never heard of All County before those checks, and that he had mainly interacted with Fred Trump, his secretary and Robert Trump.The worry, instead, was how they would decide which threads to follow.The article emphasizes just how much remains to be uncovered in the Trump tax return saga, Ms. Craig, Mr. Barstow and Mr. Buettner said.\u201cOne of the big themes of this story is this one little alleyway that we wandered down, and all that it sort of revealed to us is how little we actually do know about the president\u2019s financial history,\u201d Mr. Barstow said. \u201cIn all of the books, all of the profiles, all of the newspaper stories, we haven\u2019t found one mention of Donald Trump and All County Building Supply.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once students learn skills like how to create strong passwords and not share information with strangers, the program encourages them to be \u201cfearless\u201d online explorers.Kerry Gallagher, an assistant principal at St. John\u2019s Preparatory School in Danvers, Mass., said Google\u2019s program helped students learn concrete ways to be safer and kinder online.\u201cRather than being a bystander, they feel as though they have the skills to intervene\u201d when they observe other children being mean online, Ms. Gallagher said. She added that younger students also gained a \u201cbetter sense for who they should share things with and who they shouldn\u2019t, depending on what that content is.\u201dGoogle\u2019s name appears on every screen of Interland and the program\u2019s certificates, which also incorporate Google\u2019s colors. The curriculum features cartoon robots that resemble the company\u2019s Android robot icon. To some observers, the game is essentially a big ad for Google.David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit advocacy group, likened the program to asking Budweiser to talk to parents and children about underage drinking.\u201cThere is an increasing awareness of the fact that all these supposedly free platforms are not free and that all of us are being tracked and our information is really the commodity we\u2019re paying,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cThis seems like the wrong time to be pushing resources that tell kids to be brave and fearless on the internet without telling them to be cautious and without giving them the information they really need.\u201d\u201cWe are helping them become more knowledgeable about what the digital landscape is like,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said of his students, \u201cso they can make choices about what they use and what they don\u2019t use.\u201dMs. Yi of Google said the company was aware that multiple efforts were needed to help children learn to navigate the digital world. In addition to \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve also built products like Family Link, which lets parents supervise their kids\u2019 Google accounts; have hosted online safety school assemblies for years; and will continue to develop new tools and resources for kids, parents and educators.\u201dAmerican corporate giants are no strangers to the country\u2019s schools.\u201cThe best solution would be for this kind of training to be undertaken by an organization less invested in how consumers conceive of privacy on the internet,\u201d the authors of the journal article wrote. \u201cAt the very least, \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 should have significantly less Google branding.\u201d But even teachers like Mr. Hodgson, who uses Google tools with his students, are leery of the company\u2019s presence in schools.\u201cMaybe it has some good for the public if you use it in certain ways,\u201d he said of the \u201cBe Internet Awesome\u201d program.

{"Headline": "New Pixel Phones and Other Gadgets Keep Google in the Hardware Hunt", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough sales of its devices have been slow, the search giant unveiled the Pixel 3, a smart speaker with a built-in screen and a tablet that doubles as a PC. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For much of the last decade, Apple and Samsung have dominated sales of smartphones. So why would anyone bother trying to sell a new phone?The gadgets are Google\u2019s third wave since it started making consumer devices in 2016. The internet company has pushed these products as a way to showcase its prowess in areas like artificial intelligence and image processing.\u201cThere\u2019s some skepticism about how committed Google is,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Creative Strategies, a consumer electronics research firm. \u201cThey are still nowhere near where they need to be to make a dent in the industry.\u201dGoogle has said that hardware businesses rarely become overnight successes and that it remains focused on the long term. The company said it put more stock in indicators like high customer satisfaction in its effort to build a loyal base. Google doesn\u2019t break out revenue or profit for its hardware business.While the handset market is no longer growing as much as it did five years ago, the company wants Pixel to be a blockbuster and to set the bar for devices running Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system, said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware.\u201cIt is our objective to sell as many Pixel phones as we can,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re investing accordingly to be able to do that.\u201dHere\u2019s a closer look at Google\u2019s newest devices.Similar to the latest iPhones and Samsung phones, the new Pixel 3 phones, which will become available on Oct. 18, have glass bodies to support wireless power charging. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field to create voltage that powers the phone.Yet the screens are smaller than those of Pixel\u2019s competitors: The $799 model has a 5.5-inch screen, while the $899 model, the Pixel 3 XL, has a 6.3-inch screen. For comparison, Apple\u2019s new iPhone screens range from 5.8 to 6.5 inches diagonally, and the Samsung Galaxy screens measure 5.8 to 6.4 inches.The new Pixels also have a feature to make it easier to take good photos. The tool, Top Shot, captures a series of images when someone takes a photo; Google uses algorithms to recommend the best photo among the shots. Computers analyze millions of images to extrapolate the characteristics of a good photo, like smiles and clear faces. The analysis of the photos is done on the Pixel 3, not in Google\u2019s cloud; users will see a small chip icon marking the recommended photo. People can use the Home Hub\u2019s screen to watch videos and control smart home devices like security cameras. Notably, the Home Hub, unlike Amazon\u2019s smart screen products, lacks a camera for videoconferencing. Google said it had made that decision partly because of privacy concerns inside the home, especially bedrooms.The company\u2019s third new product, the Pixel Slate, is a convertible laptop, like a tablet with a removable keyboard similar to Microsoft\u2019s Surface. It runs Google\u2019s ChromeOS operating system and works with a digital stylus for drawing and writing. The device, which the company said would become available later this year, starts at $599.Mr. Queiroz said Google is just at the beginning of its hardware ambitions. \"Manufacturing and hardware are things that you build up over time, so we\u2019re very proud of where we are after three years compared to people who have been doing it for 10 years or longer,\" he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Resume Slide, Pulling S.&P. 500 Briefly Into a Correction ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe benchmark index fell to 10 percent off its most recent peak in early trading on Friday but recovered some of those losses. It is down more than 9 percent from its high in September.Disappointing earnings reports from the tech giants Amazon and Alphabet set off another turbulent day on Wall Street on Friday, and the benchmark stock-market index briefly dipped into a correction. Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening. Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon\u2019s sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet\u2019s revenue fell short of analyst expectations. \u201cThe poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20. By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year.In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction \u2014 a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February. There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets.Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent.Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record. But given the length of the current bull market \u2014 in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent \u2014 investors have been uneasy. \u201cThe question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG. But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said.\u201cFrom our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,\u201d he said.Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits \u2014 which public companies are currently releasing \u2014 are on pace to be up more than 20 percent. Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet\u2019s share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent. Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent. Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week. The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year.\u201cWe think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cFor whatever reason, you\u2019re seeing money come out of those high-growth software names.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Remembering the Moon Landing, Nearly 50 Years Later: \u2018We Were All Completely Silent\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, was one of those important events. As Neil Armstrong descended the steps of the lunar module and became the first person to set foot on the moon, the world\u2019s eyes seemed to be upon him.Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited and condensed for clarity. Please use the comments to share your own memories.We almost missed it as we headed home from the lake. It was late. We were on a dark empty road paved with gravel that we had driven on for miles without seeing a house, a light or another car. We were listening to a radio station that crackled and faded in and out as signals were found and lost and found again. As it became clear that the astronauts were about to step out of the lunar module, the pressure on my dad mounted to FIND SOMEPLACE WITH A TV NOW. At that point, I think we would have stopped at any house we saw and asked to come in and watch their TV with them.With only minutes to go, we saw the lighted sign of a gas station in the true middle-of-nowhere, Missouri. We pulled off near the pumps and our tires made that \u201cding ding\u201d sound that cars always triggered at gas stations back then. We went into the station and found an older man sitting in the dark with only the black and white of his tiny television flickering in the dust and the stagnant air that smelled of rubber tires and motor oil. He was sitting in the only chair and so we, my mom and dad and brother and I, sat down on the cold dirty floor. And there, surrounded by the mechanics of autos, we watched a man step down onto the moon.I was 5 years old and staying with my family at our \u201csummer house,\u201d a rustic cottage in rural Upper Greenwood Lake, N.J. We attended a local performance of the musical \u201cThe Fantasticks\u201d that afternoon, and I was enraptured.The show suddenly stopped and a television set was brought out to the center of the stage. The actors, still in costume, gathered cross-legged on the stage to watch the moon landing, joined by the audience.I vaguely remember the television images of the moon landing itself. More indelible for me is the memory of how momentous it seemed when the magical stage performance I had been watching came to a halt so that the actors could join us in watching something unique and important.I was in summer camp in upstate New York. We had one TV, an old black and white set, in a large room with beat-up couches. More than 100 campers and counselors crowded into the room. Some also weren\u2019t thrilled to find out that the plaque left on the moon bore the signature of Richard Nixon.I still have the black and white negatives we shot off the TV \u2014 a full roll.We were visiting relatives in New Jersey on the day of the landing. We watched the landing on TV there. (I think my father was disappointed that Walter Cronkite wasn\u2019t on the moon to personally show the landing and to interview the astronauts.)As we drove through our hometown of Syracuse, N.Y., on the normally busy highway, we realized that we were the only car on the road! Everyone was home watching the spectacle. Fortunately, we arrived home with some time to spare, so we were able to watch the moonwalk.I was spending the summer on Monhegan Island, where we had a family home. The island had no electricity, but across the street June Day had a generator. She put her TV in her front yard and a crowd gathered to watch the event. Watching TV on the island was novel, but seeing the first man on the moon was unforgettable. We were all completely silent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Find a Facebook Workaround: Their Own Apps", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine a society in which everyone more or less agrees with you.You wake up in the morning to online greetings from people who share your views on guns, religion and country. Your news feed contains only posts from like-minded politicians or articles from like-minded news outlets. You can safely post your own comments without fear of vitriol from trolls or challenges from naysayers.This is the insular world in which tens of thousands of Americans who use conservative political apps are experiencing the midterm election season.The apps deliver curated partisan news feeds on what are effectively private social media platforms, free from the strictures and content guidelines imposed by Silicon Valley giants. Some allow supporters to comment on posts or contribute their own, with less risk that their posts will be flagged as offensive or abusive.Many apps have video-game-like features where users can earn points for making campaign donations or contacting their legislators. Amass enough points and a supporter can attain increasing status levels \u2014 like \u201cBigLeague\u201d or \u201cPatriot\u201d \u2014 or even gain a spot on the app\u2019s leader board.Crucially, these mini-platforms harness the powerful reach of platforms like Facebook and Twitter even while competing with them. Some apps give users the option of posting on Twitter or Facebook messages that are scripted by the campaigns, combining the seeming authenticity of organic social media posts with the message discipline of paid advertising.Proponents are positioning these apps as durable communities that offer conservatives viable alternatives to mainstream social networks.The Great American app has offered text messages that you can send to your representatives with a push of a button. The app identifies your representatives from the ZIP code you provide when building your profile. Sheltered from the broader public, however, the platforms can intensify political polarization and social divisiveness, or circulate disinformation.Anyone in the United States may download uCampaign apps, Mr. Peters said, but they give a campaign the ability to bar interlopers who post messages challenging the campaign\u2019s positions.The Great America app juxtaposes a mix of enthusiastic posts about Mr. Trump and photos of puppies with anti-immigrant memes like \u201cToday\u2019s illegals, tomorrow\u2019s Democrats.\u201d One recent post, with an image depicting nooses, read: \u201cNoose flash: Treason still punishable by death.\u201dThe Great America app also hosts a ritual called \u201cFake News Friday,\u201d in which it awards \u201cTrump points\u201d to users who post liberal-bashing, mainstream-media-trashing memes.\u201cIs this the beginning of the political Balkanization of digital engagement technologies?\u201d asked Michael Slaby, a communications strategist who oversaw technology for President Barack Obama\u2019s national campaigns. \u201cGiven the tribalism of current American politics, it\u2019s possible.\u201dDan Backer, general counsel for the Great America PAC, said the app was a place for like-minded Trump supporters to socialize and entertain themselves. It has also enabled the campaign to quickly and inexpensively engage supporters. Since 2017, the Great America PAC has paid uCampaign about $108,000 for development and monthly service fees.Mr. Backer added that the app\u2019s user policy prohibits abusive comments and those that incite criminal activity. But, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to be in the business of trying to censor people\u2019s political views.\u201d\u201cIt did not do the one thing I wanted it to do,\u201d he said, which was to \u201chelp win the election for Mitt Romney by asking me to donate money to them, to post things to social media, to invite my friends and family to register to vote \u2014 to do all of the things, basically, that the Obama app did.\u201dIn 2014, Mr. Peters started uCampaign with $150,000 in start-up capital. The money came from Sean Fieler, the president of the hedge fund Equinox Partners and a well-known donor to conservative groups.The N.R.A. and Great America apps, which enable users to friend and message one another, have developed cultures with their own parlance and rituals.In their posts, users sometimes greet one another as \u201cdeplorables\u201d or \u201cfellow patriots\u201d and refer to liberals as enemies, \u201clibtards\u201d or traitors. Conspiracy theories \u2014 including memes against the financier George Soros \u2014 abound. The midterm elections are not about Democrats vs. Republicans but, as one N.R.A. app poster put it, \u201csocialism vs. freedom.\u201dOutsiders, for their part, can keep out.Soon after a reporter for The New York Times contacted 10 users via the apps, a person with the user name Deplorable Dee posted on the Great America news feed: \u201cTroll Alert!!! New York Times asking for interviews, do not communicate with these libtards.\u201dOnly one user, Ken Kumerle, a car rental agent in South Carolina who has earned more than 366,000 points on the N.R.A. app, agreed to be interviewed for this article.\u201cThey all seem very patriotic to me,\u201d Mr. Kumerle said of the members of the N.R.A. app community. \u201cI go in every day and try to do something, post or send a tweet.\u201dBy tracking their users\u2019 activities, political apps can collect a wealth of data about them and their social circles outside Facebook\u2019s control. Apps from uCampaign and WPA Intelligence, for instance, ask users for their name, address, phone number and email address. The apps from uCampaign may also collect user names and other details when users post campaign messages from the apps on Twitter or connect their Facebook accounts.The National Rifle Association app offers users 100 points for posting a comment on its news feed and 200 points for telling their legislators, \u201cNo New Gun Control Today!\u201dThe Times tested several of the apps\u2019 privacy practices and found that, when a user invited a friend to join uCampaign\u2019s N.R.A. app, the app did not send the friend\u2019s information to itself or to other companies. But The Times found that a similar feature on WPA\u2019s Cruz app sent a friend\u2019s contact details to an AggregateIQ domain.Some political apps, including from uCampaign, also ask users who want to send friends campaign messages to share their contacts. If a user agrees, the app can try to match the contacts to profiles of likely voters, using information provided by a political campaign. As an example, Mr. Peters, the chief executive, described how the Trump app in 2016 was able to match 68 of his 900 contacts to voters in swing states.\u201cIt asked me to send a text to my mom in Michigan saying, \u2018Only Trump has a plan to repeal Obamacare,\u2019\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cBut it asked me to send an email to a friend in Florida saying that \u2018only Trump has a plan to build the wall.\u2019\u201dMr. Peters turned some of those features, like inviting friends, into a way for users to collect points and gain status within the group. He began incorporating gamelike features into his company\u2019s apps in 2014 as a way to get supporters to participate in political activities.In July, for instance, the N.R.A. app began offering users 100 points for tweeting a slogan urging their senators to support Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. The messages have since been have tweeted more than 13,300 times.The Cruz app similarly awards points to users for tweeting campaign messages, volunteering and taking part in other activities.\u201cThe Obama campaign proved, and Democrats continue to prove, the value of continuously engaging supporters via an app like this,\u201d said Mr. Wilson of WPA Intelligence, the company behind the Cruz app. \u201cIt is critical Republicans keep up with tools of our own.\u201dAaron Krolik and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In London\u2019s Vegan Fish-and-Chip Shop, Banana Blossoms Play Cod", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A newly opened restaurant in an East London neighborhood is aiming to make waves by serving what looks like the perfect presentation of fish and chips, that quintessential British dish: a piece of glistening plump batter, chunky chips, mushy peas and a slice of lemon.But one major ingredient is missing.\u201cThere\u2019s no fish in our \u2018fish,\u2019 \u201d says Daniel Sutton, a fishmonger and restaurateur who opened what he says is London\u2019s first stand-alone \u201cvegan fish\u201d and chips restaurant, Sutton and Sons, in Hackney this week.For lovers of succulent fried cod, that concept may be hard to grasp.\u201cWhat do you mean there is no fish?\u201d Christopher Haddon asked the restaurant\u2019s manager with a puzzled expression on Thursday. He seemed confused and left the restaurant, or chippie, shaking his head.Vegans, however, could not get enough of the fake fish.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, delicious. Mmmmm,\u201d said Dan Margetts, 53, as he took a bite. \u201cIt\u2019s the same look and texture but less oily, cleaner \u2014 and no ammonia.\u201dHis husband, Edwards Dos Santos, a 49-year-old property broker, agreed, emerging from his bite with a big smile. He took out his phone and snapped a picture to share on social media.\u201cIt\u2019s just like artichoke, delicate slices of artichoke. It\u2019s really delicious,\u201d he said.British cultural and culinary ties to fish and chips run deep. The wartime prime minister Winston Churchill called them \u201cthe good companions,\u201d and some historians have even suggested that the dish helped win World War I by boosting morale.Its origins have been disputed for centuries. Some historians say the first shop to serve fish and chips together opened in northern England in 1863, in Mossley, a small town that is now part of Greater Manchester; others argue that the first was opened in East London in 1860, by a Jewish immigrant family.Regardless, the meal has become a British staple, and in many households, Friday night is fish night.Mr. Sutton was inspired to open a hub for vegans after he put his creation on the menu at his original fish shop in Hackney and it was a hit, he says.As for how he makes his \u201cfish,\u201d the main ingredient is banana blossom, an edible flower that he came across at a Vietnamese market. He found that marinating it with seaweed and samphire, a salty coastal plant, gave the blossom a fishy taste, and that it resembled fish when battered.\u201cThe common vegan substitute for fish is tofu, but it doesn\u2019t taste like fish, and it doesn\u2019t batter right,\u201d he explained at his new shop on Thursday as he took in customers\u2019 reactions to the food from the corner of his eye.A vegan couple from Stockholm, who were staying more than an hour outside London, had come to Hackney just to try the vegan fish. Another couple tried a \u201cprawn\u201d cocktail made from Japanese potato, finding it so similar to the texture of real prawn that one asked the manager to confirm it was truly vegan.\u201cThere\u2019s been some confusion, but so much excitement,\u201d said the shop\u2019s manager, Adrianna Bonesso, who used to work at a Sutton and Sons traditional fish-and-chip shop up the road.\u201cWhen we put vegan options on the menu of our other shop, there was so much demand we could hardly keep up. We needed to open another shop,\u201d she explained.Eddy Macit, a fish-loving Turk from the Black Sea area, has taken on the role of head chef at the new shop and prepares the ingredients by hand the night before. The shop has a range of vegan trimmings, including pies and mash and tartar sauce. (Vegan burgers and sausages are also on the menu.)\u201cYou have to be much more careful when you are frying to make sure the consistency is right,\u201d he said as he fried one of the banana blossoms. \u201cYou can\u2019t just whack it all in like a fish.\u201dAfter watching nearly a dozen vegans devour the dish, I decided to try it. I am also a fish-loving Turk from the Black Sea area and I wanted to love it, but after years of eating succulent cod fillets my palate could not quite adjust to the thin and rubbery texture of the blossom flower. (The whole experience made me crave fish, and for dinner I had a meaty chunk of North Atlantic haddock.)Mr. Sutton imports the banana blossom from Thailand and says that the vegan-friendly ingredients do not come cheap. One portion of fish and chips at the vegan shop costs 7 pounds and 50 pence (around $10), a little cheaper than the cost of the real fish, which starts at \u00a310.50 a portion and goes up according to the type of fish.Ms. Macit and Ms. Bonesso observed that the customers who came to eat at the vegan shop somehow seem different \u2014 more calm and friendly, they said.\u201cIn the other shop, it was more chaos and lots of different types of requests,\u201d Mr. Macit said, \u201cespecially on Fridays, which is like a religious day \u2014 fish-and-chips day.\u201dVictor Kremer, 25, an actor who came across the restaurant on his Google News feed, said: \u201cThis is very exciting. London\u2019s first vegan fish and chippie. It feels like the start of something.\u201dBut not everyone is embracing the venture. Some passers-by criticized the shop for advertising its creations as fish.\u201cIt\u2019s not fish. Why would you call it fish? Call it what it is,\u201d one female passer-by remarked.Ms. Bonesso said the local council made a similar complaint, warning that the items on the menu were misleading.\u201cWe are working on new names,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe vish for fish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple iPhone XR Review: A Cheaper Phone Suited to Most of Us", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIn an era of skyrocketing smartphone prices, it\u2019s a relief that Apple\u2019s $750 iPhone is just as powerful and nearly as capable as its $1,000 counterparts, our reviewer found. Good news, Apple loyalists: You won\u2019t have to burn $1,000 on your next iPhone. That\u2019s because for about $750, you can have the iPhone XR, which is just as fast and nearly as capable as its more expensive counterparts.For everyone else, the XR is perfectly adequate and has few downsides. Its 6.1-inch screen, which is based on LCD, an older display technology, looks ever so slightly inferior to the OLED screens on the XS phones \u2014 but you would need to be a movie buff to notice the difference.The XR\u2019s single-lens camera is also less capable than the dual-lens cameras on the XS models. Yet the XR can still produce very satisfying photos of people using portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. After I tested an XR for four days, here are the highlights.Apple developed a new kind of LCD to improve color accuracy and squeeze the XR\u2019s screen into the corners of the phone. The result is what Apple calls a Liquid Retina display, which looks better \u2014 brighter and more vibrant \u2014 than past iPhone LCD screens.I confess that I struggled to see a difference between the Liquid Retina screen and the OLED on an iPhone XS. The distinction is most evident in blacks: If you look at a photo taken in the dark, you will notice that the blacks on the XR\u2019s screen have a faint blue glow, which is coming from the backlight used to illuminate the screen, while the blacks on the XS look darker and more realistic because the OLED technology turns off individual pixels to make them black.These downsides were trivial. The vast majority of your time on a phone will probably be spent looking at amateur photos taken by friends and family anyway, so it\u2019s worth saving $250 to have this slightly less vibrant screen.If you are debating between an XS and XR, your buying decision will probably come down to the camera. The XR\u2019s single-lens camera takes excellent, clear photos with lifelike colors, but because it lacks a second lens, it is less capable at taking those DSLR-like portrait mode shots, which are a lot of fun.To do portrait mode with the XR\u2019s single lens, Apple used machine learning, which involves computers analyzing images to recognize people in the photo and properly sharpen them while blurring the background. Apple decided to limit its machine-assisted image processing on the device specifically to human subjects. In contrast, the second lens on the XS camera helped the device do portrait shots of a wider variety of subjects, like dogs and objects. In addition to the help of machine learning, the two lenses worked together to create a depth-of-field effect that kept the main subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.When you attempt to take a portrait photo of a nonhuman, the XR camera will display the message \u201cNo person detected.\u201d This was the biggest downer to me as a dog owner and foodie (and what ultimately drove me to buy an XS). Apple said that for the XR\u2019s portrait mode, the company wanted to focus on getting photos of people to look just right.That said, people who are less dog crazy and more interested in shooting photos of, well, people probably won\u2019t mind this limitation on the XR. In my tests, the XR was excellent at taking portrait photos of my partner, properly sharpening details of her head, including her hair strands, while blurring the background.Let\u2019s speed through what else you need to know about the XR: Apple said the XR had the longest battery life among the new iPhones. It gets 16 hours of video playback, compared with 15 hours on the XS Max. In my tests, I didn\u2019t notice a meaningful difference. Both iPhones had long enough battery life to get me through the day.In speed tests measuring a single computing core with a benchmarking app, the XR was just as fast as the XS, 49 percent faster than Google\u2019s Pixel 3 and 45 percent faster than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9.The body of the XR is about half a millimeter thicker than the XS partly because the cheaper phone had to make room for the backlighting used to illuminate its LCD screen. In addition, the XR\u2019s 6.1-inch screen is a bit bigger than the XS with a 5.8-inch screen. As a result, it felt bulkier in the pocket than the XS. (Of course, the XS Max with a 6.5-inch screen felt the bulkiest.)The XR lacks 3D Touch, the iPhone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. Instead, placing your finger over a button, like the camera shortcut on the lock screen, and holding it down results in haptic feedback. This is a negligible omission: I forgot that 3D Touch even existed because I rarely use it.The XR comes in six colors: white, black, blue, yellow, coral and red. The XS phones come in three: gold, white and black. As is often the case for new gadgets, good things come to those who wait. If you resisted splurging on the XS to wait for the XR, you will be rewarded with a great phone \u2014 and some extra cash lying around. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading.

{"Headline": "Robert Pitofsky, Champion of Consumer Protection, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Pitofsky, who as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the Clinton administration advocated stricter enforcement of competition and greater protection for consumers, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 88.The cause was complications of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his son David said.Mr. Pitofsky was a leading figure in competition law. An antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University law school, he wove in and out of government, private law practice and academia over his career.President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Pitofsky to head the Federal Trade Commission in 1995. At the time, it was a sleepy agency colloquially referred to as \u201cthe little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201dMr. Pitofsky soon sought to call attention to the growing threat of corporate consolidation, particularly with the rise of technology. During his tenure the agency would become the central watchdog for the internet and technology industries.Mr. Pitofsky won support from consumer groups that had pushed for greater scrutiny of mergers and stronger consumer protection in matters like deceptive advertising. But he was also criticized by some free-market conservatives and antitrust lawyers, who said he was trying to expand antitrust enforcement too far.Early on Mr. Pitofsky held public hearings to gather input on how the F.T.C. might look beyond traditional views of antitrust enforcement to better account for the modernization of the economy and the growth of technology.Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s push to update antitrust policy has echoes today, as the F.T.C. is again opening debate on how it approaches competition enforcement in the tech sector. Consumer groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns that a handful of companies, like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, have outsize influence on the economy even though they apparently do not violate antitrust laws.Last month, at the first of a series of F.T.C. hearings on antitrust at the Georgetown Law Center, Joe Simons, the current chairman, said he was modeling the hearings after those held by Mr. Pitofsky in 1995.Mr. Simons, who was a student of Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s at Georgetown, said in a statement this week that Mr. Pitofsky was \u201cone of the true giants of his field\u201d and that he had been \u201cinstrumental in establishing a strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy.\u201dAs F.T.C. chairman, Mr. Pitofsky sought to block nearly a dozen mergers, including that of the office-supply retailers Staples and Office Depot. The companies tried to merge again in 2015 but were again blocked.The agency under Mr. Pitofsky also filed to block the merger of BP Amoco with Atlantic Richfield, until BP agreed to sell off $7 billion worth of Arco\u2019s Alaska oil assets to Phillips Petroleum. In 2000, however, the agency ultimately agreed to approve Time Warner\u2019s $165 billion merger with AOL, with certain conditions.He pledged to make antitrust apolitical and to balance free-market interests with concerns that consolidation among corporations was threatening consumer welfare.Robert Pitofsky was born in Paterson, N.J., on Dec. 27, 1929, to Morris and Sadye Pitofsky. His father fixed textile looms, and his mother sold dresses.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature from New York University in 1951 and earned a law degree at Columbia Law School in 1954. He served in the Army for two years before joining the private law firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood in New York, where his first case was defending Eli Lilly against antitrust charges. In 1964 he began teaching law courses at New York University.Mr. Pitofsky joined Georgetown University\u2019s law school in 1973 as a professor and stayed until 1978, when he was appointed an F.T.C. commissioner. He returned to Georgetown Law in 1981 and became dean in 1983. He held that position until 1989.In addition to his son David, Mr. Pitofsky is survived by his wife, Sally Levy Pitofsky; another son, Alex; a daughter, Liz Pitofsky; and seven grandchildren.Mr. Pitofsky returned to teaching several times over the years. In addition to Mr. Simons, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the F.T.C., his students included Christine Varney, who was in charge of antitrust at the Justice Department during the Obama administration.In an interview with Washington Lawyer in 2002, Mr. Pitofsky said, \u201cI think a really good class is one of the great pleasures in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Google Pixel 3 Review: Phone\u2019s Smarts Shine Through Its A.I.-Driven Camera", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixHardware innovations? Nope. Instead, Google is emphasizing software improvements \u2014 particularly for images \u2014 with its newest Pixel smartphones.Apple and Samsung typically show off glitzy hardware innovations \u2014 dual-lens cameras; bigger screens \u2014 to mesmerize millions into buying their new smartphones. Google has taken a different approach: It wants to sell people on better software.\u201cThe phone is powered by A.I. so that we let Pixel do really useful, delightful things,\u201d said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware. \u201cThe phone doesn\u2019t get in the way. Things just happen for you.\u201dThe Pixel 3, which will be available on Thursday, is a modest piece of hardware otherwise. It comes in two screen sizes \u2014 5.5 inches and 6.3 inches \u2014 that are slightly smaller than phones from Apple and Samsung. The smaller Pixel costs $799; the larger one is $899.After testing the Pixel 3 for four days, I\u2019m convinced that Google did the right thing by emphasizing its software. The Pixel 3 is a superior Android phone to Samsung\u2019s top-rated Galaxy devices thanks largely to Google\u2019s clever camera and intuitive interface. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the new Pixel has the all-around best camera \u2014 I prefer the iPhone camera\u2019s more lifelike colors. Still, the Pixel 3\u2019s software smarts offer some advantages, like the ability to take superior photos with the bokeh effect, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.Here\u2019s what I found about the Pixel 3\u2019s most important features.Let\u2019s say you take a photo of a group of people and one person blinks. Using Google\u2019s new photo-optimization tool, Top Shot, there\u2019s a chance you can salvage that photo by choosing a better shot with that person\u2019s eyes open.To use Top Shot, you turn on a feature called Motion Photos, which are essentially three-second videos capturing the moments just before and after you take a shot. When you snap a picture, Google\u2019s camera software can analyze those before-and-after moments for a better image to recommend.Google\u2019s theory is that Top Shot will change the way people take photos: Instead of snapping several shots of the same subject and manually picking the best one, users could instead shoot a single motion photo and then let Google suggest the best image.For me, Top Shot didn\u2019t profoundly improve my photos or change my habits. For example, in a park, I still took a half dozen photos of my dogs until they both smiled at the camera. But when I reviewed my favorite photo, Google recommended two different shots as a potential Top Shot \u2014 and I did pick the one where the dogs\u2019 faces looked clear. It\u2019s impressive that Google is capable of detecting the qualities of a good photo, but I found the process of reviewing and selecting the recommended shots to be time consuming. It was quicker to use the old technique of snapping a bunch of photos and manually swiping through them to decide which you like most.In other words: For now, I don\u2019t consider this a must-have feature.A better reason to consider the Pixel 3 is its impressive ability to take so-called portrait mode photos, those DSLR-like images with a gently blurred background and sharpened foreground. This effect is useful for producing artistic-looking photos of people, food and objects. Portrait mode is the Pixel 3\u2019s strength: Compared with both Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones and Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, which use dual-lens cameras to take portrait mode photos, the single-lens Pixel 3 camera was more reliable at sharpening the intended subject.Here\u2019s an example: When I had dim sum for lunch and used the Pixel 3\u2019s portrait mode to snap a photo of five soup dumplings inside a basket, the camera appropriately sharpened the five dumplings while blurring out my partner in the background. When I took a portrait mode photo with the iPhone XS, the camera blurred out one of the five dumplings. I eventually got the iPhone camera to sharpen all five dumplings with a few more tries, but the Pixel 3 did it in one attempt.Having this smart camera \u2014 which has the potential to become even smarter through software updates \u2014 is a compelling reason to consider the Pixel 3. Google said it planned to add more camera features in those updates, like Night Sight, which helps people take photos in the dark without using a flash.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do with machine learning to produce image quality in photography and video, it really surpasses the need for us to do more,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said.Beware: Using this feature comes with some risk.The screening tool works by tapping a button when you want to screen a call. An automated message will ask the caller to state his or her name and purpose for calling. From there, the user can receive a transcription of the caller\u2019s response and decide whether to take the call. The tool works well: I screened a call from my partner, and Google did a perfect job at immediately transcribing her response (\u201cMy purpose is to eat dumplings, so leave me alone\u201d).It remains to be seen how effective the screening tool will be when Pixel customers use it en masse. I still think the safer \u2014 although imperfect \u2014 solution is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers, like those that are nearly identical to yours.But I don\u2019t recommend messing with the robocallers. The bots will always win.Advertisement"}

America\u2019s Won\u2019t Necessarily Be the Best.", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA breakup of the web grants privacy, security and freedom to some, and not so much to others.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.As governments push toward a splintered internet, American corporations do little to counteract Balkanization and instead do whatever is necessary to expand their operations. If the future of the internet is a tripartite cold war, Silicon Valley wants to be making money in all three of those worlds.Part of the rationalization is that whether or not American companies get in on the action, a homegrown company will readily enact the kind of censorship and surveillance that its government requires. (Indeed, if Google launches in China, it has an uphill battle to fight against Baidu, the entrenched, government-endorsed Chinese search engine.) What this future will bring for Europe and the United States is not clear. Mr. Gomes\u2019s leaked speech from inside Google sounded almost dystopian at times. \u201cThis is a world none of us have ever lived in before,\u201d Mr. Gomes told employees. \u201cAll I am saying, we have built a set of hacks, and we have kept them.\u201d He seemed to hint at scenarios the tech sector had never imagined before. The world may be a very different place since the election of Donald Trump, but it\u2019s still hard to imagine that what\u2019s deployed in China will ever be deployed at home. Yet even the best possible version of the disaggregated web has serious\u00a0\u2014 though still uncertain \u2014\u00a0implications for a global future: What sorts of ideas and speech will become bounded by borders? What will an increasingly disconnected world do to the spread of innovation and to scientific progress? What will consumer protections around privacy and security look like as the internets diverge? And would the partitioning of the internet precipitate a slowing, or even a reversal, of globalization? A chillier relationship with Europe and increasing hostilities with China spur on the trend toward Balkanization \u2014\u00a0and vice versa, creating a feedback loop. If things continue along this path, the next decade may see the internet relegated to little more than just another front on the new cold war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Fears of the Supply Chain in China", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHello, everyone. I\u2019m Paul Mozur, a reporter based in Shanghai, and I have covered technology in Asia for eight years. Though lately the big story has been internet companies, hardware and the supply chain remains close to my heart. Maybe that\u2019s why the tech news bombshell a little over a week ago has been so fascinating to me.For years, China and the United States have squabbled over the supply chain, which sits mostly in China but is under the charge of companies from dozens of countries.The fact that the two sides share the same fears shows how difficult it can be to ensure security in a world in which the design, production and assembly of electronics occur across multiple countries.The American block on Huawei isn\u2019t completely effective against hypothetical supply chain hacks. That\u2019s because European and Japanese telecom equipment brands also have a good chunk of their supply chains in China. On the other hand, China\u2019s control of a huge portion of the supply chain doesn\u2019t ensure its security, because high-end design and production often happens elsewhere.Neither side is happy with this. Both China and the United States will probably continue to winnow their mutual tech reliance. It won\u2019t be easy. They are working against 40 years of economic integration and a tremendously complex web of big and small companies.A different approach would be to identify the key things that need to be protected. In a discussion I had the other day with Samm Sacks, a tech policy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, she put forward the idea of having a \u201csmall yard and a high fence.\u201dThe point is to identify key products that cannot be compromised and come up with solutions to protect them. Obviously, companies should always do their best to ensure security. But that doesn\u2019t have to lead to ripping apart the global supply chain.For example, regular Americans shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about buying Huawei phones. Senators and admirals, on the other hand, should probably stick with something more closely guarded. That could involve building small, secure supply chains closer to home or special audits of phones used by people who could be high-profile targets. Even if it\u2019s a bit expensive.Either way, it\u2019s worth remembering that even if a brand of electronics is from one country, what\u2019s inside it could come from six others. Country of origin also doesn\u2019t ensure security. It makes me glad I\u2019m a journalist and not in charge of The New York Times\u2019s cyber defenses.And now on to the other news of the week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking to My Fianc\u00e9 About My New Girlfriend", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveAfter enjoying an open relationship, a couple decides to tie the knot. Just one question: Why must marriage require sexual fidelity for life?This wasn\u2019t the \u201990s when mix tapes were a popular medium for revealing a crush. Even mix CDs had come and gone. If you were going to use someone else\u2019s songwriting to convey your feelings, you did it with a Spotify playlist. I was charmed that Luke liked music and was obstinately analog about it.I had only recently started dating Luke. We were doing that casual, millennial thing that begins on Tinder and spreads into bar dates, sandwiched between bar dates with other people. I tended to be dating three people at a time \u2014 both men and women \u2014 and the life spans of my pseudo-relationships averaged two months or so. I liked it this way. A capital-R relationship seemed too big for my life, a concrete shape I had no room for.But when I listened to Luke\u2019s mix tape, I felt tricked. This was not a casual mix tape. It had folk songs about longing and soul music about feelings. It had \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d and something by Usher.Luke soon revealed himself to be good not only at making mix tapes but also vegetarian lentil stew and weekend travel plans to canoe through Lafayette to find armadillos. We approached and passed the two-month mark before I knew what had hit me.Two years later, we moved from New Orleans to Chicago and rented a one-bedroom apartment. We established a night to have family dinners. We got cats.But I never wanted to give up dating other people, and neither did Luke. In Chicago, we maintained our Tinder accounts and would lie side-by-side in bed swiping right, occasionally showing off our respective matches.Polyamory wasn\u2019t something my parents easily understood. My grandparents told me they felt \u201ctruly worried\u201d for me. But nothing about our arrangement ever felt unusual. Most people I knew in New Orleans were non-monogamous; being 20-something there implied that you kissed strangers at Mardi Gras.Before Luke, I had spent almost a decade building and prioritizing a close platonic friendship with my roommate, and she never minded that I went on dates with other people. Why should it be different with someone I slept with?In Chicago, we each dated only a few people. It\u2019s colder than New Orleans so leaving one\u2019s apartment is less appealing. Sometimes I got jealous; sometimes Luke did. We talked about our jealousy at length and afterward felt closer. Three years into our relationship, we kept dating other people, but we noticed that the jealousy just kind of stopped. In the spring, Luke filled our living room with yellow daisies and we got engaged.The next winter, at a party, I met Kat.She wore a skintight black dress with see-through keyholes on the sides. I couldn\u2019t stop staring. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in real life.She was there with her boyfriend, Brendan, who was visiting from Portland, Oregon, and they were also polyamorous. I liked Kat and I liked her boyfriend; we all exchanged numbers and said we would stay in touch.Months passed. I saw Kat at birthday parties and once at a gay rights rally. Over the summer, we ended up on the same camping trip with mutual friends along the Wisconsin River. At night, we laid on our backs with our shins to the bonfire. I moved close so our arms would touch. She took my hand. We waited for the stars to fall.I have always been scared of dating women. When attracted in the past, I have mostly gone emotionally limp, terrified of rejection. Women just seemed so untouchably beautiful; I was afraid they could see through my foundation-wearing, hair-dying tricks and know instantly that I was not a suitable lover.After the camping trip, when I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Kat, I drafted countless text messages to her that I never sent, until finally Luke told me I should ask her out.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her out?\u201d I said.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not the one who can\u2019t stop talking about her.\u201dI decided I would ask her out by writing her an actual letter and sending it. The letter had a long list of possible dates and times when we might hang out, and I drew cats on the front of it to indicate how whimsical and carefree I was.Three days later, Kat responded that yes, she was interested. I jumped around our apartment as if I had just gotten into my top college.Our first date was in my living room during a rainstorm. I tried on four outfits before settling on something that I decided would make it look like I had not tried on four outfits. I ordered enough Thai food for six, forgetting that on your first date you\u2019re usually too nervous to eat anything. Our conversation blissfully meandered; I tried not to look directly at her because I feared the depth of my crush was written all over my face.Luke got home as our date was winding down. He joined us in the living room for a few minutes before leaving us alone to say the kind of goodbyes that linger a little too long at the beginning of relationships.That night, I lay next to my fianc\u00e9 and told him about the woman I was falling for.People ask me why I\u2019m getting married, considering my open approach to sexual fidelity. It seems that marriage, for most, is a contract where you agree to give up having sex with anyone else for the rest of your life as a sacrifice to someone you love.Which is a beautiful concept that works well for a lot of people \u2014 approximately 50 percent of the couples that try it. But for me, commitment has little to do with physical intimacy.I\u2019m getting married because I want to promise, in front of my friends and family, that I am going to love Luke forever. I want to assure him that if he can\u2019t pay his rent, or when someone he loves gets sick, or if his car breaks down in an ice storm and he\u2019s stranded on the highway, that he can call me and I\u2019ll be there for him no matter what.I want to keep our family dinners going indefinitely. I want to co-parent our cats. More than anything, I want Luke to know that I will tell him the truth, and that when the truth is painful I will stop what I\u2019m doing and tend to him until he feels better.But I am not going to promise him that our love won\u2019t change, and neither will he promise that to me. The fact that love absolutely will change is one of my favorite things about love. Rather, as the love changes, I hope Luke and I will be able to hold each other with compassion; that we will stay curious and empathetic.One night, after a December evening out, Kat walked me to the train station. Under the overpass, she pulled me toward her and kissed me in a small, sweet way that threw my stomach into knots. Our glasses fogged; we both wore gloves so thick we couldn\u2019t feel each other\u2019s hands. It was one of those fleeting rom-com moments you want to hang onto.Talking with the love of my life about falling for Kat has been an incredible gift. Luke pets my hair and lets me wax poetic in a way that most of my friends can only tolerate for so long. And it goes both ways; I root for him when he goes on dates. Kat says she talks to her boyfriend about me, too.Right before Christmas, Luke and I went to Portland (my family lives there; we always head over for the holidays) and met up with Kat and Brendan. We all went on a date together. After it was over, Luke and I lay awake in my childhood bed, laughing about how sweet and strange and beautiful our lives were turning out.I know not everyone wants to love this way. I understand fear of loss, and I understand wanting to hold something still when it\u2019s good. Ultimately, this particular shape makes sense to me: love as a blob that can\u2019t be pinned down, as something alive, an animal that ventures from person to person but finds places to call home.Advertisement"}

Is the country becoming more willing to play a larger role?Mr. Rudd mostly demurred, choosing instead to explain that Australia\u2019s national psyche was still wrapped up in a history defined by distance and reliable alliances with major powers \u2014 first Britain, then the United States.Breaking away from that position, even when the United States is becoming more unpredictable, is still a major challenge.\u201cAustralians don\u2019t take themselves seriously as a regional and global power,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t think anyone else would.\u201dSometimes you ask New York Times readers...Here\u2019s one thing we do know: Australians are extremely proud of their compulsory voting system and want the world to know about it.But I figured I\u2019d add a couplemore worthwhile responses from Australian readers about the compulsory voting system that didn\u2019t fit into the article.\u201cI don\u2019t see how a democracy can work without it. It is a good, good thing for our country. It gives us a sense of belonging and purpose. We all have to think about it, at least for that day.\u201d\u2014 Diane Smith\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. The compulsion is minor, but the effects of this policy are huge. Look at when our elections take place \u2014 on Saturdays, ensuring EVERYONE can vote. Look at where the voting booths are \u2014 neighbourhood schools, gyms, places where the most people can go. And look at the sense of community when we vote. We turn up, chat to locals, buy fundraising sausages in bread and home made jams (they\u2019re known as democracy sausages). And we all vote.\u201d\u2014 Stuart PageAustralians often talk about not wanting to self-promote or even celebrate their own accomplishments, but clearly there are areas where confidence comes easily and is well-deserved.As the country moves closer to a federal election, there will be more signals pointing to Australia\u2019s urges and mood \u2014 the vibe, as fans of \u201cThe Castle\u201d would say \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to try and put what\u2019s happening into context.Now here are a few other stories from The Times that you shouldn\u2019t miss, along with a recommendation.______Maybe it\u2019s also time for us to do something similar or more ambitious for cities in Australia. Where do you think we should we start?____________It\u2019s called \u201cstochastic terrorism,\u201d he writes, \u201cin which mass communications, including social media, inspire random acts of violence that according to one description \u201care statistically predictable but individually unpredictable.\u201d______A few highlights from around the country and the region...The stretch of boardwalk on the way to Coogee that had been ruined by storms has been renovated and finally re-opened.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.There is nothing the political world loves more than an upset. It\u2019s the plot twist no one saw coming. It\u2019s the victory that upends all our expectations. It\u2019s the shocker that tells us what we missed.Here are some of the races we\u2019re watching for their upset potential:Steve King - House - IowaRobert Menendez - Senate - New JerseyKris Kobach - Governor - KansasKristi Noem - Governor - South DakotaSafe G.O.P. House Seats - New York Metro AreaCan Democrats flip Staten Island? What about Representative Pete King\u2019s seat on Long Island? None of these scenarios feel super likely, but there\u2019s enough Democratic energy that we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Republicans lose a few longstanding districts in the New York-New Jersey metro area. The most likely candidate is New Jersey\u2019s 11th District, where the former prosecutor Mikie Sherrill is mounting a strong bid for the seat held for decades by the Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen.____________________I spent three days last week in North Dakota reporting on the voter ID law there, which requires residential addresses. Many Native Americans don\u2019t have residential addresses, and the problem was driven home for me by what should have been a very simple task: getting to one of the reservations to report.I didn\u2019t have enough cell service in North Dakota to use Google Maps, so I rented a GPS unit with my car. It took me to the city limits of Fort Totten, the seat of the Spirit Lake Reservation \u2014 and then it stopped. It told me I had arrived at the tribe\u2019s administrative offices. I was actually in the middle of a remote highway, with a lake on one side and fields on the other.I had just enough service to make a call, so I pulled over and called OJ Semans, of the Native American voting rights group Four Directions, whom I was meeting at the office. He named some landmarks the GPS might be able to find, but it couldn\u2019t find any of them.What we ended up doing was almost comical. I told OJ the lake was on my left, which told him which direction I was facing. He went to a spot where he could see the highway, and he started describing the oncoming cars. The amount of time that passed between him describing one and me seeing it told us how far away I was. I put my flashers on to identify my car, and when he finally saw it, he told me to turn.All\u2019s well that ends well \u2014 until a few hours later, when I drove to the Turtle Mountain Reservation in Belcourt and the same thing happened again.This is the heart of the problem. Even tribal headquarters, the biggest buildings in town, don\u2019t always have addresses. As state officials have noted, addresses can be assigned, and many have been. But the sheer scope of their absence tells you what a huge task it is.____________________You can see all our polling here.________________________________________\u2022 Early voting begins in Colorado and Kansas.(All times listed are local.)____________________We spotted this friendly little guy in a meeting room here at NYT HQ.

{"Headline": "The Time to Buy Those Holiday Travel Tickets? Now", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsGoing home for the holidays can be expensive and stressful, but with the right timing and these maneuvers, it doesn\u2019t always have to be.But here are some tips from travel experts that can help minimize the pain \u2014 both financial and logistical \u2014 of your next holiday trip. As in years past, the general rule is the earlier you book, the better. But there are exceptions.\u201cThis last minute window tends to see prices spike the most dramatically, and while you may have heard of someone getting a great deal the day before Christmas, the reality is that the data show this is very, very unlikely,\u201d Mr. Surry said.It\u2019s not only when you book, but when you choose to fly. Traveling on the holiday itself will always cut down on your total fare. Hipmunk found that flying on Thanksgiving Day can save you 21 percent over the peak booking price. You\u2019ll save a similar amount by flying on Christmas Day and avoiding the previous Friday, Dec. 21, which is the most costly.\u201cIt all comes back to basic supply and demand,\u201d Mr. Surry said. \u201cThe airlines know that there is little outside incentive to travel on a day that you would prefer to be spending in celebration with family and friends, and as a result, we tend to see reduced prices on these days.\u201dWhen you return is crucial as well. Google\u2019s data analysis suggests taking an extra vacation day or two so you can return a bit later than most. They saw lower than average prices with return flights on Tuesday Nov. 27 and Wed. Nov. 28.Most of us feel obligated to visit family back home, but maybe you want to take a year off from discussing politics with Uncle Frank. If you just want to get away this holiday season and you have some flexibility on where you go, you\u2019ll find some great travel deals.A trip outside the country might also be a good idea for the winter holidays. Google has noticed a trend of lower prices for flights to popular international destinations like Paris, London and Cancun, with fares around 20 percent lower than average.If you are going home but not staying with family, vacation rentals like Airbnb may be cheaper than hotels. Hipmunk found that those rentals can save Thanksgiving travelers 10 percent on average and 7 percent during the week of Christmas.But if you prefer hotels and their amenities, there are ways to save there too, especially if you\u2019re flexible on where exactly you stay. Google found that San Francisco, Boston and Washington D.C. are the three U.S. cities generally offering the best hotel deals, with average savings ranging from 40 to 50 percent.\u201cHotel prices drop in many U.S. cities in the days leading up to Thanksgiving because of a significant decline in business travel and thus lower overall demand,\u201d Mr. Holden said.If you are departing from a bigger city, you probably have a few airports to choose from. You may be used to flying out of one in particular, but you may want to consider the one that\u2019s a little further away, like a regional airport or a national one over an international one, or be ok with a return flight to your \u201cother\u201d airport. (As always, compare prices from alternative departure sites, to see if going a little out of your way will result in a significant savings.)Hipmunk found that booking round trip flights with different airports can save travelers up to 14 percent on Thanksgiving weekend, and 17 percent off the week of Christmas.

{"Headline": "After the Royal Wedding, a Gospel Choir Hits the Big Time", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Karen Gibson wanted some silence. She was standing before the Kingdom Choir, the gospel ensemble she founded and has led for more than 20 years, during a recent rehearsal at a church in the London neighborhood of Pimlico. The group had just been working on a version of \u201cAll of Me,\u201d made famous by John Legend, and a couple of dozen singers were enjoying a rambunctious moment of downtime.\u201cO.K., got to listen,\u201d Ms. Gibson said, raising her arms and her voice. The chattering continued.\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Listen,\u2019 I\u2019m serious,\u201d she said, much louder. The talking stopped. \u201cYou see how things are kicking up. You are going to have to be on the top of your game. When I say, \u2018Listen,\u2019 I\u2019m saying it for a reason. Am I clear?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the group replied.A song made famous by Ben E. King, an American soul artist, performed by black singers, for an aristocracy that is emblematically British and white. As a bit of culture splicing, it was inspired, though Ms. Gibson said that initially she had no idea that she and her choir had triumphed.In the days that followed, the media in Britain anointed Ms. Gibson the country\u2019s \u201cgodmother of gospel\u201d; YouTube videos of the choir\u2019s performance have been viewed several million times. For a group whose biggest previous audience was 200 people, the transition from obscurity to international acclaim was instant.And just getting started. On Friday, Sony releases the Kingdom Choir\u2019s debut album, \u201cStand By Me,\u201d recorded, in part, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The group will perform in Sydney, Australia, at the close of the Invictus Games on Oct. 27, and an 18-city tour of Britain, the group\u2019s first, is planned for next year. That will be followed by to-be-announced dates in the United States, according to the choir\u2019s management.For Ms. Gibson, a natural introvert with a beatific smile, notoriety has been an adjustment. Her elaborate upswirl of pewter-toned hair makes her instantly recognizable, and she said she was getting accustomed to fame, which she finds both strange and exhilarating. As she took a seat for this interview, in a South London cafe, a young man stood to make room.\u201cYour music helped me through a very dark place,\u201d he said, as he picked up his backpack and moved.\u201cThe weird part is that I am living the same life I\u2019ve always lived,\u201d Ms. Gibson said, after the two talked for a minute. \u201cI go to the same supermarket. I\u2019m making the same music. I\u2019m ordinary. But not.\u201dMs. Gibson has been involved with gospel singing since she was a teenager, growing up in the Battersea neighborhood of South London and attending a black Pentecostal church. Inspired by early work of the Winans, who would become perhaps the United States\u2019 foremost gospel family, she, her sister and some childhood friends formed a sextet called New Dawn. The group performed all over England, primarily at churches.After high school, Ms. Gibson spent \u201c11 unhappy years\u201d in information technology for an arm of local government. When she was laid off, she found a job teaching gospel at a girls Catholic school. She formed the Kingdom Choir in 1994, reuniting members of New Dawn and recruiting others who had the right mix of singing chops and positive energy.\u201cI don\u2019t audition,\u201d Ms. Gibson said. \u201cIt\u2019s down to our connection.\u201dThere are dozens of gospel groups in Britain and many were more prominent than the Kingdom Choir. But one former Kingdom member knew Eva Williams, Prince Charles\u2019s deputy head of communication. Ms. Gibson was riding a bus one day in March when her cellphone rang.\u201cWe\u2019d like to invite you to sing at the royal wedding,\u201d Ms. Williams said.\u201cMostly what I felt was disbelief,\u201d Ms. Gibson remembers. \u201cRight up until the wedding, I kept thinking, this is going to fall through.\u201dShe was initially instructed not to tell anyone, a challenge for a conductor who needs 20 singers to clear their calendar, months in advance.Elaine Simpson, a choir member and longtime friend, was one of those recruited. \u201cKaren called me and asked if I was free on May 19,\u201d Ms. Simpson said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not free. Why?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Google the date.\u2019 I was thinking, what is the point of Googling a date?\u201dIn an instant, Ms. Simpson decided she could be free on May 19.Gathering members was the easy part. The challenge was coming up with an arrangement of \u201cStand by Me,\u201d a request of the royals, that the couple liked. The first version, sent via MP3, got a polite, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Prince Harry and Ms. Markle wanted it stripped down and less syncopated, Ms. Gibson said.Versions two, three, four, five and six were all rejected with the same directive: Pare it back. So Ms. Gibson suggested a face-to-face meeting with the couple. Off she went to Kensington Palace with five singers and a keyboard player.\u201cThey were lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just walked through an arrangement on the spot. \u2018Do \u201coohs\u201d here. The second verse will come in here.\u2019 And the minute we started to sing, I could just feel their approval, the joy, the effect. Both of them said, \u2018That\u2019s the one.\u2019 \u201dIt wasn\u2019t. When the choir recorded the new arrangement, it reacquired \u201cbells and whistles,\u201d Ms. Gibson\u2019s shorthand for more complicated rhythms and additional harmonies. Versions seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 and 12 were all turned down.With no time left for more back and forth, the choir improvised what amounted to version 13 on wedding day. The members met that morning at Buckingham Palace and drove roughly 25 miles to St. George\u2019s Chapel with a police escort.\u201cWe were so ready,\u201d Ms. Gibson said of the performance. \u201cWe just prayed that this gift of a song was accepted.\u201dOnly during the end of the second number, \u201cThis Little Light of Mine\u201d \u2014 sung as the royal couple left the church and got into a horse-drawn carriage \u2014 were there claps and cheers. A few attendees offered congratulations. The actor Tom Hardy gave Ms. Gibson a hug. Then bodyguards came to escort her and other members to a press room, where the group got its first taste of celebrity.\u201cIt was a bit of pandemonium,\u201d Ms. Simpson said. \u201cWe were trying to get to the BBC studio with this escort and we were literally mobbed. People came up to us crying, wanting our photographs. But it was all love. Everyone was smiling, laughing.\u201dIn a matter of days, the group\u2019s Instagram account soared from 700 followers to 32,000. Friends and well-wishers called, as did a talent manager, Jonathan Shalit. He\u2019d seen a story about the choir and noticed that Ms. Gibson hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about an album \u2014 either a deal or an imminent release.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even have a P.R. person, but I managed to track down a contact for her,\u201d Mr. Shalit said in an interview. \u201cWhen I found out that they didn\u2019t have a record deal, I was gobsmacked.\u201dHis pitch to Ms. Gibson emphasized the rewards of the here rather than the hereafter.\u201cHe asked me, \u2018If you had any amount of money, what would you do with it?\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I want to look after my mum. I want to pay off her bills. Pay off my bills.\u201dWith the promise of added income has come added work. Rehearsals are now twice a week, instead of once every two. Some choir members have quit their full-time jobs.But even as the Kingdom Choir goes pro, it has kept the jubilant atmosphere that has long defined it. For every stern word that Ms. Gibson uttered at the Pimlico rehearsal, there were 20 of pure encouragement. The night ended with the choir listening back to a track they\u2019d recorded for the album. It was Jill Scott\u2019s \u201cGolden,\u201d and for many in the room, it was the first time they\u2019d heard the finished product.The choir was on its feet, singing along to their own voices, dancing and jumping, an almost athletic outburst of bliss. In a corner, Ms. Gibson beamed, clapped and joined in on the chorus: \u201cLiving my life like it\u2019s golden, living my life like it\u2019s golden.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Among them were the page Right Wing News and left-wing outfits like Reverb Press.Facebook said this amounted to the most domestic pages and accounts it had ever removed related to influence campaigns. The company said it had discovered the activity as part of its broader effort to root out election interference. Also, the pages had become more aggressive in using tactics like fake accounts and multiple pages to make themselves appear more popular.Facebook said that the removed content violated its rules about online spam, and that it was likely making money for its publishers via ads. \u201cToday, sensational political content seems to be a more effective way for people to build an audience for their pages and drive traffic to their websites, which earn them money for every visitor to the site,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of security.A weaker renminbi has made Chinese goods more attractive despite the tariffs.

The head of the S.E.C. says that\u2019s not likely, at least not anytime soon.But he added that he understands the concern: \u201cThe president did touch on a nerve, which is: Are people running their companies too much for the short term in response to pressures?\u201dThe U.S. economy is riding high.

And falling currencies may feed trade tensions.

{"Headline": "Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Taylor Swift has nothing on Snapchat \u2014 at least when it comes to persuading people to register to vote.Snap, the company behind the popular social media service, said on Tuesday that it had helped more than 400,000 users register to vote during a recent two-week period. Much of the activity, the company said, was in key battleground states like Texas, Florida and Georgia.Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers and young adults, pushed people 18 and over to register by adding a button about doing so on each user\u2019s profile page. The company also sent video messages to all of those users urging them to register.The users were directed to a nonpartisan voter registration website, TurboVote.org. Once they answered a few questions about their potential eligibility as a voter, TurboVote directed them to state and local election boards to officially register.\u201cThere is no more powerful form of self-expression than the ability to vote,\u201d said Jennifer Stout, global head of public policy at Snap. \u201cThe numbers we\u2019ve seen have been fantastic and have shown us that our users have been some of the most engaged communities out there.\u201dIt appears that Snap may have had an even bigger effect, getting 418,000 people to register. Of that total, 79,148 registered in Texas, 29,044 in Florida, 22,649 in Georgia and 17,994 in Ohio. All those states have competitive races.Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Google have also pushed voter registration drives, by linking to sites like TurboVote, which work with companies in their voter drive, provide information on candidates and voter initiatives and send text and email reminders to users.Young Americans are historically among the least consistent voters. But there are signs that they are more engaged than usual in this year\u2019s elections, speaking up on issues like immigration, gun control and health care. And on social media, many young people have promoted their voter registrations and have pushed their peers to vote.\u201cFor young people, voting isn\u2019t as much a civic duty as it is an identity issue,\u201d said Brandon Naylor, a spokesman for Democracy Works, which runs the website TurboVote.Snapchat\u2019s younger demographic has attracted candidates to the service ahead of the midterm elections. In the hotly contested race for Senate in Texas, between Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent, and his Democratic challenger, Beto O\u2019Rourke, the candidates have used Snapchat to post stories on the trail. Both have appeared on Snapchat\u2019s political television show on the app, \u201cGood Luck America.\u201dStill, it is unclear how many young people will show up at polls on Nov. 6. In 2014, in the last midterm election, only 17.1 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted. And it would be too simplistic to attribute any uptick in young votes directly to the voter campaigns of social media outlets like Snap, Instagram and Facebook, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to forecast voter turnout,\u201d said Donald Green, a professor of political science at Columbia University. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to say any Taylor Swift-style surge will make a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Taste of Marrakesh", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "Personal JourneysThe ancient Moroccan city is being reinvigorated by local entrepreneurs opening their own cafes, bars and riads, while embracing tradition.Supported byTwenty years after my first visit, some things about Marrakesh remain remarkably similar. The medina \u2014 the labyrinthine old part of the city \u2014 is still partly populated by stooped men in djellabas and the occasional donkey-led cart. The late afternoon light hits the high walls of its alleys in warming hues of yellow and orange. It still feels, at times, that everyone wants to sell you something.Around dusk, the Jemaa el Fna, the medina\u2019s main square, still goes through the same transformation: Juice vendors and the occasional snake charmer are replaced by a dizzying array of food stalls and circles of musicians.Perhaps the most transformative change: Twenty years ago, I struggled to connect, using my barely conversational French; now almost anyone under the age of 35 or 40 speaks English (and, often, not French).But I could never get Marrakesh and Morocco out of my head. Soon after my trip, I started working at The New York Times and, years later, as an editor in the Travel section. This time, I could return as a journalist.Since my first trip, Marrakesh has become Morocco\u2019s premier tourist city. For decades it has attracted travelers, though at a much smaller scale. \u201cEverybody knows everybody else in Marrakesh,\u201d wrote the English author Peter Mayne in his 1953 memoir, \u201cA Year in Marrakesh.\u201d \u201cAt least everybody knows everyone who lives here \u2014 the tourists who come in for a look at the city and a taste of its delights don\u2019t count, except to have francs taken off them.\u201dBut unlike cosmopolitan Casablanca, or Tangier, which, being a short ferry ride away from Spain, had the chaotic transience of a border town, Marrakesh has stayed both exciting and accessible for Western travelers.In Morocco\u2019s \u201cJewel of the South,\u201d the streets and bazaars spill over with artistry, whether it be in architecture, cuisine, crafts or fine art.Twenty years ago, I spent most of my time with nonnative travelers: a couple of strong-willed Italian women whom I met haggling in the medina; two Japanese women that we joined up with for a trek into the Sahara, the last part by camel; Spanish students on a budget even tighter than mine (one night we dined on canned tuna and r\u2019ghayef, Moroccan flatbread, on a medina sidewalk).This time around, I desperately wanted to connect with native Moroccans who were doing interesting, creative things. I discovered a vibrant cultural scene, one filled with men and women who care deeply about celebrating their city and country \u2014 but who are fighting an uphill battle against a lack of support from the Moroccan government and that influx of expats.Over tea and Moroccan pastries, I asked Mr. Ait Ben Abdallah, 56, who owns six riads around the medina (and another in Fez; he rents the Dar Cherifa space), if he was the exception or the rule as a native riad owner. The exception, he said, estimating that 90 to 95 percent are owned by foreigners. But that didn\u2019t exactly bother him.\u201cThirty years ago, Moroccans didn\u2019t want to live in the medina,\u201d he said in French, as Abdellah translated. The foreigners, he said, were helping support an infrastructure \u2014 and moreover, the very existence of the medina, where centuries-old properties were being destroyed. \u201cI would sell riads to the devil if it helped me get Moroccans to open their eyes to how the medina is being destroyed.\u201dMr. Ait Ben Abdallah was born outside the city and moved to his aunt\u2019s house in the medina at age 7. As a successful entrepreneur, he now wanted to give back, not just by renovating riads, but by educating children in his hometown, where he runs cultural events that provide arts education. He employs about 120 people at his properties, and at Dar Cherifa, he hosts free readings, a restaurant and exhibitions.\u201cWorking in heritage is important,\u201d he said, smiling broadly, \u201cbut creating jobs really matters more.\u201dA few of the women brought in a large tray, singing a joyful prayer as they did, and we sat down to a feast of couscous. We dug in as Ms. El Falahi, told us her tale.A decade ago, the village had been populated by drug users and delinquents. She called the authorities and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bulldozer and we\u2019re going to build a co-op.\u201d To everyone\u2019s astonishment, she did just that. She now employs 40 women (some of whom, in this traditional community, had previously not been allowed to even leave their homes), sent 30 of them to earn their degrees, and has opened 19 more cooperatives around the country. The co-op has since received funding from the National Initiative for Human Development; it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that they make a gluten-free couscous for the royal family.Barom\u00e8tre is the brainchild of two Marrakeshis, Hamza and Soufiane Hadni, brothers who opened the bar and restaurant in 2016. Soufiane, 34, is tall, with a ponytail and a pokerfaced expression. Hamza, 29, is shorter and a smooth talker. They both wore beards and the sort of structural glasses you might find on an architect.Before opening Barom\u00e8tre, neither had any experience at bars. \u201cWe had this dream of doing something together,\u201d Hamza said, as Abdellah and I surveyed the bar, which was stocked with syrups, infusions and garnishes. The dream had been accomplished: The place is popular with both locals and tourists.Both the menu and glassware (each glass paired to a specific cocktail) were elaborate almost to the point of absurdity. I chose the Churchill, an old-fashioned variation made with cognac, whiskey, thyme honey, orange, cinnamon and date-nut smoke, the last of which was created by torching the nuts, then lowering a glass to contain the smoke.I had to give the Hadni brothers points for passion and ambition, especially considering their limitations (every drink involving whiskey used Jack Daniel\u2019s; spirits are hard to come by in Morocco). But my inner cocktail snob couldn\u2019t help but note that spirits were measured with a jigger, while juices and infusions were not; and my Manhattan variation (with a syrup made from local carob) was not sufficiently diluted. There is also an impressive food menu \u2014 I had mhamsa (a type of Moroccan pasta) made risotto-style, with clams and a saffron emulsion \u2014 by the Marrakeshi chef, Badr Chguifi.Still, it was clear the brothers shared a quality with everyone I met on my trip. \u201cThe common thing among all these people,\u201d said Abdellah, between sips of a Casablanca beer, \u201ceveryone is passionate about what they do.\u201dI ducked into a courtyard that was whitewashed and pleasantly spartan, and was greeted by Laila Hida, 34, who founded the space in 2013. We sat down at a wooden table in the middle of the courtyard; pieces of art of various sorts \u2014 photographic, multimedia, sculptural \u2014 were scattered on the walls. Ms. Hida is taciturn in a thoughtful way, with long, dark hair and a mischievous smile.Le 18 had begun as a way to connect young artistic Marrakeshi. \u201cLittle by little the community got bigger,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cWithout choosing to become a cultural space, that\u2019s what we became.\u201d Within the first year, Le 18 hosted about 20 events \u2014 and now presents exhibitions, talks, performances and screenings. It has also just put out its first magazine, Chergui (named after a warm wind from the Sahara) \u2014 \u201cwithout anything, without money\u201d from the government, she added.\u201cNo one will help you from the state, from the ministries,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cThere is no place for organizations, for artists that are not within the voice that the states wants to bring up.\u201dStill, Ms. Hida and other creative types reflect the medina\u2019s energy, at turns frenetic and languid. \u201cIt\u2019s a great richness, being in the medina,\u201d she said, as we lunched on kefta tagine. \u201cIt\u2019s made us think about how to be humble.\u201dAfter my meeting with Ms. Hida, I headed back to the Jemaa el Fna for a final dinner. I watched as its daily transformation began: juice vendors making way for sellers of snail soup and sheep\u2019s head. The sun went down and the square swarmed with activity. It all felt surprisingly familiar.An earlier version of this article misstated Abdellatif Ait Ben Abdallah\u2019s relationship to the Marrakesh riad Dar Cherifa. He rents the space, he does not own it. (He does own seven other properties, six in Marrakesh and one in Fez.)Dan Saltzstein, a former editor in Travel, is interim editorial director for Special Projects at The Times.Advertisement"}

What do you think will stick around?We are in a renaissance period of photography, when technology is ultimately changing the way humans relate to imagery. Photos are no longer used just as a way to capture a moment. They are an actual form of communication.What do you wish would go away?I want portable 360-degree video cameras to take a break until we can figure out how to scale them without completely compromising image resolution. I don\u2019t think they have found that sweet spot just yet.Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?In my daily life, I cannot live without my Bose wireless noise-canceling headphones. I hesitated getting them for a while, but my husband got them for me as a gift and I will never go back to normal earphones. (No more cords!) I also have several portable mirror sets with LED bulbs, which I pack when I am traveling to help with makeup application and general skin care.And when my husband and I travel, we love using Airbnb. We have actually gone on a vacation planned around an Airbnb location because we were interested in the living space and wanted to experience it. Like most new businesses in the gig economy, it is shaking up the hotel industry in a good way, I think, and allowing people alternative ways to experience new cities in unexpected ways.You\u2019re new to London.

{"Headline": "Google Faces Internal Backlash Over Handling of Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is struggling to contain a growing internal backlash over its handling of sexual harassment and its workplace culture.Google later said it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years; none received an exit package. Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai also issued apologies, with Mr. Pichai later saying his initial statement \u201cwasn\u2019t enough\u201d and apologizing again. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned on Tuesday and did not obtain an exit package.But employees\u2019 dissatisfaction has not subsided. On Thursday, more than 1,500 \u2014 most of them women \u2014 plan to walk out of almost two dozen company offices around the world to protest the treatment, organizers said.Google declined to comment.At a staff meeting last year, Google\u2019s founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, also struggled to answer a question about who their female role models were, said two employees who saw a video of the meeting.Mr. Brin tried to recall the name of a woman he had recently met at a company event who had impressed him, the people said. Mr. Page eventually reminded Mr. Brin that the woman\u2019s name was Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer. Mr. Page said his hero was Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google and Alphabet, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Last week, The Times reported that Google had paid Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile software, a $90 million exit package even after the company concluded that a harassment claim against him was credible. (Mr. Rubin has denied any misconduct and has said the report of his compensation is a \u201cwild exaggeration.\u201d) Google also paid millions of dollars in an exit package to another executive who was accused of harassment, and continued employing a third despite a harassment claim.\u201cI know this is really an exceptionally painful story for some of you, and I\u2019m really sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Page said at the time.The meeting did little to quell the anger. On Friday, Ms. Stapleton said, she created an internal mailing list to organize a walkout. More than 200 employees joined over the weekend, she said, and the numbers have since grown to more than 1,500.That same day, Mr. Pichai sent an apologetic email to employees saying he would support this week\u2019s protest. He said that some workers had already raised constructive ideas of how to improve policies around harassment and that he hoped to \u201cturn these ideas into action,\u201d according to the email, which was obtained by The Times.Employees organizing the walkout have called on Google to end the practice of private arbitration \u2014 which requires people to waive their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements \u2014 in cases of sexual assault and harassment. They also are demanding publication of a transparency report on instances of sexual harassment, more disclosure of salaries and compensation, an employee representative on the company\u2019s board and a chief diversity officer who could make recommendations directly to the board.Other employees said they were disappointed that senior executives such as David C. Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, who had a child with a female subordinate, and Mr. Brin, who had a public extramarital relationship with an employee, remained in influential positions. Some raised questions about whether it was appropriate for Eric Schmidt, the company\u2019s former chief executive and chairman, to remain on Alphabet\u2019s board after former and current employees said he had retained a mistress as a company consultant.Thursday\u2019s walkout is set to begin in Google\u2019s Tokyo office and then circle the globe, with employees leaving work around 11 a.m. in their time zones, Ms. Stapleton said. People can choose whether or not to return to work, she said.\u201cWhile Google has championed the language of diversity and inclusion, substantive actions to address systemic racism, increase equity and stop sexual harassment have been few and far between. ENOUGH,\u201d organizers of the walkout wrote on an internal website, which was viewed by The Times. \u201cTime\u2019s up at Google.\u201dKate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}

But as capabilities have advanced, the idea of autonomous weapons reaching the battlefield is becoming less hypothetical.Without a nonproliferation agreement, some diplomats fear the world will plunge into an algorithm-driven arms race.In a speech at the start of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 25, Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres listed the technology as a global risk alongside climate change and growing income inequality.\u201cLet\u2019s call it as it is: The prospect of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is morally repugnant,\u201d Mr. Guterres said.Two weeks earlier, Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said the weapons \u201cimpact our collective security,\u201d and that decisions of life and death must remain in human hands.Twenty-six countries have called for an explicit ban that requires some form of human control in the use of force. But the prospects for an A.I. weapons ban are low. Several influential countries including the United States are unwilling to place limits while the technology is still in development.Diplomats have been unable to reach a consensus about how a global policy can be implemented or enforced. Some have called for a voluntary agreement, others want rules that are legally binding.A meeting of more than 70 countries organized by the United Nations in Geneva in August made little headway, as the United States and others said a better understanding of the technology was needed before sweeping restrictions can be made. Another round of talks are expected to be held later this year.Some have raised concerns that a ban will affect civilian research. Much of the most cutting-edge work in artificial intelligence and machine learning is from universities and companies such as Google and Facebook. But much of that technology can be adapted to military use.Major technical challenges remain before any robot weaponry reaches the battlefield. Maaike Verbruggen, a researcher at the Institute for European Studies who specializes in emerging military and security technology, said communication is still limited, making it hard for humans to understand why artificially intelligent machines make decisions. Better safeguards also are needed to ensure robots act as predicted, she said.But significant advancements will come in the next two decades, said Derrick Maple, an analyst who studies military spending for the market research firm Jane\u2019s by IHS Markit in London. As the technology changes, he said, any international agreement could be futile; countries will tear it apart in the event of war.\u201cYou cannot dictate the rules of engagement,\u201d Mr. Maple said. \u201cIf the enemy is going to do something, then you have to do something as well. No matter what rules you put in place, in a conflict situation the rules will go out the window.\u201dDefense contractors, identifying a new source of revenue, are eager to build the next-generation machinery. Last year, Boeing reorganized its defense business to include a division focused on drones and other unmanned weaponry. The company also bought Aurora Flight Sciences, a maker of autonomous aircrafts. Other defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems and Raytheon are making similar shifts.Mr. Maple, who has worked in the field for over four decades, estimates military spending on unmanned military vehicles such as drones and ships will top $120 billion over the next decade.No completely autonomous weapons are known to be currently deployed on the battlefield, but militaries have been using technology to automate for years. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air-defense system automatically detects and destroys incoming rockets. South Korea uses autonomous equipment to detect movements along the North Korean border.Mr. Maple expects more collaboration between humans and machines before there is an outright transfer of responsibility to robots. Researchers, for example, are studying how aircrafts and tanks can be backed by artificially intelligent fleets of drones.In 2016, the Pentagon highlighted its capabilities during a test in the Mojave Desert. More than 100 drones were dropped from a fighter jet in a disorganized heap, before quickly coming together to race toward and encircle a target. From a radar video shared by the Pentagon, the drones look like a flock of migrating starlings.There were no humans at the controls of the drones as they flew overhead, and the machines didn\u2019t look much different from those any person can buy from a consumer-electronics store. The drones were programmed to communicate with each other independently to collectively organize and reach the target.\u201cThey are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,\u201d William Roper, director of the Pentagon\u2019s strategic capabilities office, said at the time.To those fearful of the advancement of autonomous weapons, the implications were clear.\u201cYou\u2019re delegating the decision to kill to a machine,\u201d said Thomas Hajnoczi, the head of disarmament department for the Austrian government. \u201cA machine doesn\u2019t have any measure of moral judgment or mercy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Great at Everything.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn allowing the best competitors to rise to the top in our market economy, we allow enormous wealth to concentrate in relatively few hands. The competition that produced Apple, Tesla and Google has also produced billionaires.Perversely, the wealth generated this way is having an unintended consequence. Wealth accumulated in one arena is frequently used to acquire control in others. The result is far from efficient, since success in one arena hardly assures success in another.The problem is obvious in sports.In basketball or baseball, for example, teams place their best players in the game in the crucial moments that separate a win from a loss. You might think that there should be similar care taken in the executive suite, too, so that the best managers are in place to make the crucial business decisions. Yet sports superstars like Michael Jordan or Derek Jeter \u2014 as well as businessmen like James Dolan of the Knicks and Rangers, but originally of the Cablevision empire \u2014 have been running teams with less than monumental success in the won-lost column.It\u2019s quite possible, of course, that the best days are still to come for Mr. Jordan\u2019s Charlotte Hornets, Mr. Dolan\u2019s teams and for the Miami Marlins, which Mr. Jeter hasn\u2019t run for very long. But it still seems fair to say that while money is portable from one field to another, talent often is not.This problem is hardly unique to sports. It is endemic in free markets. Success and wealth that move from one arena to another often breed inefficiency.Of course the leap from talented salesperson to manager is nowhere near as large or as consequential as the leaps that great wealth allows.A hedge fund manager who buys a newspaper has the power to decide what constitutes news. A rich app developer who starts a foundation can decide which philanthropic projects are worthwhile. A real estate developer who donates heavily to a local theater may have considerable influence over which plays will come to life.Neither wealth accumulation nor the use of wealth to influence a wide array of unrelated ventures is particularly new, of course: The rich have been patrons of the arts and sciences for decades.But the phenomenon of wealthy people seeking to influence areas in which they have no particular expertise appears to be particularly severe today, partly because of the young age at which people can now become wealthy. The problem is not that younger people are less able than older ones. It is that they have more years in which to meddle.Competition places some constraints on how long the wealthy can stay at the top. But not much.While reputation depreciates, wealth accumulates. An athlete cannot keep playing solely on the basis of his performance from a decade ago. Wealth, however, has a long memory, and it brings its own luck. Virtually all major league sports teams have increased in value, both the good ones and the bad ones. The biggest challenge is being wealthy enough to own one in the first place.Short of wholesale revamping of the economy, we cannot change the power wealth gives. We can, however, work to thwart one of the accomplices to the problem: our own psychologies, which magnify the power of wealth.Psychologists studying stereotypes have noted that one of the most basic dimensions for evaluating people is by their competence. The problem is that competence is often viewed as a general attribute; rather than realizing that people are skilled at individual activities, we imagine that they are talented at nearly everything. We overgeneralize ability.Few beliefs play to human hubris more than the belief in the universality of talent \u2014 a belief that successful people have the \u201cit\u201d that lets them do great things in every walk of life, certainly including politics.Wealth can be intoxicating, leading a billionaire into economically destructive narcissism. Like nepotism, this kind of narcissism favors familiarity over talent, except that the person being privileged is yourself.But the successful do not just benefit from their own wealth. They benefit from our mistaken perceptions. The fungibility of wealth amplifies this faulty and dangerous notion that money is equivalent to generalized ability.Each of us can temper how we view successful people, recognizing that their talents are specific. Running a tech startup that makes billions doesn\u2019t make one a virtuoso who can disrupt all industries. Managing an investment fund doesn\u2019t give one deep insight into which social projects will have the greatest impact on poverty. And so on.When someone builds a better mousetrap, the world should beat a path to his door. We shouldn\u2019t assume he\u2019s good at anything but building mousetraps, however, no matter how rich he is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Will Teach Silicon Valley to Be Ethical?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome think chief ethics officers could help technology companies navigate political and social questions. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. I think we can all agree that Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision right about now.Is the solution for its companies to hire a chief ethics officer?While some tech companies like Google have top compliance officers and others turn to legal teams to police themselves, no big tech companies that I know of have yet taken this step. But a lot of them seem to be talking about it, and I\u2019ve discussed the idea with several chief executives recently. Why? Because slowly, then all at once, it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds.It\u2019s probably no surprise, considering the complex problems the tech industry faces. As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank\u2019s giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape \u2014 $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis\u2019 funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It\u2019s an ethical swamp out there.That\u2019s why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business \u2014 like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border.Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues. At a recent company event, he elaborated: \u201cWe can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.\u201d23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer. In an interview I did this week with its chief executive, Anne Wojcicki, she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates, but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues. She acknowledged that the collection of DNA data is rife with ethical considerations, but said, \u201cI think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set, rather than just hire one person to determine this.\u201dWhen asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics, some point out that legal or diversity/inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top \u2014 the chief executive.Also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or, worse, get steamrollered. And, if the person was bad at the job, of course, it could drag the whole thing down.How can an industry that, unlike other business sectors, persistently promotes itself as doing good, learn to do that in reality? Do you want to not do harm, or do you want to do good? These are two totally different things.And how do you put an official ethical system in place without it seeming like you\u2019re telling everyone how to behave? Who gets to decide those rules anyway, setting a moral path for the industry and \u2014 considering tech companies\u2019 enormous power \u2014 the world.Like I said, adult supervision. Or maybe, better still, Silicon Valley itself has to grow up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Benfica, a Big-Time Club, Is Going After Small-Time Bloggers", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 The blogger read the email at about 11 p.m. on a quiet night in September, the time of day when he usually posts his popular musings about soccer in Portugal.The message was from Google, Inc. In it, the company \u2014 or, more specifically, its lawyers \u2014 explained to the blogger, a slight man in his mid-30s, that the Portuguese soccer powerhouse S.L. Benfica had requested that Google hand over his personal details because he had published 13 articles containing confidential club information on a Google-owned platform.Benfica counts half of Portugal\u2019s 10 million inhabitants as fans. Twice the champion of Europe and a regular in the Champions League, it is the country\u2019s equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys or Manchester United, only more so. And now it wanted revenge.Stunned, the blogger struggled to fall asleep after reading the email and its attachment \u2014 a subpoena from the United States District Court for the Central District of California. When his wife and two children awoke the next day, he had not slept a wink.He worried about Benfica\u2019s \u201cunlimited legal support\u201d and about running afoul of the team\u2019s most fanatical supporters, he said in a recent interview. He asked to remain anonymous because he believed he could be in danger.\u201cThey could come to my employer; I don\u2019t know what can happen,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off. Then he quickly added, \u201cMy kids \u2014 I thought about it all.\u201dTo understand how an unassuming blogger in Portugal ended up staring at a subpoena from a lawsuit in California \u2014 and as a pawn in litigation that will turn on the definition of privacy in a technological age \u2014 it helps to know how desperate things have become for Benfica since proprietary details about the inner workings of the club emerged last year. Among other things, the leaked documents suggested the club had a plan to influence league and federation officials and even control officiating in top-division matches. Benfica denies any wrongdoing.Even in normal times, rumors and intrigue about events inside the Est\u00e1dio de Luz, Benfica\u2019s cavernous stadium and headquarters, dominate the many nightly debate shows on local television and the cover of at least one of Portugal\u2019s three daily sports newspapers. Its rivalries with the country\u2019s other top teams, Sporting and F.C. Porto, are famously fractious; vicious spats between club executives help to feed the daily narrative of fervor in this country.The most recent trouble began in the spring of 2017 when Porto\u2019s communications director, Francisco Marques, appeared on a team-owned television channel and revealed the inner workings of Benfica gleaned from a cache of club data secretly supplied to him. Then he did it again. And again. To soccer fans and journalists in Portugal, Marques\u2019s weekly revelations about Benfica became must-see television.About 20 gigabytes worth of internal documents and emails belonging to some of Benfica\u2019s most senior officers had been shared with him anonymously, Marques said. The information presented on his show, \u201cUniverso Porto de Bancada,\u201d was wide ranging. It included a Benfica slide show detailing an apparent effort to gain greater influence over federation and league officials, as well as details of how the club spent a large sum of money on a witch doctor from Guinea-Bissau to boost the team\u2019s performances. There were also documents suggesting connections between the club and the men responsible for overseeing refereeing in Portugal.\u201cI think it\u2019s the same person who spoke to me that published the emails,\u201d Marques said in an interview, insisting that neither he nor Porto had paid for the data.The police are investigating the hack on Benfica\u2019s system, but also the club itself. Law enforcement officials have conducted raids on Benfica\u2019s offices, and last month prosecutors charged the club with corruption after investigators found it had a mole inside the Portuguese judicial system. The official, prosecutors contend, tipped off Benfica about ongoing investigations but also to those involving Porto and Sporting.Those who have published articles and blogs based on the leaked material argue there is a significant public interest in doing so, given the team\u2019s immense social and cultural importance in Portugal.\u201cBenfica was the victim of a robbery and disclosure of its private correspondence, first by a local television channel linked to a rival club, Futebol Clube do Porto, and, later, in the face of a decision of the court that forbade this disclosure, these emails, many of them distorted, began to be issued by blogs attached to rival clubs,\u201d the team said in a statement.The club also contends information gleaned from its emails has been \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201caltered,\u201d violating any \u201cpublic interest or right to information\u201d defense.Until it sent him details of the subpoena, Google had not been in touch with the blogger to ask him to take down any posts or material that may have breached its guidelines. (He is embroiled in the legal battle because the site that hosts his blog, Blogspot, is owned by Google.) Google\u2019s terms of use warn users against publishing \u201cpersonal and confidential information.\u201d The company has not revealed his identity to Benfica yet, but it theoretically could if ordered to do so by the court; it declined to comment on the blogger\u2019s case other than to say the company would comply with the law.Sitting at a table in a cafe at Lisbon\u2019s international airport one recent afternoon, the blogger, known as \u201cJohn Doe 2\u201d in the California lawsuit, produced a sheaf of documents from a backpack, including copies of blog articles he has posted about Benfica, and the email from Google. It said he had until Oct. 8 to \u201cfile a motion to quash\u201d or any other formal objection to the subpoena.He missed that deadline and is now contemplating his next move. While Benfica has the financial might to engage a team of lawyers, the blogger had not yet secured representation to defend his interests in the United States. That has left him reliant on solely his own efforts; recently, he sent Google an impassioned email pleading with the company not to surrender his personal information to the club.He acknowledged being a fan of Benfica\u2019s rival Sporting, but he rejected Benfica\u2019s claim that he is part of an organized network conspiring to damage its reputation.What started out as a late-night hobby, a chance to unwind after putting the kids to bed, is now a significant problem subject to forces he cannot control. He delayed telling his wife about the legal time bomb that dropped into his inbox, preferring to save her from worrying about what Benfica might do, too.\u201cI believe they want to know my identity so they can intimidate me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are perfectly aware that my blog has nothing to do with any type of illegal access to their data that ended up in the email leakage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention.

At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.\u201cThe Argument\u201d is produced by Alex Laughlin and Ryan Kailath for Transmitter Media.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Getting Harder to Talk About God", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decline in our spiritual vocabulary has many real-world consequences.Mr. Merritt writes about the intersection of religion, culture and politics.More than 70 percent of Americans identify as Christian, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from listening to them. An overwhelming majority of people say that they don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking about faith, most of the time.During the Great Depression, the playwright Thornton Wilder remarked, \u201cThe revival in religion will be a rhetorical problem \u2014 new persuasive words for defaced or degraded ones.\u201d Wilder knew that during times of rapid social change, God-talk is often difficult to muster.We may have traded 1930s-level poverty and hunger for a resurgence in racism, sexism and environmental cataclysm, but our problems are no less serious \u2014 or spiritually disorienting. While many of our most visible leaders claim to be religious, their moral frameworks seem unrecognizable to masses of other believers. How do we speak about God in times like these when God is hard to spot?As a student of American Christianity and the son of a prominent megachurch pastor, I\u2019ve been sensing for some time that sacred speech and spiritual conversation are in decline. But this was only a hunch I had formed in response to anecdotal evidence and personal experience. I lacked the quantitative data needed to say for sure.So last year, I enlisted the Barna Group, a social research firm focused on religion and public life, to conduct a survey of 1,000 American adults. This study revealed that most Americans \u2014 more than three-quarters, actually \u2014 do not often have spiritual or religious conversations.More than one-fifth of respondents admit they have not had a spiritual conversation at all in the past year. Six in 10 say they had a spiritual conversation only on rare occasions \u2014 either \u201conce or twice\u201d (29 percent) or \u201cseveral times\u201d (29 percent) in the past year. A paltry 7 percent of Americans say they talk about spiritual matters regularly.But here\u2019s the real shocker: Practicing Christians who attend church regularly aren\u2019t faring much better. A mere 13 percent had a spiritual conversation around once a week.For those who practice Christianity, such trends are confounding. It is a religion that has always produced progeny through the combination of spiritual speech and good deeds. Nearly every New Testament author speaks about the power of spiritual speech, and Jesus final command to his disciples was to go into the world and spread his teachings. You cannot be a Christian in a vacuum.And yet even someone like me who has spent his entire life using God-talk knows how hard it has become. Five years ago, I moved from the Bible Belt to New York City and ran headfirst into an unexpected language barrier. Sure, I could still speak English as well as I always had. But I could no longer \u201cspeak God.\u201dBy this I mean that spiritual conversations, once a natural part of each day for me, suddenly became a struggle. Whether I spoke to a stranger or a friend, the exchange flowed freely so long as I stuck to small talk. But conversations stalled out the moment the subject turned spiritual.Before relocating, I worked as a part-time minister at a suburban congregation outside of Atlanta. Before that, I had attended a Christian college and seminary. All my life, I used religious language daily in my home and community, rarely pausing to think about the meaning of my words. But I was not in Georgia anymore.Whenever I used religious terms I considered common \u2014 like \u201cgospel\u201d and \u201csaved\u201d \u2014 my conversation partner often stopped me mid-thought to ask for a definition, please. I\u2019d try to rephrase those words in ordinary vernacular, but I couldn\u2019t seem to articulate their meanings. Some words, like \u201csin,\u201d now felt so negative that they lodged in my throat. Others, like \u201cgrace,\u201d I\u2019d spoken so often that I no longer knew what they meant.According to my survey, a range of internal conflicts is driving Americans from God-talk. Some said these types of conversations create tension or arguments (28 percent); others feel put off by how religion has been politicized (17 percent); others still report not wanting to appear religious (7 percent), sound weird (6 percent) or seem extremist (5 percent). Whatever the reason, for most of us in this majority-Christian nation, our conversations almost never address the spirituality we claim is important.A deeper look reveals that the decline in sacred speech is not a recent trend, though we are only now becoming fully aware of it. By searching the Google Ngram corpus \u2014 a collection of millions of books, newspapers, webpages and speeches published between 1500 and 2008 \u2014 we can now determine the frequency of word usage over the centuries. This data shows that most religious and spiritual words have been declining in the English-speaking world since the early 20th century.There is also a practical reason we need a revival in God-talk, specifically at this time in American history. Many people now avoid religious and spiritual language because they don\u2019t like the way it has been used, misused and abused by others. But when people stop speaking God because they don\u2019t like what these words have come to mean and the way they\u2019ve been used, those who are causing the problem get to hog the microphone.That toothy televangelist keeps using spiritual language to call for donations to buy a second jet. The politician keeps using spiritual language to push unjust legislation. The street preacher keeps using spiritual language to peddle the fear of a fiery hell. They can dominate the conversation because we\u2019ve stopped speaking God. In our effort to avoid contributing to the problem, we can actually worsen it.Christians in 21st-century America now face our own serious \u201crhetorical problem.\u201d We must work together to revive sacred speech and rekindle confidence in the vocabulary of faith. If we cannot rise to this occasion, sacred speech will continue its rapid decline \u2014 and the worst among us will continue to define what the word \u201cChristian\u201d means.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reality Breaks Up a Saudi Prince Charming\u2019s Media Narrative", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorJust six months ago, American media outlets presented a sunny-side-up portrait of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as he made a good-will tour of New York, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.Eager journalists captured him at Starbucks with Michael R. Bloomberg, strolling the Google grounds with Sergey Brin and dining with Rupert Murdoch. Built into the narrative was a mostly cheerful acceptance of the story Crown Prince Mohammed was selling about himself \u2014 that here, at last, was the modern Middle Eastern leader the West had been waiting for.That story started to crack apart on Oct. 2, when the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a sharp critic of the Saudi government, walked into the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul and didn\u2019t walk out.The apparent hit was part of a progression that was underway long before Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s charm campaign, which made him out to be not some ruthless royal, but a youthful reformer who had granted Saudi women the right to drive and lifted the country\u2019s 35-year ban on movie theaters (a potential jackpot for Hollywood).Mr. Emanuel, an organizer of the evening, had reason to celebrate: the Saudis planned a $400 million investment in Endeavor, his entertainment holding company. (In light of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, Endeavor is reassessing the deal, according to a person with knowledge of Mr. Emanuel\u2019s thinking, who shared it only on condition of anonymity.)And suddenly the \u201cM.B.S.\u201d moniker took on a grim new meaning among the plugged-in set of Washington: Mister Bone Saw.Sherif Mansour, the director of the committee\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, told me he took a dim view of the news media\u2019s more credulous accounts of Crown Prince Mohammed.\u201cWe have been beside ourselves,\u201d Mr. Mansour said.

{"Headline": "Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents, an investigation by The New York Times has found.Mr. Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help.But The Times\u2019s investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father\u2019s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day.Much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes. He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents, records and interviews show. Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more. He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings.These maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue Service, The Times found. The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax records show.The president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article. But a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement on Monday, one day after The Times sent a detailed description of its findings. \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,\u201d Mr. Harder said. \u201cThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Harder sought to distance Mr. Trump from the tax strategies used by his family, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. \u201cPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.\u201dThe president\u2019s brother, Robert Trump, issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family:\u201cOur dear father, Fred C. Trump, passed away in June 1999. Our beloved mother, Mary Anne Trump, passed away in August 2000. All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father\u2019s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother\u2019s estate was closed in 2004. Our family has no other comment on these matters that happened some 20 years ago, and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents, may God rest their souls.\u201dThe Times\u2019s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. According to tax experts, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes, because the acts happened too long ago and are past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud.The findings are based on interviews with Fred Trump\u2019s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings and immense profitability of his empire. They include documents culled from public sources \u2014 mortgages and deeds, probate records, financial disclosure reports, regulatory records and civil court files.The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records \u2014 bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks. Most notably, the documents include more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. While the records do not include the president\u2019s personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad, dozens of corporate, partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises.What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free of his father\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d outer-borough operation and parlayed a single $1 million loan from his father (\u201cI had to pay him back with interest!\u201d) into a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos, airlines and golf courses the world over. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version, it was always his guts and gumption that overcame setbacks. Fred Trump was simply a cheerleader.\u201cI built what I built myself,\u201d Mr. Trump has said, a narrative that was long amplified by often-credulous coverage from news organizations, including The Times.Certainly a handful of journalists and biographers, notably Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, have challenged this story, especially the claim of being worth $10 billion. They described how Mr. Trump piggybacked off his father\u2019s banking connections to gain a foothold in Manhattan real estate. They poked holes in his go-to talking point about the $1 million loan, citing evidence that he actually got $14 million. They told how Fred Trump once helped his son make a bond payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying $3.5 million in casino chips.But The Times\u2019s investigation of the Trump family\u2019s finances is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Donald J. Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth.By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.Fred Trump\u2019s real estate empire was not just scores of apartment buildings. It was also a mountain of cash, tens of millions of dollars in profits building up inside his businesses, banking records show. In one six-year span, from 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, now equivalent to $210.7 million. It was not unusual for tens of millions in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit to flow through his personal bank accounts each month.Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children. He made Donald not just his salaried employee but also his property manager, landlord, banker and consultant. He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships. He gave him $10,000 Christmas checks. He gave him laundry revenue from his buildings.Much of his giving was structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal. Although Fred Trump became wealthy with help from federal housing subsidies, he insisted that it was manifestly unfair for the government to tax his fortune as it passed to his children. When he was in his 80s and beginning to slide into dementia, evading gift and estate taxes became a family affair, with Donald Trump playing a crucial role, interviews and newly obtained documents show.The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and it is constantly being stretched by inventive tax lawyers. There is no shortage of clever tax avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the I.R.S. itself. The richest Americans almost never pay anything close to full freight. But tax experts briefed on The Times\u2019s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation, particularly about the value of Fred Trump\u2019s real estate, that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to his children.\u201cThe theme I see here through all of this is valuations: They play around with valuations in extreme ways,\u201d said Lee-Ford Tritt, a University of Florida law professor and a leading expert in gift and estate tax law. \u201cThere are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.\u201dThe manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump\u2019s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father\u2019s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump\u2019s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million.The same set of buildings would be sold off over the next decade for more than 16 times that amount.The most overt fraud was All County Building Supply & Maintenance, a company formed by the Trump family in 1992. All County\u2019s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants.After this article was published on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance said the agency was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d and \u201cvigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation.\u201dAll told, The Times documented 295 streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades to enrich his son. In most cases his four other children benefited equally. But over time, as Donald Trump careened from one financial disaster to the next, his father found ways to give him substantially more money, records show. Even so, in 1990, according to previously secret depositions, Mr. Trump tried to have his father\u2019s will rewritten in a way that Fred Trump, alarmed and angered, feared could result in his empire\u2019s being used to bail out his son\u2019s failing businesses.Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals.Constructing that image required more than Fred Trump\u2019s money. Just as important were his son\u2019s preternatural marketing skills and always-be-closing competitive hustle. While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative. Fred Trump\u2019s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and his presidential campaign.The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump\u2019s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family.Donald Trump\u2019s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars.Early experience, cultivated connections and a wave of federal housing subsidies helped Fred Trump lay the foundation of his son\u2019s wealth.Before he turned 20, Fred Trump had already built and sold his first home. At age 35, he was building hundreds of houses a year in Brooklyn and Queens. By 45, he was building some of the biggest apartment complexes in the country.Aside from an astonishing work ethic \u2014 \u201cSleeping is a waste of time,\u201d he liked to say \u2014 the growth reflected his shrewd application of mass-production techniques. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called him \u201cthe Henry Ford of the home-building industry.\u201d He would erect scaffolding a city block long so his masons, sometimes working a second shift under floodlights, could throw up a dozen rowhouses in a week. They sold for about $115,000 in today\u2019s dollars.By 1940, American Builder magazine was taking notice, devoting a spread to Fred Trump under the headline \u201cBiggest One-Man Building Show.\u201d The article described a swaggering lone-wolf character who paid for everything \u2014 wages, supplies, land \u2014 from a thick wad of cash he carried at all times, and whose only help was a secretary answering the phone in an office barely bigger than a parking space. \u201cHe is his own purchasing agent, cashier, paymaster, building superintendent, construction engineer and sales director,\u201d the article said.It wasn\u2019t that simple. Fred Trump had also spent years ingratiating himself with Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic machine, giving money, doing favors and making the sort of friends (like Abraham D. Beame, a future mayor) who could make life easier for a developer. He had also assembled a phalanx of plugged-in real estate lawyers, property appraisers and tax accountants who protected his interests.All these traits \u2014 deep experience, nimbleness, connections, a relentless focus on the efficient construction of homes for the middle class \u2014 positioned him perfectly to ride a growing wave of federal spending on housing. The wave took shape with the New Deal, grew during the World War II rush to build military housing and crested with the postwar imperative to provide homes for returning G.I.s. Fred Trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation\u2019s largest recipients of cheap government-backed building loans, according to Gwenda Blair\u2019s book \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.\u201dThose same loans became the wellspring of Donald Trump\u2019s wealth. In the late 1940s, Fred Trump obtained roughly $26 million in federal loans to build two of his largest developments, Beach Haven Apartments, near Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Shore Haven Apartments, a few miles away. Then he set about making his children his landlords.As ground lease payments fattened his children\u2019s trusts, Fred Trump embarked on a far bigger transfer of wealth. Records obtained by The Times reveal how he began to build or buy apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens and then gradually, without public trace, transfer ownership to his children through a web of partnerships and corporations. In all, Fred Trump put up nearly $13 million in cash and mortgage debt to create a mini-empire within his empire \u2014 eight buildings with 1,032 apartments \u2014 that he would transfer to his children.The handover began just before Donald Trump\u2019s 16th birthday. On June 1, 1962, Fred Trump transferred a plot of land in Queens to a newly created corporation. While he would be its president, his children would be its owners, records show. Then he constructed a 52-unit building called Clyde Hall.It was easy money for the Trump children. Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings.The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.For Donald Trump, this meant a rapidly growing new source of income. When he was in high school, his cut of the profits was about $17,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars. His share exceeded $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college.How Fred Trump transferred 1,032 apartments to his children without incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in gift taxes is unclear. A review of property records for the eight buildings turned up no evidence that his children bought them outright. Financial records obtained by The Times reveal only that all of the shares in the partnerships and corporations set up to create the mini-empire shifted at some point from Fred Trump to his children. Yet his tax returns show he paid no gift taxes on seven of the buildings, and only a few thousand dollars on the eighth.That building, Sunnyside Towers, a 158-unit property in Queens, illustrates Fred Trump\u2019s catch-me-if-you-can approach with the I.R.S., which had repeatedly cited him for underpaying taxes in the 1950s and 1960s.Donald Trump went to work for his father after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him vice president of dozens of companies. This was also the moment Fred Trump telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent.Fred Jr., seven and a half years older than Donald, had also worked for his father after college. It did not go well, relatives and former employees said in interviews. Fred Trump openly ridiculed him for being too nice, too soft, too lazy, too fond of drink. He frowned on his interests in flying and music, could not fathom why he cared so little for the family business. Donald, witness to his father\u2019s deepening disappointment, fashioned himself Fred Jr.\u2019s opposite \u2014 the brash tough guy with a killer instinct. His reward was to inherit his father\u2019s dynastic dreams.Fred Trump began taking steps that enriched Donald alone, introducing him to the charms of building with cheap government loans. In 1972, father and son formed a partnership to build a high-rise for the elderly in East Orange, N.J. Thanks to government subsidies, the partnership got a nearly interest-free $7.8 million loan that covered 90 percent of construction costs. Fred Trump paid the rest.But his son received most of the financial benefits, records show. On top of profit distributions and consulting fees, Donald Trump was paid to manage the building, though Fred Trump\u2019s employees handled day-to-day management. He also pocketed what tenants paid to rent air-conditioners. By 1975, Donald Trump\u2019s take from the building was today\u2019s equivalent of nearly $305,000 a year.Fred Trump also gave his son an extra boost through his investment, in the early 1970s, in the sprawling Starrett City development in Brooklyn, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the nation. The investment, which promised to generate huge tax write-offs, was tailor-made for Fred Trump; he would use Starrett City\u2019s losses to avoid taxes on profits from his empire.Fred Trump invested $5 million. A separate partnership established for his children invested $1 million more, showering tax breaks on the Trump children for decades to come. They helped Donald Trump avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in 1978 and 1979. But Fred Trump also deputized him to sell a sliver of his Starrett City shares, a sweetheart deal that generated today\u2019s equivalent of more than $1 million in \u201cconsulting fees.\u201dThe money from consulting and management fees, ground leases, the mini-empire and his salary all combined to make Donald Trump indisputably wealthy years before he sold his first Manhattan apartment. By 1975, when he was 29, he had collected nearly $9 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father, The Times found.Wealthy, yes. But a far cry from the image father and son craved for Donald Trump.Fred Trump would play a crucial role in building and carefully maintaining the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\u201cHe is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth \u2018more than $200 million.\u2019\u201dIn the chauffeured Cadillac, Donald Trump took The Times\u2019s reporter on a tour of what he called his \u201cjobs.\u201d He told her about the Manhattan hotel he planned to convert into a Grand Hyatt (his father guaranteed the construction loan), and the Hudson River railroad yards he planned to develop (the rights were purchased by his father\u2019s company). He showed her \u201cour philanthropic endeavor,\u201d the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange (bankrolled by his father), and an apartment complex on Staten Island (owned by his father), and their \u201cflagship,\u201d Trump Village, in Brooklyn (owned by his father), and finally Beach Haven Apartments (owned by his father). Even the Cadillac was leased by his father.\u201cSo far,\u201d he boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve never made a bad deal.\u201dIt was a spectacular con, right down to the priceless moment when Mr. Trump confessed that he was \u201cpublicity shy.\u201d By claiming his father\u2019s wealth as his own, Donald Trump transformed his place in the world. A brash 30-year-old playboy worth more than $200 million proved irresistible to New York City\u2019s bankers, politicians and journalists.Yet for all the spin about cutting his own path in Manhattan, Donald Trump was increasingly dependent on his father. Weeks after The Times\u2019s profile ran, Fred Trump set up still more trusts for his children, seeding each with today\u2019s equivalent of $4.3 million. Even into the early 1980s, when he was already proclaiming himself one of America\u2019s richest men, Donald Trump remained on his father\u2019s payroll, drawing an annual salary of $260,000 in today\u2019s dollars.In theory, the money had to be repaid. In practice, records show, many of the loans were more like gifts. Some were interest-free and had no repayment schedule. Even when loans charged interest, Donald Trump frequently skipped payments.This previously unreported flood of loans highlights a clear pattern to Fred Trump\u2019s largess. When Donald Trump began expensive new projects, his father increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump was converting the old Commodore Hotel into a Grand Hyatt, his father stepped up with a spigot of loans. Fred Trump did the same with Trump Tower in the early 1980s.In the mid-1980s, as Donald Trump made his first forays into Atlantic City, Fred Trump devised a plan that sharply increased the flow of money to his son.The plan involved the mini-empire \u2014 the eight buildings Fred Trump had transferred to his children. He converted seven of them into cooperatives, and helped his children convert the eighth. That meant inviting tenants to buy their apartments, generating a three-way windfall for Donald Trump and his siblings: from selling units, from renting unsold units and from collecting mortgage payments.In 1982, Donald Trump made today\u2019s equivalent of about $380,000 from the eight buildings. As the conversions continued and Fred Trump\u2019s employees sold off more units, his son\u2019s share of profits jumped, records show. By 1987, with the conversions completed, his son was making today\u2019s equivalent of $4.5 million a year off the eight buildings.Fred Trump made one other structural change to his empire that produced a big new source of revenue for Donald Trump and his siblings. He made them his bankers.The Times could find no evidence that the Trump children had to come up with money of their own to buy their father\u2019s mortgages. Most were purchased from Fred Trump\u2019s banks by trusts and partnerships that he set up and seeded with money.Co-op sales, mortgage payments, ground leases \u2014 Fred Trump was a master at finding ways to enrich his children in general and Donald Trump in particular. Some ways were like slow-moving creeks. Others were rushing streams. A few were geysers. But as the decades passed they all joined into one mighty river of money. By 1990, The Times found, Fred Trump, the ultimate silent partner, had quietly transferred today\u2019s equivalent of at least $46.2 million to his son.Donald Trump took on a mien of invincibility. The stock market crashed in 1987 and the economy cratered. But he doubled down thanks in part to Fred Trump\u2019s banks, which eagerly extended credit to the young Trump princeling. He bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $407.5 million. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle fleet in 1989 for $365 million and called it Trump Shuttle. His newest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, would need at least $1 million a day just to cover its debt.The skeptics who questioned the wisdom of this debt-fueled spending spree were drowned out by one magazine cover after another marveling at someone so young taking such breathtaking risks. But whatever Donald Trump was gambling, not for one second was he at risk of losing out on a lifetime of frictionless, effortless wealth. Fred Trump had that bet covered.Bailouts, collateral, cash on hand \u2014 Fred Trump was prepared, and was not about to let bad bets sink his son.As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump\u2019s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.Fred Trump\u2019s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan.Fred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?The Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door.There are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.Such was the case with the rescue mission at his son\u2019s Trump\u2019s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump\u2019s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.With this ruse \u2014 it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty \u2014 Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.Both the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.As the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father\u2019s right hand at family meals and participated in his father\u2019s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump\u2019s news conferences.\u201cI probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,\u201d Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.They were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.Those talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.Fred Trump Jr.\u2019s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.This fantastical claim \u2014 that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days \u2014 slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: \u201cgreenmailing.\u201d The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.On Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had \u201ctaken a sizable stake\u201d in Time. Sure enough, Time\u2019s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.Later that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price \u2014 $81.74 \u2014 it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn\u2019t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son\u2019s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.With other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,\u201d he\u2019d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him \u2014 \u201cFinish this job before you start that job,\u201d he\u2019d counsel \u2014 but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.By 1987, for example, Donald Trump\u2019s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.In December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son\u2019s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.Under state law, developers must file \u201coffering plans\u201d that identify to any potential condo buyer the project\u2019s sponsors \u2014 in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office. He did not do that, records show.He did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor\u2019s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as \u201cthe\u201d owner of Trump Palace.Under I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.According to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.Yet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.Property records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million \u2014 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.By failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss \u2014 that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.Federal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.The partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades \u2014 to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.Donald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father\u2019s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great business, it was a good business,\u201d he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.Donald Trump tried to change his ailing father\u2019s will, prompting a backlash \u2014 but also a recognition that plans had to be set in motion before Fred Trump died.Fred Trump had given careful thought to what would become of his empire after he died, and had hired one of the nation\u2019s top estate lawyers to draft his will. But in December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document, drafted by one of his own lawyers, that sought to make significant changes to that will.Fred Trump, then 85, had never before set eyes on the document, 12 pages of dense legalese. Nor had he authorized its preparation. Nor had he met the lawyer who drafted it.Yet his son sent instructions that he needed to sign it immediately.What happened next was described years later in sworn depositions by members of the Trump family during a dispute, later settled, over the inheritance Fred Trump left to Fred Jr.\u2019s children. These depositions, obtained by The Times, reveal something startling: Fred Trump believed that the document potentially put his life\u2019s work at risk.As close as they were \u2014 or perhaps because they were so close \u2014 Fred Trump did not immediately confront his son. Instead he turned to his daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, then a federal judge whom he often consulted on legal matters. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d he told her, she recalled during her deposition. When Judge Barry read the codicil, she reached the same conclusion. \u201cDonald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission,\u201d she said, \u201cand Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family.\u201d (In a brief telephone interview, Judge Barry declined to comment.)Fred Trump took prompt action to thwart his son. He dispatched his daughter to find new estate lawyers. One of them took notes on the instructions she passed on from her father: \u201cProtect assets from DJT, Donald\u2019s creditors.\u201d The lawyers quickly drafted a new codicil stripping Donald Trump of sole control over his father\u2019s estate. Fred Trump signed it immediately.Clumsy as it was, Donald Trump\u2019s failed attempt to change his father\u2019s will brought a family reckoning about two related issues: Fred Trump\u2019s declining health and his reluctance to relinquish ownership of his empire. Surgeons had removed a neck tumor a few years earlier, and he would soon endure hip replacement surgery and be found to have mild senile dementia. Yet for all the financial support he had lavished on his children, for all his abhorrence of taxes, Fred Trump had stubbornly resisted his advisers\u2019 recommendations to transfer ownership of his empire to the children to minimize estate taxes.With every passing year, the actuarial odds increased that Fred Trump would die owning apartment buildings worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it exposed to the 55 percent estate tax. Just as exposed was the mountain of cash he was sitting on. His buildings, well maintained and carrying little debt, consistently produced millions of dollars a year in profits. Even after he paid himself $109.7 million from 1988 through 1993, his companies were holding $50 million in cash and investments, financial records show. Tens of millions of dollars more passed each month through a maze of personal accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, UBS, Bowery Savings and United Mizrahi, an Israeli bank.Simply put, without immediate action, Fred Trump\u2019s heirs faced the prospect of losing hundreds of millions of dollars to estate taxes.Whatever their differences, the Trumps formulated a plan to avoid this fate. How they did it is a story never before told.It is also a story in which Donald Trump played a central role. He took the lead in strategy sessions where the plan was devised with the consent and participation of his father and his father\u2019s closest advisers, people who attended the meetings told The Times. Robert Trump, the youngest sibling and the beta to Donald\u2019s alpha, was given the task of overseeing day-to-day details. After years of working for his brother, Robert Trump went to work for his father in late 1991.The Trumps\u2019 plan, executed over the next decade, blended traditional techniques \u2014 such as rewriting Fred Trump\u2019s will to maximize tax avoidance \u2014 with unorthodox strategies that tax experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent. As a result, the Trump children would gain ownership of virtually all of their father\u2019s buildings without having to pay a penny of their own. They would turn the mountain of cash into a molehill of cash. And hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to the United States Treasury would instead go to Fred Trump\u2019s children.A family company let Fred Trump funnel money to his children by effectively overcharging himself for repairs and improvements on his properties. All County had no corporate offices. Its address was the Manhasset, N.Y., home of John Walter, a favorite nephew of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter, who died in January, spent decades working for Fred Trump, primarily helping computerize his payroll and billing systems. He also was the unofficial keeper of Fred Trump\u2019s personal and business papers, his basement crowded with boxes of old Trump financial records. John Walter and the four Trump children each owned 20 percent of All County, records show.All County\u2019s main purpose, The Times found, was to enable Fred Trump to make large cash gifts to his children and disguise them as legitimate business transactions, thus evading the 55 percent tax.The way it worked was remarkably simple.Each year Fred Trump spent millions of dollars maintaining and improving his properties. Some of the vendors who supplied his building superintendents and maintenance crews had been cashing Fred Trump\u2019s checks for decades. Starting in August 1992, though, a different name began to appear on their checks \u2014 All County Building Supply & Maintenance.Mr. Walter\u2019s computer systems, meanwhile, churned out All County invoices that billed Fred Trump\u2019s empire for those same services and supplies, with one difference: All County\u2019s invoices were padded, marked up by 20 percent, or 50 percent, or even more, records show.The Trump siblings split the markup, along with Mr. Walter.Years later, in his deposition during the dispute over Fred Trump\u2019s estate, Robert Trump would say that All County actually saved Fred Trump money by negotiating better deals. Given Fred Trump\u2019s long experience expertly squeezing better prices out of contractors, it was a surprising claim. It was also not true.The Times\u2019s examination of thousands of pages of financial documents from Fred Trump\u2019s buildings shows that his costs shot up once All County entered the picture.Beach Haven Apartments illustrates how this happened: In 1991 and 1992, Fred Trump bought 78 refrigerator-stove combinations for Beach Haven from Long Island Appliance Wholesalers. The average price was $642.69. But in 1993, when he began paying All County for refrigerator-stove combinations, the price jumped by 46 percent. Likewise, the price he paid for trash-compacting services at Beach Haven increased 64 percent. Janitorial supplies went up more than 100 percent. Plumbing repairs and supplies rose 122 percent. And on it went in building after building. The more Fred Trump paid, the more All County made, which was precisely the plan.While All County systematically overcharged Fred Trump for thousands of items, the job of negotiating with vendors fell, as it always had, to Fred Trump and his staff.Leon Eastmond can attest to this.Mr. Eastmond is the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. In 1993, he and Fred Trump met at Gargiulo\u2019s, an old-school Italian restaurant in Coney Island that was one of Fred Trump\u2019s favorites, to hash out the price of 60 boilers. Fred Trump, accompanied by his secretary and Robert Trump, drove a hard bargain. After negotiating a 10 percent discount, he made one last demand: \u201cI had to pay the tab,\u201d Mr. Eastmond recalled with a chuckle.There was no mention of All County. Mr. Eastmond first heard of the company when its checks started rolling in. \u201cI remember opening my mail one day and out came a check for $100,000,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company. I didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201dAll County\u2019s owners devised another ruse to profit off Mr. Eastmond\u2019s boilers. To win Fred Trump\u2019s business, Mr. Eastmond had also agreed to provide mobile boilers for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings free of charge while new boilers were being installed. Yet All County charged Fred Trump rent on the same mobile boilers Mr. Eastmond was providing free, along with hookup fees, disconnection fees, transportation fees and operating and maintenance fees, records show. These charges siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars more from Fred Trump\u2019s empire.Mr. Walter, asked during a deposition why Fred Trump chose not to make himself one of All County\u2019s owners, replied, \u201cHe said because he would have to pay a death tax on it.\u201dAfter being briefed on All County by The Times, Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said the Trumps\u2019 use of the company was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d and could constitute criminal tax fraud. \u201cIt certainly looks like a disguised gift,\u201d he said.While All County was all upside for Donald Trump and his siblings, it had an insidious downside for Fred Trump\u2019s tenants.As an owner of rent-stabilized buildings in New York, Fred Trump needed state approval to raise rents beyond the annual increases set by a government board. One way to justify a rent increase was to make a major capital improvement. It did not take much to get approval; an invoice or canceled check would do if the expense seemed reasonable.The Trumps used the padded All County invoices to justify higher rent increases in Fred Trump\u2019s rent-regulated buildings. Fred Trump, according to Mr. Walter, saw All County as a way to have his cake and eat it, too. If he used his \u201cexpert negotiating ability\u201d to buy a $350 refrigerator for $200, he could raise the rent based only on that $200, not on the $350 sticker price \u201ca normal person\u201d would pay, Mr. Walter explained. All County was the way around this problem. \u201cYou have to understand the thinking that went behind this,\u201d he said.As Robert Trump acknowledged in his deposition, \u201cThe higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged.\u201dState records show that after All County\u2019s creation, the Trumps got approval to raise rents on thousands of apartments by claiming more than $30 million in major capital improvements. Tenants repeatedly protested the increases, almost always to no avail, the records show.One of the improvements most often cited by the Trumps: new boilers.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, disputed The Times\u2019s reporting: \u201cShould The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.\u201dOn Jan. 21, 1994, they created a company called Apartment Management Associates Inc., with a mailing address at Mr. Walter\u2019s Manhasset home. Two months later, records show, Apartment Management started collecting fees that had previously gone to Trump Management.The only difference was that Donald Trump and his siblings owned Apartment Management.But these savings were trivial compared with those that would come when Fred Trump transferred his empire \u2014 the actual bricks and mortar \u2014 to his children.The transfer of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire to his children began with a \u2018friendly\u2019 appraisal and an incredible shrinking act.Six months later, on Nov. 22, the Trumps began transferring ownership of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. (A few properties were excluded.) The instrument they used to do this was a special type of trust with a clunky acronym only a tax lawyer could love: GRAT, short for grantor-retained annuity trust.GRATs are one of the tax code\u2019s great gifts to the ultrawealthy. They let dynastic families like the Trumps pass wealth from one generation to the next \u2014 be it stocks, real estate, even art collections \u2014 without paying a dime of estate taxes.The details are numbingly complex, but the mechanics are straightforward. For the Trumps, it meant putting half the properties to be transferred into a GRAT in Fred Trump\u2019s name and the other half into a GRAT in his wife\u2019s name. Then Fred and Mary Trump gave their children roughly two-thirds of the assets in their GRATs. The children bought the remaining third by making annuity payments to their parents over the next two years. By Nov. 22, 1997, it was done; the Trump children owned nearly all of Fred Trump\u2019s empire free and clear of estate taxes.As for gift taxes, the Trumps found a way around those, too.The entire transaction turned on one number: the market value of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. This determined the amount of gift taxes Fred and Mary Trump owed for the portion of the empire they gave to their children. It also determined the amount of annuity payments their children owed for the rest.The I.R.S. recognizes that GRATs create powerful incentives to greatly undervalue assets, especially when those assets are not publicly traded stocks with transparent prices. Indeed, every $10 million reduction in the valuation of Fred Trump\u2019s empire would save the Trumps either $10 million in annuity payments or $5.5 million in gift taxes. This is why the I.R.S. requires families taking advantage of GRATs to submit independent appraisals and threatens penalties for those who lowball valuations.In practice, though, gift tax returns get little scrutiny from the I.R.S. It is an open secret among tax practitioners that evasion of gift taxes is rampant and rarely prosecuted. Punishment, such as it is, usually consists of an auditor\u2019s requiring a tax payment closer to what should have been paid in the first place. \u201cGRATs are typically structured so that no tax is due, which means the I.R.S. has reduced incentive to audit them,\u201d said Mitchell Gans, a professor of tax law at Hofstra University. \u201cSo if a gift is in fact undervalued, it may very well go unnoticed.\u201dThis appears to be precisely what the Trumps were counting on. The Times found evidence that the Trumps dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the real estate assets they placed in Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s GRATs.The methods the Trumps used to pull off this incredible shrinking act were hatched in the strategy sessions Donald Trump participated in during the early 1990s, documents and interviews show. Their basic strategy had two components: Get what is widely known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d appraisal of the empire\u2019s worth, then drive that number even lower by changing the ownership structure to make the empire look less valuable to the I.R.S.A crucial step was finding a property appraiser attuned to their needs. As anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows, appraisers can arrive at sharply different valuations depending on their methods and assumptions. And like stock analysts, property appraisers have been known to massage those methods and assumptions in ways that coincide with their clients\u2019 interests.The Trumps used Robert Von Ancken, a favorite of New York City\u2019s big real estate families. Over a 45-year career, Mr. Von Ancken has appraised many of the city\u2019s landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Donald Trump recruited him after Fred Trump Jr. died and the family needed friendly appraisals to help shield the estate from taxes.Mr. Von Ancken appraised the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the Trumps\u2019 GRATs and concluded that their total value was $93.9 million, tax records show.To assess the accuracy of those valuations, The Times examined the prices paid for comparable apartment buildings that sold within a year of Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. A pattern quickly emerged. Again and again, buildings in the same neighborhood as Trump buildings sold for two to four times as much per square foot as Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals, even when the buildings were decades older, had fewer amenities and smaller apartments, and were deemed less valuable by city property tax appraisers.Mr. Von Ancken valued Argyle Hall, a six-story brick Trump building in Brooklyn, at $9.04 per square foot. Six blocks away, another six-story brick building, two decades older, had sold a few months earlier for nearly $30 per square foot. He valued Belcrest Hall, a Trump building in Queens, at $8.57 per square foot. A few blocks away, another six-story brick building, four decades older with apartments a third smaller, sold for $25.18 per square foot.The pattern persisted with Fred Trump\u2019s higher-end buildings. Mr. Von Ancken appraised Lawrence Towers, a Trump building in Brooklyn with spacious balcony apartments, at $24.54 per square foot. A few months earlier, an apartment building abutting car repair shops a mile away, with units 20 percent smaller, had sold for $48.23 per square foot.The Times found even starker discrepancies when comparing the GRAT appraisals against appraisals commissioned by the Trumps when they had an incentive to show the highest possible valuations.Such was the case with Patio Gardens, a complex of nearly 500 apartments in Brooklyn.Of all Fred Trump\u2019s properties, Patio Gardens was one of the least profitable, which may be why he decided to use it as a tax deduction. In 1992, he donated Patio Gardens to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey, one of the largest charitable donations he ever made. The greater the value of Patio Gardens, the bigger his deduction. The appraisal cited in Fred Trump\u2019s 1992 tax return valued Patio Gardens at $34 million, or $61.90 a square foot.By contrast, Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s GRAT appraisals found that the crown jewels of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Beach Haven and Shore Haven, with five times as many apartments as Patio Gardens, were together worth just $23 million, or $11.01 per square foot.In an interview, Mr. Von Ancken said that because neither he nor The Times had the working papers that described how he arrived at his valuations, there was simply no way to evaluate the methodologies behind his numbers. \u201cThere would be explanations within the appraisals to justify all the values,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBasically, when we prepare these things, we feel that these are going to be presented to the Internal Revenue Service for their review, and they better be right.\u201dOf all the GRAT appraisals Mr. Von Ancken did for the Trumps, the most startling was for 886 rental apartments in two buildings at Trump Village, a complex in Coney Island. Mr. Von Ancken claimed that they were worth less than nothing \u2014 negative $5.9 million, to be exact. These were the same 886 units that city tax assessors valued that same year at $38.1 million, and that a bank would value at $106.6 million in 2004.It appears Mr. Von Ancken arrived at his negative valuation by departing from the methodology that he has repeatedly testified is most appropriate for properties like Trump Village, where past years\u2019 profits are a poor gauge of future value.In 1992, the Trumps had removed the two Trump Village buildings from an affordable housing program so they could raise rents and increase their profits. But doing so cost them a property tax exemption, which temporarily put the buildings in the red. The methodology described by Mr. Von Ancken would have disregarded this blip into the red and valued the buildings based on the higher rents the Trumps would be charging. Mr. Von Ancken, however, appears to have based his valuation on the blip, producing an appraisal that, taken at face value, meant Fred Trump would have had to pay someone millions of dollars to take the property off his hands.Mr. Von Ancken told The Times that he did not recall which appraisal method he used on the two Trump Village buildings. \u201cI can only say that we value the properties based on market information, and based on the expected income and expenses of the building and what they would sell for,\u201d he said. As for the enormous gaps between his valuation and the 1995 city property tax appraisal and the 2004 bank valuation, he argued that such comparisons were pointless. \u201cI can\u2019t say what happened afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they increased the income tremendously.\u201dTo further whittle the empire\u2019s valuation, the family created the appearance that Fred Trump held only 49.8 percent.Armed with Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million appraisal, the Trumps focused on slashing even this valuation by changing the ownership structure of Fred Trump\u2019s empire.The I.R.S. has long accepted the idea that ownership with control is more valuable than ownership without control. Someone with a controlling interest in a building can decide if and when the building is sold, how it is marketed and what price to accept. However, since someone who owns, say, 10 percent of a $100 million building lacks control over any of those decisions, the I.R.S. will let him claim that his stake should be taxed as if it were worth only $7 million or $8 million.But Fred Trump had exercised total control over his empire for more than seven decades. With rare exceptions, he owned 100 percent of his buildings. So the Trumps set out to create the fiction that Fred Trump was a minority owner. All it took was splitting the ownership structure of his empire. Fred and Mary Trump each ended up with 49.8 percent of the corporate entities that owned his buildings. The other 0.4 percent was split among their four children.Splitting ownership into minority interests is a widely used method of tax avoidance. There is one circumstance, however, where it has at times been found to be illegal. It involves what is known in tax law as the step transaction doctrine \u2014 where it can be shown that the corporate restructuring was part of a rapid sequence of seemingly separate maneuvers actually conceived and executed to dodge taxes. A key issue, according to tax experts, is timing \u2014 in the Trumps\u2019 case, whether they split up Fred Trump\u2019s empire just before they set up the GRATs.In all, the Trumps broke up 12 corporate entities to create the appearance of minority ownership. The Times could not determine when five of the 12 companies were divided. But records reveal that the other seven were split up just before the GRATs were established.The pattern was clear. For decades, the companies had been owned solely by Fred Trump, each operating a different apartment complex or shopping center. In September 1995, the Trumps formed seven new limited liability companies. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 8, they transferred the deeds to the seven properties into their respective L.L.C.\u2019s. On Nov. 21, they recorded six of the deed transfers in public property records. (The seventh was recorded on Nov. 24.) And on Nov. 22, 49.8 percent of the shares in these seven L.L.C.\u2019s was transferred into Fred Trump\u2019s GRAT and 49.8 percent into Mary Trump\u2019s GRAT.That enabled the Trumps to slash Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s valuation in a way that was legally dubious. They claimed that Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s status as minority owners, plus the fact that a building couldn\u2019t be sold as easily as a share of stock, entitled them to lop 45 percent off Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million valuation. This claim, combined with $18.3 million more in standard deductions, completed the alchemy of turning real estate that would soon be valued at nearly $900 million into $41.4 million.According to tax experts, claiming a 45 percent discount was questionable even back then, and far higher than the 20 to 30 percent discount the I.R.S. would allow today.The I.R.S. determined that the Trumps\u2019 assets were worth $57.1 million, 38 percent more than the couple had claimed. From the perspective of an I.R.S. auditor, pulling in nearly $5 million in additional revenue could be considered a good day\u2019s work. For the Trumps, getting the I.R.S. to agree that Fred Trump\u2019s properties were worth only $57.1 million was a triumph.\u201cAll estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly,\u201d Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, said in his statement.In the end, the transfer of the Trump empire cost Fred and Mary Trump $20.5 million in gift taxes and their children $21 million in annuity payments. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than they would have paid based on the empire\u2019s market value, The Times found.On the day the Trump children finally took ownership of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Donald Trump\u2019s net worth instantly increased by many tens of millions of dollars. And from then on, the profits from his father\u2019s empire would flow directly to him and his siblings. The next year, 1998, Donald Trump\u2019s share amounted to today\u2019s equivalent of $9.6 million, The Times found.This sudden influx of wealth came only weeks after he had published \u201cThe Art of the Comeback.\u201d\u201cI learned a lot about myself during these hard times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to the basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused, and I got myself out of a box.\u201dOver 244 pages he did not mention that he was being handed nearly 25 percent of his father\u2019s empire.During Fred Trump\u2019s final years, dementia stole most of his memories. When family visited, there was one name he could reliably put to a face.Donald.On June 7, 1999, Fred Trump was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, not far from the house in Jamaica Estates, for treatment of pneumonia. He died there on June 25, at the age of 93.Fifteen months later, Fred Trump\u2019s executors \u2014 Donald, Maryanne and Robert \u2014 filed his estate tax return. The return, obtained by The Times, vividly illustrates the effectiveness of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s.Fred Trump, one of the most prolific New York developers of his time, owned just five apartment complexes, two small strip malls and a scattering of co-ops in the city upon his death. The man who paid himself $50 million in 1990 died with just $1.9 million in the bank. He owned not a single stock, bond or Treasury bill. According to his estate tax return, his most valuable asset was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died.The bulk of Fred Trump\u2019s empire was nowhere to be found on his estate tax return. And yet Donald Trump and his siblings were not done. Recycling the legally dubious techniques they had mastered with the GRATs, they dodged tens of millions of dollars in estate taxes on the remnants of empire that Fred Trump still owned when he died, The Times found.As with the GRATs, they obtained appraisals from Mr. Von Ancken that grossly understated the actual market value of those remnants. And as with the GRATs, they aggressively discounted Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. The result: They claimed that the five apartment complexes and two strip malls were worth $15 million. In 2004, records show, bankers would put a value of $176.2 million on the exact same properties.As with the Trump Village appraisal, the Trumps appear to have hidden key facts from the I.R.S. Tysens Park, like Trump Village, had operated for years under an affordable housing program that by law capped Fred Trump\u2019s profits. This cap drastically reduced the property\u2019s market value.Except for one thing: The Trumps had removed Tysens Park from the affordable housing program the year before Fred Trump died, The Times found. When Donald Trump and his siblings filed Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return, there were no limits on their profits. In fact, they had already begun raising rents.As their father\u2019s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate\u2019s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he made during his lifetime, including, for example, the $15.5 million Trump Palace gift to Donald Trump and the millions of dollars he gave his children via All County\u2019s padded invoices.\u201cIf they knew anything was wrong they could be in violation of tax law,\u201d Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said. \u201cThey can\u2019t just stick their heads in the sand.\u201dIn addition to drastically understating the value of apartment complexes and shopping centers, Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return made no mention of either Trump Palace or All County.It wasn\u2019t until after Fred Trump\u2019s wife, Mary, died at 88 on Aug. 7, 2000, that the I.R.S. completed its audit of their combined estates. The audit concluded that their estates were worth $51.8 million, 23 percent more than Donald Trump and his siblings had claimed.That meant an additional $5.2 million in estate taxes. Even so, the Trumps\u2019 tax bill was a fraction of what they would have owed had they reported the market value of what Fred and Mary Trump owned at the time of their deaths.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. \u201cThe returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments, which were made, and then fully approved all of the tax filings. These matters have now been closed for more than a decade.\u201dIn 2003, the Trump siblings gathered at Trump Tower for one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire.As always, Robert Trump drove into Manhattan with several of his lieutenants. Donald Trump appeared with Allen H. Weisselberg, who had worked for Fred Trump for two decades before becoming his son\u2019s chief financial officer. The sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, were there as well.The meeting followed the usual routine: a financial report, a rundown of operational issues and then the real business \u2014 distributing profits to each Trump. The task of handing out the checks fell to Steve Gurien, the empire\u2019s finance chief.A moment later, Donald Trump abruptly changed the course of his family\u2019s history: He said it was a good time to sell.Fred Trump\u2019s empire, in fact, was continuing to produce healthy profits, and selling contradicted his stated wish to keep his legacy in the family. But Donald Trump insisted that the real estate market had peaked and that the time was right, according to a person familiar with the meeting.He was also, once again, in financial trouble. His Atlantic City casinos were veering toward another bankruptcy. His creditors would soon threaten to oust him unless he committed to invest $55 million of his own money.Yet if Donald Trump\u2019s sudden push to sell stunned the room, it met with no apparent resistance from his siblings. He directed his brother to solicit private bids, saying he wanted the sale handled quickly and quietly. Donald Trump\u2019s signature skill \u2014 drumming up publicity for the Trump brand \u2014 would sit this one out.Three potential bidders were given access to the finances of Fred Trump\u2019s empire \u2014 37 apartment complexes and several shopping centers. Ruby Schron, a major New York City landlord, quickly emerged as the favorite. In December 2003, Mr. Schron called Donald Trump and they came to an agreement; Mr. Schron paid $705.6 million for most of the empire, which included paying off the Trumps\u2019 mortgages. A few remaining properties were sold to other buyers, bringing the total sales price to $737.9 million.On May 4, 2004, the Trump children spent most of the day signing away ownership of what their father had doggedly built over 70 years. The sale received little news coverage, and an article in The Staten Island Advance included the rarest of phrases: \u201cTrump did not return a phone call seeking comment.\u201dEven more extraordinary was this unreported fact: The banks financing Mr. Schron\u2019s purchase valued Fred Trump\u2019s empire at nearly $1 billion. In other words, Donald Trump, master dealmaker, sold his father\u2019s empire for hundreds of millions less than it was worth.Within a year of the sale, Mr. Trump spent $149 million in cash on a rapid series of transactions that bolstered his billionaire bona fides. In June 2004 he agreed to pay $73 million to buy out his partner in the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. (\u201cI\u2019m just buying it with my own cash,\u201d he told reporters.) He paid $55 million in cash to make peace with his casino creditors. Then he put up $21 million more in cash to help finance his purchase of Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., that he later sold to a Russian oligarch.*****The first season of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was broadcast in 2004, just as Donald Trump was wrapping up the sale of his father\u2019s empire. The show\u2019s opening montage \u2014 quick cuts of a glittering Trump casino, then Trump Tower, then a Trump helicopter mid-flight, then a limousine depositing the man himself at the steps of his jet, all set to the song \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d \u2014 is a reminder that the story of Donald Trump is fundamentally a story of money.Money is at the core of the brand Mr. Trump has so successfully sold to the world. Yet essential to that mythmaking has been keeping the truth of his money \u2014 how much of it he actually has, where and whom it came from \u2014 hidden or obscured. Across the decades, aided and abetted by less-than-aggressive journalism, Mr. Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than seen.In a statement to The Times, the president\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated what Mr. Trump has always claimed about the evolution of his fortune: \u201cThe president\u2019s father gave him an initial $1 million loan, which he paid back. President Trump used this money to build an incredibly successful company as well as net worth of over $10 billion, including owning some of the world\u2019s greatest real estate.\u201dBut the more than 100,000 pages of records obtained during this investigation make it possible to sweep away decades of misinformation and arrive at a clear understanding about the original source of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth \u2014 his father.Here is what can be said with certainty: Had Mr. Trump done nothing but invest the money his father gave him in an index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, he would be worth $1.96 billion today. As for that $1 million loan, Fred Trump actually lent him at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today\u2019s dollars, The Times found.And there is one more Fred Trump windfall coming Donald Trump\u2019s way. Starrett City, the Brooklyn housing complex that the Trumps invested in back in the 1970s, sold this year for $905 million. Donald Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds is expected to exceed $16 million, records show.It was an investment made with Fred Trump\u2019s money and connections. But in Donald Trump\u2019s version of his life, Starrett City is always and forever \u201cone of the best investments I ever made.\u201dPhoto illustration by Grant Gold/The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Fake News Is Poisoning Brazilian Politics. WhatsApp Can Stop It. ", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Tard\u00e1guila, Mr. Benevenuto and Mr. Ortellado are the authors of a new report on misinformation in Brazil.With just a few weeks before the runoff vote on Oct. 28 between the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro and his left-wing opponent Fernando Haddad, there is still time for WhatsApp to make temporary changes to the platform to reduce the poisoning of Brazilian political life. The company must be decisive before it is too late.But these efforts seem to have pushed dirty campaigns elsewhere, in particular to WhatsApp, where activity consists of encrypted personal conversations and chat groups involving up to 256 people. Such chat groups are much harder to monitor than the Facebook News Feed or Google\u2019s search results.It is difficult to establish to what extent these misinformation campaigns are affiliated with political parties or candidates, but their tactics are clear: They rely on a combined pyramid and network strategy in which producers create malicious content and broadcast it to regional and local activists, who then spread the messages widely to public and private groups. From there, the messages travel even further as they are forwarded on by believing individuals to their own contacts.From a sample of more than 100,000 political images that circulated in those 347 groups, we selected the 50 most widely shared. They were reviewed by Ag\u00eancia Lupa, which is Brazil\u2019s leading fact-checking platform. Eight of those 50 photos and images were considered completely false; 16 were real pictures but used out of their original context or related to distorted data; four were unsubstantiated claims, not based on a trustworthy public source. This means that 56 percent of the most-shared images were misleading. Only 8 percent of the 50 most widely shared images were considered fully truthful.The problem of false news in Brazil transcends ideological divides.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters shared several images describing politicians \u2014 including those from the center right \u2014 as \u201ccommunists.\u201d The most widely shared image from our sample was a black-and-white photo of Fidel Castro and a young woman. The description accompanying the picture claims the woman is former President Dilma Rousseff, and the text accompanying it suggests Ms. Rousseff was Castro\u2019s pupil, a \u201csocialist student.\u201d The young woman in the photo, however, is not Ms. Rousseff. The picture was taken in the United States in April 1959, when Ms. Rousseff was only 11. Yet such images are effective in smearing Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 of which Mr. Haddad is a member \u2014 in a country where there is much antipathy to communism among the middle class.The alarming flow of distorted information can be mitigated. If WhatsApp changes some of its settings in Brazil from now until Election Day, Oct. 28, it can reduce the spread of lies. Moreover, these simple changes can be made without impinging on freedom of expression or invading users\u2019 privacy.WhatsApp should undertake three measures immediately:We contacted WhatsApp this week and presented these suggestions. The company responded by saying that there was not enough time to implement the changes. We disagree: In India, it took only a few days for WhatsApp to start making adjustments. The same is possible in Brazil.Our country is in a decisive political moment. Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s extreme right-wing positions \u2014 including his contemptuous positions on human rights and his nostalgia for the military dictatorship \u2014 have led many voters to fear for the future of our country\u2019s democracy. Many other voters worry that Mr. Haddad seems to be following orders from Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president who is now in prison on corruption charges.With such high stakes and such a polarized debate, Brazilians should not be casting their votes on the basis of false or distorted information. None of our proposals would require WhatsApp to limit its operations or impede Brazilians\u2019 ability to communicate with friends and family. We are suggesting only that the company temporarily impose some restrictions to stop the spread of fake news and dangerous rumors ahead of a critical election.Cristina Tard\u00e1guila is the director of Ag\u00eancia Lupa, a fact-checking platform.

{"Headline": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Announce She\u2019s Pregnant", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Another royal baby is on the way.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are expecting a child in the spring, Kensington Palace announced on Monday.Prince Harry, 34, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and Ms. Markle, 37, are widely seen as likable and approachable, and she brought elements to the royal family that would have been unthinkable not so long ago: She is American, a former actress, biracial, divorced and a self-described feminist. Their union has been hailed as giving the royals a more accessible, modern and inclusive image.The couple landed in Sydney on Monday morning to start a 16-day tour through Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The child would be seventh in line to the British throne, after, in order, Charles, Prince of Wales, father of Prince Harry; Harry\u2019s older brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge; the three young children of William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge; and Harry, himself. But under current rules, the new royal baby would not be titled prince or princess.Unless the queen makes a similar change on their behalf, any children of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle\u2019s would be titled earl or lady.Even so, the new royal baby will be the subject of a media frenzy, judging by reactions to the wedding, and to Monday\u2019s news. Shortly after the announcement of Ms. Markle\u2019s pregnancy, Twitter was ablaze with excitement, much of it with a #RoyalBaby hashtag.After the announcement of a vernal royal birth, the question \u201cwhen is spring?\u201d spiked in Google searches. The announcement also meant that Ms. Markle\u2019s due date might coincide with Britain\u2019s labors to leave the European Union: Brexit is scheduled for March 29.Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are in Australia in part for the Invictus Games, a sporting event for sick and injured military veterans that includes wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball.Harry founded the games in 2014, and the latest iteration starts on Saturday.The duke and duchess will also take part in dozens of other public events \u2014 76 in all. They will visit a rural Australian town struggling with drought, go to the Sydney Opera House for a celebration of its 45th anniversary, pet a koala in a Sydney zoo and meet Indigenous Australian leaders on Fraser Island, off eastern Australia.The baby buzz could translate into even larger crowds than they had been expected to draw.A royal spokeswoman said that Doria Ragland, Ms. Markle\u2019s mother, was \u201cvery happy about this lovely news, and she looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild.\u201dThe most recent British royal baby arrived this year, when the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis.An earlier version of this article misstated the occasion of the celebration at the Sydney Opera House. It is the opera house\u2019s 45th anniversary, not its 75th.Damien Cave contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Used to Know Exactly What People Wanted \u2014 Then It Made a Watch", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyApple opened a routine product-launch event last month with a gag. An establishing aerial shot of Apple\u2019s new circular headquarters set up a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it\u2019s an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple\u2019s depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 and it\u2019s not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation.The subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them,\u201d he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, \u201cthey would have said, \u2018Faster horses.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era.The company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn\u2019t succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They\u2019re for Instagram or Facebook; they\u2019re for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple\u2019s competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple\u2019s core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history\u2019s most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers.The Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch \u2014 with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting \u2014 was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself.Four years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn\u2019t yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process \u2014 and still in charge \u2014 of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It\u2019s a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious.During the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d \u2014 attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It\u2019s the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you\u2019re snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up \u2014 that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn\u2019t have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for.Over the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what\u2019s going on with, and inside, its wearers\u2019 bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device\u2019s body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won\u2019t be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer\u2019s heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance.For now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that \u2014 it\u2019s a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple\u2019s relative commitment to privacy \u2014 at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording.As Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple\u2019s stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple\u2019s devices and software.This is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple\u2019s latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry.There may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can\u2019t remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device \u2014 or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Kid\u2019s Apps Are Crammed With Ads", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a new study of the most downloaded apps for children ages 5 and younger, researchers found advertising in almost all of them.Many developers market apps for children as being educational. So Jenny Radesky, a pediatrician who wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for children and media, wanted to check that out. \u201cOne of my big concerns about why apps might not be educational was because of the presence of distracting features such as banner ads that sit along the top of the screen and which contain stimuli that are irrelevant to the learning objective,\u201d Dr. Radesky said. \u201cAnd we were expecting to see those.\u201dShe was not expecting all the rest.\u201cThe first word that comes to mind is furious,\u201d said Dr. Radesky, an assistant professor of developmental behavioral pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School. \u201cI\u2019m a researcher. I want to stay objective. We started this study really just trying to look at distraction. My frustrated response is about all the surprising, potentially deceptive stuff we found.\u201dHer team of researchers spent hundreds of hours playing 135 different games. Published in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics, the study\u2019s findings are stark: 95 percent of commonly downloaded apps marketed to be played by children ages 5 and under contain at least one type of advertising. The researchers concluded many of these examples seemed to violate F.T.C. rules around unfair and deceptive advertising.To accompany the publication of the study, called \u201cAdvertising in Young Children\u2019s Apps: A Content Analysis,\u201d more than a dozen media and children\u2019s health advocacy organizations sent the F.T.C. a letter asking for an investigation. The letter brings up a few specific findings from Dr. Radesky\u2019s research: In Olaf\u2019s Adventures, published by Disney, clicking on a glowing cake that is not marked as an ad takes the player to a store; in Doctor Kids, published by Bubadu, a character cries if the player clicks away from the in-app store.\u201cWe urge the commission to immediately launch an investigation of Android apps designed for, and marketed to, young children and hold developers accountable for their practices,\u201d the letter states.The group argues that these advertising tactics violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which bans unfair and deceptive business practices.Mr. Chester said the Google app marketplace should not allow these apps to be directed to kids at all. \u201cGoogle in fact knows and is a co-conspirator with the developers,\u201d he said. In a statement, a Google spokesperson said app developers can show ads so long as they agree to comply with privacy laws and the company's policies, such as barring advertisers from collecting information on users under 13. \u201cApps primarily directed to children must participate in our Designed for Families Program and must follow more stringent requirements, including content and ad restrictions,\u201d the statement said. It added that Google Play \u201cdiscloses whether an app has advertising or in-app purchases, so parents can make informed decisions.\u201dKathryn Montgomery, who helped lead the effort that resulted in the landmark Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, said she thinks now is the moment for another landmark action to protect children. \u201cThe tide has turned,\u201d said Dr. Montgomery, a professor of communications at American University. \u201cYou can feel it. A few years ago to suggest limiting tech for kids would have sounded alarmist, and now that\u2019s changing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to children and deceptive the way the ads are structured into the play,\u201d Dr. Montgomery said. \u201cThe F.T.C. is one of the only regulatory agencies able to do something about it, and we\u2019re seeing this issue is having a very bipartisan reach.\u201dWhile other studies of children and games usually focused on the top rated or recommended apps, Dr. Radesky chose to study the ones with the most downloads. Many of those were free apps, and she found those had the most alarming advertising. \u201cThose were the ones that my low-income patients download the most,\u201d she said. To Dr. Radesky, this bombardment of advertising undercuts most of the educational content an app may include.\u201cThere\u2019s very limited research showing how children learn from interactive media,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the one thing that\u2019s consistent is if you have lots of distracting bells and whistles, children don\u2019t comprehend the underlying learning material as well.\u201d Some of it became personal. \u201cIt was a really creepy cartoon version of Donald Trump trying to resist pressing a big red nuke button,\u201d Dr. Radesky said. \u201cMy son got upset at the cartoon cause he was like, \u2018Wait does Trump actually have a button like that in his office?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Oh great, now I need to explain this.\u2019\u201dShe hopes the study will lead parents to ask more questions about the games their kids are playing. And she hopes it leads to regulation, though she suspects that will be a harder battle. \u201cThe hardest argument to make when you live in the U.S. is that children\u2019s rights should be higher than the rights of advertisers or companies who want access to them,\u201d she said. \u201cKids make a lot of money \u2014 they are demanding, and they are very susceptible.\u201dWith additional reporting by Doris Burke.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Writer Who Appeared on \u2018Media Men\u2019 List Sues Its Creators", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStephen Elliott has filed a lawsuit against the people behind a crowdsourced document that listed men said to be guilty of harassment and assault.Mr. Elliott, an author based in New Orleans, whose name appeared on the list highlighted in red to signify that multiple women had accused him of \u201cphysical sexual violence,\u201d said in a lawsuit that the information about him on the list was \u201cabusive, vulgar, intentionally misleading as well as damning to the Plaintiff\u2019s reputation and good name.\u201d The lawsuit asserts that Mr. Elliott lost professional opportunities and friendships after the list became public knowledge. It accuses Ms. Donegan and the other authors of the list of taking action \u201csolely to damage Plaintiff\u2019s reputation and career.\u201dThe list was created exactly a year ago by Ms. Donegan, who has said that she sought to warn peers in the media industry about men to be avoided. It was created in a Google spreadsheet, which can be edited collaboratively, and initially shared with a select group. Directions at the top of the list read: \u201cPlease never name an accuser, and please never share this document with a man.\u201d Knowledge of the document spread quickly, bringing both additional viewers to it and additional names, as the other women, many of them acting anonymously, added people to the list. The suit represents the first known legal action taken by a man named on the list against its creator and contributors. Andrew T. Miltenberg, a lawyer representing Mr. Elliott, said in an interview Thursday that he had taken the case because \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t be able to hide behind anonymity \u2014 in this case the anonymity of the internet \u2014 to ruin someone\u2019s life.\u201dHe said that other people had expressed interest in joining the suit, but that as of Thursday evening, no one had. He did not give further details on who had expressed interest. He also declined to comment on who was paying Mr. Elliott\u2019s legal fees.\u201cIf you\u2019re Stephen Elliot or someone else on that list or a private person, an individual who\u2019s just a target, where do you go to get your reputation back and how you defend yourself?\u201d he asked. He said that the list represented a modern-day form of McCarthyism.The suit suggests that Mr. Elliott would seek to locate anonymous contributors to the list through the I.P. addresses or email accounts that could identify them. Google\u2019s press team said that such information would be turned over if Mr. Elliott provided the company with a valid court order (or, alternatively, if he obtained it directly from Ms. Donegan).The list was labeled \u201ca collection of misconduct allegations and rumors.\u201d A message toward the top advised those with whom it was shared to \u201ctake everything with a grain of salt.\u201dMs. Donegan declined to comment on Thursday.The list, which was created soon after multiple accusations of assault against Harvey Weinstein became public, was an early flash point in the nascent #Me Too movement.Mr. Elliott is asking the court to order that the defendants \u201cissue a written retraction to each and every person to whom they originally published the false and defamatory statements,\u201d and no less than $2 million in damages.

{"Headline": "Double Takes Amid the Devastation: Reporting on a Hurricane\u2019s Surreal Aftermath", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs our journalists navigate roads damaged by Hurricane Michael, Sheri Fink recalls indelible images from her coverage of Hurricane Florence: traveling by boat on a highway, watching floodwaters swallow roofs, ferrying survivors whose lives were forever altered.Outside, fire crews in yellow shirts from Charlotte and navy shirts from Boone gathered at lines of picnic tables with National Guard and active duty Army personnel for a breakfast of grits and sausage served by the spouses of county officials, some of whose families had spent nine days at the center and would be away from their homes for days more. For about one in five county employees, there would be no going home: Their dwellings were destroyed.We rode NC-53 as if it were a river. Almost immediately, floodwaters rose to the necks of mailboxes, then to the tops of street signs. Large birds circled above us. We handed branches from person to person as we floated through a brushy area. An egret stood watch over the flooded groves of Newberry\u2019s Blueberries. I later learned that crops tainted by floodwaters could not be sold for human consumption.After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, Dale had raised his log house high above ground. He had everything they needed to survive: food, water, generators, fuel. On that day, surrounded by devastation, what vexed the men most were the people speeding by, apparently sightseers, who created wakes that nudged the water line inches higher.Mr. Rivenbark joined us on the airboat, and we headed for his home. He had figured it would be safe, but all hope was abandoned as we approached a trailer with light gray siding. \u201cOh, geez,\u201d Mr. Rivenbark said, his blue eyes welling. \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201dMr. Rivenbark, wearing a life vest, climbed clumsily onto his deck. He waded in thigh-deep water, pushing away overturned chairs to reach his front door. He soon returned, clutching medicine vials and a box. \u201cLost everything I got,\u201d he said. \u201cLord have mercy.\u201d The water was even in his brand new washing machine.He shook his head and cried as we floated away. \u201cI started to kill myself last night. If I\u2019d had an extension cord,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get a hold of my therapist.\u201d He was staying in town with his daughter and her 6-week-old baby, and we resolved to stay in touch with him. (He was doing O.K., taking it \u201cone day at a time,\u201d he said last week, and even helping out others, volunteering to repair a church\u2019s generators.)For a time, the sun overhead turned the still water into a mirror, rendering the peaks of roofs into perfect rhombuses. It was as unbelievable an image as was the idea of a house swallowed to its tip, as was the idea of lives so irrevocably changed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Sturdy Love Is What You Need", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveThere is the often facile social media narrative of overcoming adversity in marriage. And then there is the reality. I clicked and then winced as I took in a photo of an icy Montana highway, a pickup with the hood smashed in, and a blue Subaru Outback that had been cut cleanly in half. Skimming, I learned that the woman \u2014 a former high school classmate, Deirdre \u2014 was expected to survive and her daughter, 3, had been airlifted to a hospital.Three years earlier, my husband, Eric, and I had lost our 22-month-old son, Seamus, when they were struck in a crosswalk by a careless driver. I disappeared from Facebook afterward, emerging only when I became pregnant 16 months later, a tidy ending for my social media world. I let others write the story of my marriage as one that survived tragedy and emerged even stronger.In reality, we were more like a ship that had weathered a bad storm \u2014 grateful and relieved to be afloat, but the damage was extensive.The implication from my friend who tagged me was that I should do something. But I hadn\u2019t seen Deirdre in 20 years. How would it feel to hear from someone whose experience included the worst outcome?I grabbed my raincoat and headed out. It was drizzly and cold in downtown Portland, the streets bustling with Christmas shoppers. My son and daughter \u2014 twins born two years after Seamus died \u2014 had just turned 1, and this was the first year in recent memory I approached the holiday with something other than dread. I had even dug out our Christmas decorations, a disorganized time capsule of tangled light strings, Seamus\u2019s stocking and random ornaments.Now all the merriment seemed ridiculous. I headed from the mall toward the Willamette River, wondering about Deirdre\u2019s holiday plans. Would they celebrate at home or in a hospital? Would they celebrate at all?Along the river the crowd thinned, reduced to the occasional jogger or cyclist. I was tempted to yell, \u201cChildren aren\u2019t supposed to die!\u201d just to feel a little less alone. Surely they would agree.But grief is a solitary journey, even when you\u2019re married and the deceased is a child you loved in equal measure. When we returned from the hospital without Seamus, Eric retreated to the nursery, howling with pain. I avoided Seamus\u2019s room, instead sitting on the couch he had christened with a Sharpie just a few days earlier, my body vibrating with shock as I received a steady stream of tearful visitors.As the weeks wore on, I sought solace from friends and therapy while Eric turned inward, comforted only by the thought of having another child. I wanted another baby, too, but I also wanted to travel, sell our house, start over \u2014 all things Eric resisted.If we stayed together, it was mostly in proximity, necessitated by our shared goal of becoming parents again. We spent a year having sad, purposeful sex. Then, as I approached my 36th birthday, we sought help from a fertility specialist, who pronounced us infertile, refusing to treat us unless we used an egg donor. Then a second doctor agreed to a Hail Mary round of in vitro fertilization for $18,000.When we learned I was pregnant with twins, our community \u2014 most of whom knew nothing of our struggle to become pregnant \u2014 celebrated with us, using words like \u201cmiracle.\u201d Meanwhile, I surveyed the damage.Having more children did not reduce the sadness that had become the identifying feature of our marriage, but it did force our hearts to expand to accommodate other, happier emotions. My life acquired a richness that did not exist before Seamus died, as if it had switched from black-and-white television to high definition color. I was surprised by the way ordinary pleasures \u2014 birds on our feeder, the sticky grasp of toddler fingers or a sip of water after a run \u2014 counterweighed the sorrow.If Deirdre\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t make it, this is what I would want to tell her: that grief is exactly as painful as you think it will be, but with time you will learn to love your sadness because of the tiny shoots of joy and gratitude that sprout around it, like new growth on scorched earth.Rounding the corner to my office, I brought my thoughts back to the present, where an afternoon meeting and an evening of toddler wrangling awaited. I told myself there was nothing I could do, that Deirdre\u2019s daughter would make a full recovery, probably.Two weeks later, I received another Facebook message letting me know that Deirdre\u2019s daughter had died. This time, there was no stuffing my feelings. I came home from work and raced through a blur of food-smeared trays, double baths, lullabies and feeble cleanup efforts before collapsing with Eric on the couch, where we cried together, replaying those first awful days in our heads.One afternoon while our children napped, I ventured into our basement to retrieve a wicker basket of cards we had received after Seamus died, feeling a sudden camaraderie with the writers, despite the common phrases that kept appearing: \u201cThere are no words.\u201d \u201cYou are in our hearts.\u201d \u201cI cannot imagine your pain.\u201dNo one can think of the perfect thing to say at such times. I couldn\u2019t either.But remembering the comfort the notes had brought, I decided to send Deirdre a card anyway. To my surprise, she replied by email, and soon we were exchanging text messages. I told her I had a trip to Montana planned in April, and we arranged to meet.On the drive to her house, I clutched a small moonstone my grief counselor had given me. Its smooth surface calmed me as I navigated a two-lane highway that threaded through a Montana landscape of grazing cattle and snow-dusted hills.Inching my car toward a cozy cabin at the end of a long driveway, I felt young Zoe\u2019s absence press against my chest. I wondered if horses in the nearby pasture noticed the way world around them had been altered. It was a stillness I knew well.Deirdre greeted me with a hug, apologizing as her new puppy, Chief, mauled me with wet dog kisses. Tall and slender, her brown hair cut into a bob, she had no visible signs of injury. With the exception of a few strands of gray hair, she looked much as she had two decades before. We went for a walk through the winding streets of her subdivision, the Beartooth Mountains towering in the distance and Chief running in circles, entertaining us with his puppy energy.There was no small talk. We discussed watching our children die, moving easily between medical terms and mother terms. At one point, one of Deirdre\u2019s neighbors drove by in a black pickup. She rolled down her window and Deirdre introduced me, then they chatted for a few minutes.As the woman drove away, Deirdre said, \u201cThat\u2019s Chief\u2019s veterinarian. She also lost a son, years ago.\u201dI marveled at the three of us talking about the weather and the dog, our shattered hearts somehow still beating.I asked Deirdre how her marriage was holding up, and she told me her husband was struggling over having made the decision to withdraw care for Zoe. I found myself saying, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d even though I could and had imagined that scenario with Seamus many times.\u201cBy the time doctors declared Seamus\u2019s time of death,\u201d I said, \u201cthere was no room for doubt.\u201d I then said something about being \u201clucky,\u201d and we both laughed. I told her my marriage had suffered \u2014 Eric\u2019s near-total reliance on me for emotional support was suffocating at times, and I often felt I had to choose between caring for him and caring for myself. But people didn\u2019t want to hear that because it countered the preferred narrative of healing and recovery.Deirdre said she loved her husband but wasn\u2019t sure what would become of her marriage. I was glad to give her space to voice something that was obviously true.During our conversation, we discovered that both Seamus and Zoe loved the moon, so before I left, I handed Deirdre the moonstone my counselor had given me, and we promised to keep in touch.Two hours after I arrived, as the sun set in fiery streaks over the mountains, I drove back to my family. When a farmer waved at me from inside a beat-up pickup, I thought about the comfort of sturdy, unglamorous things, my marriage among them.Ours may not be a great love story, but set against a backdrop of cruel nature and boundless beauty, I didn\u2019t need it to be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Workers Now Want to Know: What Are We Building This For?", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Dr. Poulson works on search technologies, he had no knowledge of the product, which was code-named Dragonfly. So in a meeting last month with Jeff Dean, the company\u2019s head of artificial intelligence, Dr. Poulson asked if Google planned to move ahead with the product and if his work would contribute to censorship and surveillance in China.According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit the company. Mr. Dean did not respond to a request for comment, and Google declined to comment.Across the technology industry, rank-and-file employees are demanding greater insight into how their companies are deploying the technology that they built. At Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, as well as at tech start-ups, engineers and technologists are increasingly asking whether the products they are working on are being used for surveillance in places like China or for military projects in the United States or elsewhere.That\u2019s a change from the past, when Silicon Valley workers typically developed products with little questioning about the social costs. It is also a sign of how some tech companies, which grew by serving consumers and businesses, are expanding more into government work. And the shift coincides with concerns in Silicon Valley about the Trump administration\u2019s policies and the larger role of technology in government.And the change is likely to last: Some engineering students have said they are demanding more answers and are asking similar questions, even before they move into the work force.\u201cWhat people are looking for \u2014 not just employees \u2014 they are looking for some clarity,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman. \u201cAre there principles that get applied? Even if you don\u2019t agree with the decision that gets made, if you understand the thinking behind it, it helps a lot.\u201dAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.The lack of information about what tech employees are working on was recently evident at Clarifai, an artificial intelligence start-up in New York City.Last year, a small team of Clarifai engineers began working on a project inside a private room at its downtown New York office, said three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation. Paper covered the windows, and employees called the room \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets,\u201d in a sly reference to the second Harry Potter novel. Even the eight engineers and researchers working inside the room did not entirely realize the nature of the project, the people said.When employees asked about the project in meetings, Clarifai\u2019s chief executive, Matt Zeiler, said it was a government project related to \u201canalytics\u201d or \u201csurveillance\u201d and would \u201csave lives,\u201d according to the people.After employees read documents posted to Clarifai\u2019s internal systems, it became clear that the company had won a contract for Project Maven and that workers were creating something for the Defense Department, the people said. One engineer quit the project immediately after a meeting with the Defense Department where killing was discussed in frank terms, they said.A Clarifai spokesman said that at the very beginning of the project, the company sat down with those chosen for it to brief them on the nature of the work, and one employee quit the project then. \u201cEvery member of Clarifai\u2019s Project Maven team agreed to work on the project, and the two people who chose not to participate were assigned to different efforts across the company,\u201d the spokesman said.Dr. Poulson, whose work involved incorporating a variety of languages into Google search, said he did not initially think his research could be involved in Dragonfly \u2014 until he noticed Chinese had been added to a list of languages for his project.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know the holistic scope of what they\u2019re building,\u201d said Dr. Poulson, 32, who worked at Google for over two years. \u201cYou don\u2019t have knowledge of where it\u2019s going unless you\u2019re sufficiently senior.\u201dThe difficulties of knowing what companies are doing with technologies is compounded because engineers at large tech companies often build infrastructure \u2014 like algorithms, databases and even hardware \u2014 that underpins almost every product a company offers. At Google, for example, a storage system called Colossus is used by Google search, Google Maps and Gmail.\u201cIt would be very difficult for most engineers in Google to be sure that their work wouldn\u2019t contribute to these projects in some way,\u201d said Ms. Nolan, who helped to keep Google\u2019s systems running online smoothly. \u201cMy personal feeling was that if the organization is doing something I find ethically unacceptable, then I was contributing to it.\u201dYet executives at tech companies have claimed that complete transparency is not possible.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had confidential projects as a company. I think what happened when the company was smaller, you had a higher chance of knowing about it,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said at a staff meeting in August, according to a transcript provided to The New York Times. \u201cI think there are a lot of times when people are in exploratory stages where teams are debating and doing things, so sometimes being fully transparent at that stage can cause issues.\u201d\u201cWe are students opposed to the weaponization of technology by companies like Google and Microsoft,\u201d the pledge stated. \u201cOur dream is to be a positive force in the world. We refuse to be complicit in this gross misuse of power.\u201dAlex Ahmed, a doctoral candidate in computer science at Northeastern University in Boston, said she organized a student discussion on campus this month to debate whether they should work for tech companies that made decisions they believed to be unethical.\u201cWe\u2019re not given an ethics course. We\u2019re not given a political education,\u201d Ms. Ahmed, 29, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to do this unless we create the conversations for ourselves.\u201dOver the summer, she said, students at Northeastern also protested the school\u2019s multimillion-dollar research contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under which it would provide research on technology exports to the agency. A Northeastern spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Bridget Frey, the chief technology officer at the online real estate company Redfin, said job candidates had increasingly raised ethical questions in interviews. This summer, interns questioned Redfin\u2019s chief executive, Glenn Kelman, about whether the way the site displays school information and test scores could contribute to socio-economic divides in neighborhoods. In response, the company said it planned to add more context about the test score information early next year.Employees are now frequently asking, \u201cIf you don\u2019t share the information with me, how can I make sure this isn\u2019t happening here?\u201d Ms. Frey said.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the real estate company Redfin\u2019s addition of context to school test score information it publishes online. It plans to add that context early next year; it has not already added it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple News\u2019s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.One morning in late August, Apple News\u2019s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company\u2019s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\u201cWe put so much care and thought into our curation,\u201d said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.\u201dThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.Their work has complicated the debate about whether Silicon Valley giants are media or technology companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter have long insisted they are tech entities and not arbiters of the truth. The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and others have bet heavily on artificial intelligence to help them sort through false news and fact-based information. Yet Apple has unabashedly gone the other direction with its human-led approach, showing that a more media-like sensibility may be able to coexist within a technology company.Apple\u2019s strategy is risky. While the company has long used people to curate its App Store, the news is far more contentious. The famously secretive company has also provided little transparency on who is picking the stories for Apple News and how those people avoid bias.For the first time recently \u2014 and after extensive negotiations on the terms of the interviews \u2014 Apple agreed to let a Times reporter in on how it operates Apple News.There are ambitious plans for the product. Apple lets publishers run ads in its app and it helps some sign up new subscribers, taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Soon, the company aims to bundle access to dozens of magazines in its app for a flat monthly fee, sort of like Netflix for news, according to people familiar with the plans, who declined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Apple also hopes to package access to a few daily-news publications, like The Times, The Post and The Wall Street Journal, into the app, the people said.Apple\u2019s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. \u201cThere is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,\u201d Ms. Kern said.But there are early signs that Apple is not the industry\u2019s savior. Many publishers have made little on ads in Apple News, and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of subscriptions it helps sell does not help. Having experienced Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s disruption of their industry, many publications are wary of Apple, according to conversations with executives from nine news organizations, many of whom declined to comment on the record for fear of upsetting the trillion-dollar corporation. Some were optimistic that Apple could be a better partner than other tech giants, but were leery of making the company the portal to their readers.\u201cWhat Apple giveth, Apple can taketh away,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Journal, Bloomberg and other publications. Once readers are trained to get their news from Apple, he said, news organizations will realize: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of Apple.\u201dFor decades, newspapers had one of industry\u2019s most direct relationships with customers: Broadsheets and tabloids reported the news, printed it and delivered it to your door.Then the internet arrived, and Google and Facebook became the middlemen between publishers and their readers, while leveraging that position to dominate digital advertising and decimate newspapers\u2019 advertising business model.The rise of Google and Facebook in news was partly driven by algorithms that provided enormous scale, enabling them to surface millions of articles from thousands of sources to their billions of users. The algorithms were largely designed to keep users engaged and clicking, meaning they tended to promote posts that drew clicks and shares, which often meant the sensational. That elevated fringe and partisan sites that produced intentionally misleading, highly partisan or downright false content.(A Google spokeswoman said the company aimed to avoid misinformation by screening publishers before letting them into Google News. She added that Google this year began helping news organizations sell subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company helps publishers reach more readers, earn ad revenue and sell subscriptions. She said Facebook\u2019s algorithm recently decreased the visibility of pages that share clickbait.)Into that environment came Apple. In late 2015, the iPhone maker released a free news app to match users with publications they liked. People selected their interests and favorite publications, and the app returned a feed of relevant stories.The announcement attracted little fanfare. Three months later, Apple announced an unusual new feature: humans would pick the app\u2019s top stories, not algorithms.Apple said it remained convinced of the benefits of people.\u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s chief of apps and Ms. Kern\u2019s boss, said about Apple News. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to let it be a total crazy land.\u201dTo create its newsroom, Apple needed journalists. Starting in 2015, it poached editors from The Times, The Journal, CNN and Bleacher Report, among other publications. To lead them all, an Apple recruiter found Ms. Kern, a rising star in the New York magazine world.\u201cYou don\u2019t generally have the whole package, but she did,\u201d Adam Moss, New York Magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said of Ms. Kern\u2019s news judgment, story ideas and work ethic.Last year, Mr. Moss said, Ms. Kern came into his office with the news that Apple had approached her about a job.\u201cI said to her, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Moss. \u201cWith the literary skills and the artistic skills Lauren had, to go into a company that was really dominated by engineers was a recipe for enormous frustration.\u201dMs. Kern said it was an opportunity to help journalism from the other side. Going to tech also came with a raise; she would not say how much. She moved from Brooklyn to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes, where she bought a car for the first time in 13 years, a golden retriever named Leo for her son, and a spacious house with chicken coops in the back. (She plans to leave the coops empty.)In interviews, Ms. Kern was lighthearted but matter of fact. Friends and former colleagues described her as fiercely dedicated to two things: her son and her job.\u201cShe has an executive\u2019s brain. Most places I work, journalists are such poor managers,\u201d said Noreen Malone, a former colleague at New York Magazine. \u201cIt was always clear Lauren was going to run something.\u201dNow Ms. Kern leads roughly 30 former journalists in Sydney, London, New York and Silicon Valley. They spend their days consuming news across the internet, fielding 100 to 200 pitches a day from publishers, and debating which stories get the top spots.Ultimately, they select five stories to lead the app, with the top two also displayed in a prominent window to the left of the iPhone home screen. They also curate a magazine-style section of feature stories. The lineup typically shifts five or more times a day, depending on the news. A single editor in London typically chooses the first mix of stories for the East Coast\u2019s morning commute before editors in New York and then Cupertino step in.Ms. Kern said she and her team did not run the story because they didn\u2019t trust it. Why? It\u2019s not a formula that can be baked into an algorithm, she said.\u201cI mean, you read a story and it doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test,\u201d she said.Ms. Kern criticized the argument that algorithms are the sole way to avoid prejudice because bias can be baked into the algorithm\u2019s code, such as whether it labels news organizations liberal or conservative. She argued that humans \u2014 with all their biases \u2014 are the only way to avoid bias.\u201cWe\u2019re so much more subtly following the news cycle and what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only legitimate way to do it at this point.\u201dApple executives said they are convinced that Apple News is not only a cure for the ills of how people consume news in the internet era, but also a lifeline for journalism \u2014 and democracy.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tim said we have a responsibility to help the news industry,\u201d said Mr. Rosner, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to democracy.\u201dIn actual newsrooms, there is skepticism that a tech giant will rescue the industry.Daniel Hallac, chief product officer for New York Magazine, said traffic from Apple News has doubled since December to now account for nearly 12 percent of visits to the magazine\u2019s website. Traffic from Facebook has dropped about a third, to 8 percent of visits, while Google\u2019s share has increased slightly to nearly half of the site\u2019s traffic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Apple News,\u201d he said.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees its services push, said publishers can run their own ads alongside their stories in Apple News and keep all of the revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d he said. He noted most major publishers take advantage of that feature. Apple also places ads for publishers for a 30 percent cut.But news publishers said selling ads for Apple News is complicated, and that advertisers\u2019 interest was limited because of the lack of customer data. Slate also attributed its issues to minuscule revenue from the ads Apple placed. Apple recently made it easier for publishers to place their own ads, but Mr. Cue conceded Apple is not terribly good \u2014 or interested \u2014 in advertising.Another potential issue is that Apple News mostly helps a small coterie of publishers. In July, Florida\u2019s largest newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times, received 79 percent of its outside web traffic from Google and 20 percent from Facebook, said Conan Gallaty, the paper\u2019s digital chief. Apple accounted for 1 percent, he said.\u201cOf the major three \u2014 Facebook, Google and Apple \u2014 Apple probably kept the furthest distance in engaging with regional and local publishers,\u201d he said.Mr. Cue said Apple is most interested in helping publishers sell subscriptions. Apple News now enables people to subscribe at the tap of a finger, leveraging many iPhone owners\u2019 preloaded credit cards.But there is concern here, too. Apple nabs 30 percent of subscription revenues the first year and 15 percent each subsequent year. In contrast, Google takes a 5 percent cut; Facebook takes nothing. Apple also owns the customer relationship, unlike Google or Facebook, refusing to pass along even subscribers\u2019 email addresses.Given those terms, some news executives said Apple News could cannibalize future subscribers, leaving news organizations with less revenue and less data per customer.Mr. Cue said Apple primarily delivers customers who wouldn\u2019t have subscribed otherwise and that its revenue share was \u201ca relatively small cut,\u201d in part to offset its costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge moneymaking business,\u201d he said.In April, Apple bought Texture, an app that lets readers pay $10 a month for access to about 200 magazines. It now plans to incorporate the service into Apple News, drastically expanding its reach, according to people familiar with its plans.Given Apple\u2019s ambitions and growing team of former journalists, will it ever start producing the news and not just aggregating it?\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future plans, but that\u2019s certainly not what we set out to do,\u201d said Mr. Rosner.So there\u2019s a chance?\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Keystone Problem: \u2018A Monoculture of Thought\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe book is no tell-all cri de coeur against Google; Ms. Powell still regards the search company with fondness, and she notes that her book was inspired as much by an earlier, harrowing experience she had at Badoo, a European dating start-up where she was the chief marketing officer.It\u2019s the essentially true bit that gets attention. While the events in Ms. Powell\u2019s satire are purposefully and hilariously over the top \u2014 a major plot point involves a moon colony \u2014 her diagnosis of Silicon Valley\u2019s cultural stagnancy is so spot on that it\u2019s barely contestable.Broadly, Ms. Powell suggests that many of Silicon Valley\u2019s problems can be laid at the feet of an engineering-and-data-obsessed monoculture that invites little input from people outside the bubble.Yet through fiction, Ms. Powell illuminates the persistence and pervasiveness of the male-dominated tech bubble in a way that is difficult to appreciate in a parade of headlines about industry scandals.Ms. Powell smartly recognizes a truth that many in the industry elide: A lack of diversity is not just one of several issues for Silicon Valley to fix, but is instead the keystone problem \u2014 the source of much else that ails tech, from its recklessly expansionist zeal to the ways its brightest companies keep stepping in problems of their own making.In short, Silicon Valley\u2019s problem is sameness, stupid \u2014 and in Ms. Powell\u2019s telling, we are not going to get a better, more responsible tech industry until we get a more intellectually diverse one.\u201cI don\u2019t think that everyone has an equal voice,\u201d Ms. Powell said in an interview. \u201cEven putting aside broader issues around gender diversity, ethnic diversity or class diversity, there\u2019s also an issue around people\u2019s educational backgrounds. If you have a hierarchy where engineers are at the very top and the people who are interfacing with the outside world are a couple rungs below that, you really miss something when those people don\u2019t have an equal voice at the table.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a monoculture of thought, and that\u2019s a real problem.\u201dGoogle declined to comment on Ms. Powell\u2019s book. Badoo did not respond to an inquiry.Ms. Powell began writing \u201cThe Big Disruption\u201d in 2012, as she was moving from Badoo back to Google, where she had worked earlier as a contractor. Her fictional company, Anahata, is something of an amalgam of the two. Like Google, Anahata made it big as a search engine, but now it has a hand in every tech pot, from social media to artificial intelligence to Genie, an app that predicts the future.Like Larry Page \u2014 one of Google\u2019s founders and now the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet \u2014 Anahata\u2019s founder, Bobby Bonilla, is painfully awkward. He prefers to hold meetings in the men\u2019s room, and speaks in big-picture riddles that confuse his underlings.And like Google and every other tech giant, Anahata\u2019s executives and employees feel crushed by the daily threat of obsolescence. A nimbler start-up called Galt keeps poaching Anahata\u2019s employees and beating it to new technologies.It is in their pursuit of Galt that all at Anahata seem to lose sight of the outside world. They grow reckless with their power, blind to their effect on anything beyond tech, and they systematically sideline any voices that counsel some new and less obviously idiotic path.\u201cI think we ascribe far too much mal-intent to large companies, like they wake up every morning thinking they want to be overlords in this Darth Vadery way,\u201d Ms. Powell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s much more a base, ego-driven desire to be the biggest and the best.\u201dShe described the dynamic as a constant jockeying for position within an industry that talks only to itself. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of looking at what your competitors are doing \u2014 you have A.I., I have A.I. You have a drone, I have a drone,\u201d she said.And once in that loop, it can be impossible to break out of Silicon Valley\u2019s viscously insular ways of thinking.There are no women of importance in Anahata\u2019s ranks, and the company exploits its few female employees in ways that make Uber look good in comparison. Still, the only female character in the book, a Friedan-spouting feminist, buys into the company completely. She\u2019s happy to paper over Anahata\u2019s problems by offering some high-minded, fanciful justification for terrible behavior today \u2014 because to get ahead in tech is to join the cult.Ultimately, it was the cultishness that got to Ms. Powell, too.\u201cThe debate around that \u2014 what is our responsibility? \u2014 was building, and I didn\u2019t always feel we had enough urgency,\u201d she said. (Google has said that it has poured resources into fixing this issue.)More than for any particular controversy, Ms. Powell said, she left Google for a reason that resonates with the primary theme of her novel \u2014 because of the industry\u2019s dreary sameness.Every morning, she rode a fancy shuttle bus to Google\u2019s offices, where she was lavished with food and other perks and encouraged never to leave \u2014 and to work to exhaustion, if not burnout.\u201cI felt like I\u2019d ceased to become anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I did was work all the time and talk about tech.\u201d She concluded that a job that asked her to jump from crisis to crisis, that did not admit time or perspective to consider many ideas that were outside its small world, was not the best use of her time.Ms. Powell does not have any easy or obvious ideas for how to address tech\u2019s monoculture. She thinks of her book as starting a conversation. But any solution, she said, will involve \u201ca fundamental, bottoms-up cultural change\u201d \u2014 and one that we should not expect to see overnight.\u201cBig ideas should be simple. Napkinable,\u201d one of the Anahata executives declares in the book.Fixing tech will be anything but.An earlier version of this column misspelled the name of the fictional company in Jessica Powell\u2019s novel. It is Anahata, not Anahanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner Go \u2018Camping\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The outdoors, even the fake outdoors, may not seem like the place you\u2019d expect to find Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner, otherwise known as the duo behind the Brooklyn-chic millennial comedy \u201cGirls.\u201dYet one morning in June here they were, offering a tour of the Hollywood soundstage where the cast and crew of \u201cCamping,\u201d their new HBO limited series that begins airing on Sunday, had retreated after a stint filming in the heat and dust of a nearby movie ranch.They stepped past a white canvas tent and into a recreated barn, where Ms. Konner pulled out her phone to show off a cache of photos of the on-location snake wrangler\u2019s daily haul of would-be invaders.\u201cWe called it Snake of the Day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would try to get him to send them to the other show shooting nearby.\u201dO.K., so they may not be the campingest kind. But the show, which will unfold over eight half-hour episodes, is less about camping than about what happens when camping goes wrong.Jennifer Garner stars as a hypercontrolling L.A. mom giving her husband a backwoods birthday weekend that spirals into a chaos of BB-gun mishaps, accidental drug trips, an outhouse-related crisis and old grudges among female friends with challenging personalities (sound familiar?) that blossom into what the two creators call full-blown \u201cwomen-on-women crime.\u201dIf anyone is looking for an offscreen analogue to the show\u2019s catfights, the two women, speaking separately by telephone last month, described more of a conscious uncoupling.\u201cIt was sort of a slow burn,\u201d Ms. Konner said, when asked what had precipitated the split. \u201cWe just wanted to go in different directions. I think we\u2019re not sure what they are, but we want to find our independence.\u201d\u201cCamping\u201d shares some obvious DNA with \u201cGirls,\u201d starting with its core of four complicated women navigating the crosscurrents of friendship and hateship. In conversation, Ms. Konner and Ms. Dunham seemed eager to both embrace the parallels and shake them off a bit.Asked about the tone they were going for, Ms. Konner, 47, reached for a different generational reference point. \u201cIn our dreams, it\u2019s \u2018The Big Chill,\u2019\u201d she said.She passed the word on \u201cCamping\u201d to Ms. Konner, who was similarly smitten. \u201cFirst of all, I just thought it was hilarious,\u201d Ms. Konner, who directed the first two episodes, said. \u201cIt also just seemed like such a natural limited series. You have the whole wide world of camping, but it\u2019s also so claustrophobic.\u201dThe show \u2014 while warmer, sunnier and L.A.-glammier \u2014 largely follows the narrative beats of the original, and keeps versions of the central characters, including Kathryn\u2019s beleaguered husband (David Tennant), her spacey sister (Ione Skye) and a free-spirited (and very horny) reiki healer-slash-D.J.-slash-accountant (Juliette Lewis).Asked about that controversy, Ms. Konner said, \u201cWe like to think we heard people the first season and got better and better.\u201dEarly on, there were conversations about a role for Ms. Dunham, who hadn\u2019t acted onscreen since a cameo on \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d last October. It was ultimately decided that she was too young, but she wrote her own experience into it, in the form of Ms. Garner\u2019s character\u2019s gynecological problems, which are recited in operatic detail.\u201cIf anyone has said \u2018uterus\u2019 more on television, I would be shocked,\u201d Ms. Dunham said. \u201cI kept saying to Jennifer, \u2018If there\u2019s anything you need to know about your uterus, just ask.\u2019 She was like, \u2018I\u2019m good, I can Google!\u2019\u201dMs. Dunham and Ms. Konner\u2019s creative split may have lent an elegiac overtone to the show. But on set in June, during a joint interview in their sparsely decorated shared office, Ms. Konner talked about trying to find projects that would allow Ms. Dunham (who directed 19 episodes of \u201cGirls,\u201d in addition to starring in it) to delegate more.Ms. Dunham, wrapped in a bulky sweater coat (\u201cI stole it from Jenni,\u201d she said), talked about the desire to have \u201ca more sustainable life,\u201d and figuring out \u201chow to be Ryan Murphy.\u201dAsked what they fought about, they suggested, after a pause, food.\u201cWe also disagree about tattoos,\u201d Ms. Dunham added, pulling up her sleeve to show off a recently acquired constellation of good luck symbols \u2014 a crystal, the number 13 (her birth date) \u2014 sprinkled across her wrist.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound great when I say it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut after everything I\u2019ve dealt with \u2014 in the public eye, with my body, personally \u2014 I\u2019m about to embark on period of creative selfishness, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important for me to do.\u201dAs for onscreen conflict, \u201cCamping\u201d certainly delivers. Ms. Lewis, speaking by telephone, recalled the crazed \u201cDon Knotts scream\u201d she lets loose in an early campfire scene, like the opening bell of her escalating assault on Kathryn\u2019s overly well-laid plans.\u201cJenni and Lena were so confident about what they were looking for that they gave you freedom to play,\u201d she said.Ms. Garner, who is playing her first television role since \u201cAlias\u201d ended 12 years ago, described a friendly, collaborative set, if one where she was perhaps the only gung-ho natural-born camper: She led the cast in calisthenics and brought gifts of home-baked blueberry buckle and honey from her own beehives.When the prospect of the role surfaced, she watched the original show, which she called \u201csearingly funny and uncompromisingly, unapologetically British,\u201d and hesitated.\u201cI thought, I can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She said she was \u201cin awe of the courage\u201d of Ms. Davis and of Vicki Pepperdine, who played a far more grim-faced version of her character. \u201cBut I thought if I was going to play someone that unlikable, I would need to justify it to myself,\u201d she said.Ms. Dunham and Ms. Konner\u2019s initial scripts provided the back story drawn from Ms. Dunham\u2019s own health problems, but Ms. Garner still struggled with the character\u2019s harder edges.\u201cThere were lots of moments where I naturally softened Kathryn, and they were saying, \u2018No, you\u2019re not allowed to tear up \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed to even think about it, that\u2019s not where she is,\u2019\u201d she said.For Ms. Dunham, the show\u2019s appeal, for all its darker undercurrents, is in its lunatic energy, and its opportunity, as she put it, \u201cfor women to act their butts off.\u201d\u201cThis is a good time in history to do something with a lot of joy in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we all could use that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In recent years, the tech industry\u2019s largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There\u2019s just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.The industry\u2019s new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets \u2014 these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting \u201csmart.\u201d Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend \u2014 known by the marketing catchphrase \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung.Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities.

Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet.\u201cI can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,\u201d he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. \u201cIn our government-can\u2019t-do-anything-ever society, I don\u2019t see any reining in of the corporate trends,\u201d he said.At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a \u201csmart\u201d fan using Amazon\u2019s chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan\u2019s control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code \u2014 in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code.And that\u2019s it. The fan\u2019s digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in.This system illustrates Mr. Schneier\u2019s larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet.Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don\u2019t connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do.The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don\u2019t often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple\u2019s brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors.The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry.Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason techies don\u2019t like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn\u2019t a terrible idea.Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast. Why not go slowly into the uncertain future?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google to Charge Phone Makers for Android Apps in Europe", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Google has always made its Android mobile operating system available free as a way of getting its search engine, web browser and other applications on as many devices as possible to collect data about users and to sell advertising.But on Tuesday, in response to a European antitrust ruling this year, the company said it would for the first time begin charging handset manufacturers to install Gmail, Google Maps and other popular applications for Android in the European Union.The new arrangement is the latest sign that global technology companies are adjusting their business practices in Europe to account for stiffer regulations there.By obligating handset makers to load the free apps along with the Android operating system, regulators said, Google had boxed out competitors. With the company now required to separate its services in Europe, handset manufacturers like Samsung and Huawei will now have more flexibility there to choose what applications they want to pre-install on phones.Google said it would sell a license for a package including its Google Play app store, Gmail, YouTube and Maps. Another license will be available for companies that want to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser, allowing handset makers to team up with rival services. The company did not say how much it would charge for the licenses.The European Commission had allowed Google to come up with its own ways for complying with the decision, putting pressure on regulators to ensure that the company met its obligations. Google already faces accusations that is has not complied with an earlier antitrust ruling over its unfair favoring of its own search results.The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.Android is the world\u2019s most widely used mobile operating system, powering more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. Google said that more than 24,000 different kinds of devices run the software. Using Android has allowed companies like Samsung to compete against Apple\u2019s iPhone without having to make their own software.In providing Android free to any device maker to use and modify, Google helped make the software available everywhere \u2014 in phones, tablets, cars and refrigerators. But the company tied the use of the popular Play store, where customers can download more than one million apps made by outside developers, to requirements that device makers feature other, ad-driven services like Google\u2019s search engine and web browser.Some handset makers argued to European regulators that Google\u2019s terms made it impossible for them to create devices less dependent on the search giant\u2019s applications. Those companies will now have more freedom to offer alternate services without facing consequences from Google.\u201cAndroid phone makers wishing to distribute Google apps may now also build noncompatible, or forked, smartphones and tablets\u201d in Europe, Google said in a statement. \u201cThey will also be able to license Google Play separately from Search and Chrome, with full freedom to install rival apps as before.\u201dGoogle declined to say what the financial impact of the changes would be, and it said the license fees were needed to make up for any lost ad revenue. But the company could make money from handset makers that choose to use its applications, and it will collect the licensing fees and the advertising revenue when its services are used.Google also plans to offer financial incentives to companies that continue featuring its search engine and browser, potentially giving the company an advantage over rivals.Samsung and Huawei, two of the largest makers of Android phones sold in Europe, had no immediate comment.The Android changes may not be permanent. Google is appealing the European Commission\u2019s decision, a process that could drag on for years. If the company prevails, it could revert to bundling its free services.Europe has become the world\u2019s toughest watchdog over the global technology industry. Once seen as overly aggressive, policies in the region are now influencing other countries to take a tougher approach. In the United States, where the tech industry has enjoyed little regulation, members of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are speaking more favorably of stricter oversight of online platforms like Facebook and Google.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Polymath Author With More Ideas Than He Can Handle", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A little pruning would have helped. The only point of opening an essay collection is to spend some time with an interesting mind, and Joshua Cohen \u2014 novelist, journalist, critic; prodigy, polyglot, polymath \u2014 has one of the most interesting minds in circulation. But half as long would have been twice as good. A miscellany masquerading as a major statement, \u201cAttention: Dispatches From a Land of Distraction\u201d gives us sketches, musings, diaristic fragments, cultural criticism, reportage \u2014 politics, literature, music, travel; Trump, Barnum, Zizek, the internet \u2014 all capped by a titular history (of sorts) that weighs in at novella length.There is a certain logic to the volume\u2019s larger structure, though. As we move from a section called \u201cHome\u201d to one called \u201cAbroad\u201d and on to \u201cDreamlands,\u201d Cohen becomes not less in tune with his environment but more so. \u201cHome\u201d is the America of Thomas Pynchon, 9/11, Edward Snowden, Trump: the tyranny of normalcy, the normalization of tyranny. Cohen, born in 1980 and the product of a Hebrew day school, has laid claim to a place within the lengthening lineage of Jewish American writers. Yet the Jewish encounter with America, which may be described as a very old mind making contact with a very new civilization, can go in two directions. Figures like Philip Roth, Alfred Kazin and the younger Saul Bellow embraced American society in all its cacophonous energy. Those like Lionel Trilling, Susan Sontag and the older Saul Bellow recoiled in fastidious repugnance from its vulgar materialism and anti-intellectualism, turning back to Europe \u2014 or rather, upward, to European high culture \u2014 for refuge.Cohen pitches his tent in the second camp. An intensely bookish young man who passed his post-collegiate years in Central and Eastern Europe as a correspondent for The Jewish Daily Forward, Cohen affects a personal style, to judge from photographs \u2014 round-rimmed glasses, melancholy gaze \u2014 of a Russian Jewish intellectual circa 1910. His spiritual mood, marked by a sardonic cultural pessimism, is suited to match. Cohen is most at home, and \u201cAttention\u201d is at its best, in \u201cAbroad.\u201d The section is heavy on literary criticism, the mode in which he goes deepest, because he goes slowest, and in which he is able to bring his learning, as well as his artistic experience, most fully to bear. There are actual arguments here, often brilliant ones, on the Holocaust writer H. G. Adler; the Czech novelist and raconteur Bohumil Hrabal; the French experimentalist and Oulipian Georges Perec, a collateral descendant of the Yiddish literary giant I. L. Peretz; as well as on Mahler, Shakespeare, Vargas Llosa and others. The interpolated notebook entries, meanwhile, adumbrate a serpentine journey through Poland, Budapest, Belgrade, Croatia, Odessa, Sofia and Bucharest. Cohen is working his way through, and laying claim to, a personal imaginative geography.A movement back, it is also, as the name of the following section makes clear, a movement in. Cohen\u2019s \u201cDreamlands\u201d are, most prominently, Jewlands. There are the \u201cMountain Jews\u201d of Azerbaijan, a closed society of semilegendary origin. There is the Hasidic tradition, with its Zenlike parables and wisdom-working rabbis. There is, at last, that waking dream turned waking nightmare, Israel. It is no coincidence that Cohen\u2019s itinerary in \u201cAbroad\u201d \u2014 drawn, evidently, from his years with The Forward, where his editor referred to him as the \u201cDead Jews correspondent\u201d \u2014 takes him through the Ashkenazi heartland. The experience became a basis for \u201cWitz\u201d (2010), Cohen\u2019s most ambitious book, an epic satire of Jewish American Holocaust kitsch. In \u201cAttention,\u201d as in his most recent novel, \u201cMoving Kings\u201d (2017), he takes aim at the Zionist project. If the middle pillars of Jewish American identity are Auschwitz and Israel, sainted victims and glamorized warriors, Cohen gives them both a mighty push. His solipsistic immaturity can sometimes bother me, but his truculent bravery often delights me.William Deresiewicz\u2019s most recent book is \u201cExcellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Project Baseline Aims to Ward Off Illness Before We Get Sick", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers are recruiting 10,000 volunteers to discover the earliest warning signs of cancer, heart disease and other killers.\u201cIn the cancer field we often find problems long after people have symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rarely find things early.\u201dMany of the people joining the study are healthy adults, which differs from traditional medical trials that focus largely on people who are already ill. Another key difference is that the researchers are collecting a staggering amount of medical data on their subjects: analyzing their microbiomes, sequencing their genomes, subjecting them to a variety of scans and assessing their cognitive health. They are also equipping volunteers with new wearable technology from Verily that records their nightly sleep patterns and tracks their heart rhythms and physical activity.In another unusual move, the Project Baseline investigators are sharing the research results with their subjects, everything from how much plaque or calcium they find in their arteries to which bacterial strains inhabit their guts. Some experts worry, however, that providing such detailed medical data to healthy adults could lead to new problems. Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute in California, cautioned that the sheer amount of testing, scans and other \u201cdeep interrogations\u201d could produce incidental findings that cause unnecessary anxiety. \u201cSometimes it leads to unwarranted further testing that could even be harmful,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is the new challenge in a democratized world of medical research,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cI\u2019m really in favor of it, but it sets up this new issue of dealing with unexpected results that are difficult to interpret.\u201dThe Project Baseline researchers are learning this firsthand. They say they have discovered and promptly alerted participants to potentially lethal conditions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, like cancer and aortic aneurysms, so they can seek appropriate medical care. But some of the participants have also been frightened by fairly innocuous findings, like chest X-rays that reveal small, usually benign nodules in their lungs that they may look up on the internet and think are cancerous, said Dr. Charlene Wong, a Project Baseline investigator. \u201cFor most of our participants, it will not be cancer. But we\u2019re still in the process of working with participants to find out if we can return that data in the right way so that we minimize the anxiety it can cause,\u201d she said.Dr. Ken Mahaffey, a Project Baseline investigator and cardiologist at Stanford, said that he and his colleagues have \u201ca responsibility, socially, morally and ethically, to get systems in place so we can share the results with participants in ways that they can understand them and then help them engage with their own physicians and clinical providers.\u201dDespite the anxiety it can cause, many people welcome such data. Studies like Project Baseline are especially appealing to the so-called Quantified Self movement, the growing community of people who track their every biometric with smartphone apps, high-tech gadgets and direct-to-consumer health tests. Some 2,000 people have enrolled in Project Baseline so far, and thousands more have signed up in a registry of potential volunteers who may be called on as the project expands to additional medical centers. While there have been plenty of longitudinal studies in the past, many of the largest and most important were not very diverse. The landmark Framingham heart study that began in 1948, for example, focused mostly on white adults. Dr. Svati Shah, an associate professor of medicine at Duke, said Project Baseline is recruiting many people who are black, Hispanic, Asian and other ethnicities so the study can shed light on differences in disease risk factors among people of different backgrounds.That includes people like Rosa Gonzalez, 57, a nurse who lives in Concord, N.C. Ms. Gonzalez, who is Mexican-American, joined the study earlier this year and has encouraged at least a dozen Latino friends and acquaintances to join it as well. \u201cOther studies present data and talk about Latinos, but they don\u2019t have Latinos in the study,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to set an example so other Latinos see that it\u2019s good to take part so that we can have data that shows how we\u2019re the same or different.\u201dDr. Gambhir said the idea for Project Baseline was hatched in 2013, when Google executives approached him and said they wanted to do a landmark study on human health. Dr. Gambhir proposed a study to find early markers of cancer in people who are otherwise healthy. \u201cWe have always thought that if we learn more about what your body is doing before you become ill, then we would have a much better chance of ideally preventing or at least detecting things early,\u201d he said. Google liked the idea but suggested broadening the scope to include other diseases.Verily declined to say how much it is spending on Project Baseline. But the company is investing in several areas of health care, including the development of contact lenses and miniature sensors that monitor blood sugar levels so patients with diabetes can better manage their disease. In addition to sharing results with study volunteers, Project Baseline is hosting events and webinars in which study participants can ask the researchers questions and give them suggestions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t research that\u2019s happening in a black box,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cPeople on the ground are part of this movement.\u201dWondering what you should be wondering about in terms of your health?

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The public knows about each of these incitements because of reporting by news organizations. Social media misinformation is becoming a newsroom beat in and of itself, as journalists find themselves acting as unpaid content moderators for these platforms.The internet platforms will always make some mistakes, and it\u2019s not fair to expect otherwise. And the task before Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and others is admittedly herculean. No one can screen everything in the fire hose of content produced by users.

The officials said they were doing so not to undermine Mr. Trump, but out of frustration with what they considered the president\u2019s casual approach to electronic security.American spy agencies, the officials said, had learned that China and Russia were eavesdropping on the president\u2019s cellphone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepting communications between foreign officials.On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said this article was \u201csoooo wrong!\u201d and asserted that he used only government phones and \u201conly one seldom used government cell phone.\u201d He did not claim there were other factual errors in The New York Times\u2019 reporting.The current and former officials said they have also determined that China is seeking to use what it is learning from the calls \u2014 how Mr. Trump thinks, what arguments tend to sway him and to whom he is inclined to listen \u2014 to keep a trade war with the United States from escalating further. In what amounts to a marriage of lobbying and espionage, the Chinese have pieced together a list of the people with whom Mr. Trump regularly speaks in hopes of using them to influence the president, the officials said.The Chinese have identified friends of both men and others among the president\u2019s regulars, and are now relying on Chinese businessmen and others with ties to Beijing to feed arguments to the friends of the Trump friends. The strategy is that those people will pass on what they are hearing, and that Beijing\u2019s views will eventually be delivered to the president by trusted voices, the officials said. They added that the Trump friends were most likely unaware of any Chinese effort.L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Mr. Wynn, said his client was retired and had no comment. A spokeswoman for Blackstone, Christine Anderson, declined to comment on Chinese efforts to influence Mr. Schwarzman, but said that he \u201chas been happy to serve as an intermediary on certain critical matters between the two countries at the request of both heads of state.\u201dRussia is not believed to be running as sophisticated an influence effort as China because of Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent affinity for President Vladimir V. Putin, a former official said.China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Trump friends like Mr. Schwarzman, who figured prominently in the first meeting between President Xi Jinping of China and Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida resort, already hold pro-China and pro-trade views, and thus are ideal targets in the eyes of the Chinese, the officials said. Targeting the friends of Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Wynn can reinforce the views of the two, the officials said. The friends are also most likely to be more accessible.One official said the Chinese were pushing for the friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with Mr. Xi as often as possible. The Chinese, the official said, correctly perceive that Mr. Trump places tremendous value on personal relationships, and that one-on-one meetings yield breakthroughs far more often than regular contacts between Chinese and American officials.Whether the friends can stop Mr. Trump from pursuing a trade war with China is another question.Officials said the president has two official iPhones that have been altered by the National Security Agency to limit their abilities \u2014 and vulnerabilities \u2014 and a third personal phone that is no different from hundreds of millions of iPhones in use around the world. Mr. Trump keeps the personal phone, White House officials said, because unlike his other two phones, he can store his contacts in it.Apple declined to comment on the president\u2019s iPhones. None of them are completely secure and are vulnerable to hackers who could remotely break into the phones themselves.But the calls made from the phones are intercepted as they travel through the cell towers, cables and switches that make up national and international cellphone networks. Calls made from any cellphone \u2014 iPhone, Android, an old-school Samsung flip phone \u2014 are vulnerable.The issue of secure communications is fraught for Mr. Trump. As a presidential candidate, he regularly attacked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 campaign for her use of an unsecured email server while she was secretary of state, and he basked in chants of \u201clock her up\u201d at his rallies.Foreign governments are well aware of the risk, and so leaders like Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin avoid using cellphones when possible.President Barack Obama was careful with cellphones, too. He used an iPhone in his second term, but it could not make calls and could receive email only from a special address that was given to a select group of staff members and intimates. It had no camera or microphone, and it could not be used to download apps at will. Texting was forbidden because there was no way to collect and store the messages, as required by the Presidential Records Act.\u201cIt is a great phone, state of the art, but it doesn\u2019t take pictures, you can\u2019t text. The phone doesn\u2019t work, you know, you can\u2019t play your music on it,\u201d Mr. Obama said on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d in June 2016. \u201cSo basically, it\u2019s like \u2014 does your 3-year-old have one of those play phones?\u201dWhen Mr. Obama needed a cellphone, the officials said, he used one of those of his aides.Mr. Trump has insisted on more capable devices. He did agree during the transition to give up his Android phone (the Google operating system is considered more vulnerable than Apple\u2019s). And since becoming president, Mr. Trump has agreed to a slightly cumbersome arrangement of having two official phones: one for Twitter and other apps, and one for calls.Mr. Trump typically relies on his cellphones when he does not want a call going through the White House switchboard and logged for senior aides to see, his aides said. Many of those Mr. Trump speaks with most often on one of his cellphones, such as hosts at Fox News, share the president\u2019s political views, or simply enable his sense of grievance about any number of subjects.Administration officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime paranoia about surveillance \u2014 well before coming to the White House he believed that his phone conversations were often being recorded \u2014 gave them some comfort that he was not disclosing classified information on the calls. They said they had further confidence he was not spilling secrets because he rarely digs into the details of the intelligence he is shown and is not well versed in the operational specifics of military or covert activities.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of tech savvy has alleviated some other security concerns. He does not use email, so the risk of a phishing attack like those used by Russian intelligence to gain access to Democratic Party emails is close to nil. The same goes for texts, which are disabled on his official phones.His Twitter phone can connect to the internet only over a Wi-Fi connection, and he rarely, if ever, has access to unsecured wireless networks, officials said. But the security of the device ultimately depends on the user, and protecting the president\u2019s phones has sometimes proved difficult.Last year, Mr. Trump\u2019s cellphone was left behind in a golf cart at his club in Bedminster, N.J., causing a scramble to locate it, according to two people familiar with what took place.Mr. Trump is supposed to swap out his two official phones every 30 days for new ones but rarely does, bristling at the inconvenience. White House staff members are supposed to set up the new phones exactly like the old ones, but the new iPhones cannot be restored from backups of his old phones because doing so would transfer over any malware.New phone or old, though, the Chinese and the Russians are listening, and learning.Julian E.

Cruise Holdings, the two companies said Wednesday. In addition, Honda will contribute $2 billion to the project over the next 12 years.G.M. is aiming to develop a vehicle \u2014 based on its electric Chevrolet Bolt \u2014 with no steering wheel or pedals that can be used in driverless taxi and delivery services. The automaker hopes to develop the technology into a new and lucrative line of business, apart from making and selling cars and trucks for consumers.\u201cHaving the resources and capability of Honda will move us faster,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Dan Ammann, said in a conference call Wednesday.Honda\u2019s investment will give it a 5.7 percent stake in the Cruise venture. \u201cThis is a vote of confidence in G.M. and Cruise and what they are doing,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst.The announcement was made before the market opened. G.M. shares rose more than 2 percent on the day.Honda had pursued other joint efforts \u2014 it said in 2016 that it was in talks with Waymo \u2014 before making a commitment to G.M. and Cruise. \u201cHonda was going to struggle to develop their own product, so they wanted a partner and already had a relationship with G.M.,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said.Automakers are also working on self-driving technology that can be added to cars that consumers can buy to give drivers the option of relinquishing the task of steering and navigating to their destination. That type of autonomous technology is expected to take more time to reach the market, however.Rather than go at it alone, G.M. has brought on partners to help fund the project in hopes of speeding development. Earlier this year SoftBank, the Japanese tech and investment firm, invested $2.25 billion in Cruise. As part of that deal, G.M. said it would put an additional $1.1 billion of its own money into the unit, which is based in San Francisco. SoftBank\u2019s investment was made through its Vision Fund, which focuses on the technology sector.In addition to money, Honda will provide expertise in manufacturing and engineering compact vehicles, where space is at a premium.\u201cWith the backing of General Motors, SoftBank and Honda, Cruise is deeply resourced to accomplish our mission to safely deploy autonomous technology across the globe,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, chief executive of G.M. Cruise Holdings. \u201cWe want to be able to produce this car in high volume when we\u2019re ready to put it into use.\u201dG.M. and Honda remain competitors in the business of building cars, sport utility vehicles and light trucks, but have grown closer in recent years. In 2017, they began working together on a plant in Michigan to produce technology for vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells. They also cooperate in battery technology.G.M., Waymo and others are betting that driverless ride services will spread rapidly once they are able to produce vehicles that can operate with input only from sensors, software and computer chips.Waymo has made plans to buy up to 20,000 compact electric vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2019. It has also agreed to buy up to 62,000 Pacifica minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, potentially giving it a fleet of more than 80,000 driverless vehicles within three or four years. Waymo is already operating a test fleet of driverless taxis in Arizona.For now, G.M. and Waymo appear to be ahead of most competitors. Last month, Toyota agreed to invest $500 million in Uber, to help it produce self-driving vehicles. Uber\u2019s effort was set back this year when a test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz.Ford is testing a small number of self-driving cars in delivery fleets, and hopes to have a self-driving car in production by 2021.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Call for Federal Investigation of Children\u2019s Apps", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo Democratic senators are calling on federal regulators to investigate whether children\u2019s apps improperly collect personal data and whether app stores are misleading parents by labeling the apps as child-friendly.Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday saying they were concerned that thousands of apps may \u201cimproperly track children and collect their personal information.\u201dThe senators also asked the agency to examine how app stores like Google Play vet the apps they categorize as child-friendly and ensure the apps comply with the privacy law.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that many companies are violating that law,\u201d Mr. Markey said in a phone interview, \u201cand that we need to put a spotlight on it and ensure that that type of activity is stopped cold.\u201dThe Times also found programs in Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store that were labeled appropriate for children but, once downloaded, sent personal data without verifiable parental consent. Apps on the Apple platform sent less data over all.Last month, the New Mexico attorney general sued the maker of Fun Kid Racing, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies. The suit accused the companies of violating the children\u2019s privacy law. It also argued that Google misled parents by allowing the apps to remain in the children\u2019s section of its store and failed to act swiftly when researchers contacted the company with concerns that thousands of apps might be improperly tracking children.A Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said its family program \u201crequires developers\u201d to comply with the federal children\u2019s privacy law and that the company would \u201ctake action\u201d if an app was found to violate its policies.An Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, said developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children\u2019s apps.In their letter, Mr. Markey and Mr. Blumenthal asked the Federal Trade Commission to determine the extent to which app developers and their advertising partners were complying with the children\u2019s privacy law. They called on regulators to examine the kinds of personal details that apps collect from children and share with advertising companies, as well as how app developers make sure their products adhere to the law.The senators also asked the agency to scrutinize how advertising firms with policies prohibiting children\u2019s apps from using their services make sure app developers comply.This week, The Times retested one of the apps from the earlier article, Masha and the Bear, and found that the Android version continued to send precise location information and other data to tracking companies. The iOS version also still sent a tracking ID number to an advertising company, although it did not send location data.Google and Apple did not respond to specific questions about that app. In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was working on \u201csolving this problem in order to avoid committing this violation in the future.\u201dAaron Krolik contributed research.Advertisement"}

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is \u201camong the first examples of an authoritarian government\u2019s using the social network against its own people.\u201dThe Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which returned years after he had been treated for it.Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons.In a statement, Mr. Gates said that he was \u201cheartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends,\u201d adding that \u201cpersonal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dMr. Icahn said in a letter yesterday that he owns 8.3 percent of a special Dell stock that tracks the company\u2019s holdings in the publicly traded company VMware.

{"Headline": "M.I.T. Plans College for Artificial Intelligence, Backed by $1 Billion", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery major university is wrestling with how to adapt to the technology wave of artificial intelligence \u2014 how to prepare students not only to harness the powerful tools of A.I., but also to thoughtfully weigh its ethical and social implications. A.I. courses, conferences and joint majors have proliferated in the last few years.But the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is taking a particularly ambitious step, creating a new college backed by a planned investment of $1 billion. Two-thirds of the funds have already been raised, M.I.T. said, in announcing the initiative on Monday.The linchpin gift of $350 million came from Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the big private equity firm. The college, called the M.I.T. Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, will create 50 new faculty positions and many more fellowships for graduate students.It is scheduled to begin in the fall semester next year, housed in other buildings before moving into its own new space in 2022.The goal of the college, said L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., is to \u201ceducate the bilinguals of the future.\u201d He defines bilinguals as people in fields like biology, chemistry, politics, history and linguistics who are also skilled in the techniques of modern computing that can be applied to them.But, he said, \u201cto educate bilinguals, we have to create a new structure.\u201dAcademic departments still tend to be silos, Mr. Reif explained, despite interdisciplinary programs that cross the departmental boundaries. Half the 50 faculty positions will focus on advancing computer science, and the other half will be jointly appointed by the college and by other departments across M.I.T.Traditionally, departments hold sway in hiring and tenure decisions at universities. So, for example, a researcher who applied A.I.-based text analysis tools in a field like history might be regarded as too much a computer scientist by the humanities department and not sufficiently technical by the computer science department.M.I.T.\u2019s leaders hope the new college will alter traditional academic thinking and practice.\u201cWe need to rewire how we hire and promote faculty,\u201d said Martin Schmidt, the provost of M.I.T.Today, most dual-major programs involve taking courses in a computer science department in machine learning or data science in addition to a student\u2019s major. The M.I.T. college is an effort to have computing baked into the curriculum rather than stapled on. It will grant degrees, though what they will be or their names have not been determined.That appealed to Melissa Nobles, dean of M.I.T.\u2019s School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, who said she saw the new college as helping non-computer scientists bring A.I. tools to their fields \u2014 \u201cto what they really care about.\u201dThe college, Ms. Nobles said, offers the possibility of a renewal for humanities studies at M.I.T., where students flock to computer science and engineering.\u201cWe\u2019re excited by the possibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how the humanities are going to survive, not by running from the future but by embracing it.\u201dDonors, like students, are attracted more to computer science programs than to many other disciplines. But the new college at M.I.T. is designed to spread the wealth.\u201cIt\u2019s a major fund-raising mechanism that gives M.I.T. a huge resource to apply A.I. to other fields,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, who was the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and is a visiting innovation fellow at M.I.T.The college and its goals were shaped by a long-running conversation between Mr. Schwarzman, the principal donor, and Mr. Reif, the M.I.T. president. They first met in 2015 when Mr. Schwarzman was setting up the Schwarzman Scholars program, which awards scholarships for young people to gain a greater understanding of China.At the time, Mr. Schwarzman was becoming increasingly fascinated by the debate over the opportunity and challenge presented by artificial intelligence. A lengthy conversation with Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, piqued his interest, Mr. Schwarzman recalled, and he kept talking to experts and reading.\u201cI became convinced that this technology was so powerful it was really going to remake a lot of the world as we know it,\u201d he said.Over the next few years, Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Reif picked up the conversation about the trajectory of A.I. and its broad impact, when their paths crossed in places like New York and Davos, Switzerland.Over the past year, M.I.T.\u2019s leaders and faculty were brainstorming to chart a course for the university\u2019s future. The university had done individual initiatives in areas like the future of work and a research project on the human and machine intelligence.But Mr. Schwarzman urged Mr. Reif to go further, emphasizing the ethical issues raised by automated decision-making in everything from medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. He also stressed the workplace impact.\u201cWe really need to try to understand this technology, not just get hit by it,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said.Meanwhile, Mr. Reif was also focused on making a universitywide impact. His persistent question: \u201cHow do I make sure these tools are used by everyone in every discipline?\u201dThe new college structure was his answer. Mr. Schwarzman said he would be interested in contributing, and soon after, Mr. Reif made his pitch.\u201cWell, that is a big number,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said, recalling his initial reaction.After further study, he said yes.Mr. Schwarzman said he hoped that the M.I.T. move might trigger others to invest in America\u2019s A.I. future, not just commercially. He points to the major push the Chinese government is making, and notes the fruits of United States government-funded research in the past \u2014 technologies that helped America take the global lead in industries from the personal computer to the internet.\u201cI think we\u2019ve been lagging, for whatever reason,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief executive of the Blackstone Group. He is Stephen A. Schwarzman, not Steven. The error was repeated in a picture caption.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Introducing the Internet Bill of Rights", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats promise that if they win back the House, they will start regulating Silicon Valley.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. In an interview with me this week, Nancy Pelosi even suggested that a new agency could be created to manage tech\u2019s growing impact. \u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d she told me, to \u201cprotect the privacy of the American people\u201d and \u201ccome up with overarching values\u201d \u2014 a set of principles that everyone can agree on and adhere to.Call it a Bill of Rights for the internet.To set the table, let\u2019s be clear that the tech industry has long operated nearly unfettered, aided by laws that have given its major companies broad immunity and an open plain on which to operate. The goal was to foster and encourage innovation. And like the pioneers who once set out for California to make their fortune, tech companies have thrived in that regulation-free landscape.But will it be too little, too late? Consider Mr. Khanna\u2019s list of principles, which begins by stating:\u201cThe internet age and digital revolution have changed Americans\u2019 way of life. As our lives and the U.S. economy are more tied to the internet, it is essential to provide Americans with basic protections online.\u201dIn short: Horse, meet barn door.The second says consumers should have to give their permission \u2014 an \u201copt in\u201d rather than \u201copt out\u201d system \u2014 before their data can be collected and shared with third parties. I like to call it the anti-Cambridge Analytica rule.Mr. Khanna noted that this requirement must be fulfilled in a way that is not onerous \u2014 consumers shouldn\u2019t have to click on something affirming their consent every time data is collected, for example. \u201cIf you have to click on something 50 times, it kind of defeats the purpose,\u201d he said.The third principle moves into a dicier area: the right \u201cto obtain, correct, or delete personal data controlled by any company.\u201d In Europe, this idea has manifested as the controversial \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws, which wouldn\u2019t fly here. Because of First Amendment issues, and also to prevent anyone from removing information that is merely critical, Mr. Khanna added a caveat that covers a lot of sins: \u201cwhere context appropriate and with a fair process.\u201dAnd so on down the list: The fourth centers on timely notifications in the case of breaches. The fifth would give consumers the right to move their data (called data portability). The sixth calls for making net neutrality a law rather than a regulation that gets Ping-Ponged every time a new administration takes office. The seventh would hinder big internet access providers like AT&T and Verizon from collecting more data than is necessary for the rendering of services. The eighth addresses fostering competition.

Each will have slightly different formulas, and you have to constantly experiment, learn and calibrate.

It\u2019s making a piece of information more sophisticated but also simplifying it. It comes down to our audience: How can I help my colleagues around the newsroom empathize more with our readers, viewers and listeners around the world?What is your personal tech setup like?It has changed a lot over the years. Almost a decade ago, I wrote my college senior thesis on cyberwar and taught a seminar on the same subject, so I used to be hypervigilant about all of that. Then, when I was working on the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and newsletter, I had my iPhone, an Android and lots of news apps to check out their push notifications, and email apps to test how an email would be experienced and read. (I was most recently the director of global adaptation at BuzzFeed.)Since starting work on international growth, I\u2019ve simplified my hardware \u2014 mostly one phone, an iPhone X, and my good old Moto X when I need to see something on Android \u2014 but I have as many apps as ever: 314.In terms of apps and software, I am constantly tinkering and trying new apps. For (mostly) work, it\u2019s the whole Google suite, Slack, Things for my to-dos, Bear for notes, Instapaper, Nuzzel, Spotify, Pocket Casts and, of course, the New York Times app. I\u2019m looking for a better mail app right now.

That said, I\u2019m a very tactile person, and you obviously lose a lot of that when you work on the internet.

{"Headline": "Stocks Climb, Recovering From a Decline That Wiped Out 2018\u2019s Gains", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks rebounded on Thursday as strong earnings from major tech companies seemed to ease some of the worries driving a recent wave of selling that had wiped out the market\u2019s gains for the year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose by 1.9 percent, to close at 2,705.57. The rise pulled the stock market back into positive territory for 2018 a day after a turbulent session had erased the last of the year\u2019s gains. Stocks are now up 1.2 percent this year.The rally on Thursday was a rare upward jolt in what has been a rough run for stocks. Investors have dumped shares over the past month, worried about factors that could threaten the economic and profit outlook for 2019, including the trade war with China, the Fed\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates and the midterm elections.Those worries have largely outweighed the strong third-quarter sales and profit numbers that companies have reported since earnings season began this month. Thanks to a strong economy and corporate tax cuts, third-quarter profits for S.&P. 500 companies were on track to be up more than 22 percent, according to an analysis of reported results and projections by the market data firm Refinitiv.Instead, investors are scanning results for any indication \u2014 either in the profit guidance companies offer to analysts or in commentary from executives \u2014 that their fears of a rocky time ahead are warranted.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the guidance,\u201d said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving stock movements.\u201dOn Thursday, stock in International Paper rose 10.3 percent after it posted better-than-expected results. Executives said they expected strong sales and profit performance \u201cto continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.\u201d The chip giant Intel rose 4.5 percent after it raised its profit guidance for next year. Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips used in large data centers, shot up more than 15 percent after it increased full-year profit guidance.And Xilinx was only the S.&P. 500\u2019s second-best performer.Twitter posted its results, with revenue and profit topping forecasts, before the start of trading on Thursday, and its stock jumped 15.5 percent. Large tech companies also climbed. Shares of Microsoft, which reported positive results after the close of trading on Wednesday, rose 5.8 percent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 3 percent and is now up 6 percent for the year, but is nonetheless down 9.8 percent from its peak in early September.If investors were hoping that Thursday\u2019s rise means the latest period of volatility is at an end, they\u2019ll most likely be disappointed.Amazon, which rose more than 7 percent during the day, promptly tumbled in after-hours trading, after the release of its earnings report, which included a holiday forecast investors found underwhelming. And Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, whose shares had risen, dropped sharply when its results likewise disappointed.As long as investors feel that they don\u2019t have a good sense of what next year will look like, such volatility will almost certainly continue. More market swings could leave it ultimately treading water until conditions become more clear, Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cUntil we get through this we\u2019re just going to have this range-bound and very choppy market,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I Googled Geoffrey Weglarz and got many more results than the single one for Corbis. The highs and, more so, the lows of one man\u2019s life played out in the search results.He was a software developer in that field\u2019s early days, on the rise in Manhattan.Then he was an out-of-work man in his 50s, being interviewed for a television report about unemployment in middle age.Then he was an unhappy customer at McDonald\u2019s who blew a fuse in the drive-through one night and hurled his sandwich \u2014 they got the order wrong \u2014 at the woman who had served it to him. She was pregnant. The story went viral.I went back to the GoFundMe page and made the most important call of them all, to the host of the campaign, Pamela Lindemann, in Florida. She was the dead man\u2019s sister, and she filled in the outlines of a unique and complicated life \u2014 and a crucial detail about his death.After a successful career in software development, with a nice home and a family, he would lose all those things, winding up fitting all his possessions in his car. His sister said he had been diagnosed years earlier with Asperger syndrome, which seemed to explain idiosyncrasies in his personality that may have contributed to his unsuccessful job hunt. He changed his name to distance himself from the McDonald\u2019s fiasco.She said her brother took his life on Aug. 24, and she shared farewell texts from him from that day. His final hours were spent in Manhattan in a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to raise some fast cash.One can only guess why it seemed to be that particular turn of events that put him over the edge, but he drove to East 12th Street, parked and drank a poison he had said he bought on the dark web. He\u2019d been carrying it around for weeks.There ended one story, a sad one. And there began another. The police had responded to a 911 call about the man in the car on Aug. 31 and estimated at that scene that he had been there a couple of days, but in talking to Ms. Lindemann, it became clear it had been a full week since he died there.How could no one have noticed for so long? There was no single answer. A heat wave kept many indoors that week. The car windows had a dark tint. He might have looked like a napping Uber driver. There were rumors in the neighborhood that the car had parking tickets on the windshield, but these were false. The police did not ticket the car.And, for a woman in Florida trying to raise money for a funeral, one who took a reporter\u2019s call in the middle of that project, he wasn\u2019t really any of those things. He was her brother.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Can\u2019t Deport U.S. Student Over Past Support for Boycott", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government on Thursday to admit an American woman on her student visa, overruling the Interior Ministry, which pushed to deport her over a stint as an advocate for Palestinian rights while she was an undergraduate at the University of Florida.The Interior Ministry accused Ms. Alqasem, while she led a campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, of actively supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement that presses Israel to end the occupation of the West Bank. Pro-Israel advocates consider the movement anti-Semitic and bent on Israel\u2019s destruction, not least because it promotes Palestinians\u2019 right of return to land now in Israel.The case put an uncomfortable spotlight on what has become an acrimonious debate over who should be allowed into the country and more broadly, the health of Israeli democracy. Ms. Alqasem\u2019s supporters, and even some critics on the right, accused the government of an overzealous border policy and said it would do more damage to Israel\u2019s image abroad than any student\u2019s call for a boycott.In their decision, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court echoed those concerns. Because Ms. Alqasem had promised not to call for a boycott of Israel, and had left the group a year and a half ago \u2014 \u201ca significant period of time,\u201d given her young age \u2014 her actions \u201cdo not raise satisfactory cause to bar her entry to Israel,\u201d Judge Anat Baron wrote.For that reason, Judge Baron continued, \u201cthe inevitable impression is that invalidating the visa given to her was due to the political opinions she holds. If this is truly the case, then we are talking about an extreme and dangerous step, which could lead to the crumbling of the pillars upon which democracy in Israel stands.\u201dMs. Alqasem\u2019s lawyers accused the government of relying on flimsy evidence, and officials acknowledged that they had relied at least in part on Google searches and the work of an organization called Canary Mission, which says it \u201cdocuments people and groups that promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.\u201dAfter being denied entry, Ms. Alqasem, who has Palestinian grandparents, appealed to the Tel Aviv district court. At the request of a judge, she formally declared that she would not participate in any boycott activities while in Israel and that she had no intention of visiting the Palestinian territories, according to her lawyers, Leora Bechor and Yotam Ben-Hillel.A key issue at oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday was whether Ms. Alqasem remained an activist in the boycott movement or, as she testified before the lower court, had parted ways with the organization in early 2017.The government, in seeking to rebut her testimony, charged that she had clicked \u201cAttend\u201d on the Facebook page of at least one event connected to the movement this year. The judges were not persuaded.Her lawyers argued that there should be limits to the Interior Ministry\u2019s discretion in enforcing the sanctions law, particularly because it restricts free speech. And representatives of Hebrew University warned that if students with valid visas could be turned away when they arrive in Israel over their activist pasts, there would a chilling effect on academic and cultural exchanges, which Israel prizes.In the past, Israeli officials have said the 2017 entry law would not penalize people for their political opinions alone and would apply only to major figures in the boycott movement.The entry law itself is being challenged in separate litigation. The judges in Ms. Alqasem\u2019s case needed only to find that she was no longer a boycott movement activist, whatever her past actions or present beliefs, to overrule her deportation.Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Kaplan, a founder of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, said on Tuesday that she will represent Moira Donegan, the creator of a widely circulated list of \u201cmedia men\u201d accused of sexual misconduct. Ms. Donegan is the only named defendant in a lawsuit that was filed against her by Stephen Elliott, one of the men named on the list.In his suit, Mr. Elliott said that the claims about him on the list, which included \u201crape accusations\u201d and \u201csexual harassment,\u201d were false and defamatory, and that they had caused him significant professional and personal problems. He is being represented by Andrew T. Miltenberg, a lawyer who has worked on behalf of other men prominently accused of sexual misconduct.Ms. Donegan has said that she meant for the list to function as a digital \u201cwhisper network,\u201d a way to warn women, who might not otherwise hear rumors about bad behavior, to avoid certain men.In an essay for Quillette, Mr. Elliott denied the accusations, saying he was \u201cshocked to find myself accused of rape\u201d and that the list \u201cderailed my life.\u201dMs. Kaplan, a partner at Kaplan, Hecker and Fink, is most famous for representing Edith Windsor in United States v. Windsor, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act violated the constitution, a major victory for L.G.B.T.Q. rights. In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Kaplan said that she had taken Ms. Donegan\u2019s case to fight what she saw as an effort to keep women from coming forward with claims about sexual misconduct.\u201cI and other women who are involved in Time\u2019s Up have felt pretty strongly for a while that it would be really important not only to represent women who have been harassed or assaulted, but also to defend women in efforts that have been undertaken to stop women from speaking,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said.She noted that the standards for bringing a case for defamation are particularly high and difficult to meet in the state of New York and that it was hard for her to see how Mr. Elliott\u2019s suit would pass a motion to dismiss.\u201cOne can only surmise that the point of the lawsuit is to do something else, and again, my assumption is that the something else is to try to discourage other women from coming forward,\u201d she said.And just as Mr. Miltenberg has begun to establish himself as a go-to lawyer for prominent men accused of misconduct in the midst of the #MeToo Movement, Ms. Kaplan has worked on behalf of accusers. In the description, Ms. Hough wrote that Ms. Donegan \u201cdid us all a huge favor.\u201d\u201cShe made our world safer, and has paid more than her share.\u201d She added: \u201cNow she\u2019s going to need some help.\u201dAny remaining money, Ms. Hough wrote, will be donated to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.Ms. Donegan\u2019s case is currently being handled pro bono.

Fast forward to today, when everyone has the ability to see the toxic online stylings of Cesar Sayoc, the Trump supporter who has been arrested and charged for a series of mail bombs that he sent to CNN and a list of prominent Democrats. He was all over social media spewing his bile, which escalated on Twitter and Facebook starting in 2016. But it takes only seconds to draw a line between the public posts of these internet goblins and their real-life attacks. What is happening on social networks and across digital communications platforms is disturbing and ever metastasizing. And preventable.The negligence does not stop at the platforms but includes who pays for these platforms, which is how I found myself at a dinner party recently where the guests were ranking Silicon Valley funders from most to least toxic: Russia, China, Kuwait, Qatar, along with various dicey high-net-worth individuals across the globe.\u201cThey are all linked to awful behavior in some way if you are being really honest with yourself,\u201d a well-known entrepreneur said. \u201cThank goodness for Singapore.\u201d (Apparently \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d had been good for the brands of funds tied to the Singapore government, like Temasek and GIC.)I cannot tell you how sad that is to write, because when I first saw the internet way back when, I hoped that it would help eliminate the attitudes that had fueled those horrible letters to me. I na\u00efvely thought a lone man sending a reporter a missive of malevolence could not find such refuge on the wide-open internet, where his hate would be seen for what it was and denounced and exorcised.I was obviously very wrong. Instead, the internet gave people like him the space to grow and thrive. Tech made no real rules, claiming the freedom from any strictures would be O.K. in what is the greatest experiment in human communications ever.We have no idea how to deal with this situation, except to watch it play out over and over again, and allow it to kill us cell by cell.Or not. \u201cYou must live life with the full knowledge that your actions will remain,\u201d Zadie Smith wrote. \u201cWe are creatures of consequence.\u201dWe have met the creature and it is a monster. I shudder to think what the consequences will be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul G. Allen, Microsoft\u2019s Co-Founder, Is Dead at 65", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later.The company\u2019s first product was a much-compressed version of the Basic programming language, designed to suit those underpowered machines. Yet the company\u2019s big move came when it promised the computer giant IBM that it would deliver the operating system software for IBM\u2019s entry into the personal computer business. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen committed to supplying that software in 1980.At the time, it was a promise without a product. But Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981.That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons \u2014 point-and-click computing rather than typed commands. The company would also produce the Office productivity programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations.Mr. Allen\u2019s partnership with Mr. Gates began when they were teenagers attending the private Lakeside School in Seattle. It was there that they got their start in computing, working from a school Teletype terminal that was linked to a far-away mainframe computer under a so-called time-sharing computer system, in which operators paid for the computing time they used. Funds for the system were originally supplied by proceeds from a school bake sale.Mr. Allen scored a perfect 1,600 on his SAT test, and went on to Washington State University. But after two years he dropped out to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston. Mr. Gates was nearby, attending Harvard University.When an early microcomputer was introduced, appearing on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine, Mr. Allen persuaded Mr. Gates to drop out of Harvard and move to Albuquerque, where a start-up called MITS had built a machine that has been credited as the first personal computer. The machine lacked software, and Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates, showing up at the MITS offices, promised that they could supply it.Their first offering was Microsoft Basic. Both Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen were skilled code creators, but Mr. Gates was more the hard-charging, volatile businessman, while Mr. Allen played the peacemaker and negotiator in those early days.Within a few years, Microsoft moved from New Mexico to suburban Seattle. Though Mr. Allen stepped away from daily duties at Microsoft in the early 1980s, partly because of a deteriorating relationship with Mr. Gates, he remained on the Microsoft board until 2000.Mr. Allen left Microsoft after he learned he had lymphoma. But tensions had also flared with both Mr. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, a close lieutenant who eventually succeeded Mr. Gates as chief executive. In his 2011 memoir, \u201cIdea Man,\u201d Mr. Allen recalled overhearing the two talk about reducing his stake in the company.\u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Mr. Allen wrote.But Mr. Allen held his ground and his shares.Mr. Gates said in a statement on Monday: \u201cFrom our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dAs Microsoft became the dominant personal computer software company, Mr. Allen, as well as Mr. Gates, who was the face of the company, became immensely wealthy. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he had a net worth of $26.1 billion.He was also an investor and a generous philanthropist.Mr. Allen donated more than $2 billion toward nonprofit groups dedicated to the advancement of science, technology, education, the environment and the arts. Among the scientific research organizations he funded were the Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003 and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2014.And while some of his philanthropy was global, like a passion for ending elephant poaching, much of his post-Microsoft work centered on Seattle, where he became a transformative force behind many of the city\u2019s leading cultural institutions.He restored the old Cinerama movie theater to modern standards seemingly ideal for watching science-fiction films, and he hired Frank Gehry to design the Museum of Pop Culture, which Mr. Allen founded in 2000 under the original name of the Experience Music Project. The wild, undulating building displayed items revealing Mr. Allen\u2019s cultural obsessions, including guitars owned by Jimi Hendrix and Captain Kirk\u2019s command chair from the 1960s television series \u201cStar Trek.\u201dIn the 1990s, Mr. Allen bought a swath of land in the South Lake Union neighborhood to help build a Seattle version of Central Park, but the public ultimately voted down the plans. He took those real estate holdings and, through his company, Vulcan, developed South Lake Union into the home of Amazon. Google and other tech companies have been opening offices in that now revitalized neighborhood.\u201cHe has a definitive role of what we understand as today\u2019s Seattle, which is about technology, about real estate and about a distinctive local culture with international visibility,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington.Mr. Allen also used his wealth to acquire the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association in 1988 and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League in 1996.Yet in 1988, at 35, he bought the Trail Blazers and promised to keep the franchise in the city, one of the smallest in the league. He often flew to games from Seattle and sat courtside with his mother. Soon after he bought the team, the Trail Blazers had one of their best runs in franchise history, making it to the N.B.A. finals twice in three years, losing both times.In a statement, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, called Mr. Allen \u201cthe ultimate trail blazer \u2014 in business, philanthropy and in sports.\u201d Mr. Silver said Mr. Allen, one of the longest-tenured owners in the league, was particularly interested in the league\u2019s growth internationally and its embrace of new technologies.Mr. Allen set about building the team a new home downtown. The team moved into CenturyLink Field in 2002, and Mr. Allen spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the stadium. Though he spoke infrequently to the media, he could often be seen at games, sometimes raising the \u201c12\u201d flag \u2014 representing the fans \u2014 before kickoff, a team ritual.During his tenure the Seahawks made their only three Super Bowl appearances, winning the title once, in 2014.\u201cI personally valued Paul\u2019s advice on subjects ranging from collective bargaining to bringing technology to our game,\u201d Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. Commissioner, said in a statement.One of Allen\u2019s companies also owned a stake in the Seattle Sounders, one of the most successful franchises in Major League Soccer. The Sounders won the league title in 2016.Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, to Kenneth and Edna (Faye) Allen. His father was a librarian; his mother a schoolteacher. He is survived by his sister, Jody Allen.Three years ago, when commemorating Microsoft\u2019s 40th anniversary, Mr. Allen posted on Twitter a bit of the code for the company\u2019s first software product. At the top, it said, \u201cCopyright 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird to look at bits of code you wrote 40 years ago and think, \u2018That led to where Microsoft is today,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Allen said at the time. He sounded genuinely amazed.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the cities in which Mr. Allen owned professional sports teams. He owned an N.F.L. team in Seattle and an N.B.A. team in Portland, Ore.; the teams were not both in Seattle.An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Allen\u2019s middle name. It is Gardner, not Gardener.Ken Belson and Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetro ReportIn the years before abortion became legal, a clandestine group helped women with unwanted pregnancies get around the law.The no-frills advertisement, printed at times in student and alternative newspapers, went straight to the point: \u201cPregnant? Don\u2019t want to be? Call Jane.\u201d A telephone number followed.This was nearly half a century ago, when abortion was illegal almost everywhere in the country and alternative newspapers were in their heyday. There was no Jane, though, not literally anyway. Yet at the same time, Jane was anybody.\u201cIt was an Everywoman name,\u201d used for everyone who once formed an underground network that provided clandestine abortion services, Laura Kaplan said. Ms. Kaplan was part of it and wrote about the experience in a 1995 book, \u201cThe Story of Jane.\u201d That group, referred to by some as the Jane Collective, operated in Chicago and carried out thousands of abortions from 1969 to 1973. Many of the procedures were performed by medical nonprofessionals. They may have been the housewife next door, the college student down the block, the local schoolteacher.Perhaps not surprisingly, many with unwanted pregnancies resort to do-it-yourself measures. This does not mean a wholesale return to the bad old days of desperate women swallowing lye or turpentine, or using knitting needles or wire hangers. The norm now is a self-administered abortion pill \u2014 actually a combination of two medications, misoprostol and mifepristone. They are generally considered safe and, when taken together, almost always effective in a pregnancy\u2019s first trimester.Nonetheless, most states require by statute that a doctor be involved; several women have been jailed for running afoul of the law. It is enough to have spawned movements to assist pregnant women wishing to act on their own, not unlike the secretive Janes of old. In keeping with its mission of looking back to then look ahead, Retro Report recalls the life and times of that Chicago network, known formally as the Abortion Counseling Service of Women\u2019s Liberation.The network came into being in 1969, with clients like Sunny Chapman, who at age 19 had become pregnant. It was a difficult pregnancy, with considerable bleeding, Ms. Chapman recalled for Retro Report. Like many women, she first turned to what was commonly referred to back then as a back-alley abortionist. \u201cI had a conversation with the man on the phone, and just talking to him made me feel completely unsafe,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHe sounded like a gangster.\u201d Hospital emergency room doctors treated her with hostility, she said.The Janes\u2019 tactics were worthy of a spy novel. A woman seeking to end her pregnancy left a message on an answering machine. A \u201cCallback Jane\u201d phoned her, collected information and passed it to a \u201cBig Jane.\u201d Patients would be taken first to one address, \u201cthe front,\u201d for counseling. They were then led, sometimes blindfolded, to another spot, \u201cthe place,\u201d where a doctor did the abortion.That is, if he indeed was a doctor. It turned out that at least one abortionist, while skilled enough, was not a physician, just someone looking for a ready buck. A few of the Janes, Ms. Kaplan said, figured that if he could do it, so could they. And they did, for a lot less. The man\u2019s going rate in the early \u201970s went as high as $1,000, equivalent to about $6,500 today. The Janes dropped the price to $100, accepting less if the woman had little money.In 1972, the Chicago police raided an apartment used by the Janes, and arrested seven of them. In the police van, the women ripped off the sections of index cards bearing their patients\u2019 names and addresses, and swallowed them.It seems safe to say that most Americans are unfamiliar with all that, let alone with the generic Roe\u2019s first name in the case. It was Jane.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: \u201cThey just want to follow winners,\u201d the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google\u2019s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit.It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well. The NYT added that some students are asking similar questions \u2014 before they even join the work force.Mr. Ballmer\u2019s bottom line? \u201cStick with what you know.

This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy and Damien Chazelle Shoot for the Moon", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the story of any given afternoon in Hollywood: a pair of experienced producers meets a sizzling young director over a concertedly casual lunch.The producers, emissaries from a major studio, initiate ritual courtship \u2014 brandishing the keys to a virtual village of filmable, prefab intellectual property. The director need only take his pick from the lot.The three are in some ways a crew of misfits. For one thing, neither Mr. Gosling nor Ms. Foy was actually born in the land of liberty (he\u2019s Canadian, she\u2019s British). And Mr. Chazelle\u2019s earlier films have earned him a reputation as a spirited decoder of compulsive artistic genius, not as a caretaker of national mythology.But \u201cFirst Man,\u201d a meditation on collective ambition and individual sacrifice, has more in common with that early work than one might expect.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s very different from an artistic achievement, I think the moon landing, for me, has a similar effect, because it\u2019s such a poetic, symbolic moment that we all get to experience,\u201d Mr. Chazelle said, joined by Mr. Gosling and Ms. Foy for a phone interview last month.\u201cBut, of course, the reality is we\u2019re not fully experiencing it \u2014 the ways in which so much failure and cost had to precede that success story, the darker underbelly of the mythology,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think it was learning about that stuff that actually gave me a fuller appreciation of just how insanely brave and courageous they all were.\u201d Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:Damien, I have to ask: Why outsource these jobs to a Canadian and a Brit?[Laughter]Ryan, how do you personify someone who is literally a postage stamp, someone generations of Americans have grown up with and have their own ideas about?The death from cancer of the Armstrongs\u2019 young daughter, Karen, becomes an unexpected catalyst in the film. Was that bereavement, which is not widely known, always a part of the story you wanted to tell? It did seem that, in some ways, that could be the thing that, without his even knowing it necessarily, drove him to keep pushing these boundaries and eventually wind up on the moon. And obviously it also becomes a question of what happens to a marriage when it goes through that loss. So that became sort of the guiding dynamic for the movie.That\u2019s not something that he ever said directly, but I was encouraged by his sons\u2019 and Janet\u2019s reaction to the screenplay, because it seemed that they felt that was a possibility as well.The scene where Neil throws Karen\u2019s bracelet into the crater \u2014 tell me about that. The rest of the film is meticulously naturalistic, and then it takes this bold, conspicuously ahistoric leap.But of course it\u2019s not something that Neil ever confirmed or would confirm, and in a way I guess that makes it even more beautiful to me, the idea that he would kind of keep that with him and, I would imagine, Jan, and no one else.The movie makes you feel the cost that was paid to put a man on the moon. And of course the big question that follows from that is \u201cTo what end?\u201d I wonder if you feel like you ever got close to an answer.But there\u2019s this whole other less tangible side. The inspiration and sense of hope it gave to people all over the world. The motivation it gave to an entire generation that was taught that the impossible is possible. I think the enormous symbolic weight of it is hard to overstate.What I find so poignant and beautiful about the moon landing is that on one hand, from a physical standpoint, it is this almost arbitrary goal \u2014 people walking on this barren surface and then returning home. But as a moment of humanity, and displaying what humanity is capable of, there\u2019s maybe nothing that can ever top it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM to Buy Red Hat, the Top Linux Distributor, for $34 Billion", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIBM is making a big move to bring more software developers under its wing by acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the popular open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion.With the deal for Red Hat, IBM is trying to position itself as a kind of corporate \u201cSwitzerland\u201d in cloud computing \u2014 a trusted partner of businesses that are moving to the cloud, but are leery of becoming dependent on one major cloud supplier.In the cloud model, software developers write applications that run on remote data centers. The advantage can be lower costs and faster development of new business software.IBM is a champion of a hybrid approach to cloud computing. That means some crucial data and applications run on cloud technology inside a company\u2019s data centers, while other computing tasks run on the clouds of tech companies.The major third-party cloud platforms are Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Businesses complain that these cloud suppliers include proprietary technology that makes it difficult to switch from one cloud to another.The IBM cloud strategy is to supply both hardware and software for companies to build their own private clouds, and it also has a third-party public cloud offering.IBM, analysts say, cannot really compete broadly with so-called hyperscale cloud companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google \u2014 which tap their deep coffers to spend many billions of dollars a year to build more giant data centers.But IBM and Red Hat say they are well placed to be leaders in helping corporations make the transition to cloud computing without getting locked into the technology of an internet giant.The two companies say they plan to offer the technology to link a company\u2019s in-house cloud and multiple third-party clouds.\u201cEnterprises are moving to the cloud but 80 percent of them are not there yet,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, an IBM senior vice president in charge of its hybrid cloud offerings. \u201cWe can provide a much easier path to manage and make secure both private clouds and links to multiple public clouds.\u201dRed Hat, founded in 1993 and based in Raleigh, N.C., has built a profitable business, with $2.4 billion in revenue last year, around open-source software, mainly Linux. Open-source code is distributed free, and can be modified by far-flung programmers, under certain rules.Red Hat has expanded \u2014 and made money \u2014 by offering technical support, quality control, software tools and a forum for collaboration, charging subscription fees.Linux is the preferred operating system for cloud computing. \u201cFor most corporations, hybrid cloud is the only practical way to the cloud,\u201d said Paul Cormier, president for products and technologies at Red Hat.The link with IBM, Mr. Cormier said, will accelerate Red Hat\u2019s progress in the market for corporate cloud migrations.Red Hat will join IBM\u2019s cloud team, the companies said in a joint statement, but as a \u201cdistinct unit\u201d to preserve its independence and neutrality in open-source development.IBM\u2019s offer of $190 a share in cash is more than a 60 percent premium over Red Hat\u2019s closing price on Friday, $116.68 a share.The hefty price tag, said one person close to the deal, who asked not be to identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, is justified by Red Hat\u2019s growth and strong cash flow.IBM, he said, is paying about 30 times Red Hat\u2019s free cash flow, well below the average for recent software company acquisitions, and it will help lift IBM\u2019s growth and cash flow.The boards of both companies approved the deal, and the sale is expected to close in the second half of next year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Lazard advised IBM on the deal, and Guggenheim Partners and Morgan Stanley advised Red Hat.Advertisement"}

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Some elections are about hope. Some elections are about change. And some elections are about fear.I started the day watching the sun rise over the ocean in Miami, thinking that\u2019s what I\u2019d write you all today \u2014 how candidates from both sides had turned to scare tactics in the final weeks of the election.Well, it turns out that if you stoke enough fake fears, they can become real.While officials haven\u2019t yet announced a suspect or motive, all of the intended recipients are favorite targets of right-wing politicians and media.But they\u2019ve also created a political climate with such heightened rhetoric that, for people exposed to the constant drumbeat of fear, real danger can feel like an inevitable outcome.Voters have spent months hearing about imagined threats \u2014 a caravan of criminals about to storm the border, the total demise of government, riots over immigration and an epidemic of false sexual assault allegations.I\u2019ve seen some of it myself during my trip to Florida this week.Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate for governor, stood alongside a group of sheriffs on Tuesday and warned that the migrant caravan moving north through Central America is \u201ceffectively a wet kiss to the drug cartels.\u201d\u201cThe caravan can\u2019t just be allowed to overrun our border,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see that developing, obviously that is orchestrated.\u201dBut Democrats haven\u2019t been mincing their words in response. In fact, as Election Day has neared, they\u2019ve grown more aggressive in their remarks, too.On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned across the state with Andrew Gillum and Senator Bill Nelson, warning that the country was in a \u201cbattle for America\u2019s soul\u201d from a president who was \u201cshredding American values.\u201d\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, pick your heads up,\u201d he told a crowd in Jacksonville. \u201cTake this country back.\u201dAt a fund-raiser in Coral Gables this afternoon, Mrs. Clinton addressed the news of the bombs.\u201cIt\u2019s a time of deep divisions, and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together,\u201d she told a crowd of 200 donors.But it\u2019s worth noting how she talked about this election just 15 days ago.\u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,\u201d she told CNN.Obviously, there\u2019s a difference between political protests and actual violence. But as politicians in this heated election encourage their supporters to fear the other side, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that for some, that line can start to look a little bit blurry.____________________\u201cBe cool!\u201d one of the Democratic activists completely failed to whisper to another.So began Tuesday evening at a suburban Atlanta phone bank, as Michelle Kwan, the most decorated American figure skater in history, arrived to dial for Georgia\u2019s energized Democrats, including Stacey Abrams, the nominee for governor.It was, Ms. Kwan suggested in a room filled with smartphones, a reliable old-school fix for a riddle of every campaign: how to stir voters to actually vote.\u201cThere are some people who think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s got it in the bag,\u2019 or, \u2018My voice doesn\u2019t count,\u2019 and it really matters,\u201d Ms. Kwan, who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why those people who are here making phone calls, they might not feel like they reach a lot of people. They might have a canvass packet with 75 people, and they might talk to 30. Well, that 30 is a reminder: \u2018Did you vote yet?\u2019\u201dAnd so Ms. Kwan, who copped to feeling \u201cfrustrated\u201d and having \u201cmoments where I have avoided watching the television\u201d after the 2016 election, sat alone at a desk, dialing would-be voters ahead of Ms. Abrams\u2019s debate with Brian Kemp.\u201cSometimes I do,\u201d said Ms. Kwan, who is not a Georgian but once won a title in Atlanta. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s Michelle,\u2019 and then we have a really good conversation. And I\u2019ll be like, \u2018I\u2019m Michelle Kwan\u2019 \u2014 and then there\u2019s a pause.\u201d____________________I\u2019m Patting Myself on the Back Today!!

If you wouldn\u2019t, then don\u2019t go to an online forum either,\u201d says Anthony M. Cocco, a doctor at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne, and the lead author on a recent scientific study about the search habits of people before they show up in an E.R. Stick to vetted, well-sourced information, like that found on hospital or university websites. \u201cThe deeper you go, the poorer quality information you\u2019ll find,\u201d says Cocco, who suggests sticking to the first page of results.Public-health experts have long been concerned about possible negative outcomes from researching health issues online. One person might come down with \u201ccyberchondria,\u201d or the irrational fear of some phantom illness; conversely, another might let a real illness go untreated. The trust between doctors and patients might break down. But in his research, Cocco found a different phenomenon: nearly 80 percent of the patients who looked up things online before seeing a doctor reported that their searches actually improved their experience. They were better able to articulate their symptoms and understand what doctors told them.If you feel confident you can discern the difference between high- and low-quality information, search away. \u201cI encourage my younger or tech-savvy patients to go online,\u201d Cocco says. Otherwise, proceed with caution. Make sure a site is not trying to sell you a product or cure. Know that some medical terms will produce more accurate results than others. In one study, researchers found that only one of the top 54 results for \u201cendometriosis\u201d \u2014 the subject of over 4.5 million searches annually \u2014 led to a page that contained what was deemed to be accurate information about the condition. But Cocco recommends skipping the kind of scientific papers you might find on Google Scholar or PubMed; they often contain unusual cases and bewildering terminology.If you\u2019re concerned about something you saw online \u2014 searches often turn up worst-case scenarios \u2014 tell your doctor. Cocco finds it is easier to reassure patients if he knows exactly what it is they\u2019re scared of. Trust your ability to triage yourself. \u201cIf you have an acute condition, just call the ambulance,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t sit there for 20 minutes googling it first.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beastie Boys Put Down the Mic and Pick Up the Pen", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "After the death of Adam Yauch, Michael Diamond and Adam Horovitz worked to capture the groundbreaking group\u2019s aesthetic and legacy on the page. Here\u2019s how they did it.Supported byThe story begins \u2014 or maybe ends \u2014 with three guys in their early 50s hanging out on a beautiful late summer afternoon, drinking iced coffee and talking about how much they love the Clash, and how weird it is that the celebrity-clogged hotel where they\u2019re sitting is just up the block from where CBGB was way back when. Dad stuff. Two of the dads, though, are the surviving members of the Beastie Boys: Adam Horovitz, with upswept gray hair and a white T-shirt with a faint graffito on the front; and Michael Diamond, wearing a bright red button-up, his hair still dark, his face creased and tan from years living in Southern California. Ad-Rock and Mike D, in other words.The volume, full of old photographs and comics, with a riot of fonts and layouts, is a nonmusical summa of Beastie aesthetics. Personal history, tour bus folklore, studio geekery and a generational drama that summons an impressive roster of witnesses, including the writers Jonathan Lethem, Ada Calhoun and Colson Whitehead, the comedian/actress Amy Poehler and assorted fellow musicians. Some scores are settled, some beef is squashed, and no doubt some ugly business gets airbrushed or skipped over. Bad behavior is acknowledged; feminist-ally bona fides are upheld. Since there won\u2019t be any more new Beastie Boys music, this scrapbook will help to consolidate a sprawling and complicated legacy.Around the same time, they started a magazine called Grand Royal that was also sort of a record label and also sort of a lifestyle consumer emporium and also sort of a clubhouse where you could feel simultaneously like a noob and a savant. It was like a website, but on paper. Silly and do-it-yourself, it had the disarming, off-the-cuff, look-what-I-found sense of artistic integrity that is central to the Beastie legacy.That legacy between hard covers doesn\u2019t much resemble a standard rock star memoir. In apt Gen X fashion it\u2019s funnier and more modest than the best-sellers by the musical heroes of the baby boomers. The three of us talked about that, and about a lot of other things. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.So how did the book come about?What did you most want it not to be?Were there places where you remembered things differently?Well it\u2019s a long time. How do you remember that now \u2014 the music you listened to, and what gave you the idea that it was something you could do? Did that put pressure on you to do something different?Were you at all self-conscious about being white kids working in the rap idiom? A lot of kids are growing up now in a Beastie-created world, where music, sneakers, clothes, food, so much of what they consume is connected and cross-branded. And you were pioneers in that kind of thing. How did that grow out of the music? When I think of you guys, I think of two moments. The first one, the early and mid-80s, we were talking about. But then there\u2019s also the early and mid-90s, a decade later, when there\u2019s a creative flowering in hip-hop and the indie-rock moment. Somehow you were in both of those places. How do you think you got there?One thing that was definitely true of the early Beastie Boys was the playful, obnoxious persona. There was the inflatable penis onstage at your shows.  And already, probably 20 years ago, you distanced yourself from some of the most offensive parts of that. At the moment, across the culture, there\u2019s a lot of reckoning going on about misogyny and homophobia, past and present, and I wonder if that came up again working on the book?There\u2019s something bittersweet about this book, because of Yauch\u2019s death.Advertisement"}

As a partner at a financial consulting firm, I thought: \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the money every day.\u201dBut I reasoned that he and I weren\u2019t going to be sharing a checking account anytime soon, so why end things prematurely? Besides, in the context of our conversation, he wasn\u2019t even referring to me but to his ex-wife; they had been driven apart by financial disagreements. This put some distance between his words and me, or so I told myself.I didn\u2019t normally go for guys who said things like, \u201cI\u2019m the man.\u201d I usually fell for men who didn\u2019t argue when I said it was my turn to pay for dinner. These men noticed my intelligence before my looks, or at least they said they did.But in my post-divorce haze, I found myself falling for a different kind of man.As his words lingered, I felt a combination of shock and curiosity, as if encountering a species previously thought extinct. I knew there were men who believed they should be in charge of money. The shock came from encountering one who readily admitted it.But he already had made clear he believed in traditional gender roles. With sex, too, he had said, \u201cI\u2019m the man. I want to lead.\u201dI found his bluntness surprising but also alluring. He was confident in his desires.Since my ex-husband had divorced me the previous year, I had been reconsidering what I thought I knew about relationships. And my previous belief in a relationship of equals seemed painfully na\u00efve.My ex called himself a feminist, but in our marriage that seemed to mean he felt fine about me dramatically out-earning him, fine about spending my income freely on luxuries, and fine about me covering the mortgage, the private school tuition for our children and the rest of our financial commitments. (At the time, he was building a small retail business from which he took no salary.)This experience should have led me to dump any guy who claimed it was a man\u2019s job to manage a couple\u2019s money, but here it was having the opposite effect. I craved a man who sought to take financial responsibility for his family, even if I didn\u2019t need it.After my fantasy of a partnership of equals had failed to materialize, I seemed to want to replace it with a fantasy of paternalistic protection.The men I\u2019d previously dated thought of themselves as staunch feminists \u2014 in hindsight, frustratingly so, at least in the sense that they were too inclined to defer to me (under the guise of respecting me) to ever take charge, either financially or sexually. I can\u2019t blame them; the pattern of choosing men too reticent to arouse me had been mine.I had interrogated the last man I dated on his Democratic bona fides before agreeing to meet for coffee. But with my new guy, I found myself quietly acquiescing as he told me his voting history shouldn\u2019t matter. (I took this to mean his voting history was the opposite of mine.)After paying for coffee that first evening, he carefully aligned the bottom of the receipt with his credit card, then wrapped it around tightly before placing the card back in his wallet (my ex would have scrunched up the receipt and tossed it in the nearest trash can). Watching the care he took with this mundane task, I knew I wanted him.A week later, we played chess in an ice-cream parlor. I sensed that losing would dampen his ardor, so I left my king open to attack, letting him checkmate me twice. As we left, he took my hand and pulled me closer.Lying in his bed before falling asleep, I felt guilty about the chess games. They were like fake orgasms, untruthful actions giving the man an exaggerated view of his talents. But these games didn\u2019t hide sexual dissatisfaction; they hid my intelligence, turning me into someone he would feel a need to protect.He often cooked for us in the kitchen he had remodeled himself (despite a career in data analytics, not construction). The walls of my kitchen were still marked with the rough outlines of the cabinetry my ex had wrested off years earlier in his aborted attempt at an upgrade.Sitting with a glass of wine, admiring my new guy\u2019s cooking and handiwork, I was tempted to minimize the implications of his beliefs on gender roles. I pondered him being in charge of the money. Unlike my ex, he was frugal, believing a car was for transportation, not luxury. His home was outfitted with charming furniture he had made himself.But he wasn\u2019t cheap when it came to me. He paid when we ate out; I never even offered, in part because I knew doing so would displease him, but also because I relished feeling cared for. He was fiscally responsible, generous and trustworthy.So I told myself there was nothing wrong with the man being in charge of the money as long as he made good decisions. At the same time, I found myself becoming guarded around my new guy, evading his questions and hiding things I thought he wouldn\u2019t like. When he asked if I ever went to church, I said no \u2014 but failed to mention I was Jewish. I never lied about my career, though I didn\u2019t tell him the whole truth either. He knew I was an actuary but not that I was a partner at the firm.Despite my evasiveness, I knew what I loved about him. A few years earlier, a dog had attacked his son. He fought off the dog, but his son was left with stitches and difficulty sleeping. He sued the neighbor who owned the dog, getting a sizable contribution to his son\u2019s college fund, and the neighbor moved away.Given the choice between a man who said all the right things about supporting a strong woman and a man who shielded his child from a vicious dog with his bare hands, I chose the latter. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.In the end, though, he didn\u2019t choose me.He was smart enough, first of all, to see through my deceptions: the restraint during chess and the lack of candor about my career. There were other things he may have spotted too, like the mezuza on my door frame or the chess strategy books on my shelves.And I think he must have realized I earned more than he did. When he expressed frustration that he hadn\u2019t been able to save for his children\u2019s college costs, I said nothing. And when he asked me about alimony and child support, I answered truthfully: I didn\u2019t receive any.When I made the mistake of mentioning work, he finally asked enough questions to find my career history online. It was aggressive enough (on his part) and evasive enough (on my part) for us both to feel like it was the beginning of the end.A few hours later, I lay next to him, noticing the swarthiness of his arms against my pale skin. I told him a story about sex with my ex-husband.\u201cYou initiated?\u201d he said, mildly incredulous.His other beliefs I had sensed and anticipated, but given our sexual compatibility, I hadn\u2019t expected him to believe a woman shouldn\u2019t initiate sex.When I next saw him, he was sullen and withdrawn. I mentioned my cabinetry problems, as if to say, \u201cSee, I don\u2019t earn more than you. I can\u2019t even afford a normal kitchen.\u201dIt was a last-ditch effort to turn myself into the person I thought he wanted and also the person I wanted to be: a woman who needed to be protected. Or perhaps, more accurately, a woman who wanted to feel protected, whether she needed it or not. My attempt was halfhearted though; I knew the endeavor was doomed.After we had sex, he said he couldn\u2019t stay over, though he had no plans for the morning. The next day, by text, I ended it, which is what he wanted me to do.It seemed like an obvious decision, but I surprised myself by bursting into tears. What he had offered \u2014 strength, protection and generosity \u2014 were things I had been looking for without even knowing it. That\u2019s the thing about gender roles. They can meet a need you were afraid to acknowledge, and they can take it all away when you don\u2019t conform.Eventually, I hired someone for the cabinetry work. It was expensive, but that\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s my kitchen, and I\u2019m in charge of the money.Susan Forray works as an actuary in Milwaukee, Wis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Comes After the Roomba?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been 16 years since the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner was introduced by iRobot.Partly inspired by a novel robotics approach known as \u201cfast, cheap and out-of-control,\u201d the humble Roomba was not much of a robot. It simply wandered around a room sucking up dust and debris. A second generation was able to autonomously make its way back to a recharging station.But unlike robots like Sony\u2019s dog, Aibo, it did something useful at a nonastronomical price. It was a hit for iRobot, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Since then, there have been waves of failed attempts to create more sophisticated home robotic products from companies in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe. There have been efforts to build humanoid robots, social companion robots, robots that cook, robots that do your dry cleaning, robots that fold your clothes and robots that change the kitty litter.But there still isn\u2019t a second successful home robot category beyond the lowly vacuum cleaner.Despite persistent optimism, roboticists and A.I. researchers have painfully learned that while computers can run mathematical circles around humans, things that humans do without thinking are the most difficult for machines. John McCarthy, an A.I. pioneer, would reach into his pocket and deftly extract a quarter as an example of the most challenging tasks for a robot.Many researchers have come to believe that the recent breakthroughs in machine learning will not be enough to build robots adept at moving and performing tasks in a home. That is likely to require several more technological breakthroughs.The continuing challenges in building a successful home robot have been underscored recently by the disappointments of several high-profile start-ups.Mayfield Robotics, which was developing Kuri, a home companion robot with backing from Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., a German electronics company, announced in July that it was \u201cpausing\u201d operations and returning pre-order deposits. Kuri\u2019s demise followed a similar fate earlier this year that befell Jibo, a heavily funded effort by Cynthia Breazeal, an M.I.T. professor, to build a social robot that had started a $3.5 million Indiegogo campaign in 2014.Pepper, introduced as a home robot by the French robot design firm Aldebaran Robotics and then acquired by SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, was initially priced at $2,000 with an additional monthly subscription. The robot is now being advertised on the firm\u2019s website as a commercial \u201chost\u201d or greeter for a flat fee of $25,000.The snail\u2019s pace of development in home robots stands in striking contrast to the rapid advance of artificial intelligence in successful products like Amazon\u2019s Echo or even the Siri technology of iPhones.\u201cNot a single human has been replaced by a humanoid robot,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the roboticist who started Google\u2019s self-driving car program.Japan and South Korea have been ahead of the United States in their enthusiasm for home robots, but companies there have had similarly disappointing results.\u201cAt one point I remember the president of South Korea saying that there would be robots in most Korea homes by 2012,\u201d said Tandy Trower, a software engineer who oversaw the original Microsoft Windows operating system and later established a robotics development effort at the company.He now leads his own home robot company, Hoaloha Robotics, which is focused on a mobile robot to permit older people to live independently at home. Mr. Trower said that while he remained optimistic that in the long run he would be able to develop a robot that acted as a partner or an assistant for aging people, he realized that a commercial product was not on the near horizon.Despite those repeated failures, many technologists remain optimistic that the home robot is just around the corner.At Stanford University, which pioneered the original robot arm and first mobile robot in the 1960s, the roboticist Kenneth Salisbury developed the prototype PR1 home robot a decade ago.The PR1 inspired Willow Garage, a start-up funded by Scott Hassan, one of Google\u2019s original programmers. Willow Garage produced another prototype home robot, the PR2, which led to a number of spinoffs, but no successful commercial home applications emerged from the research.Both the PR1 and PR2 were early explorations in performing common household tasks like getting a cup of coffee, loading and unloading the dishwasher, and going to the refrigerator and getting a beer. The robot prototypes performed these tasks, but only in highly controlled experiments.Now, Stanford roboticists are working on a next-generation robot that could potentially work in the home. Silvio Savarese, a Stanford computer scientist, is leading a team developing a robot called JackRabbot, intended for home or campus delivery as well as some tasks in the home. But getting around a house is still difficult, even in a ranch house without stairs, he said.Self-driving cars\u2019 engineers use the technology \u201csimultaneous localization and mapping,\u201d or SLAM, to navigate. It makes it possible to create a map in an unknown environment and place the car accurately. But in a home, with densely packed objects, including humans, that move frequently, SLAM is insufficient, Mr. Savarese said.So could a robot that helps tidy up the house be close?\u201cPicking things off the floor is with in reach if we can get the price of the arm down,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at Berkeley. His favorite for a new market might be what he calls a \u201cdecluttering robot,\u201d which would wander the house picking up after its occupants.\u201cDoing anything time critical is difficult,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201c But if you are willing to leave the house and come back six hours later \u2014 the house is clean.\u201dHis group is also experimenting with a robot that can make a bed \u2014 admittedly slowly, but he argues that it is not a task that has to be done at human speed.The Berkeley researchers are doing their experiments using a robot supplied by the Toyota Research Institute. The automaker is one of at least three large technology companies that have active home robot development projects in Silicon Valley.Many roboticists say they believe that the aging of people around the globe will be the catalyst for the arrival of more sophisticated home robots.\u201cThe demographic shifts of aging society will provide, in our view, a strong opportunity for a market for such a product to start, and that we also expect that what is good for aging society will also end up being helpful for everyone,\u201d said Gill Pratt, the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute.In addition to Toyota, Alphabet\u2019s Google X research laboratory and Amazon have active robotics research efforts that are reportedly aimed at home applications.Despite the new investments in research and development, veteran researchers are conscious that home robots have seemed imminent for decades.\u201cThe problem,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a leading Chinese artificial intelligence researcher who is now a venture investor, \u201cis that low cost plus high expectations plus no patience makes it difficult to make a great product.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the name of a robot being developed at Stanford. It is JackRabbot, not Jackrobbot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venture Capitalist: A.I. Hype Still \u201cHas a Ways to Go Up\u201d", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chief executive of Google has likened artificial intelligence to fire \u2014 a powerful breakthrough that is full of risks.Earlier this year, Google said it would not renew a contract to provide artificial intelligence technology to a Pentagon program after company employees protested. The outcry showed that tech workers \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s most valuable resource \u2014 are powerful, too.Created in 2017, Gradient Ventures has invested in 20 companies, ranging from a start-up that makes software for autonomous vehicles to one that is applying A.I. to biomedical research.Ms. Patterson spoke with The New York Times about data safety, \u201chealthy debate\u201d and the changing attitudes of A.I. entrepreneurs. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Where is A.I. in the hype cycle? I think it has a ways to go up actually. Hype is another word for attention, and so I actually think the attention is warranted because the applications are important.But it is kind of synonymous with the \u201890s \u2014 I lived through it before \u2014 with, the \u201chigh-tech company\u201d or a \u201cdot-com company.\u201d They would say \u201chigh-tech company\u201d in order to kind of gain entree into V.C.s. So, sometimes I am seeing companies that say they are A.I. companies. But one of the lines that I draw is if the math can be done in Excel, it is not an A.I. company.A.I. is at the center of all of our modern ethical issues with things like predictive policing, autonomous weapons and facial recognition. Why do you think that is and do you think it\u2019s fair? I think that a healthy debate is healthy and I think it\u2019s actually good for start-ups. Having the open debate has changed the way the conversation goes with start-ups.Early-stage founders used to not proactively bring up these issues and now they do. So I\u2019m really happy for the open debate. As part of our due diligence process, we have a step called a brainstorm. We were already bringing up these issues as part of the brainstorming process and now I\u2019m pleased that the founders are bringing up the issue.You spent time as vice president of engineering for A.I. at Google. Did it surprise you when Google employees protested the company\u2019s work with the Pentagon?That kind of outcry has gotten a little louder in the last year and not just from Google employees, but other companies as well. Has that changed your investment philosophy or strategy in any way?We have passed on companies that we felt were crossing those lines. For instance, we saw an A.I. camera company and it integrated facial recognition and maybe mall traffic and maybe even your purchases, and we felt that if you were to do a brainstorm with them of where this could go in the future, it might make great sense on (return-on-investment) grounds, and they are getting contracts, but we did not invest because of ethical concerns.Have you noticed a desire to shy away from some of those investments in the broader venture market?They were successful in their raise. But the vast majority, we\u2019re talking 99.9 percent of companies, their only desire is to have applications that help people and they\u2019re all positive.Have you advised companies to not pursue lines of business because of either controversy or ethical reasons? Yeah. Getting a contract takes a long time, and it takes a long time to build the tech that would enable that contract. And so, we haven\u2019t advised someone to change their product, but if they had two different contracts and they said, \u2018Which one should I do?\u2019 I think we would weigh in. Do you think there are any sort of fears \u2014 either of bias, job loss, evil robot overlords, a lack of transparency \u2014 that are overblown? Are there any that are underplayed?So, I mean we\u2019ve all seen instances where, given the wrong data, a learned algorithm can go awry. I wouldn\u2019t call it overblown, but reminding people to be careful when they\u2019re building their products to get the data right, I think we can short-circuit those issues.I think in general, building an A.I. product is sort of like the very early Disney movies. They look magical, but actually when you think about it, somebody had to draw those drawings, like 24 frames a second. It\u2019s just a lot of very hard work, so it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight, which is sometimes the impression that I think people have.I see all the hard work that goes into it and I see that you can\u2019t really be surprised. They don\u2019t just spring fully formed. When you\u2019re deeply involved like that you\u2019re kind of not scared about the process. I\u2019ve seen some members of the community call for a Hippocratic oath among venture capitalists investing in A.I. because of the ethical challenges. What do you think of that idea?We\u2019re publicly saying that we abide by the A.I. principles and I welcome anyone else to say that too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Monrovia, Indiana\u2019 Is a Sharp, Lyrical Look at Small-Town America", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s true that he works in images rather than lines of verse, that the people in his movies speak in plain prose and that his own voice is never heard onscreen, but to pin his work under the documentary rubric seems increasingly misleading. Poetry feels like a better classification. A Wiseman film \u2014 the newest is \u201cMonrovia, Indiana\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t make an argument or tell a story. It\u2019s not trying to raise awareness of a cause or a problem, though awareness is its currency and its reward. You arrive at meaning through patterns and rhythms, and you have to do some work to apprehend the structure and the themes. In return, you arrive at a kind of knowledge that\u2019s impossible to summarize, and also to forget.Monrovia is a town of around 1,000 people (according to the 2010 census) about a 30-minute drive southwest on I-70 from Indianapolis (according to Google Maps). Wiseman and his crew spent time there in what looks like the summer and fall, judging from the changing color of the ripening corn. There are picturesque, pastoral glimpses of cloud-flecked skies and green fields (the cinematographer is John Davey) that suggest the unchanging cycles of rural life.The human reality of the film is more complicated, as you might expect. Wiseman observes people in groups and in public. There are no straight-to-camera interviews or home visits, but rather a tour of the rituals and routines of municipal life as citizens work, shop, eat, argue and play. As usual in a Wiseman film, we sit in on a lot meetings \u2014 of committees and organizations whose business includes zoning, water service and the placement of a park bench. We also visit a pizza place, an antique-car rally, a school and a veterinarian\u2019s office, where a dog is put under general anesthesia so its tail can be cropped.That scene is gross, puzzling and oddly tender \u2014 a thing that happens in the world without context or explanation, and that requires skill, care and concentration on everyone\u2019s part but the dog\u2019s. The surgery\u2019s inclusion can be taken as evidence of Wiseman\u2019s broad curiosity and of his sly sense of humor, a warning to anyone who would try to impose a unifying interpretation on the film.It is, after all, about a slice of red-state America at a time of fierce political polarization. In the wake of the 2016 election, traveling to Monrovia \u2014 a mostly white town in the vice president\u2019s home state \u2014 is hardly an idle or random decision, and the unavoidable political implications of \u201cMonrovia, Indiana\u201d give its observations an undeniable urgency.If one lesson is that there\u2019s more to life than politics, even in politicized times, another is that there is more to democracy than ideology. I\u2019m not evoking some mythical common ground where we all come together in spite of our differences. There are no mythic places in Wiseman\u2019s world, which is a land of practicality and procedure.A teacher \u2014 or maybe he\u2019s a coach of some kind; nobody is identified by name or title in a Wiseman film, unless it comes up naturally in conversation \u2014 delivers a lecture to a group of teenagers about a Hoosier basketball legend named Branch McCracken. The dynamism of the speaker and the boredom of his listeners feel performed, not for the benefit of Wiseman\u2019s cameras so much as to fulfill the terms of a social transaction, one that seems both entirely familiar and deeply absurd.Life is theater. Everyone is simultaneously actor and spectator. The old-timers telling stories in the coffee shop are acting out familiar roles, as are the members of the City Council and the participants in a solemn ritual at the Masonic temple. The minister sending his departed congregant off to glory may be the most obvious and energetic showman in \u201cMonrovia, Indiana,\u201d but that fact, rather than undermining his sincerity, is what confirms it.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "HIAS, the Jewish Agency Criticized by the Shooting Suspect, Has a History of Aiding Refugees", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Mazen Hasan had to flee his native Iraq because his work for the American military had drawn threats on his life, it was a Jewish refugee resettlement agency called HIAS that helped him and his family to settle in Pittsburgh.\u201cThey did everything they can to help us and make it easy to adjust to a new life here,\u201d said Mr. Hasan, 61, an engineer who arrived in the United States in 2014.HIAS is one of nine agencies with contracts from the State Department to help refugees acclimate to the United States. It has aided immigrants with diverse talents from all corners of the world, including the co-founders of Google and WhatsApp.It is also the target of many anti-Semitic rants posted on social media by Robert Bowers, the suspect in the mass shooting on Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2014 including one post published only a few hours before the shooting. Eleven worshipers were killed in the attack.The agency\u2019s local affiliate, Jewish Family and Community Services of Pittsburgh, met the Hasans at the airport when they arrived, drove them to the apartment that had been arranged for the family and shepherded them through the process of getting Social Security numbers, securing medical care and learning how to get around the city on public transportation.The refugees who receive those kinds of services from the nine resettlement agencies, including the International Rescue Committee and several faith-based groups like HIAS, have all been through extensive vetting by the federal government and have been given clearance to enter and reside in the country.Even so, Mr. Bowers\u2019s writings on social media were bitterly hostile to refugees and to the agency that helped them.\u201cHIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,\u201d he said in a post hours before the attack. \u201cI can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201dIn another post, he wrote: \u201cYou like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us? We appreciate the list of friends you have provided.\u201d Alongside it was a link to information on the National Refugee Shabbat Event, celebrated on Oct. 20 at more than 300 Jewish congregations in 33 states.Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, said the climate of political rancor over immigration gave impetus to the national refugee event. \u201cWe felt that at a time when the U.S. is doing less and less for refugees, that we must demonstrate, as a refugee people, that it is more important than ever to continue to welcome refugees as a community,\u201d he said.At a gathering at Congregation Shir Hamaolot in Irvine, Calif., Jackie Menter, a co-founder of the Orange County Jewish Coalition for Refugees, shared her experience working with Middle Eastern and African refugees on the Greek island of Chios last year.She spoke of a Syrian girl who had watched a land mine kill her mother as they were fleeing captivity by the militant group Islamic State, and a man named Mustafa, who returned home to his apartment in the Syrian city of Aleppo to find the entire building bombed out and his wife, children and mother dead.Citing biblical passages about welcoming the stranger, Ms. Menter urged congregants to get involved with HIAS\u2019s efforts to support refugees and asylum seekers. On Saturday night, after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh, she said, \u201cEvil, hatred and racism will not keep justice and mercy from prevailing.\u201dThe Trump administration has sharply reduced the number of people fleeing violence and persecution who are admitted to the United States as refugees, lowering the annual ceiling from the 110,000 set before Mr. Trump took office to 45,000 in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and to 30,000 for fiscal 2019. Delays caused by extra levels of screening ordered by the Trump administration \u2014 targeting especially people from 11 countries, 10 of them predominantly Muslim \u2014 meant that only 22,491 refugees actually arrived in fiscal 2018.Since it began in 1881 in a storefront on the Lower East Side of Manhattan as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, HIAS has assisted millions of people displaced by conflict or persecution, often on account of their religious or political beliefs, to rebuild their lives. Its clients have often been Jews \u2014 its first mission was to aid those fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe \u2014 but the agency has also helped resettle many other kinds of refugees, including thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians after Communist victories in Southeast Asia in the 1970s.\u201cWe used to welcome refugees because they were Jewish,\u201d Mr. Hetfield said. \u201cToday HIAS welcomes refugees because we are Jewish.\u201dThe organization played a role in resettling more than 400,000 Soviet Jews who reached the United States, including the families of Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, who came in 1979 when he was 6, and Jan Koum, a co-founder of WhatsApp, who arrived as a teenager about a decade later.\u201cI would have never had the kinds of opportunities I\u2019ve had here in the Soviet Union, or even in Russia today,\u201d Mr. Brin, who has donated to HIAS, said in a 2009 interview. \u201cI would like to see anyone be able to achieve their dreams, and that\u2019s what this organization does.\u201dRita Sostrin, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles and a former member of HIAS\u2019s board, was once a client. She and her parents, fleeing anti-Semitism, emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987. They were met in Vienna by HIAS representatives who helped them travel on to Rome, where United States officials processed them for resettlement.The family arrived in Minneapolis in 1988. The local HIAS affiliate helped them get on their feet. Ms. Sostrin\u2019s parents found work in their professional fields and she enrolled in college.\u201cComing to the U.S. is the biggest miracle of my life, and it\u2019s thanks to HIAS,\u201d said Ms. Sostrin, 48, who is married with two children, 11 and 9.In Pittsburgh, Mr. Hasan\u2019s extended family has grown to 16, including married adults with American-born children, two of whom are his grandchildren.\u201cWe are happy with the life we have here, which the Jewish agency helped us start,\u201d said Mr. Hasan, who is an observant Muslim. \u201cWhat happened in the synagogue, this is very bad.\u201dAn earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one of the resettlement agencies. It is the International Rescue Committee, not the International Refugee Committee.Advertisement"}

Sears has lost $11 billion since 2011; sales have dropped 60 percent over the same period; and it has closed hundreds of stores. Its C.E.O., Eddie Lampert, has sold off businesses to raise cash, but critics argue that he has strip-mined the company.Filing for bankruptcy is risky for retailers, as doing so tends to send customers and suppliers fleeing, making it hard to recover. There\u2019s no reason to think Sears would fare any differently.That is a huge bet to place on a company with enormous growth, huge ambitions \u2014 and widening losses.Beijing is running out of options in the trade war. One extreme action it could take, as the holder of over $1 trillion in U.S. foreign debt, would be to buy back that debt \u2014 or even to dump it on the open market. Experts tend to dismiss that possibility, as it would severely damage both the American and Chinese economies.There is no proving ground. There is no predictable math, no scale model. If China were to use its nuclear option and the markets didn\u2019t react, it would lose influence in stark fashion. If it worked \u2014 but was more effective than expected \u2014 China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?Beijing\u2019s latest effort to prop up its economy amid a trade war with the U.S. isn\u2019t working yet. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, fell again this week, to below 6.93 per dollar.But the currency doesn\u2019t trade freely: It moves within a range set by the central bank. And a fall in its value can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which is handy when President Trump\u2019s tariffs push up their prices in America.Among the sectors hardest hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s approach are the beverage and auto industries, which rely heavily on foreign aluminum and steel to make cans and cars. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, said this month that higher prices for aluminum imports from Canada were eating into quarterly profits and said it would raise prices as a result. The company lowered its profit forecast for the year and its stock slid. Similarly, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company said last month that the additional costs from the metal tariffs alone would shave about $1 billion off its annual profits.The new trade deal won\u2019t be signed until late November, and it could be amended before then. Some Republican lawmakers have been pushing Mr. Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. That may happen \u2014 or the whole thing could be thrown into limbo if Democrats take back the House.The uncertainty in insider trading law invites debate over the legality of misconduct that has no place in our markets. But this is a fixable problem: The law can be updated and made clearer. Ideally, Congress would take the lead. But bipartisan proposals to update the law have languished for years.

{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}

But my mother stopped answering. A few days later, I asked again and confirmed: 11 years earlier my mother had aborted her pregnancy at 10 weeks.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We couldn\u2019t afford him,\u201d she said. I buried her apologetic excuse in my heart, and never brought up her decision again.But in that moment, my invisible brother was born.I don\u2019t blame my mother for my brother\u2019s absence. When she made her decision, our family had just immigrated to New York from China; my parents were struggling to make rent, much less afford a second son. They worked as waiters at Chinese restaurants. We shared a bathroom in Queens with two other families. My childhood memories involve lots of waiting around to use our communal toilet.I bear scars that make me question whether I would want anyone I love to have shared my childhood. Each afternoon after school, I was left in the care of immigrant neighbors as my parents worked seven days a week to keep their restaurant jobs. Trapped in strangers\u2019 homes, I was never allowed to make any noise. If I misbehaved, they would scream in my face; if I dared shed tears, they would threaten to beat me. Even as an adult I remain unable to make a sound when I cry.I never shared these childhood traumas with my mother even after our family moved to Toronto. But in the days after she revealed her secret, I wondered whether I should have: whether any of those painful stories might have helped validate her decision, and ease the guilt in her eyes.Five years after learning of my mother\u2019s secret, I returned to New York for an internship with a financial firm. I would lean over my cubicle and imagine my brother on the other side. Would he have been a better Excel model-builder? Would we be sharing whisky tonight after work? Perhaps in an alternate universe, could we have become best friends?In the summer of 2015, before I began my M.B.A. at Stanford, I planned a family holiday to New Zealand. After sharing the itinerary with my best friend, Kevin, I suddenly thought to invite him on our trip. After all, I had long called Kevin my brother. I imagined him standing in our family portrait \u2014 and in that moment, nothing ever felt so right.But the words never came out of my mouth: my mind began to ridicule itself instead. After all, I had grown up alone. What did I know of brotherhood, anyway? How I could be a worthy brother for Kevin when I had never been that for anyone else?On that long flight to New Zealand, I found myself missing both that brother I had never met, and the one whom I chose but could never truly call my own.In New Zealand I witnessed the earliest signs of aging in my father. He had often bragged about his skills behind the wheel. But on that trip, we took longer to cover ground than Google Maps estimated. I began to count how often my father needed to take drops to treat his glaucoma; then I discovered tears welling in my eyes as well.In the passenger seat, I spent hours staring at my father\u2019s wrinkles, and listening to the soft melodies of my mother\u2019s snores in the back.Never did I feel more alone, longing for a sibling to share in my pain. Never did I feel more guilt for moving away for college and later abroad for work, never returning to live even a single year in their city after turning 18.Sometimes I found myself resenting my invisible brother \u2014 for never having been born.Sometimes I blame him still.My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly three years. Being a psychologist, she has a habit of psychoanalyzing me; being my partner, she offers feedback on how I could be a better boyfriend.\u201cYou are talking about yourself again!\u201d she complains. \u201cGo fix your only child syndrome!\u201dShe laughs and we embrace, since she is an only child as well. Sometimes I wonder whether our similar upbringing helped connect us. We are both introverts, after growing up in isolation. I immersed myself in fiction to better understand strangers; she will graduate this fall with a doctorate in clinical psychology. Before we met we both worried we would end up alone in old age, a repeat of our childhoods.I often wonder how the birth of my brother might have changed me as a romantic partner. Would I have grown into a more secure or sociable boyfriend? Would I have pursued a career in creative writing rather than business, had I grown up without the understanding that I would one day shoulder my parents\u2019 medical care all by myself?Recently my girlfriend and I have been discussing children. She wants only one child, concerned about her career. I support her despite my preferences for a larger family. But under the covers at night, I sometimes become overwhelmed with what feels like intense mourning. I twist in bed and ponder my mother\u2019s decision nearly a quarter-century ago \u2014 and the butterfly effects my brother\u2019s absence has had on my childhood, my career and even my relationship with the woman I plan to marry. Then I fall asleep and dream.I imagine Thanksgiving, Chinese New Year and Christmas \u2014 my family of loved ones and friends gathered around a wooden dining table \u2014 and there he is in the corner, sitting beside my mother and laughing at another of my father\u2019s awful jokes. My sibling\u2019s face is blurred but my heart recognizes him instantly. And then I know that I would not trade him for any sum of riches, any promise of fame or success \u2014 this invisible brother I never met.Advertisement"}

But defense work is already part of Silicon Valley\u2019s DNA.Ms. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the origins of Silicon Valley.It may not be a popular position, but Mr. Bezos\u2019s comments reveal an important truth: The Pentagon has been part of the Silicon Valley story all along. Defense contracts during and after World War II turned Silicon Valley from a somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet. The American tech economy rests on the foundations of the military-industrial complex. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment.The result is an enduring technological optimism. Early Silicon Valley didn\u2019t have a J. Robert Oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation. Instead, it had an ebullient regional booster, Fred Terman, an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn Stanford from a middling school with a good football team into an engineering powerhouse.Big defense certainly made its mark. The region\u2019s biggest employer from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War was Lockheed. Local start-ups of the time also benefited, and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds, not necessarily military ones. Take, for example, David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. An outspoken critic of government overreach, Packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things. \u201cI think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money,\u201d he once told HP executives. \u201cWhile this is an important result of a company\u2019s existence, we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being.\u201dThe next generation of Silicon Valley technologists took these sentiments further. They grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money; their first encounters with computers were often in government-funded university labs. Yet by the time they graduated from college in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of them wanted nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. So they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life. They stayed in academia, moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer-education centers and community message boards.Then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture, part cowboy. \u201cThe personal computer operator is the Electronic Man on Horseback riding into the (sinking) Western sun,\u201d declared a columnist in the newsletter InfoWorld in 1980. \u201cHe is the last of the rugged individualists, and the personal computer is his only effective weapon.\u201dWhether their employees realize it or not, today\u2019s tech giants all contain some defense-industry DNA. The result is the conflicted identity we now see in Silicon Valley. Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s how to determine whether your purchase will stand the test of time.As my daughter said, it\u2019s \u201c3-D printing in real time.\u201d But the pen is fun to use and a great example of \u201cuncomplicated\u201d tech. There\u2019s no byzantine software to learn. In fact, you don\u2019t need a computer to use it, and you can get up-and-running quickly. In many ways, it\u2019s a model of how all consumer technology should be, and what sets the tech that stands the test of time from the gear that\u2019s forgotten in a year or two: It\u2019s uncomplicated. But Mr. Zeldman said that in the past 20 years, there has been a shift. The products that have been most successful, particularly digital products and services, \u201chaven\u2019t been the most advanced, sophisticated or beautiful, necessarily,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut they were the ones that understood what consumers wanted to do and enabled them to do it.\u201d This is what made Amazon, Google and Apple so powerful. This notion can also be used to discover why products fail. Take Microsoft\u2019s misstep in redesigning the Windows 8 operating system: The move was almost universally panned for removing the hallmark \u201cStart\u201d button users had come to rely on. The new \u201cMetro\u201d tiled interface was certainly sophisticated and attractive, reflected how the market was changing, and incorporated mobile-friendly design elements. But it misunderstood what consumers wanted \u2014 namely a consistent starting point. The key to determining whether some new piece of technology, whether it\u2019s a gadget, app or website, will work for you \u2014 and better yet, stand the test of time \u2014 is how uncomplicated it is, and how easy it is to do what the product is designed to do. Here are a few factors to help you evaluate before you sign up, or spend your money. For most things, you may only need a very simple product or app. Those who may want more sophistication will have to spend time finding a full-featured alternative. \u201cIf there\u2019s a learning curve,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cdoes it teach you a new way to think about that subject and make you better at what you do?\u201d If so, that product might be worth it. If you buy a high-end camera, you can learn how to shoot a vast array of creative photos. But if you\u2019re just shooting simple selfies, you might be wasting your money. \u201cIf I\u2019m downloading an app from Apple\u2019s app store, I read the reviews first. I study the screenshots there, since they\u2019re representative of the app,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m interested in downloading a photo app, but if the filters are ugly in the screenshot, I know it\u2019s not for me.\u201d It\u2019s also O.K. to stop using a cheap or inexpensive app after you\u2019ve downloaded it. \u201cOne of the great things about apps is that you can also try out a limited-feature version (only certain elements of the app are turned on), and see if it works for you before you decide to pay for the full product,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. It\u2019s difficult, but not impossible, to try out hardware like a camera or speaker. See if you can borrow a friend\u2019s device to try it out. Or try renting one. With a large item, like a TV, visit a friend who has bought the same (or similar) product and see how it works. As a teacher, I find this to be a valuable gauge of how much the company really cares. A stand-alone scanner I once bought had a manual that stopped midway through the instructions \u2014 not surprisingly, I rarely used that scanner. Conversely, a digital camera I once reviewed had a number of simple, well-illustrated tip sections built right into the camera menu, which were invaluable to a novice and even helpful for experienced shooters. Obviously, this is easier if you\u2019re not out a lot of money. \u201cIf an app isn\u2019t helping me,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cI just wipe it off my phone and don\u2019t give it another thought.\u201d The reviews might be good and it might be well regarded, but don\u2019t bother with it if it doesn\u2019t suit your needs. As for pricey gadgets, you\u2019ll want to do research beforehand. However, the same philosophy applies: After you\u2019ve done your research, if the product in question doesn\u2019t suit your needs or budget, walk away. Return it or, better yet, sell it. If you\u2019re looking for tech that\u2019s uncomplicated, you can\u2019t really make an assessment if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s available or what\u2019s changed. If you were looking for a high-end camera 10 years ago, the best viewfinders were through-the-lens viewfinders found on digital single-lens reflex cameras. At the time, electronic viewfinders were mediocre, grainy and inferior. Today\u2019s electronic viewfinders, though are just about as clear and sharp. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Turns Over Identities of Bloggers on Benfica", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe information was turned over as part of a lawsuit filed by the team, the Lisbon-based Benfica, earlier this year in United States District Court in California as part of an effort to stop the bloggers.Benfica, the serial national champion, has been battling a tide of leaked information for much of the past year that has cast a negative shadow over it . The leaks have been drip-fed onto a specially created website since December, producing sensational headlines and leading to a crisis within a club that counts some of the country\u2019s most important politicians and business figures as members.However, Benfica was unable to stop the leaks through Portugal\u2019s legal system. So the club, a two-time European champion, turned in April to California\u2019s courts. It issued subpoenas to Google and a handful of other companies that own the platforms used by the bloggers.The efforts have paid off. \u201cWe only confirm that we made agreements with those digital platforms,\u201d said a spokesman for Benfica. He declined to provide further details of the information the team received.In a statement, Google said it complied with the legal process. \u201cGoogle gave notice to impacted users who then had an opportunity to challenge the legal process in a U.S. court,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the company.The owner of the popular Artista do Dia blog is among those whose user identity has very likely been passed on to Benfica by Google. He received an email from Google in September telling him he could try to quash Benfica\u2019s demand through a legal challenge.Faced with thousands of dollars of legal fees, the author, whose identity The New York Times has been confirmed, was only able to reply with an impassioned email, in which he outlined that he had not been responsible for the leak, and like many others, had written about a subject of enormous public interest.\u201cI thought Google and billions of users of Google services were protected by a company with principles and, above all, respect for users who trust their platforms,\u201d said the writer, a professional services worker with two children. \u201cI think it opens a very serious precedent that will only allow those with financial possibilities to remain anonymous.\u201dBenfica\u2019s status within Portugal is immense. The team counts at least half of the country\u2019s 10 million citizens as fans, the weight of which gives it a greater cultural and social significance than most ordinary sports teams. Even in good times, details of exploits inside its Estadio da Luz home dominate local media.The leaks, which began last year, have purported to show influence peddling schemes that targeted top soccer officials and, perhaps most worryingly for the club, efforts to influence the refereeing system. Benfica denies wrongdoing. It has separately been charged with illegally obtaining confidential information from a mole working inside the justice ministry.Albert Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said under current regulations Google had little option but to comply with Benfica\u2019s subpoena. Internet companies get hundreds of thousands of similar requests, said Gidari, who spent 20 years representing some of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies including Google. \u201cIt isn\u2019t scalable to know what\u2019s behind each case,\u201d he said.Google already goes \u201cone step beyond\u201d what it is required to do by giving notice of the subpoena to users, he added.Benfica\u2019s search for the bloggers and web users has dominated the headlines since The New York Times first reported on the issue earlier this month. Benfica fans have also tried to unmask the identity of those behind the blogs. In at least one case, the name and photograph of a man suspected of being one of the bloggers was widely circulated on the internet but turned out to be wrong.Fans of Benfica\u2019s rivals, Sporting Clube de Portugal and F.C. Porto, are behind most of the blogs the team is targeting for legal action. Benfica alleges the two other teams are part of a conspiracy to discredit it, a claim that is typical in soccer in Portugal, where club executives frequently launch allegations against one another. The leaks first appeared on a weekly television show on Porto\u2019s channel, before a website called O Mercado de Benfica appeared in December 2017.Porto\u2019s communications director Francisco Marques said he received the data anonymously from an individual purporting to be a fan of the club. Marques said he passed all the files he received to the police. He suspects the website publishing the leaked information is run by the same person.In its lawsuit in California, Benfica claimed the details published online were \u201ctrade secrets\u201d that buttressed its success in winning championships and cultivated an academy system that generated \u201cmore than any other club in the world\u201d in player sales this decade. The claim did not mention police raids on Benfica\u2019s offices or ongoing investigations into alleged results manipulation and corruption it faces.\u201cDespite commencing numerous actions, both civil and criminal, in Portugal, Benfica has thus far been unable to stem the tide of stolen information or identify the thieves. It is clear to Benfica that only with the cooperation of the hosting organizations will Benfica be able to stop the campaign to discredit it,\u201d its U.S. lawyers wrote.Gidari, the former privacy lawyer, said the suit seemed similar to others brought by other large organizations confronting the public disclosure of damaging information.He added that though in some cases there may be valid reasons behind subpoenas, they are often \u201cstrategic lawsuits brought to silence critics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Squeezes Out More Profit as Sales Growth Slows", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon\u2019s profits were hit or miss for its first couple of decades. But now, for the first time, they are starting to look consistent \u2014 with four consecutive quarters above $1 billion in profit.On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. But the focus on profit that investors have long sought wasn\u2019t enough to keep them happy. The company\u2019s shares dropped more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading, after Amazon also announced that revenue in its core retail business was growing more slowly than in the past.The company\u2019s sales were up 29 percent to $56.6 billion, below what analysts had predicted. In Amazon\u2019s biggest business, its online store, sales rose just 11 percent over the past year. A year ago, the pace was twice as quick.\u201cThey are saturating the core market in the U.S. for e-commerce,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who leads Amazon research for Gartner L2. \u201cThis is a company in transition right now,\u201d moving from a focus on acquiring more customers to getting more growth from people who already shop the site.Profit was up in part because Amazon\u2019s leadership has focused on trimming costs to counteract the slower growth. \u201cWe have really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters.He said the company saved money by redeploying engineers rather than hiring more new staff and being more efficient in its warehouses and data centers. About 613,000 people now work at Amazon, up 13 percent from the same time last year. Mr. Olsavsky said that over the course of 2017, the number of employees jumped 38 percent, not including its new Whole Foods workers.\u201cThe theme will be banking some of the investment from prior years,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said in a later call with analysts.Amazon has made a push in recent months to get more out of its high-margin areas, especially its industry-leading cloud computing services, a huge business with 31 percent operating margins this quarter.Its Prime memberships are another area: This year, Amazon raised the annual price of a Prime Membership by 20 percent, to $119. The number of new members signing up for Prime has been slowing, down to just 1 to 2 percent a quarter, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a firm that surveys users for brands and investors.Those lucrative markets let Amazon plow cash into new businesses that require intense physical investments and engineering talent, like expanding fast grocery delivery or building out its Alexa ecosystem. \u201cNow the investment is not a cycle \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d said Brian Nowak, who researches Amazon at Morgan Stanley.The company has been spending heavily in its international operations, in particular India, looking for its next enormous consumer market. International sales were up just 15 percent over the previous year, to $15.5 billion. Amazon\u2019s international sales are not profitable, though the margins are improving.As part of the wage increase, Amazon ended the bonus and stock grants it had been giving workers, which analysts estimated would offset some of the costs, as would increased efficiencies using robotics. Mr. Olsavsky declined to provide details of the costs associated with the new wage.\u201cOne of Amazon\u2019s weapons against competitors is the confidence of Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cto be able to show that when we start a new business in a new category, we can send the value of legacy businesses in those industries plummeting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year. Beijing could struggle to contain this latest debt bubble.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Urban Planning Guru Says Driverless Cars Won\u2019t Fix Congestion", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Peter Calthorpe thinks Silicon Valley has it all wrong. He rejects the ideas of tech industry visionaries who say personal autonomous vehicles will soon be the solution to urban problems like traffic congestion.Mr. Calthorpe is a Berkeley-based urban planner who is one of the creators of New Urbanism, which promotes mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods. His designs emphasize the proximity of housing, shopping and public space.He is not opposed to autonomous vehicles. Mr. Calthorpe\u2019s quarrel is with the idea that the widespread adoption of personally owned self-driving cars will solve transportation problems. In fact, he worries it will lead to more urban congestion and suburban sprawl.Mr. Calthorpe believes that in trying to solve a very hard technical problem, Silicon Valley is ignoring an easier application for autonomous technology that has the potential to quickly change mass transit and help solve the Valley\u2019s housing crisis. It starts with backing away from solo car trips.A popular claim by the advocates of self-driving cars is that not only will they be safer than human-driven cars, but they will lead to fewer cars, faster commutes and a radical rethinking of cities where finding a place to park is no longer a priority.But Mr. Calthorpe, citing a range of transportation studies, has simulated through computer models the impact of self-driving vehicles in urban settings. He argues that if they are used the way today\u2019s vehicles are \u2014 carrying a single individual in most cases \u2014 they will lead to more congestion.When it is easier to travel in a city in self-driving cars, Mr. Calthorpe said, everyone will want to do so. And when self-driving vehicles are more affordable \u2014 which could take years to happen \u2014 people who currently rely on public transit while running their errands will instead send their cars to pick up the groceries and the dry cleaning, adding significantly to what Mr. Walters and other urban planners call \u201ctotal vehicle miles.\u201dHe used his software to show that by changing just commercial zoning to permit higher density along El Camino Real \u2014 the 45-mile boulevard that stretches through the heart of Silicon Valley from San Francisco to San Jose \u2014 it would be possible add more than a quarter-million housing units.The Valley\u2019s housing crisis can be explained in data that shows that since 2010, the region has added 11 jobs for every new home built; the median home price has reached $934,000; and rents have gone up 60 percent since 2012. One of the consequences of the growing imbalance between housing and jobs is the increasing traffic and congestion, according to an Urban Footprint report.To avoid congestion, the plan requires efficient mass transit. Mr. Calthorpe has proposed an alternative \u2014 autonomous rapid transit, or ART \u2014 using fleets of self-driving vans in reserved lanes on main arteries like El Camino Real. Those lanes would allow the vehicles to travel faster and require a lower level of autonomous technology. And the vans could travel separately or be connected together.A recent study that Urban Footprint did in collaboration with Fehr & Peers determined that an autonomous rapid transit system, which could be built today, would be twice as fast as a conventional bus and cost a little more than half as much to operate.Mr. Calthorpe\u2019s plan is an evolution of the concept of \u201ctransit-oriented development\u201d he pioneered while teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1980s. It focuses on designing urban communities that encourage people to live near transit services and decrease their dependence on driving.The idea has attracted the attention of public transit activists in Southern California.Mr. Zane said the ART technology would dovetail nicely with a planning idea called Grand Boulevards, which has been funded by two ballot propositions in the Los Angeles region and has until now been focused on a human-driven system known as bus rapid transit.Most recent Silicon Valley start-ups have focused on personal vehicles rather than mass transit. But in July, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, announced a partnership with Valley Metro in the Phoenix region to develop a transportation system that would look very much like Mr. Calthorpe\u2019s ART concept.To gain broad acceptance for his idea, however, Mr. Calthorpe needs to convince city officials like Lenny Siegel, the mayor of Mountain View, where Google is based.Mr. Siegel is a veteran community activist whose focus is on the imbalance between jobs and housing and the impact of the long commutes made by people who work in the city. He also has expressed concerns about anything that will affect the flow of conventional automobile traffic.Mountain View is trying to plan for a future that will require moving as many as 40,000 people back and forth each day from the CalTrain railroad corridor that runs between San Francisco and San Jose to workplaces like Google. Currently, city planners envision an autonomous system like the one that Mr. Calthorpe envisions, but on an elevated track.Mr. Calthorpe insists that planners need to take bold steps and argues that rethinking major boulevards like El Camino by filling in with denser housing and adding a more efficient autonomous transit system is the best place to start.\u201cYou have to redesign the street itself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to add autonomous transit, and you need to get rid of parallel parking and put in bikeways and better sidewalks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Choire Sicha, the editor of the Styles desk at The Times, which reports on everything from weddings and fashion to social change and self-care, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What does your tech setup look like? And what do you do to make it look stylish?Why do we do that? I use this phone more than I use my office laptop. I use this phone more than I use any other device in my life, including my television. Sometimes instead of turning on the television I will just watch television on my phone. Don\u2019t tell David Lynch!I also should stop calling it my phone, because I do not make phone calls on it, because phones are fairly useless as phones and mostly because the phones are infested with incessant spam calls that apparently, as with school shootings, food-borne illness incidents and the removal of registered voters from the rolls, we are incapable as a society of preventing in any way. Also, because I am on an Android phone (a Pixel XL), none of my friends will text with me, and it makes me sad. They love their beloved iMessage on their beloved, stupid iPhones. Companies don\u2019t care about us, or at least not me. They care about themselves (and about not paying taxes in America, and I get that, truly, I have been there myself).My phone does have a New York Fashion Week PopSocket on it, though, and I\u2019m a real PopSocket convert! It makes reading in bed great again. What\u2019s so janky about your setup? What features or tools are on your wish list to make it better?My phone is ragged now. We barely made it. The screen is horribly burned in. It\u2019s hot. When I plug it in, it begins to download and update things and everything freezes. It smells a little bad?And now the decision time is here, and I\u2019m unhappy. The more I\u2019m put in the position of deciding whether I will spend more than $1,000 on a \u201cphone\u201d (as the prime large-size offering from each of the three major companies ends up being more than two weeks\u2019 take-home pay for a Whole Foods employee) or daringly branch out into the slightly less premier brands, the more I realize how awful it is that these disgusting, beeping, needy Tamagotchis are my most constant companion. I have a more active friendship and, to be honest, romantic life with my phone than I do with almost any humans. Can this be good for me? Am I an experiment?At the very least I would like them to make digital devices that aren\u2019t incredibly fragile and scratchable. Right now, until they just punch the circuitry into the back of our skull, like the way they murder cows, we have to carry these things around as if they were tiny flat glass babies.In the end, as you can see in the pictures, I finally bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 9.How has tech affected style?The biggest trend around the world is that nearly every man now has a worn-in rectangle in the front pocket of his jeans. I also predict that hand-enlargement surgery for women will briefly become a trend until the time of the, you know, putting the phones into the skull bones. Then there are no more worries!The best part of how they\u2019ll put the phone in our heads is that when the seawaters all rise, the phone will be the last part of us to get wet.What other tech product are you currently obsessed with? This setup saves marriages and also soothes cats. If you sleep in silence next to someone, you are doing it wrong! The tongue of this whooshing envelope, if you will, actually intrudes into my person in the form of a small plastic mandibular advancement device. It\u2019s a kind of fancy mouth guard, and the technological arms race around sleep apnea is fascinating. For instance, while I was being fitted with this device \u2014 it gently juts the jaw forward, basically, allowing you to breathe while you sleep and not rush toward death as quickly \u2014 it was casually mentioned that if it didn\u2019t fit handily, they could install little bumps on my teeth that would fit into slots in the device, locking it in overnight, in a real steampunk nightmare of medical intervention. It fit.Does your lover or spouse report that your snoring is terrible? Do you feel exhausted in the morning? Do you feel like you have a cold all the time but you don\u2019t? Do you wake up suddenly at night screaming in panic? No, wait, that last one\u2019s normal. The rest of you, visit an otorhinolaryngologist today!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Meddling Is a Symptom, Not the Disease", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore worrisome than foreign interference in our elections is how our own tech and media companies feed and profit from our deepening domestic political polarization.Dr. Tufekci is a professor who studies the social effects of technology.Given the credible evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s only natural that Americans are concerned about the possibility of further foreign interference, especially as the midterms draw closer.But I worry that we\u2019re focusing too much on the foreign part of the problem \u2014 in which social media accounts and pages controlled by overseas \u201ctroll factories\u201d post false and divisive material \u2014 and not enough on how our own domestic political polarization feeds into the basic business model of companies like Facebook and YouTube.It\u2019s this interaction \u2014 both aspects of which are homegrown \u2014 that fosters the dissemination of false and divisive material, and this will persist as a major problem even in the absence of concerted foreign efforts.Consider some telling exchanges from this year\u2019s Senate hearings involving high-level executives from Facebook and Twitter. (Google, which owns YouTube, didn\u2019t bother sending a comparable representative.) In April, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, pressed Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on how much money the company had made by ads placed by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory. Mr. Zuckerberg replied that it was about $100,000 \u2014 a negligible amount of money for the company.Last month, Ms. Harris further grilled Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, on this point, demanding to know how much inauthentic Russian content was on Facebook. Ms. Sandberg had her sound bite ready, saying that \u201cany amount is too much,\u201d but she ultimately threw out an estimate of .004 percent, another negligible amount.Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have business models that thrive on the outrageous, the incendiary and the eye-catching, because such content generates \u201cengagement\u201d and captures our attention, which the platforms then sell to advertisers, paired with extensive data on users that allow advertisers (and propagandists) to \u201cmicrotarget\u201d us at an individual level.Traditional media outlets, of course, are frequently also cynical manipulators of sensationalistic content, but social media is better able to weaponize it. Algorithms can measure what content best \u201cengages\u201d each user and can target him or her individually in a way that the sleaziest editor of a broadcast medium could only dream of.Mr. Parscale said that Facebook turned out to be so useful that the Trump campaign spent most of its budget of $94 million on the platform, and in response, Facebook helpfully embedded staff members with the Trump campaign (as it does with major advertisers) to help it spend its money more effectively.Microtargeting, while lucrative for Silicon Valley, brings with it many other problems. Investigators at ProPublica found that Facebook was allowing advertisers to post job and housing ads that specifically excluded African-Americans, and even made it possible for people to select \u201cJew-haters\u201d as a category to reach with paid messaging. The American Civil Liberties Union found that Facebook was allowing employers to show jobs only to men or to younger employees \u2014 excluding women and older workers.In response to a barrage of criticism, Facebook has agreed to make all advertisements on its site available on a public database and limit some forms of microtargeting, but we still don\u2019t know exactly what happened in 2016: What features of Facebook were used to help the Trump campaign find the voters who could be subject to this \u201cvoter suppression\u201d effort? How was the platform used to test the messages that might be most effective at this?Wall Street is under no illusion about how things work for these companies. When Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would try to do better \u2014 even if it hurt profits \u2014 and when Twitter started purging bots, bringing down the number of \u201cusers\u201d the company can report, their stock prices dropped because of worries about their long-term profitability.It is understandable that legislators and the public are concerned about other countries meddling in our elections. But foreign meddling is to our politics what a fever is to tuberculosis: a mere symptom of a deeper problem. To heal, we need the correct diagnosis followed by action that treats the underlying diseases. The closer our legislators look at our own domestic politics as well as Silicon Valley\u2019s business model, the better the answers they will find.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Neighbor Bro Smashes My Romantic Fantasy", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveShe hoped her new apartment would lead to a relationship within its walls, not a parade of hookups outside of them.\u201cAre you sure you can afford it?\u201d she asked as I signed the contract. \u201cMaybe your boyfriend will move in and help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d I said.\u201cLili was alone when she moved in,\u201d she said, referring to the previous tenant who had shown me the apartment. \u201cBut then she met Nathan and they lived there for five years.\u201d She leaned in closer. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have a boyfriend now, but you will soon.\u201d Then she winked, as if to say: It worked for Lili; it will work for you too.The apartment was big and cheap for Bushwick, with exposed brick and wood floors that were perfectly distressed. It was a good place to live alone \u2014 on a busy street that felt safe at night, and within five subway stops of my closest friends. But it was also big enough for two people, with a bonus room in the middle of the apartment and an extra closet for spare clothing.As someone who could be described as super single, I felt optimistic about a place seemingly so eager to accommodate a couple.The apartment was also a short walk from a loft rented by two friends of mine and a rotation of roommates who occupied the extra bedrooms. Most of the people I got to know my first year in the city I had met at parties at the loft, and every man I dated or thought about dating in Brooklyn had lived there. The loft was like a gallery of romantic prospects for me, and living nearby seemed like a move in the right direction.Even though I could barely afford the rent, I treated my apartment like my forever home. I caulked the drafty windows. I hung wall art. I bought furniture for the space that was once a second bedroom and now would be an underutilized formal dining room.One day I came home to an Amazon Prime delivery in Lili\u2019s name, somehow mistakenly delivered to the address long after she moved. A couple months later, after several unsuccessful attempts to return the package, I finally opened it. Inside were two throw blankets and a teakettle similar to ones I\u2019d been planning to buy for myself. It was like a housewarming gift paid backward.Somehow, though, none of this had the desired effect on my love life. One man was so intimidated to see that I owned not only a microwave but also a table to put it on, that he immediately demanded to know my salary. (Less than his, which he took as a relief). Another tried to give his unwanted furniture to me when he moved out of the loft because I had the space for it. (I took a clothing rack and refused the rest.)On a visit home to Michigan I met up with a friend for dinner to complain about my perpetual singleness.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re supposed to meet anyone,\u201d she said.I described the loft as a factory churning out eligible men for me, when in fact it had produced only a few failed prospects.She was no stranger to romantic disappointment herself but had recently met the love of her life, quickly adopting the beatific optimism of the well paired.\u201cMaybe someone new will move in,\u201d she said. But when I told her the loft was about to be emptied of tenants and renovated, she burst out laughing despite herself.\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, repeating what was becoming a mantra. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t someone for everyone. Lots of people end up alone.\u201dSoon the new owners began their work on the loft, reconfiguring the units into smaller apartments, and everyone I knew who lived there moved out. Then I got fired. I had to ask my parents for help with rent while I collected unemployment and posted my place on Airbnb. I did everything I could to keep the apartment.And then a man did arrive.He moved into the apartment next door, and I hated him at first sound. He talked in what I called Bro Voice (like vocal fry, but for men) and rode a skateboard around the neighborhood whenever he wasn\u2019t banging heavy objects into one of our shared walls. I quickly dubbed him Neighbor Bro.Neighbor Bro smoked indoors, kept his shoes in the hallway and once woke me up by assembling Ikea furniture at 3 a.m. the night before my first day at a new job. I hated him more than any neighbor I\u2019d ever had, including one who stole my bike and one who hung an old medicine cabinet in the hallway filled with handmade clay animals.According to my landlord, Neighbor Bro had learned about the apartment from my upstairs neighbor, which made sense, because she was also fond of late-night construction projects.Soon after he moved in, I thought I could hear Neighbor Bro slipping up to her apartment some evenings for what would turn out to be exceptionally loud late-night hookups, occupying the otherwise dull hours between 2 and 5 a.m. by slamming her bed frame into the wall above my head with a vigor that seemed to threaten the structural integrity of the building.I didn\u2019t want to be the angry spinster banging on the ceiling with a broom while her neighbors had sex upstairs. But I also needed sleep, so I kept a broom in the bedroom and knocked on the ceiling whenever my upstairs neighbor made other offending noises past the quiet hour of 12 a.m. I hoped she could deduce that if I could hear her vacuuming her bedroom at midnight, I could definitely hear Neighbor Bro rattling her bed frame at 3 a.m., but this never seemed to dawn on her.Sometimes when I\u2019d knock on the ceiling, Neighbor Bro would yell \u201cWhat?\u201d \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t tell which apartment his voice was coming from.Apparently their arrangement was a casual one, and soon other women were showing up at his door late at night throughout the week, permitting little peace for me on the other side of the wall. One night he spent a couple of hours with the woman upstairs, then returned to his own apartment for his second hookup of the night, while I slept on my couch to escape the noise coming through every shared wall, floor and ceiling between us.I think anyone would be pushed to the edge by this point, but it seems like a particular torture for the interminably celibate to have another person\u2019s sex life forced on her in surround sound.So I left Neighbor Bro a note full of practical suggestions to remedy the situation \u2014 felt pads, a thick rug \u2014 and in return he left an angry screed taped to my door, signed with his phone number and instructions to \u201ctext him if he\u2019s being loud.\u201d (Um, no.)He complained about my loud vacuuming, even though I don\u2019t own a vacuum, and the sound of what he thought were my own late-night romps. Sometimes, he said, he would call his roommate into the room to bear witness to the noise before \u201cthe show was over.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. Either the sound was coming from another apartment in the building, or there were two 20-something men with their ears to my wall listening to me \u2014 put away my laundry?Indignant, I started to draft a rebuttal in my head, but there\u2019s no way to say, \u201cI can guarantee you no one is having sex in this apartment!\u201d and come out sounding like a winner. So I decided to move.A friend was separating from her husband and looking for a roommate. I had always preferred to live by myself, but living in my apartment meant for two had forced me to consider how much nicer it would be to share a home, to have someone else take turns emptying the trash and picking fights with the neighbors.She and I started looking at listings together, and I tried to feel better about giving up my apartment by thinking of all the things I didn\u2019t like about it. We would move to a quieter neighborhood where together we could afford a duplex with a yard I had always wanted, a fantasy involving neither the perfect apartment nor the perfect man.One lesson I learned: You can\u2019t will the right man into your life simply by planning for him.Rebecca Woodward is a freelance writer and social media strategist based in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Thermometer Tells Your Temperature, Then Tells Firms Where to Advertise", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of what we do \u2014 the websites we visit, the places we go, the TV shows we watch, the products we buy \u2014 has become fair game for advertisers. Now, thanks to internet-connected devices in the home like smart thermometers, ads we see may be determined by something even more personal: our health.This flu season, Clorox paid to license information from Kinsa, a tech start-up that sells internet-connected thermometers that are a far cry from the kind once made with mercury and glass. The thermometers sync up with a smartphone app that allows consumers to track their fevers and symptoms, making it especially attractive to parents of young children.The data showed Clorox which ZIP codes around the country had increases in fevers. The company then directed more ads to those areas, assuming that households there may be in the market for products like its disinfecting wipes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends disinfecting surfaces to help prevent the flu or its spread.It is unique, Kinsa says, because it comes straight from someone\u2019s household in real time. People don\u2019t have to visit a doctor, search their symptoms on Google or post to Facebook about their fever for the company to know where a spike might be occurring.\u201cThe challenge with Google search or social media or mining any of those applications is you\u2019re taking a proxy signal \u2014 you\u2019re taking someone talking about illness rather than actual illness,\u201d said Inder Singh, the founder and chief executive of Kinsa. Search queries and social media can also be complicated by news coverage of flu season, he said, while data from the C.D.C. is often delayed and comes from hospitals and clinics rather than homes.Christine Bannan, the consumer protection counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that even though Kinsa appeared to be using the information in a privacy-compliant manner, its business model highlights the need for federal regulation around how consumer data is handled.\u201cUltimately there should be a more uniform standard and it shouldn\u2019t be up to the whims of each company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s less of a privacy question and more of an ethical question on what we think is acceptable for targeting people who are ill and what safeguards we want to have around that.\u201dKinsa sells its data to other companies under the name Kinsa Insights. While Mr. Singh declined to share the names of other customers, citing confidentiality agreements, he said other companies had used the data to target advertising. It has also been used by pharmacies and manufacturers that make and distribute medicines and cough and cold products to keep retailers\u2019 shelves full with flu-related products when fevers spike in certain areas, he said.One model of Kinsa\u2019s thermometer plugs straight into phones, while another child-friendly version looks like Elmo from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d The company said that most app users opt to share their location and that Kinsa does not link the information to phone numbers or email addresses.\u201cWe take data from our users, we aggregate it, we do all sorts of machine-learning techniques with it and combine it with other data sets and what we ultimately get is a signal,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cThat\u2019s on a ZIP code basis and county-by-county basis.\u201dHe said the data provided unique insight into flu-related illness in specific areas. \u201cWe can tell you if it\u2019s high or low, whether it\u2019s rising, if it\u2019s bigger than the three- or five- year average, when it\u2019s going to peak and how severe the symptoms are, too,\u201d Mr. Singh said.Clorox used that information to increase digital ad spending to sicker areas and pull back in places that were healthier. Consumer interactions with Clorox\u2019s disinfectant ads increased by 22 percent with the data, according to a Kinsa Insights case study that tracked performance between November 2017 and March of this year. That number was arrived at by measuring the number of times an ad was clicked on, the amount of time a person spent with the ad and other undisclosed metrics, according to Vikram Sarma, senior director of marketing in Clorox\u2019s cleaning division.Being able to target ads in this way is a big shift from even seven years ago, when the onset of cold and cough season meant buying 12 weeks of national TV ads that \u201cwould be irrelevant for the majority of the population,\u201d Mr. Sarma said. The flu ultimately reaches the whole country each year, but it typically breaks out heavily in one region first and then spreads slowly to others.While social media offered new opportunities, there has been \u201ca pretty big lag\u201d between tweets about the flu or flulike symptoms and the aggregation of that data for marketers to use, he said.\u201cWhat this does is help us really target vulnerable populations where we have a clear signal about outbreaks,\u201d Mr. Sarma said.Mr. Singh, who was an executive vice president at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, said that Kinsa worked only with clients that can help with its mission of preventing the spread of illness through early detection. It made sense to work with Clorox, he said, because of the C.D.C. recommendation about disinfecting.While Kinsa has a public health mission, other smart-device companies may not have similar mind-sets, Ms. Bannan said.\u201cI can just think of how cigarette and alcohol companies could use strategies like this, or other industries that could really have more harmful effects on people,\u201d she said.Kinsa can make recommendations to individuals in certain situations, Mr. Singh said, pointing to its partnership with Teladoc, a telemedicine company.

{"Headline": "IBM Takes Cybersecurity Training on the Road", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years ago, IBM opened one of the nation\u2019s first commercial cybersecurity ranges in Cambridge, Mass., to let companies practice responding to simulated cyberattacks. It describes the experience as \u201ca game of Clue mixed with a Disney roller-coaster ride.\u201dThe experience proved so popular \u2014 about 2,000 people, including chief executives and entire corporate boards, have played IBM\u2019s game, which has an eight-month waiting list \u2014 that IBM decided to build a second range.But this time, it\u2019s going mobile.While companies are scrambling to get up to speed, they can\u2019t always send an entire team away for a few days of training on how to spot and respond to a cyberattack.Starting Monday the company is introducing its mobile cyber command center, tucked into a heavily customized semitrailer truck. What IBM calls its \u201ccyber tactical operations center\u201d will make stops at college campuses and security-focused events before heading to Europe for a lengthy tour.Officially, the trailer is intended for cybersecurity education and as a mobile response unit. Unofficially, it\u2019s also a playground packed with tech bling where geeks can experiment with ways to combat cyberattacks that have yet to be imagined.\u201cPeople have put all kinds of cool things into trailers, but nobody has ever put a cyber command center into one before,\u201d said Caleb Barlow, a vice president at IBM Security, where he leads the companys X-Force Threat Intelligence organization and created the Cambridge range.It also crammed in 20,000 feet of networking cable, two satellite dishes with cellular links, a generator-fueled power plant and a light tower with the intensity of 60 car headlights. Its data center, stuffed with server racks and multimedia controls, fits into a space the size of a large refrigerator.On the road, the truck looks like any other shipping trailer hauling goods. But when it parks, it unfolds and triples its size. Beneath an extended canopy, IBM can unfurl a command post with 22 Mac-equipped work stations and a six-seat conference room.The main training room closely resembles IBM\u2019s Cambridge range, with touch-screen monitors on three walls showing charts, video clips and forensic material like snippets of malicious computer code. From a tablet, IBM\u2019s employees can adjust the room\u2019s displays. A tap on the tablet\u2019s \u201cbreaking news\u201d button shifts the room\u2019s lighting from a soothing blue to urgent red.\u201cIt helps us get the cortisol going,\u201d Mr. Barlow said. \u201cPeople react unconsciously to the visual cues.\u201dCyber ranges take their inspiration from the military. Just as soldiers train in simulated environments for the conditions they might face in battle, cyber defenders regularly practice on virtual networks. A growing number of companies participate in cyber war games and stage mock attacks to test their defenses.Sean McKee, a senior cyber threat manager for TD Bank, visited IBM\u2019s Cambridge range this year and was intrigued enough to plan a two-day training exercise there in December for 40 TD Bank employees.The bank tests its crisis management plans at least once a year, incorporating everyone from front-line responders to its top executives, but its capabilities are less immersive than IBM\u2019s, Mr. McKee said.\u201cPeople immediately get to see the results of their actions,\u201d Mr. McKee said. \u201cIt gives them a sense that there are other forces at play here and the decisions you make in a moment of crisis are going to have a lasting impact on your organization.\u201dRegulators, lawmakers and corporate customers have responded with more stringent requirements that companies improve their defenses and practice their crisis-response plans for handling significant attacks.\u201cWe\u2019ve had growing demand from boards and C-suites, and it\u2019s hard to get those people out to Cambridge,\u201d Mr. Barlow said. \u201cThis is a way to bring training to them.\u201dIBM is still figuring out exactly what it will do with its new toy. The truck is a fully functional command center, Mr. Barlow said. It could, in theory, be sent to large events \u2014 IBM works on cybersecurity for the United States Open and Wimbledon tennis tournaments \u2014 to handle real-time threat response.But its main purpose will be training. IBM plans to re-create its Cambridge mock-attack scenarios and build custom exercises for companies looking to test their skills.Mr. McKee, a former Canadian army officer, said that his bank, like many, had responded to escalating threats by increasing the pace and complexity of its training exercises. TD Bank\u2019s session in December at the Cambridge range will mix technical challenges for the bank\u2019s security incident response team with legal, public relations and privacy trials for its top executives.\u201cI always run these exercises with the caveat that this is not a test,\u201d he said. \u201cA test is pass or fail. If you have certain areas where you go down in a flaming ball of fire, that\u2019s a success. You found a critical vulnerability in your response.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My students created a survey to determine which issues are important to younger voters. They will use this survey data to guide the questions they ask the candidates included in our guide. Students will also create a \u201chow to vote\u201d section of the guide in order to educate first time voters about the process and requirements of voting. Through the project students will learn about civic engagement, different levels of government and their functions, and how to vote.In the culminating activity, students create a campaign to motivate young people to go to the polls in the form of a video, song, podcast, poster, editorial, speech or podcast.Students will address whether and how governments (federal and local) act \u2014 extralegally and legally \u2014 to keep target populations from voting: tactical measures like closing polling places in target districts, withholding the right for felons and former felons to vote, voter ID laws, etc.How do these actions communicate our collective values? We will ask students to bring their personal, global perspective into the conversation, including their experiences with voter suppression tactics in their home countries.Over the last decade, our High School here in Etown has put together an extensive mock election simulation that not only teaches our 12th (now 11th) Grade Government & Economics students how campaigns work, but about the issues and candidates themselves. This year is no different as we will be running two Congressional, the Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor and Gubernatorial races with the whole school voting on the outcome.Students will analyze how values are embedded in (and exploited by) the design of political messaging. Assessing tone, visual language, verbal language and sound design, they will be asked to unpack the ways in which political messaging incites emotional responses, and the degree to which political messaging is aligned with or divorced from policy, action and governance. Students will also analyze how/whether political messaging is intended to ignite action or apathy, which either increases or depresses voter turnout among targeted voters.Students get to don their best forecaster hats and try to predict toss up races in the House and Senate after breaking down demographics, political profiles, and candidate comparisons. They present on their predictions before Election Day (in 2016 students did cakes when cut up would reveal red or blue, we also had a pi\u00f1ata filled with blue candy for one prediction). We track predictions on a congressional districts map and debrief the day after elections are held. It\u2019s a great way to learn about the election process, polling, how demographics influence voting behavior, hot button issues, and what makes certain districts/states unique to their own experience.Working in pairs, students will also find one intriguing race (either regional or national) and follow one neophyte on his or her journey, from August to November. Each week, that campaign\u2019s representatives in our class will report on what happened in the race that week. In addition, we\u2019ll have the students contact their chosen campaign to ask questions, or even get an interview._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wireless Charging Is Here. So What Is It Good For?", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixThe technology, also known as magnetic induction, is a relatively new feature for powering iPhones and popular Android phones. Most people don\u2019t use it, but here are a few benefits.Besides getting bigger, smartphones keep getting \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 glassier. From front to back, the bodies of many of the newest smartphones are composed of glass.The trend is not part of a broad conspiracy to make you shatter your phone so that you buy a new one. Instead, glass lets energy pass through the phone so that it can be charged wirelessly. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, creating voltage that powers the phone without your plugging a wire into it.That may be because wireless charging isn\u2019t truly wireless. People typically need accessories from companies like Samsung, Mophie and Anker \u2014 which generally look like mats and stands that you can set your phone on \u2014 to wirelessly power up. And while you don\u2019t have to plug a cable into the phone, the accessories themselves have to be hooked up to a power outlet.There\u2019s a trade-off, too: Wireless charging is less efficient at transferring energy than a wire, and is thus slower at refilling a battery. (Mophie said that generally, when both types of chargers were on the same wattage, wireless was about 15 percent slower.) So what\u2019s the point?Charlie Quong, vice president of product development for Mophie, said placing wireless chargers in areas where people spent a lot of time \u2014 like their bedroom, car and office \u2014 could enable them to top off their phones more frequently by removing the hassle of plugging in.The products help people \u201cget charged throughout their day without having to deliberately park their phone down,\u201d Mr. Quong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really convenient.\u201dAs a longtime skeptic of wireless chargers, I was eager to find a useful application for the technology. So I scattered the chargers around the focal points of my daily routine: on my nightstand, in my car, in my briefcase, on my office desk and on a living room table.In the end, I would consider keeping a wireless charger only in the bedroom or in a briefcase. Here\u2019s what I found.Two types of wireless chargers can be placed on a bedside table: pads and stands. In this case, the charging stand was beneficial. It elevated my phone at an angle to turn the phone into an alarm clock \u2014 with a quick poke at the screen, I could glance at the time, disable an alarm or look at a calendar alert. At night when the lights were off, setting the phone on the dock was easier than fumbling around for a wire to plug in. And the slower charging didn\u2019t matter, because I was asleep.The pad was less useful. With the phone lying flat, I had to remove it from the charger whenever I wanted to check it. A wireless charging pad or stand can also be placed on an office desk. The idea is to quickly set your phone down on the charger whenever you return to the table.Wireless charging isn\u2019t beneficial in an office environment, assuming you care about speed and productivity.If you want your device to stay charged between meetings, the slower speed is inconvenient. In my test, the Anker stand took about 10 minutes longer to replenish 25 percent of battery than a wired charger.The other downside in the office is that you can\u2019t easily use the phone to write a message without removing it from the charger. With a cord, you can do all your important tasks while staying plugged in.A wireless battery pack was great for date night. During dinner with my partner, it was nice to skip carrying a cord. We set the battery down on the table and took turns recharging our devices.You could place a charging pad on a TV stand or end table for guests to replenish their phones when they come over. It\u2019s not only convenient and hospitable, but it also looks less tacky than dangling cords all over your common areas.Mr. Quong said the mount was conceived as an all-in-one solution, eliminating the need to buy two separate accessories for mounting and charging a phone. But given the high price of $70 for the Mophie mount, I recommend going piecemeal. Plus, a wire was still involved anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dyson Wants to Curl Your Hair", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut its cutting-edge technology \u2014 magical air currents \u2014 will cost you.\u201cThis will break the internet,\u201d said Jen Atkin, the founder of Ouai Haircare and stylist to several Kardashians. Her excitement was not for a celebrity makeover or magazine cover but for the latest product introduction from Dyson: the Airwrap, a tool that can curl or smooth or dry hair. \u201cMy reaction was, like, this is so incredible,\u201d she said.The Airwrap release follows the introduction in spring 2016 of the Supersonic, the doughnut-shaped hair dryer with a $399.99 price tag that was Dyson\u2019s first foray into the beauty market. A Google search for Dyson Supersonic and \u201cworth the hype\u201d yields more than 9,000 results. So one may expect the Airwrap to be met with a similar blend of curiosity and excitement. But unlike the Supersonic, whose features are familiar to anyone who has used a standard blow dryer, the Airwrap requires a certain measure of coaching.On a recent morning in a SoHo hotel suite, representatives from Dyson joined Jon Reyman, a hairstylist and an owner of the Spoke & Weal salons, to demonstrate.The product is shaped like a traditional curling iron but with a detachable head. There are 30- and 40-millimeter barrels for curling as well as a hair dryer attachment, a round brush and two kinds of smoothing brushes. They are sold in various combinations: Volume & Shape (for straighter and thinner hair with the dryer, soft brush, round brush and 30-millimeter barrel); Smooth & Control (for curlier and thicker hair, with the dryer, firm brush and both 30- and 40-millimeter barrels).Each is $499.99, or there is a kit with all of the attachments for $549.99. All three come in a camel-color leather storage case that looks almost like something Herm\u00e8s might produce.Using the dryer attachment, Mr. Reyman worked on a model\u2019s long blond hair until it was almost but not entirely dry. Then he removed the attachment and put on the 30-millimeter barrel. He held the hair about four inches from the end and turned on the device, showing off the Airwrap\u2019s neat trick: The hair wrapped itself around the barrel. He pushed a button for cool air to set the curl and released it.The result was a bouncier, more voluminous curl than one has come to expect from a standard curling wand \u2014 and lacked the singed smell often associated with irons. \u201cCurling irons damage your hair and compress the hair shaft,\u201d Mr. Reyman said. \u201cWith this, you get the same pattern without the damage, but the result is also fuller.\u201dWhile the a large majority of curling irons or hot brushes sold on Amazon are under $50, Dyson promises benefits in exchange for the high cost. The Airwrap can be used on wet hair and, with heat at less than 300 degrees, is much less hot than the 360 to 450 degrees that other curling wands average, which is good for protecting hair from damage but also skin from injury. A 2001 study in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine found that over five years studied, there were an estimated 105,081 injuries related to hair-care products, of which thermal burns were the most common.The Supersonic was touted as being lighter and faster at drying and less damaging than other models on the market. And, it had the cachet of being innovative and it looked different from anything that had come before. Even though the company, based in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England, declined to share sales figures, it appears to have been a hit. \u201cIt was kind of a historic launch,\u201d said Priya Venkatesh, the senior vice president of merchandising for skin and hair at the Sephora beauty chain. \u201cIt was a case where it totally delivered and surpassed expectations. Dyson is priced higher in every category they enter, and I don\u2019t recall there being a big protest on the price itself.\u201d In fact, she said, it was one of Sephora\u2019s top-selling brands online and the first time a hair product hit the top five holiday sellers, which it did for the last two years.It also became a status symbol \u2014 Dyson recently released a version of the Supersonic plated in 23.75-karat gold that sells for $499.99 \u2014 and a cult object. \u201cWe never go into a category looking to do a single product,\u201d said Tom Crawford, Dyson\u2019s global research and development director for personal care. The development process of the Airwrap has taken about six years, 642 prototype iterations and $31.4 million in development costs.\u201cWhen we\u2019re going to a new product, we start from scratch, and we try to understand the fundamentals first,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. \u201cInstead of having a funky idea and seeing if it works, we go back to basics and specify what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d In this case the mission was to engineer a styling tool that eliminated the problem of high heat and damaged hair.At the early stages Dyson had two teams working in parallel. One was a research team looking at technology, motors, air flow, acoustics, noise or the science of hair. Another team looked at the science of human interaction with the product. As Mr. Crawford explained, \u201cThey\u2019re saying: \u2018Having to wrap your hair around a hot iron and rotate it is awkward. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you didn\u2019t have to do that. Let\u2019s try to get rid of that process.\u2019 It\u2019s scientific research working in tandem with blue-sky thinkers coming up with wild ideas. Then we force-fit these two approaches to one.\u201dThen there\u2019s testing, in both the virtual and physical world: dropping it from overhead, knocking it on walls, smashing it on the ground. Engineers were encouraged to try it out and test prototypes to see if they broke. A fringe benefit, one imagines, is to let out a little steam.Some of Dyson\u2019s 12,000 employees tested it, as did about 20 hairstylists, like Mr. Reyman and Ms. Atkin, who said she was often observed by engineers recording her using it. \u201cI was this loudmouth hairstylist giving my frank critique to months and months of work,\u201d she said with a laugh.Mr. Crawford emphasized the importance of feedback. \u201cWe learn the frustrations and problems that different people will be responding to,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Japanese culture, people bathe and shower before bed. And in sunny states in the U.S., they\u2019re concerned about UV damage to the hair.\u201dWhat about future personal care ventures, like a flat iron? \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to solve problems,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. \u201cAre we developing things? Maybe.\u201dFor the Airwrap introduction, expectations are high but managed. \u201cIn general blow dyers are a bigger market,\u201d Ms. Venkatesh of Sephora said. \u201cThe consumer will have a little more learning to do with this one, but it\u2019s a very compelling proposition. I\u2019m not yet expecting it to beat the Supersonic, but we\u2019re willing to be surprised.\u201dMr. Reyman doesn\u2019t think it has a lot of competition. \u201cNothing on the market is exceptional,\u201d he said.

Jennifer Bandier, the boutique\u2019s founder, was not surprised. \u201cThe customer needs to feel like making a purchase is an experience and that what they are buying has a good story that they can share with their friends (and their social media followers),\u201d Ms. Bandier wrote in an email.Wone\u2019s offerings also aren\u2019t the most expensive out there. Katie Warner Johnson, a founder and the chief executive of Carbon38, which sells fashion forward active wear, said that women\u2019s willingness to pay about $300 for Michi leggings was \u201cessentially the foundation of our business.\u201d One of the first items Carbon38 offered was a style called Medusa: a swirling patchwork of black spandex, mesh and heather gray fabric that made it look as if the pants were growing up the wearer\u2019s leg. And women were lining up for them back in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really able to play with the price spectrum since then,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.Elizabeth van der Goltz, the global buying director of Net-a-Porter, said the site was initially \u201cnervous\u201d to stock leggings over $200. Now there are $490 blue and black Fendi leggings printed with scribbled hearts and $345 Lucas Hugh black leggings with opalescent tape stripes and pinhole mesh inserts for ventilation. These brands have \u201chigh sell-throughs,\u201d Ms. Van der Goltz wrote in an email. (Their cost continues to accrue after purchase: The Fendi leggings, though designed to sweat in, require hand washing or dry cleaning.)What does $300 and up buy you? In the case of Wone, not strategic color blocking, or extra ventilation. Instead, Ms. Hildebrand touts personalized finishing and Italian and French fabrics, which cost $20 to $25 per yard, as opposed to the $3 to $4 for fabrics more typically used in active wear. As opposed to the standard promise of holding up through 50 machine washes, Wone\u2019s are guaranteed through 50,000 washes \u2014 that\u2019s every single day for the next 136 years, or at least through your lifetime, no matter how much exercise might extend it. (What will future archaeologists think when they excavate large amounts of indestructible athleisure?)Wone\u2019s social media strategy is also different from most brands\u2019: The company\u2019s lone Instagram post, for example, is of blank white space.\u201c It\u2019s hard to be in health and wellness and advocate or even promote something that\u2019s sort of the antithesis of wellness,\u201d Ms. Hildebrand said of the brand\u2019s tactic. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make sense from a philosophical standpoint.\u201d And yet influencers, to whom Ms. Hildebrand gave products, helped stoke demand (one influencer described a Wone bra in an Instagram Story as the best she\u2019d ever worn). The brand\u2019s packaging \u2014 a brown box containing a sleek black box, tissue paper sealed with embossed sticker \u2014 has inspired many an unboxing video.Ms. Hildebrand, who also founded a now-defunct meditation studio, will also email customers at all hours, which might seem at odds with wellness. \u201cI struggle with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to build this to a place where I can absolutely afford to limit my hours.\u201dBut not for long her customers: Barneys New York will begin selling Wone in December.

{"Headline": "The Next Tech Talent Shortage: Quantum Computing Researchers", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Savoie, founder and chief executive of a start-up called Zapata, offered jobs this year to three scientists who specialize in an increasingly important technology called quantum computing. They accepted.Several months later, the Cambridge, Mass., company was still waiting for the State Department to approve visas for the specialists. All three are foreigners, born in Europe and Asia.Whether the delays were the result of tougher immigration policy or just red tape, Mr. Savoie\u2019s predicament was typical of a growing concern among American businesses and universities: Unless policies and priorities change, they will have trouble attracting the talent needed to build quantum technology, which could make today\u2019s computers look like toys.It is a story that is being told repeatedly in the tech industry in the United States. As companies push into new technologies, they are finding it harder to identify qualified engineers and researchers. They are also facing tougher immigration rules for foreign-born tech experts and competing with tech centers like Montreal, London, Paris and Beijing.International competition is a particularly thorny issue in quantum computing because one of these machines \u2014 in theory \u2014 could crack the encryption that protects sensitive information inside governments and businesses around the world. If a quantum computer can be built, it will be exponentially more powerful than even today\u2019s supercomputers.Last month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy invited experts from government, industry and academia to Washington for a daylong policy meeting dedicated to quantum technologies. Several attendees, including Mr. Savoie, expressed concern that the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies could affect quantum research in academia and corporations.\u201cThe concern is: Are we still the destination for the best and the brightest in science and engineering and technology?\u201d said Roger Falcone, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the meeting in Washington.The labor pool in quantum computing is even smaller. By some accounts, fewer than a thousand people in the world can claim to be doing leading research in the field.For decades, quantum computing was purely experimental. When it was first proposed in the early 1980s, the goal was to build a system based on the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics. Over the past several years, scientists have shown that they can build these machines, if only on a small scale.With traditional computers, transistors store \u201cbits\u201d of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do.When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Scientists who build these systems specialize in the physics of those very small or cold things, which is nothing like the physics we experience from day to day.\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people who know how to do this,\u201d said Steven Girvin, a professor of physics at Yale University. \u201cThese machines are quasi-hand-built by Ph.D.s in physics.\u201dBecause these machines could eventually break today\u2019s encryption, some believe there are reasons to be careful as large numbers of foreigners move into the field and to find ways of building a larger pool of American-born talent that can handle sensitive breakthroughs.\u201cWe need to be cognizant\u201d of the potential for academic and industrial espionage, said Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe answer is not to shut down the flow of people from abroad, but to find ways of better protecting intellectual property.\u201dAs American tech giants like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft accelerate their quantum computing efforts, work is speeding up in China and Europe as well. The Chinese government is working on a $10 billion national lab for quantum research in Hefei, set to open in 2020, and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is building a lab of its own. In 2016, the European Union invested 1 billion euros \u2014 roughly $1.2 billion \u2014 in quantum computing.Could those efforts race past progress in the United States and possibly threaten national security? \u201cIf you are talking about a quantum computer in Russia or China or anywhere else, you are talking about a weaponized technology,\u201d said Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington.The good news is no one has been able to build a commercially viable quantum computer so far, so there is time to fix the talent problem. Lawmakers and government officials are exploring strategies to help ensure that the pool of available talent grows.Jacob Taylor, a veteran quantum researcher who oversees quantum strategy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, played down concerns that other countries could beat the United States to quantum computing. \u201cWe have been the leader in this world for a long time,\u201d he said.In artificial intelligence research, many worry that too much talent is moving from academia into industry, lured by high salaries, bonuses and stock options. In the quantum field, policymakers like Dr. Taylor hope to address this problem by funding projects at university and government labs.\u201cI see the country at a crossroads with quantum information systems,\u201d said Brian DeMarco, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois who specializes in quantum computing and has worked with government organizations on the technology. \u201cI can see things not working out, where the balance is not good, and it derails our ability to compete.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Charge Your Phone Faster", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo time to wait for your phone to charge up? No problem \u2014 these tips will get you the most battery power in the least amount of time.You\u2019re about to head out the door, but your phone desperately needs some extra juice before you leave. Thankfully, you can charge your phone faster \u2026 if you can separate truth from myth.If you remember your high school physics, electricity is measured in watts, which is a product of voltage (in number of volts) and current (in number of amps). Some chargers supply more voltage or amperage than others, meaning they will charge your phone faster (as long as your phone supports it \u2014 it will draw only as much power as it knows it can handle). Here are some guidelines to follow to charge your phone as fast as possible.Not all chargers are created equal, either. For example, iPhones come with Apple\u2019s small five-volt/one-amp power bricks, while iPads come with larger five-volt/2.4-amp bricks (though some older ones are five-volt/2.1-amp). If you plug that iPad charger into an iPhone, however, it will draw more power \u2014 provided it\u2019s a relatively modern iPhone. Some older iPhones may not be able to use more than one amp, while others (like the iPhone 6) will pull around 1.6 amps from that iPad charger.Again, you don\u2019t have to use the best charger possible \u2014 your phone will be able to draw power from any charger that fits its physical port. It will just charge at the maximum speed the phone supports. A Quick Charge 2.0 phone will only ever be able to charge at Quick Charge 2.0 speeds, even if connected to a Quick Charge 3.0 charger.You may have heard that your phone will charge faster if you turn it off or put it in airplane mode. This seems logical: After all, if your phone is using less battery, then it will charge faster, right?Last, keep in mind that your phone won\u2019t charge from 0 percent to 100 percent at the same speed. Using one of these faster chargers will make a big difference when charging between 0 percent and 80 percent or so, but after that, your battery will slow down and charge at regular speed for that last bit. So keep this in mind as you race against the clock: Fast charging will help you revive a dead phone quickly, but it won\u2019t \u201ctop off\u201d your phone in record time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Trolls Reigned Free: A New History of Reddit", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Even then, at a moment of techno-optimism we are unlikely to see again in our lifetimes, Reddit was a toxic swamp. It was the place you went, shrouded in anonymity, for pornography, hard-core racism, revenge porn, Nazi cheerleading, Jew-baiting, creepshots, fat-shaming, mindless anarchy and pictures of dead kids or of women who had been beaten. If anyone bothered to look, Reddit was proof that on the internet, the trolls were in charge.Founded in 2005, soon after Facebook, Reddit has always been something of an anomaly among companies whose content was generated by users. Its founders, barely out of their teens, had no real vision. It wasn\u2019t even their idea. They cashed out as soon as they could. The buyer was Cond\u00e9 Nast, home of America\u2019s toniest magazines, but executives there had no vision either. Reddit was created by millions of Americans with a taste for darkness. You can\u2019t blame this one on Vladimir Putin.In the beginning, Reddit users simply shared links about interesting things they read. Then comments were added. The job of moderating was assigned to anonymous volunteers, who created and shaped \u201csubreddits\u201d to their own passions. This was a genius move: It allowed Reddit not only to keep its staff lean, but to distance the company from the sleazier content.Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, a writer for Inc. magazine, tells the Reddit story in \u201cWe Are the Nerds.\u201d The two co-founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, cooperated extensively. I admire them for doing so because despite Lagorio-Chafkin\u2019s best efforts \u2014 Ohanian is called \u201ccharismatic\u201d or celebrated for his \u201ccharisma\u201d on Pages 47, 158, 214, 223 and 330 \u2014 they come off as whiny and callow schemers, and not the sharpest of sticks. On the very first page, the two University of Virginia seniors cannot figure out what a \u201ckiosk\u201d is.The title \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d doesn\u2019t really fit the tale. \u201cWe Are the Trolls\u201d would have made much more sense. \u201cI was always kind of an [expletive],\u201d Huffman explains early on. Lagorio-Chafkin bluntly calls him \u201ca total troll.\u201d He was also a genius programmer. The great achievement of the social internet was to unleash jerkdom for many while monetizing it for a few.The Reddit tale is an indictment of Silicon Valley, something Lagorio-Chafkin seems to sense but never confronts head-on, perhaps because she is so grateful for access to Huffman and Ohanian. \u201cTwo nice guys who made it, by crafting something incredible and yet ridiculously unwieldy, with no lack of turbulence along the way,\u201d Lagorio-Chafkin writes in an author\u2019s note. A more accurate summation might be: \u201cTwo inexperienced young guys created something they didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t control.\u201dIt\u2019s all here anyway: the lack of adult oversight; the suck-up press; the growth-at-any-cost mentality; the loyal employees, by turns abused and abusive (memo from management: \u201cYou do realize you were talking about penises for 90 minutes, right?\u201d); the defense of horrendous behavior as \u201cfree speech\u201d; the jettisoning of \u201cfree speech\u201d when it served corporate purposes; the way no one seeks permission but all expect forgiveness.\u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is most compelling when it tells the story of a third young man who played a founding role at Reddit. Aaron Swartz was brilliant, troubled and impossible, but he saw the tech economy more clearly than well-medicated people. \u201cIn the old days the new money was made through theft and abuse of office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow any random computer programmer \u2014 or even the people who hung around them \u2014 could find themselves saddled with a pile of cash.\u201d In early 2013, hounded by the government over a stupid stunt involving the downloading of academic journals, Swartz committed suicide.Reddit became so offensive it was difficult to work there. A community manager who had a brief tenure in 2015 told Lagorio-Chafkin some of the reasons: \u201cChild molesters, child porn, vicious stalking, rape threats, serious harassment, people taking the harassment offline and people filing police reports on each other.\u201d One chief executive, stressed beyond endurance, simply stopped showing up for work. His replacement, Ellen Pao, tried to impose order in the office and on the site. The backlash led to her abrupt departure. Huffman returned and purged most of the staff.The charismatic Ohanian came back as well, trying a few Reddit spinoffs that fizzled. He is best known now for being Mr. Serena Williams. I wondered if any of his new relatives ever asked him about the popular subreddit called CoonTown \u2014 you can guess the contents \u2014 but \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is silent on this. CoonTown was finally banned by Reddit in 2015.I also saw a lot of ads. Reddit is worth about $2 billion, which means Advance Publications, the parent of Cond\u00e9 Nast and now Reddit\u2019s biggest investor, made good money. In Silicon Valley, that\u2019s still pretty much all that matters.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times.

(The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny. So far, its progress is found wanting.More from Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger:Over the last 10 years, Silicon Valley\u2019s social media companies have expanded their reach and influence to the furthest corners of the world. But it has become glaringly apparent that the companies never quite understood the negative consequences of that influence nor what to do about it \u2014 and that they cannot put the genie back in the bottle.The chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced the initiative as part of the nation\u2019s annual budget. The new charge, scheduled to go into effect in 2020, would apply only to organizations with global revenue of at least 500 million pounds, or about $640 million. The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed. The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents the likes of Google and Facebook, said that \u201cimposing a digital tax could create a chilling effect on investment in the U.K. and hinder businesses of all sizes from creating jobs.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s retreat, analysts say, could mark the beginning of a new era not just for Europe\u2019s biggest country but for the Continent itself.It could leave Germany more unstable and less able to take the lead in Europe at a time when leadership is badly needed on an array of topics \u2014 from Britain\u2019s imminent departure from the European Union to Italy\u2019s controversial budget plans.Stefan Koopman, an economist at Rabobank, offered a bleak assessment to the NYT: \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a worse time for Germany\u2019s steady ship to hit choppy waters.\u201dLegally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary.

{"Headline": "A Dark Consensus About Screens and Kids Begins to Emerge in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "\u201cI am convinced the devil lives in our phones.\u201dSupported byA wariness that has been slowly brewing is turning into a regionwide consensus: The benefits of screens as a learning tool are overblown, and the risks for addiction and stunting development seem high. The debate in Silicon Valley now is about how much exposure to phones is O.K.\u201cDoing no screen time is almost easier than doing a little,\u201d said Kristin Stecher, a former social computing researcher married to a Facebook engineer. \u201cIf my kids do get it at all, they just want it more.\u201dMs. Stecher, 37, and her husband, Rushabh Doshi, researched screen time and came to a simple conclusion: they wanted almost none of it in their house. Their daughters, ages 5 and 3, have no screen time \u201cbudget,\u201d no regular hours they are allowed to be on screens. The only time a screen can be used is during the travel portion of a long car ride (the four-hour drive to Tahoe counts) or during a plane trip. Recently she has softened this approach. Every Friday evening the family watches one movie. There is a looming issue Ms. Stecher sees in the future: Her husband, who is 39, loves video games and thinks they can be educational and entertaining. She does not.\u201cWe\u2019ll cross that when we come to it,\u201d said Ms. Stecher, who is due soon with a boy. Some of the people who built video programs are now horrified by how many places a child can now watch a video.Asked about limiting screen time for children, Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist who for years directed product for YouTube at Google, sent a photo of a potty training toilet with an iPad attached and wrote: \u201cHashtag \u2018products we didn\u2019t buy.\u2019\u201dAthena Chavarria, who worked as an executive assistant at Facebook and is now at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s philanthropic arm, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said: \u201cI am convinced the devil lives in our phones and is wreaking havoc on our children.\u201dMs. Chavarria did not let her children have cellphones until high school, and even now bans phone use in the car and severely limits it at home.She said she lives by the mantra that the last child in the class to get a phone wins. Her daughter did not get a phone until she started ninth grade.\u201cOther parents are like, \u2018Aren\u2019t you worried you don\u2019t know where your kids are when you can\u2019t find them?\u2019\u201d Ms. Chavarria said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018No, I do not need to know where my kids are every second of the day.\u2019\u201dFor longtime tech leaders, watching how the tools they built affect their children has felt like a reckoning on their life and work. \u201cOn the scale between candy and crack cocaine, it\u2019s closer to crack cocaine,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of screens. Technologists building these products and writers observing the tech revolution were na\u00efve, he said. \u201cWe thought we could control it,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cAnd this is beyond our power to control. This is going straight to the pleasure centers of the developing brain. This is beyond our capacity as regular parents to understand.\u201dHe has five children and 12 tech rules. They include: no phones until the summer before high school, no screens in bedrooms, network-level content blocking, no social media until age 13, no iPads at all and screen time schedules enforced by Google Wifi that he controls from his phone. Bad behavior? The child goes offline for 24 hours. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what we were doing to their brains until I started to observe the symptoms and the consequences,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThis is scar tissue talking. We\u2019ve made every mistake in the book, and I think we got it wrong with some of my kids,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWe glimpsed into the chasm of addiction, and there were some lost years, which we feel bad about.\u201d His children attended private elementary school, where he saw the administration introduce iPads and smart whiteboards, only to \u201cdescend into chaos and then pull back from it all.\u201d This idea that Silicon Valley parents are wary about tech is not new. The godfathers of tech expressed these concerns years ago, and concern has been loudest from the top. Those who have exposed their children to screens try to talk them out of addiction by explaining how the tech works. John Lilly, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist with Greylock Partners and the former C.E.O. of Mozilla, said he tries to help his 13-year-old son understand that he is being manipulated by those who built the technology. \u201cI try to tell him somebody wrote code to make you feel this way \u2014 I\u2019m trying to help him understand how things are made, the values that are going into things and what people are doing to create that feeling,\u201d Mr. Lilly said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018I just want to spend my 20 bucks to get my Fortnite skins.\u2019\u201dAnd there are those in tech who disagree that screens are dangerous. Jason Toff, 32, who ran the video platform Vine and now works for Google, lets his 3-year-old play on an iPad, which he believes is no better or worse than a book. This opinion is unpopular enough with his fellow tech workers that he feels there is now \u201ca stigma.\u201d \u201cOne reaction I got just yesterday was, \u2018Doesn\u2019t it worry you that all the major tech execs are limiting screen time?\u2019\u201d Mr. Toff said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Maybe it should, but I guess I\u2019ve always been skeptical of norms.\u2019 People are just scared of the unknown.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s contrarian,\u201d Mr. Toff said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m speaking for a lot of parents that are afraid of speaking out loud for fear of judgment.\u201dHe said he thinks back to his own childhood growing up watching a lot of TV. \u201cI think I turned out O.K.,\u201d Mr. Toff said. Other Silicon Valley parents say there are ways to make some limited screen time slightly less toxic.Renee DiResta, a security researcher on the board of the Center for Humane Tech, won\u2019t allow passive screen time, but will allow short amounts of time on challenging games.She wants her 2- and 4-year-old children to learn how to code young, so she embraces their awareness of gadgets. But she distinguishes between these types of screen use. Playing a building game is allowed, but watching a YouTube video is not, unless it is as a family.And Frank Barbieri, a San Francisco-based executive at the start-up PebblePost that tracks online activity to send direct mail advertising, tries to limit his 5-year-old daughter\u2019s screen time to Italian language content. \u201cWe have friends who are screen abolitionists, and we have friends who are screen liberalists,\u201d Mr. Barbieri said. He had read studies on how learning a second language at a young age is good for the developing mind, so his daughter watches Italian-language movies and TV shows. \u201cFor us, honestly, me and my wife were like, \u2018Where would we like to visit?\u2019\u201d Mr. Barbieri said.Advertisement"}

Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a \u201cfree speech\u201d alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers:There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert \u2014 or \u201cred pill,\u201d in the parlance of right-wing internet activists \u2014 a new generation to their cause.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business.\u201cThe challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,\u201d said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. \u201cIf an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren\u2019t going to think it\u2019s a good place for their baby photos.\u201dBut the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms \u2014 and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab.\u201cWe have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers and several payment processors,\u201d the statement read.In addition, GoDaddy, the domain name provider, told Gab it had 24 hours to move its domain name to another service, after finding content on the site that promoted violence.\u201cWhen a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,\u201d a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons.In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab\u2019s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers\u2019s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation.\u201cBecause he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,\u201d Mr. Torba wrote. \u201cThey would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.\u201dMr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab\u2019s core mission of promoting free speech.\u201cTwitter and other platforms police \u2018hate speech\u2019 as long as it isn\u2019t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis double standard does not exist on Gab.\u201dWhat did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers\u2019s hatred for Jews.The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab\u2019s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology.\u201cGab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,\u201d said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. \u201cGab\u2019s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.\u201dIn the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate.On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers\u2019s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement\u2019s long-term prospects by resorting to violence.\u201cThis guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,\u201d one member wrote.A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting.On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab\u2019s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because \u201cGab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.\u201dAsked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer.\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jacky Rosen Wants to Flip Nevada for Democrats. But First, Kavanaugh.", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Jacky Rosen was introducing herself again.Milling among a crowd celebrating Mexican Independence Day in a park, Ms. Rosen, the Democratic Senate nominee for Nevada, had much on her mind. But to get voters to listen, she needed to make an impression first, with precious little time left before the November election.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jacky,\u201d she said over and over in a hot breeze that smelled like corn dogs \u2014 the world\u2019s best, if you trusted the truck making them. An aide motioned for someone to take a picture. \u201cI\u2019m Jacky.\u201dSome people nodded. Others looked confused.A first-term congresswoman, Ms. Rosen is in an extraordinary, and tricky, situation: She is running against Senator Dean Heller, the Republicans\u2019 most endangered incumbent, in a year when his party can only afford to lose one seat. And she initially had a powerful weapon: The G.O.P.-led confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, which enraged many women and Democrats, and Mr. Heller\u2019s gaffe that the sexual assault allegations against the nominee would just be a \u201chiccup\u201d in his rise to the Supreme Court.But Ms. Rosen, a 61-year-old former synagogue president, is now among the Democrats nationwide facing new energy from Republican voters who are defending Judge Kavanaugh and his patron, President Trump.It\u2019s a political moment that requires deft skills on the campaign trail \u2014 but Ms. Rosen is still a newcomer to politics, neither cagey nor glossy nor particularly electrifying. In a campaign season filled with rising Democratic stars like Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, she is not a phenomenon.Perhaps more significantly, Nevada is Nevada. Yes, the state voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 by more than 2 percentage points, but it has not had a Democratic governor since 1999. Neither quite red nor quite blue, it may be receptive to a fiery takedown of Mr. Heller over Judge Kavanaugh. Or it may not be.Unlike other states with competitive Senate races where the Kavanaugh issue has thundered into prominence, including North Dakota and Missouri, it is far from clear how the bitter nomination battle will affect the Heller-Rosen race. Political observers say Republican enthusiasm for getting the judge confirmed \u2014 which should be decided this weekend \u2014 could help Mr. Heller. But the issue also may not measurably change the turnout for either party\u2019s base in a state where political energy is focused elsewhere.Even Ms. Rosen isn\u2019t sure. In an interview, she did not criticize Judge Kavanaugh nearly as much as some other Democrats have, and added that she would hit Mr. Heller over the confirmation process but also talk plenty about health care, education and immigration.If Senator Heller votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, she said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to do a little bit of answering for that.\u201d It hardly served as a sharp rebuke. A moment later, however, she warmed to the subject, saying of her opponent: \u201cHe\u2019s just not listening to the voices in Nevada, to Nevada women, to their families who love women, who may have been victims of sexual assault.\u201dOn most issues and political fights, however, Ms. Rosen talks about collaboration and compromise, even as the Democratic base nationally clamors against President Trump. She does not extol the virtues of Medicare for All or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She does not extol much of anything at all.Yet it is Jacky Rosen, whose most notable previous political experience was perhaps keeping the peace among spirited congregants at Congregation Ner Tamid, who must choose a strategy in these final weeks on Mr. Heller, Judge Kavanaugh and so much else.Her allies, at least, are confident that she has the savvy and instincts to help deliver the Senate for the Democrats in November.\u201cIf you can be president of a synagogue,\u201d said Shelley Berkley, a former Nevada congresswoman, \u201cyou can be president of the United States very easily.\u201dRecent polling shows Ms. Rosen in a very tight race against Mr. Heller, a longtime politician who beat Ms. Berkley in 2012 in his Senate bid.Asked to explain her swift political rise during a separate interview at her campaign office here, Ms. Rosen \u2014 polished, practiced, composed \u2014 spoke about her willingness to take chances and the support she has received, then drifted into platitudes.But she knows a few. In early 2016, then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \u2014 whose influence over the state\u2019s Democratic Party has its own moniker, the \u201cReid machine\u201d \u2014 handpicked Ms. Rosen to run for an open House seat. She won, even as Mr. Trump won her district. It was Mr. Reid, too, who helped persuade Ms. Rosen to run for Senate. Mr. Reid, through an intermediary, declined to comment.\u201cI tell my daughter who just graduated college, I always tell her, \u2018Don\u2019t not do something just \u2019cause it\u2019s hard. Time is going to go by anyway,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rosen said.Nevada\u2019s electorate is divided between heavily Republican rural areas in the north and a growing Democratic population revolving around Las Vegas in the South. A growing number of Californians \u2014 left-leaning, Democrats hope \u2014 along with companies like Tesla and Google, are moving to the state, and the unemployment rate is below 5 percent. Its population is increasingly diverse. Because it is so split politically, Nevada\u2019s statewide officials tend toward relative moderation.Ms. Rosen\u2019s supporters view her as a viable alternative, a left-of-center Democrat whose biography and sparse voting record leave Republicans with little to attack. She supports a Medicaid buy-in program. She wants comprehensive immigration reform and has backed stricter gun control legislation. If Ms. Rosen is understated \u2014 more Mojave Desert beige than Las Vegas neon \u2014 that, her backers say, is the point.Mr. Heller, though, has never lost a race, and his defenders believe he will ultimately prevail.\u201cI think you have to have a very compelling reason to get rid of an incumbent U.S. Senator,\u201d said Sig Rogich, a longtime Republican strategist in Nevada, \u201cand there isn\u2019t one.\u201dLate last month, Mr. Trump appeared alongside Mr. Heller at a rally in Las Vegas and criticized Ms. Rosen. \u201cWacky Jacky,\u201d he called her, employing his fondness for derogatory nicknames. \u201cShe\u2019s wacky.\u201dMs. Rosen was born and raised in Chicago. Her father, a first-generation American who spoke Yiddish as his first language, was an auto salesman. Her mother was a homemaker. Ms. Rosen was a member of the drama club and remembers playing Mrs. Webb in a high-school production of \u201cOur Town.\u201dWhen Ms. Rosen was in college at the University of Minnesota, her parents moved to Las Vegas, where she spent a summer working as a cocktail waitress at Caesars Palace. \u201cI was a college student from the Midwest,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was very much like a fish out of water.\u201dShe graduated in December 1979 with a degree in psychology, then moved to southern Nevada and worked for many years as a computer programmer.Several years ago, she was elected president of Congregation Ner Tamid, among the biggest synagogues in the state. There, she helped reduce the synagogue\u2019s expenses, in part by installing solar panels.\u201cShe was very fiscally sound,\u201d said Rabbi Sanford Akselrad, the synagogue\u2019s spiritual leader and one of Ms. Rosen\u2019s friends.Ms. Rosen\u2019s leadership drew the attention of one of the synagogue\u2019s members, Elissa Cadish, a district judge. After many people rebuffed Mr. Reid\u2019s overtures to run for the open congressional seat, Judge Cadish recommended he call Ms. Rosen.\u201cThey asked a lot of the usual kinds of people to run,\u201d Ms. Rosen said, before speculating that other possible candidates saw the race as too risky. \u201cNo one told me that. But I\u2019m assuming this is why they didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201dAnd though some friends say she was never particularly political \u2014 \u201cWho knew she was going to go into politics?\u201d Mr. Akselrad said \u2014 they also say the ease with which she has taken to public office is not surprising.Quincy Branch, 41, who runs an independent insurance agency and previously voted for Mr. Heller, noted the senator\u2019s advantage before a round-table Ms. Rosen held recently with African-American entrepreneurs.\u201cHe\u2019s been here,\u201d Mr. Branch said, about Mr. Heller. \u201cIf Jacky can wedge that, then I think she has a stronger chance.\u201d He said he was undecided in this race.Ms. Rosen, as most candidates do, projected confidence heading into the last weeks before the election, brushing off the suggestion that Mr. Heller\u2019s name recognition would help. \u201cThey may know him,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not happy with him.\u201dOn a recent weekend afternoon, before she made her way to the Mexican Independence Day celebration, Ms. Rosen was in East Las Vegas, a lower-income part of the city. A small, largely Hispanic crowd \u2014 part of an important coalition of voters for Democrats \u2014 had gathered for an event to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, and Ms. Rosen paused frequently to allow a translator to repeat her words in Spanish.\u201cI\u2019m the granddaughter of immigrants,\u201d she said. A child hummed somewhere in the audience.At the end of her speech, she urged everyone to get out the vote. She told them to text a number to support her campaign, and tried repeating the number in Spanish.\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, triumphantly.Then she set off into the desert heat, ready to introduce herself anew.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case of Jane Doe Ponytail", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "An epic tragedy on a small block in Queens.Below awaits 40th Road, a gritty street of commerce in the Flushing section of Queens. Chinese restaurants and narrow storefronts, and dim stairwells leading to private transactions. Strivers and dawdlers and passers-by, all oblivious to what is transpiring above.But before the pavement ends the woman\u2019s descent, a few feet from a restaurant\u2019s glittering Christmas tree, imagine her fall suddenly suspended \u2014 her body freeze-framed in midair. If only for a moment.She toils in the netherworld of Flushing massage parlors, where she goes by the street name of SiSi. A youthful 38, she is in a platonic marriage to a man more than twice her age; harbors fading hopes of American citizenship; and is fond of Heineken, Red Bull and the rotisserie chicken at a Colombian place on Kissena Boulevard. Among her competitors, she is considered territorial and tireless.It is the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and SiSi is in a shabby building\u2019s top-floor apartment, for which she pays her \u201cboss\u201d a hefty fee. She has returned from a market with provisions. She has tried calling her younger brother in China, but he is asleep. She has been on the phone with friends and clients, unaware that she is in the sights of a 10-member police team working vice.She heads downstairs to stand at her building\u2019s entrance, a necessity of her job. Soon she is leading a man back upstairs \u2014 an officer working undercover \u2014 as her closely held cellphone casts a glow about her face. Their awkward conversation in her apartment convinces him that SiSi has broken the law, just as it convinces SiSi that he is a cop. She pushes him out and closes the door, though not to the inevitable. She knows from experience what comes next:More police. Tromping through the dusky vestibule of her building, across the worn scarlet rug and up the 50 tiled steps. Past the Chinese sign that says if you\u2019re looking for the driving school, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Then right to her door.The handcuffs. The hurried escort to a police vehicle. The humiliation. Again.SiSi watches the officers ascend on the video monitor she keeps near the door. Under the fixed gaze of one of those lucky cat figurines perched on a table, its paw raised in a wish of good fortune, she begins to pace.On the narrow balcony, barely two feet deep, she keeps a broom, a bucket and a small blue stool. Up she steps \u2014 and now she is falling, plunging toward the hard tenth of a New York mile that is 40th Road.A tenth of a mile. Where Mandarin trumps English and a glance trumps the spoken word. Where sex is sold beside cloudy tanks of fish and crabs. Where seedy quarters controlled by local powers are rented to illicit massage operations, and the police make sporadic sweeps, and immigrant women are arrested again and again, and few in this city take notice.Gravity prevails.The undercover officer, his job done, exits the building and turns right \u2014 at the very moment that the woman who has just offered him intimacy for money hits the pavement at his feet. A woman known along 40th Road as SiSi, but whose given name was Song Yang.A striving borough of comity and contradiction, Queens is both the birthplace of the American president \u2014 elected in part on an anti-immigration platform \u2014 and home to 2.3 million people, nearly half of them foreign-born. With hundreds of languages spoken here, it may be the most linguistically diverse place on earth.Every day, airplanes alight at Kennedy International Airport in southeast Queens, their passengers including many immigrants who join the borough\u2019s anonymous, aspirational ranks. They chop the vegetables, wash the dishes, clean the toilets, mow the lawns, drive the hired cars.And some wind up in the commercial sex trade. Making money for a pimp in an airport motel in South Jamaica. Waiting for the next client in a dingy building along Roosevelt Avenue in Corona. Or, like Song Yang, standing on a Flushing street on a cold November night, hiding behind her cute nickname, calling out to men. Playing her role in a shadow economy that benefited others through the exorbitant rent she paid.\u201cI hear she was No. 1: young, pretty, and her service was great,\u201d said Michael Chu, a travel agent and community advocate who worked across the street from her on 40th Road. \u201cPeople just lined up for her.\u201dFor years now, Flushing has been an ever-replenishing repository of immigrants entangled in the underground sex economy. The commonplace raids of illicit massage operations across the country routinely lead to the arrests of women with Flushing addresses.These parlors disappear and reappear with regularity, undermining the police crackdowns often prompted by neighborhood complaints. The industry\u2019s opaqueness adds to the confusion. Some parlors have legitimate state licenses; some legitimate operations have masseuses making sex-for-money side deals; and some are illegally unlicensed, with no interest at all in addressing someone\u2019s sore neck.Emotionally manipulated by their bosses, ashamed of what they do, afraid to trust, the women rarely confide in the police or even their lawyers about their circumstances. They might be supporting a family in China, or paying back a smuggling debt, or choosing this more profitable endeavor over, say, restaurant work. No matter the backstory, the police say their collective silence further complicates law-enforcement efforts to build racketeering and trafficking cases against the operators.But society has become increasingly aware of the complexities and inequities of the commercial sex economy, including a criminal justice system that has tended to target the exploited \u2014 often immigrant women and members of the transgender community \u2014 while rarely holding accountable their customers and traffickers.In early 2017, New York\u2019s police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, announced at a news conference that he would redirect his vice division to address prostitution and sex trafficking. This would include training intended to alter what he called the \u201claw-enforcement mind-set.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already switched much of our emphasis away from prostitutes, and begun focusing much more on the pimps who sell them and the johns who pay for their services,\u201d he said. \u201cLike all crime, we can\u2019t just arrest our way out of this problem.\u201dSince the establishment of this new \u201cmind-set,\u201d the police have continued to struggle at building criminal cases against the operators. But prostitution arrests in New York City have dropped more than 20 percent in the last year, while the arrests of customers have spiked.Still, this change in attitude at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan had not necessarily crossed the East River to benefit an immigrant now lying on her side, unable to speak, gazing up at a plainclothes officer trying to calm her until an ambulance arrived. Beside a spent cigarette, her blood pooled on the pavement she had so often worked.By morning, Song Yang would be dead, shattering a tight Chinese family that would never accept the police version of events. Her death would also come to reflect the seemingly intractable nature of policing the sex industry, and cast an unwelcome light on the furtive but ubiquitous business of illicit massage parlors.In the epic of Queens, this stretch of 40th Road is little more than an asphalt hyphen. But along its short expanse exist worlds within worlds within worlds.I want to go to work, the little girl would say to her parents. I want to pick ginseng. She was a born worker, their Song Yang.She and her younger brother lived with their parents in a remote village in China\u2019s northeastern province of Liaoning, where they grew crops on land allotted to them by their local village committee. Little Song Yang was especially efficient at harvesting the family\u2019s ginseng crop, her mother, Shi Yumei, recalled. \u201cThe more her father praised her, the harder she worked.\u201dHer father, Song Xigui, eventually found moderate success selling construction-grade sand he bulldozed from a nearby river, and by the 1990s the family had replaced its thatched-roof home with a modern brick house that included two \u201ckang\u201d bed-stoves, heated slate platforms that provided warmth during the severe winters. Still, they continued to work the crops, with Song Yang often responsible for running home to light the stove, cut the vegetables and mind her brother.As she grew older, she began to collect specimens of the enchanting butterflies zigzagging down by the river, and became meticulous in preserving their fragile iridescence. When friends came for boisterous sleepovers, they would marvel at her book of butterflies, and take turns asking to keep one.Butterflies became Song Yang\u2019s gift.At 19, she moved 2,200 miles south to Saipan, the largest of the Northern Mariana Islands, an American commonwealth, where she became one of the thousands of young Chinese women who labored in sweatshops to produce apparel bearing the guilt-absolving label \u201cMade in America.\u201d Sharing a room with five other women in a dormitory, she covered her bottom-bunk bed with a silken cloth curtain, and adorned her small rectangle of privacy with family photographs.Saipan\u2019s garment industry was shrinking by the early 2000s, and Song Yang left to become a waitress on the island. She married a worldly divorced father named Chau Chuong, an American citizen who had worked for years in New York\u2019s restaurant grind. He was so much older \u2014 67 to her 27 \u2014 that her family was slow to accept him.In 2006, the couple opened a small Vietnamese restaurant on Saipan that became so successful they opened a second place, with 150 tables. He worked the kitchen and she worked the front. \u201cShe attracted a lot of friendly customers,\u201d her husband recalled.Her brother, Song Hai, joined her after his high school graduation, eventually opening a henna tattoo parlor with a friend. When their mother came for a visit, she posed for photographs beside her daughter\u2019s well-stocked restaurant bar, her smile radiating pride.\u201cWe had a real sense of accomplishment,\u201d Mr. Song said in Mandarin.But a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011, disrupting a main source of tourism to Saipan, as well as the fortunes of Song Yang and Song Hai. The restaurants were sold, the tattoo parlor shuttered.Photographs from her brother\u2019s wedding in March 2013 capture the last happy times that Song Yang spent with her family. Here she is back home, posing with the bride and groom. Here she is, sharing a restaurant meal with the growing family. Here she is.A month later, Song Yang joined the hundreds who arrive daily at Kennedy Airport, direct from China. Straight to Flushing she went, like so many before, where she hoped that she and her husband would succeed again as restaurateurs.But there is the dream of Flushing, and the reality.With her husband now too old for kitchen work, Song Yang became their sole source of income. A waitressing job failed, as did a short-lived Chinese fast-food venture on Main Street. So she became a home health aide, and took a massage-therapy course in the hope of earning additional money. Then a friend told her of a more lucrative opportunity, to be found along 40th Road.The understanding of her parents and brother was that Song Yang worked in reflexology. They knew that gifts arrived from New York. That she called regularly for video chats while sitting in a black office chair, sometimes eating a bowl of porridge. That when her nephew was born, she proudly announced on social media that she had become an aunt \u2014 a \u201cgugu.\u201dThat she seemed happy, mostly. But there was that time when she refused to video-chat for several days, after which she explained that a man had beaten her about the face. And that other time, when she revealed that a man \u2014 a law-enforcement officer, she said \u2014 had held a gun to her head while forcing her to perform oral sex. Family members reassured her: She had no choice.Song Yang told her family last fall that she had booked a flight to China for December, and was looking forward to meeting her nephew for the first time. So far she had connected with him only online, through the popular WeChat app, where her avatar sometimes featured a butterfly.In the 19th century it had a volunteer firehouse, a nursery and residents with Irish surnames. Just in living memory, there was Harry Barlow\u2019s auto garage, the mimeograph services of Case the Printer, an appliance store proud of its color Zenith television sets and, of course, the Old Roma restaurant \u2014 famous for its veal cutlets on linguine, and that yellow sponge cake with pineapple filling.It is all long gone, replaced by ginger duck rice casserole and a shaved ice treat called red bean baobing. The 40th Road of today is almost entirely Chinese, its restaurant signs often featuring no English at all \u2014 one more reminder that the only New York constant is change.The street\u2019s 20 buildings, including Song Yang\u2019s, are mostly three- and four-story structures from the 1980s and \u201990s that evoke a utilitarian, Soviet-bloc drabness. Narrow and claustrophobic, they loom like set pieces for a film noir.The one-way street itself always feels like a wrong turn, an obstacle course of idling delivery trucks and construction equipment. One end elbows past a small playground; the other runs into the ever-clogged Main Street intersection, where plainclothes police officers can often be seen sitting in an unmarked vehicle in an attempt to deter quality-of-life crimes. Pickpocketing is so prevalent that a nearby grocery displays signs of a stick figure reaching into another stick figure\u2019s handbag.Above, looming airliners grumble as they approach LaGuardia Airport, across Flushing Bay. Just behind 40th Road, Long Island Rail Road trains grind and whine along the raised tracks. Up and down the block, the earthy aromas of produce stands and restaurant waste commingle with the classical Chinese instrumental music emanating from a soup-dumpling restaurant.And here, beside the upturned fruit crates and the overloaded garbage bags, stand the women of the massage parlors. In their 40s and 50s, mostly, they check their cellphones, drag on untaxed Korean cigarettes bought in bulk, and chat, but with eyes scanning for unattached men lacking a law-enforcement vibe.Massage?The offer is understood, if not explicit. If the man consents, he is led up the stairs of one of the dull buildings, where massage operations are often crammed amid barbershops, driving schools and employment agencies.Massage parlors offering sex are hardly a recent phenomenon, and business models vary. But the trade along 40th Road is especially audacious. The women stand on both sides of the street \u2014 five, 10, a dozen at a time \u2014 as ubiquitous as the delivery trucks. In the merciless heat and cold, they sweat and shiver on staked ground, prompting resentful neighborhood complaints about lost business and children exposed to the seamy daily spectacle.A common arrangement on 40th Road is one in which a \u201cboss\u201d rents an apartment or office from one of the building\u2019s tenants, then provides space to women for a $20 cut of whatever they charge each client. The general expectation is that each woman will generate at least $100 a day for the boss.But the bosses provide no meaningful protection. The women are at the mercy of the street, where they have been robbed, beaten, raped, thrown down stairs. The surveillance cameras nearly always present are intended less for security, perhaps, than to provide the boss with a way to count the clients who walk through the door.Over several months, the women along 40th Road shared in Mandarin the stories of how they came to be standing here, offering sex to strangers. They use names like masks. Some have chosen Americanized names \u2014 Jenny, for example \u2014 while others have been rechristened by bosses with nicknames that sound like Lala, or Kiki, or Yoyo.They came from all over China, and from myriad backgrounds. One woman said she used to clean houses. Another said she was a former reporter who covered Chinese real estate. Several described the circumstances that left them in economic straits: a failed bus company, a bankrupt jade dealership, a gambling-addicted husband.One woman often positions herself near a standpipe at the corner of Main Street, so as to be the first to approach any man venturing west. She is in her 60s, small-framed and usually dressed in layers, with long hair dyed black. She said in a raspy voice that she was from the southeastern Chinese province of Jiangxi, and that she was trying to pay off a debt incurred by her adult son in a business deal gone wrong.She had visited two job agencies on 40th Road, looking for work as a nanny, but nothing panned out. And now she was here, on the corner, where her half-joking refrain \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m too old\u201d \u2014 did not seem to deter clients.Another woman, who gave her name as Xiao Li \u2014 or Little Li \u2014 said she was from the city of Dexing, in Jiangxi Province, home to a well-known copper mine, where she once was a welder. Thin and often wearing a simple black dress, she said she had briefly left the street to study legitimate massage \u2014 \u201cSo my heart could have a little bit of peace\u201d \u2014 but had concluded that the classes were a waste of money. Back she came to 40th Road.\u201cMy body can\u2019t take it,\u201d Ms. Li, 50, said. \u201cMy body can\u2019t take so many men.\u201dOthers were even more expansive, including a stocky, 40-ish woman with cropped black hair and a lazy eye who called herself Rachel. Eating a sweet baked potato at a dumpling stall on Main Street, she recalled that while working at a job she loathed \u2014 waitressing at a Chinese restaurant in Seattle \u2014 she began hunting through WeChat forums for leads on other work, and came across an offer that she recalled saying:Massage Woman to Stand on Street. $20,000 a month. Flushing, N.Y.Rachel called the number to ask what the job entailed. The boss replied: Everything.After her first day, Rachel said, \u201cI got home and took a shower, and cried.\u201dShe paused at the memory, and added, \u201cBut then I just thought to myself, \u2018I have to keep thinking positively.\u2019\u201dMichael Chu, the longtime neighborhood advocate, has befriended some of the women who stand outside his building on 40th Road, and occasionally offers them assistance with police matters. His office, where an old dog named Scout is usually napping on some cardboard, is furnished with desks left behind by an accountant who moved rather than work beside a massage parlor.A bespectacled man of 65, Mr. Chu has listened to the travails of these women, whom he calls \u201csisters.\u201d The beatings, the robberies, the harassment from teenagers in the playground, the pressure to attract enough clients to cover their \u201crent\u201d to the boss. The hopes they harbor for permanent residence, for having enough money, for finally not doing this.\u201cThey also have an American dream,\u201d Mr. Chu said. \u201cThe sisters have an American dream.\u201dHis was Paul Hayes. Single, in his early 40s and living in Queens, he carried himself with a seen-it-all air \u2014 but she beguiled him. They gradually became lovers, then good friends with vague plans to rekindle their romance someday. But she lived with her husband in an apartment a block away. It was complicated.She had a good sense of humor, and often solicited his advice \u2014 although she ignored him when he recommended bolstering the building\u2019s security system. She also confided about the dangers and vagaries of her work life.\u201cShe really hated doing it,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.Even so, Song Yang established herself as a fierce competitor in the circumscribed world of 40th Road. Fueled by coffee and Red Bull, she toiled nearly nonstop, as if facing some self-imposed deadline. Word was that she was trying to save up to open her own Vietnamese restaurant, or to buy a house in New York for her aging parents, or to just move on.Her sharp elbows and inexhaustible style irked some of the other women, leading to arguments, shoves and occasional hair pulling. One competitor recalled that if a man chose another masseuse, Song Yang would tease the client about preferring older women.But another woman remembered a gentler, more generous Song Yang. She said that when she arrived at 40th Road, Song Yang insisted that she accept several pairs of pants to ward against winter.Song Yang\u2019s domain was a fourth-floor apartment at 135-32 40th Road, directly above another massage operation. The apartment door faced a boiler room and a makeshift gate that was intended to keep vagrants from sleeping on the roof, but also to protect the hot pepper plants nurtured there by the aged custodian.As were most things on 40th Road, her rental arrangement was convoluted.The building was constructed in 1992 by Jentai Tsai, 85, a prominent, even revered, banker in Flushing, and is owned by a real estate company overseen by his son, Eugene Morimoto Tsai. In a brief conversation last month, the younger Tsai, 42, said that he did not know that a woman had fallen from his building last year, or that his building had long been a hub of illicit massage activity.They both said, and city records confirm, that the building\u2019s managing agent \u2014 responsible for collecting rent \u2014 was another man of local distinction: Peter Tu, 62, the longtime director of the Flushing Chinese Business Association, a member of Community Board 7 and a district leader for the Democratic Party.Outside his office around the corner, Mr. Tu at first denied that he was involved with the 40th Road building, but then said that he had merely tried to assist the Tsai family by collecting the $18,500 monthly rent from the main, first-floor tenant, the Shi Li Xiang seafood restaurant. He said he no longer served in this role, had never taken any payment \u201cfrom the street,\u201d and had no idea what arrangements the restaurant had with the tenants and subtenants upstairs.\u201cI\u2019m always in the middle,\u201d Mr. Tu said.A man identifying himself as the boss of the first-floor restaurant began to shout when asked about the tenants upstairs. \u201cHow am I supposed to know the names of the people to whom I rent?\u201d he asked in Mandarin. \u201cYou want me to go up and ask everyone who they are?\u201dAbove the restaurant, in this building owned and managed by Flushing men of stature, Song Yang paid a flat fee for her apartment \u2014 as much as $400 a night, competitors say \u2014 to a square-headed, elusive \u201cboss\u201d who goes by Lao Li, or Old Li, a kind of avuncular nickname conveying familiarity with the women who work for him. But the particulars of his subleasing arrangements are as difficult to pin down as he is.One spring midnight, Lao Li made a rare appearance on 40th Road to mediate a dispute over clients that had erupted among the women. When a reporter approached and called him by name, Lao Li looked up \u2014 and bolted. He dashed east down the center of 40th Road, dodging cars, before vanishing into the dark Flushing night.Although Song Yang and other women often quarreled, they occasionally gathered with Lao Li at the restaurant downstairs, or at a nearby karaoke bar. They\u2019d watch him blow out a candle on his birthday cake, or sing along to a song popular in his native northeast China. At the Chinese New Year, he would hand out red envelopes containing small cash gifts.In cellphone videos and photographs of these get-togethers, the participants could easily be mistaken for co-workers at an accounting firm, making a night of it. They seemed untroubled by their profession\u2019s many perils, including robbery, bodily harm \u2014 and, especially, arrest.Arrest attracted unwelcome attention. It jeopardized applications for permanent residency. It magnified the humiliation. And it usually meant an appearance at the Human Trafficking Intervention Court, held on Fridays in the basement of the Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, where Mandarin sometimes seems as common as English.Established nearly 15 years ago, the court set out to treat women in the commercial sex trade less as accused criminals than as victims of trafficking and exploitation. They are told that charges will be dismissed and records sealed if they complete several individualized counseling sessions \u2014 focused, say, on job training, or education \u2014 with Garden of Hope, Restore NYC, Womankind or another outreach organization. A group called Sanctuary for Families is also on hand to provide immigration services.Song Yang went through this process more than once. In addition to expunging the arrests from her record, these court appearances provided pause, forcing her to confront the consequences of her work life.In the summer of 2016, Song Yang began frequent WeChat dialogues with a Flushing lawyer, Chen Mingli, that at first focused on acquiring permanent residency \u2014 a process that he repeatedly told her could take months and months. Still, she fretted that her arrest history would thwart her application for a green card.Gradually, though, their conversations came to reflect the darker realities of her 40th Road realm, with sobbing emoticons peppering her messages.Mr. Chen assured her that the matter would not affect the status of her immigration case, and implored her to cooperate with the police. But her intense desire to avoid attention, coupled with fear of retaliation from her attacker, overshadowed everything.The police circulated a wanted poster based on a hazy photograph of the man lifted from the surveillance video. A retired United States Marshal, who surrendered after someone mentioned him as a possible suspect, participated in a lineup.But Song Yang identified another man, wrongly, as her attacker. In addition, a DNA sample from the retired marshal did not match samples taken from Song Yang\u2019s clothing. The case was eventually closed.Several months later, in late September 2017, she was arrested a third time on a prostitution charge. Handcuffed, led away from 40th Road, held overnight.Song Yang answered:She explained that she had been forced to make hard decisions and that it had been difficult to suppress her feelings while married to a much older man who seemed increasingly removed from her day-to-day life. She felt \u201cmorally depraved,\u201d and sometimes thought about giving it all up and going home \u2014 or worse.Mr. Chen was never formally hired by Song Yang, but now his central role seemed to be to buoy her spirits.Song Yang only sank deeper.I\u2019ve fallen so low I can\u2019t be saved.She continued:Without purpose, without direction, what meaning is there to keep on living? I used to be a woman who was very strong in her life. I strove for perfection in everything I did. I never thought that my life would turn out this way. I\u2019ve truly failed.At the end of October, Song Yang made one last visit to Mr. Chen\u2019s office. She confided that another client had badly beaten her a couple of weeks earlier \u2014 an assault she had not reported to the police \u2014 and showed him photographs of her bruised and swollen face.\u201cWhy am I so unlucky?\u201d he remembers her asking.The tip hardly came as a revelation, since shady activities at this address had generated scores of 911 calls over the years. To some, the building even had the aura of being cursed, following a horrific crime in 2010, in which a deranged stalker stabbed a woman in the second-floor hallway and removed her heart and lungs.Forty-three arrests had taken place in the building over the last decade, more than a few sex-related, the most recent that of Song Yang. Ensnared in an undercover sting in late September, she had tried but failed to hide in the cramped boiler room across from her apartment, and was charged with offering sex for $70.Her case, which had prompted those despairing messages to the lawyer Mr. Chen, was one of 91 massage-parlor-related arrests in the 109th Precinct in 2017, and one of six along 40th Road. According to court records, none of those arrests were for pimping, solicitation or operating an unlicensed massage parlor.The police later determined that the sign actually said, \u201cAttention, the driving school is on the third floor next door.\u201dAn undercover officer then telephoned a woman associated with the building who was known as SiSi. They arranged an appointment for the next evening, Saturday, Nov. 25. Her price: $120.On the appointed day, members of the Queens North Vice Enforcement Squad met at their base in College Point to discuss the seven locations they planned to hit that night. The closest target became the first: the bleak building at 135-32 40th Road.The vice officers went over their safety plan. They chose their identifying color of the day. They agreed upon the mission\u2019s assorted distress signals and code words, including what the primary undercover officer would say to indicate that sex had been offered for money. Now they were ready.The 10-member team headed out into the evening, unseasonably mild for late November. They parked along Prince Street, across from the White Bear dumpling place and just short of where the one-way street bends east to become 40th Road. The team leader and two arresting officers sat in the first car, with two more arresting officers in the second car. The third vehicle was for prisoner transport.The team tested its recording device, which used Bluetooth to transmit one-way audio. No problem. The green light was given: Go.Minutes later, the undercover officer approached his target, Song Yang, just inside her building\u2019s entrance. He wore an olive-green jacket, jeans and a cap. She wore a short winter coat, a red-and-black scarf, leggings and one of her signature headbands \u2014 with a small bow that resembled a butterfly.The officer could not have known that this woman had just attempted a video chat with her younger brother, who was still asleep in China. That she had plans to fly home in December. That she had kept her court-mandated appointments with Restore NYC, a nonprofit organization that helps foreign-born victims of sex trafficking. That her fifth and last session with Restore was four days away.About all he knew was her police nickname for the night: \u201cJD Ponytail.\u201dJane Doe Ponytail.She led him up the worn stairs. She gave him a peck of a kiss in the hall, and opened her apartment door. Another woman, brand-new to Flushing and known as Momo, was already occupied with a man in the second bedroom.Song Yang walked her client to her bedroom, where, according to the police, she offered sexual intercourse for the reduced price of $80. He consented to the arrangement and, heading to the bathroom, managed to utter the code word into his transmitter that a positive \u2014 that is, illegal \u2014 agreement had been reached. He also hoped to signal to colleagues that it was time to move in, but a wary Song Yang prevented him from having privacy, telling him to keep the bathroom door open.\u201cThis is bad service,\u201d the officer said.Responding to the undercover officer\u2019s signal, the three idling police vehicles turned onto 40th Road, smack into its everlasting gridlock. Four officers got out and hustled to the building. Climbing the dreary stairs, they passed their undercover colleague, who pointed to Song Yang\u2019s door as he descended \u2014 and as she watched on the monitor in her apartment.With the police demanding that she open the door, and preparing to break it down, a panicked Song Yang hurried to the apartment\u2019s north balcony. The other woman, Momo, emerged naked from her bedroom to investigate the noise, but hustled back to hide when she realized it was the police.The balcony was not equipped with surveillance cameras, leaving what happened next to the imagination. It is possible that Song Yang was hoping to escape, perhaps by reaching for a wire that ran vertically past her balcony. It is possible that she was trying to land on the protruding metal sign of the restaurant below. It is also possible that she intended to kill herself.It is fact that she hit the pavement directly in front of the undercover officer she had pecked on the cheek just five minutes earlier. His supervisors say that the officer remains shaken to this day.Later that night, while Song Yang was lying in a hospital bed with multiple fractures to her face, head and body, the police placed her under arrest. She died in the morning \u2014 and the arrest was, in the parlance of the police, \u201cvoided.\u201dSong Yang\u2019s mother and brother had traveled 7,000 miles to better understand the how and the why of her death.Her distraught parents had telephoned their other child, Song Hai, to deliver words so heavy that he dropped his smartphone, cracking its glass. Not accepting what he heard, he sent a WeChat message to his sister that depicted a pair of clinking coffee mugs, along with a gentle request to please call home.The lack of an answer was the answer.The mother and brother spent their first two weeks in Flushing tending to the affairs of death. Then, on a dismal day of late December rain, they made their way to the Chun Fook funeral home, a few blocks from 40th Road. Though some had recommended a modest ceremony, the family had insisted on a more elaborate service, in a spacious room with a chandelier.The dark wood coffin sat at the front before rows of chairs that would remain empty. No women from 40th Road. No Lao Li. A pair of vertical scrolls with parallel aphorisms written in Chinese calligraphy \u2014 \u201cPut Down Your Burdens and Return to the Lord\u201d and \u201cTake Up Tranquillity and Celebrate Everlasting Life\u201d \u2014 hung on either side.One minister delivered prayers in English, while another repeated those prayers in Mandarin. The few mourners included Song Yang\u2019s close friend Paul Hayes; the community advocate Michael Chu; Chen Mingli, the lawyer who had tried to help her seek permanent residency; her husband, Chau Chuong, now 78, who had come from California, where he had been living for his health; and her mother and brother, their heads bowed and hands folded.Then it was a short drive along the Grand Central Parkway to the All Souls Chapel and Crematory at St. Michael\u2019s Cemetery. This is where Song Yang\u2019s battered body was returned to dust, and where, in his frustration and grief, her brother vowed justice and punched a wall.The official explanation for his only sibling\u2019s death made no sense to Mr. Song. After all, she had already paid for her flight home to celebrate their mother\u2019s upcoming birthday and to meet, for the first time, his 5-year-old son. Suicide was not possible, he reasoned. Darker forces might be at play. He had already begun his own investigation.One snowy night soon after arriving from China, Mr. Song appeared at his sister\u2019s 40th Road building with Mr. Hayes. Their plan was to break into her apartment, collect her belongings \u2014 and, if possible, retrieve any surveillance video.Mr. Song, a learning specialist by trade, and Mr. Hayes, a computer consultant, crept up the 50 tiled steps to the fourth-floor door, which was secured with a locked chain. Fearing the noise of the hammer and small acetylene torch they had planned to use, Mr. Hayes hustled to a Home Depot a mile away and returned with a hacksaw.After a few minutes of sawing, the chain gave way, and the two men pushed open the dull-gray door to enter the setting of a life interrupted. The police had taken the surveillance equipment, but everything else made it seem as if Song Yang might return at any minute.In the two bedrooms, rumpled sheets. In the kitchen, a Pepsi and a half-empty bottle of Bacardi, sliced carrots and apples, and the black chair that Mr. Song recognized as the one his sister sat in while video-chatting with her family. In the living room, a raised table with a red curtained skirt, on which sat a CD player, a pair of sunglasses and a lucky cat figurine. Placed neatly on the floor, a pair of pink shoes.On the snow-dusted front balcony, a broom, an upside-down bucket, a stool, a few plastic bags containing fruit and eggs. And, just beyond, the beckoning lights and shadows of the street below.His ever-evolving theory:That his sister had been sexually assaulted by a police officer. That she had filed a complaint. That the subsequent police lineup was fixed to protect the assailant. Then it was payback, which explained why, of all the women along 40th Road, only Song Yang was arrested in September, and was about to be arrested again in late November.As is standard when a death occurs during a police action, the Queens district attorney and the police department\u2019s Force Investigation Division were investigating. But Mr. Song was already beginning to believe that nearly every corner of the American criminal justice system \u2014 from the police to the medical examiner \u2014 was colluding to hide the truth.He patrolled downtown Flushing. He interrogated women and shopkeepers. He plastered the streets with leaflets featuring photographs of his sister and promising a \u201cBig Reward!\u201d The plea appeared in Chinese and in fractured English:Hello! When you saw the photo, SiSi (Song Yang) was no longer alive. She fell from and died on 11/25/2017 at 135-32 4FL in Flushing. Families as well as the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau are eager to find out the truth of her death. If you have ANY CLUES, please contact me ASAP. Absolutely Confidential \u2026 (Her brother Song Hai)His sleuthing occasionally paid off. One evening, amid the Main Street crush, Mr. Song spotted a man he recognized from his sister\u2019s WeChat photographs: short, solidly built, and with a distinctive, block-shaped head.Excited, Mr. Song crossed the street and, right at the Roosevelt Avenue intersection, near the subway entrance, grabbed the man by the arm. Mr. Song recalled what happened next:The two officers understood Mr. Song\u2019s intentions, he later recalled, but they explained that this was America, not China, and that he was unlawfully detaining a man who wasn\u2019t present when his sister\u2019s fall took place. They separated the men, and Lao Li floated away in the rush-hour stream.Later that evening, an angry Lao Li telephoned Mr. Song. In the conversation that Mr. Song duly recorded on his phone, Lao Li vented about the audacity of summoning the police \u2014 \u201cIf you don\u2019t have evidence, how could you say I\u2019m the boss?\u201d \u2014 before giving his version of the realities on 40th Road.He said that he rented the apartment to Song Yang for $3,100 a month \u2014 hardly the $12,000 that was rumored on the street. \u201cShe and I really didn\u2019t have any employment relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that at the start of the month, I would take the rent.\u201dLao Li said she called him her \u201cboss\u201d so that others wouldn\u2019t bully her, but he insisted that she was her own boss: prone to arrest, sure, but also smart, tenacious and tough.Throughout the conversation, Lao Li characteristically remained at a distance \u2014 even when describing that fateful night. He rushed to 40th Road after receiving a call that \u201cSiSi had jumped from the building,\u201d he said, but by the time he got there, \u201cyour sister had already been taken away.\u201dAs Mr. Song conducted his frustrating investigation, his mother spent her days in the numbing cocoon of grief. Once so proud of her entrepreneurial children, Shi Yumei was now a sorrowful woman in a foreign world, gingerly navigating a small cart down crowded Main Street, her pale gray knit cap pulled low, her mind occupied with worry. How, for example, would she and her son, here on temporary visas, survive on the little money they had brought with them?An encounter with a bellowing street evangelist eventually led her to St. George\u2019s, the old Episcopal church on Main Street whose steeple has long been a Flushing landmark. Its congregation embraced her, smothering her with food, clothing and compassion. Locking hands and forming a prayer circle one day, strangers asked God to grant peace to this new person among them, who felt so blessed that she began to volunteer at the church\u2019s food pantry as a way of giving back.One cool April morning, she donned an orange apron and joined 40 other volunteers, nearly all of them immigrants, as they prepared for the ritual that unfolds every Wednesday along the old church\u2019s north side, opposite a Lucille Roberts fitness center. They unloaded the crates from trucks, bagged the fruit and vegetables, and established an assembly line of food down the sidewalk: turnips and fennel, lettuce and apples, onions and melons.The decade-old operation had gradually adapted to the ways of Flushing, with organizers taking note of the tensions caused by different understandings of personal space among ethnic groups. The solution: two alternating lines \u2014 one that was entirely Asian, and the other a mix of black, white and Latino.On this morning, the Asian line ran alongside the church\u2019s cemetery wall, and the other line stretched down to a firehouse. But things moved apace, thanks in large part to the high-spirited efficiency of the volunteers \u2014 including Shi Yumei, who smiled at her sense of belonging as she proffered bags of onions.Each evening, after long days of volunteering and investigating, mother and son returned to a worn apartment catering to transients, not far from 40th Road. Some lodgers paid $20 a night for a narrow bed in the living room. But with some financial help from the church and a few nonprofit organizations, Mr. Song and Ms. Shi managed to pay $1,000 a month for a cramped bedroom and first dibs on a shared kitchen.They slept beside a closet packed with clothes and accessories that Song Yang left behind. Tears were shed over a single strand of black hair found on a coat. They lived in the presence of her absence.To find sleep, the mother would hold a small audio device close to her ear and listen to lively recorded stories about historical Chinese triumphs, cuddled beside one of her daughter\u2019s plush teddy bears. This way, Ms. Shi said in Mandarin, \u201cI know my daughter is here with me.\u201dTwo feet away, her son would lie in his twin bed near the window, cigarettes on the nightstand, spent beer cans under the bed, another Long Island Rail Road train clattering in the distance. Here he would try to piece together the stray bits of his investigation.He had found a grainy photograph from his sister\u2019s WeChat feed of the stocky, bald man who had supposedly sexually assaulted her, and convinced himself that a bald police detective, appearing in cellphone videos taken on the sidewalk after his sister\u2019s fall, was the same man.He had also obtained photographs and forensic notes from the autopsy. Poring over the graphic images, he decided that the discoloration around his sister\u2019s face came from a beating, and that her broken fingernails suggested some kind of struggle \u2014 and, therefore, a cover-up.This was America. Not China. Exactly.They took their seats among the defendants, including a woman in glasses often seen calling out to men on 40th Road. Mr. Song sat with his hands clasped and back erect; his mother was bent forward, as if in prayer. They waited.An air of empathy defines the court, which is intended to encourage women engaged in the commercial sex trade to avail themselves of counseling and other diversionary programs. On most Fridays, the judge, the prosecutor and the defense lawyer are women, and the lanky head court officer is determined to make the defendants feel safe and respected. He does his best to dissuade any pimps or bosses from taking a seat.Prominent in the dozen pews are Chinese women facing the usual massage-parlor-related charges of prostitution or unlicensed massage. Court-appointed lawyers from the Legal Aid Society or Queens Law Associates usually guide them through the process, along with a Mandarin-speaking interpreter and advocates from one of the nonprofit groups specializing in sex-trafficking outreach and immigration services.Defenders of the program maintain that until a better approach is developed, arrests \u2014 followed by appearances in trafficking court \u2014 provide the best chance for intervention. Even if a woman returns to 40th Road, they say, she will at least have the names of people to contact if she needs help.Others, though, counter that for many women caught in the commercial sex trade, an arrest only exacerbates their trauma. Besides, they say, one doesn\u2019t need to be arrested in order to receive helpful contact information.Judge Toko Serita, who has presided over the trafficking court for a decade, summons the defendants, one by one, to stand before her, as a court officer calls out, \u201cMandarin interpreter required, and present.\u201d The judge has short black hair, glasses and a welcoming, even reassuring demeanor, whether it\u2019s the defendant\u2019s first appearance or her last.How are you today? \u2026 Are you studying English? \u2026 This is a really good streak \u2026 I want to congratulate you for completing all your sessions with Garden of Hope \u2026 Stay out of trouble, lead a law-abiding life for the next six months, and the record will be expunged \u2026 Good luck to you.On this morning, several cases were heard before a court officer finally called out: \u201c03585 dash 17. Yang Song!\u201dEven though she was five months dead, Song Yang still had an open criminal case: the arrest on a prostitution charge two months before her fatal fall. The sprawling New York City judicial system may seem overwhelmed, even chaotic, but in the end its books must be balanced. This meant that a formality known as an \u201cabatement by death\u201d \u2014 a dismissal, in effect \u2014 was required to close the short chapter on Song Yang, or Yang Song, as the system sometimes rendered her name.Judge Serita was informed that the deceased defendant\u2019s mother and brother were present and would like to thank the court. The request stilled the courtroom. The judge sighed in sympathy.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cUm. All right. This case is now going to be abated by death.\u201dShe went on to tell Song Yang\u2019s mother and brother that everyone involved in the trafficking court was deeply saddened by their loved one\u2019s \u201ctragic and untimely death.\u201d She expressed hope that they \u201csomehow find peace with these unfortunate circumstances.\u201dMr. Song and Ms. Shi acknowledged her words with nods. They walked out of the courtroom, past an \u201cExit Only \u2014 No Re-Entry\u201d sign, and into the late-morning brightness. He lit a cigarette. She adjusted her backpack. They continued on in silence.Two weeks later, the mother and brother returned to Kew Gardens for a long-awaited meeting with investigators from the Homicide Investigations Bureau of the Queens district attorney\u2019s office. With everyone seated around a dark-wood conference table in a windowless room, the investigators shared the results of their monthslong inquiry, including 22 minutes of video culled from cameras positioned both inside and outside the building at 135-32 40th Road.In these images, their beloved daughter and sister appears in the fullness of life. Here is Song Yang, leading the undercover officer up the stairs. Here she is, kicking him out of the apartment, watching the officers ascend the stairs \u2014 rushing in alarm toward the balcony.Here, from street level, something falling, and then a beloved daughter and sister, crumpled on the pavement. Watching the video again a few days later, Ms. Shi noticed the headband that flies off her daughter\u2019s head.\u201cShe especially loved butterflies,\u201d the mother said.The video over, the investigators laid out their sober findings: The police involved in a bust-and-buy sting on 40th Road the night of Nov. 25, 2017, did not cause the death of Song Yang. To begin with, no officer was even in the fourth-floor apartment when she jumped or fell.Her brother scoffed at this conclusion. He said something rude in Mandarin. Meeting over.Night comes to 40th Road.The fruit and vegetable peddlers have boxed up and boarded up, and the last patrons of air-conditioned restaurants have stepped out to evaporate in the late June warmth. But the women are here, as always, calling out an invitation that sounds almost like a plea.They stand outside the same doorways, including the one for 135-32, where Song Yang once lingered. Very soon after she died, her fourth-floor apartment became the address for a new massage business. Its name: Heaven on Fourth.A few steps away, at the entrance to another of the gloomy buildings owned and operated by prominent Flushing businessmen, a thin woman in a brown dress sits in a metal chair with a square of Styrofoam for padding, studying her cellphone through the smoke of her cigarette. Then she pulls out a bag of overripe cherries from the building\u2019s broken mailbox and, between the repeated offerings of her services, spits out the pits and tosses them into the street, not far from a lamppost adorned with a poster bearing the face of Song Yang (\u201cBig Reward!\u201d).To the woman\u2019s right, roasted duck carcasses hang in the window of the Corner 28 restaurant, where a man is mop-swabbing the sticky floor. To her left, sorrowful creatures loll in a seafood restaurant\u2019s murky tank. Above her head, scaffolding provides protection from the stucco that city officials say has been coming loose from the buildings. Rain begins to fall.A nearby tanker truck groans as it sucks away a restaurant\u2019s used cooking oil through a large hose that snakes across the sidewalk and into the bowels of a building. The women adapt: They step over the hose, ignore the smell, raise their voices.One of the women leads a potential client to a building\u2019s threshold, but he keeps walking; she mutters an epithet in Mandarin. Then a buzz-cut junkie, who just hours before was asleep on the pavement, begins to harass the women, disrupting their business by hovering, touching, dropping his sweatpants and simulating sex acts. He enters one of their buildings and urinates in the hall.It is all ephemeral, of course, a realization reinforced daily by the laborers trudging down this street to the subway, bone-weary from working another of the construction projects that are redefining Flushing. Few today remember the Old Roma restaurant that once thrived on 40th Road, just as few tomorrow will remember a Chinese immigrant who once died on 40th Road.For now, at least, if you linger on the street, you will encounter those who remember her \u2014 including, occasionally, clients still looking for SiSi.You might see Lala, and Kiki, and Yoyo, along with other women who competed with Song Yang. You might see her lanky brother, Song Hai, who still struggles to understand why no one will be brought to justice for all that his sister went through in her adopted country. His grief smolders, as does his distrust of America.Lastly, you might see Song Yang\u2019s mother, Shi Yumei.One evening, Ms. Shi paused outside a building where some women were offering massages to passing men. Raising the drooping bags held in her hands, she explained that she had just left the food pantry at the Episcopal church on Main Street, where she had recently been baptized. She said the pastor had emphasized the importance of sharing what you have.The mother placed a bag of sweet potatoes in the doorway that had once been Song Yang\u2019s domain. It was an offering of sorts, a gift to women like her daughter. Then she was gone, assumed into the Flushing blur.Al Baker and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.

In Representative Devin Nunes\u2019s district, California\u2019s 22nd, both candidates raised enormous sums even though Mr. Nunes, a Republican, has been widely considered safe by political watchers. Mr. Nunes raised about $3.2 million while his challenger, Andrew Janz, raked in $4.4 million. Mr. Nunes, however, had more than $5 million left in his campaign chest as of Sept. 30.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)With luxury housing developments in the works, including a $1.4 billion, 815-unit tower, the district is \u201cneck deep\u201d in gentrification and facing \u201chyper-development,\u201d said Tomie Arai, an activist and a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade.But both heritage enterprises and new establishments are working to balance change and tradition to maintain the neighborhood\u2019s cultural authenticity.\u201cI am giving back to Chinatown and the city of San Francisco,\u201d one business owner said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until I die.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Google Retreats from Berlin Plan Opposed by Local Groups", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 What Google wants, Google usually gets, but in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg neighborhood, residents have won a battle against the internet giant, which backed away from a project in the face of local opposition.Google had planned to convert an old electric company building in Kreuzberg into an incubator for tech start-ups, the kind of development that could have altered the fabric of the funky, multicultural area.Instead, the company announced on Wednesday that after sinking millions of dollars into the project, it will make the space available, free of charge, to nonprofit social service and local advocacy groups \u2014 a move its adversaries welcomed.The decision handed a surprise victory to anti-gentrification groups who had protested Google\u2019s plan, but some city officials saw it as a lost economic opportunity and a stain on Berlin\u2019s vaunted tech-friendly reputation.Kreuzberg has long been one of the most affordable areas of Berlin, making it a haven for students, immigrants, artists and activists, a hub of culture, night life and left-wing politics. But in a pattern repeated in similar neighborhoods in many of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities, affluent people have moved in, too, in recent years, bringing with them the social tensions of gentrification.\u201cThey push out the people who were here before,\u201d said Achim Koppitsch, 60, who runs a vinyl record store in Kreuzberg. \u201cYou can\u2019t find any more cool places \u2014 instead you get hipster cafes that roast their own beans.\u201dResidents opposed to the Kreuzberg project worried about tech salaries driving up rents in a neighborhood already dotted with new restaurants that local residents cannot afford. But reasons for the opposition went beyond gentrification: Some people were opposed to Google because of its data collection and tax avoidance practices.\u201cBecause it was Google, it was always bigger than just an anti-gentrification fight,\u201d said Konstantin Sergiou, a neighborhood activist who worked against the project. \u201cWe were lucky.\u201dLocal resistance to such projects is fairly common. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has faced opposition in Toronto, where it plans to redevelop a section of waterfront, and a Google plan to overhaul an area of San Jose, Calif., has faced criticism.But cities often see the gentrification that comes with an influx of tech workers as a good problem to have, and they compete with one another to attract big companies. Amazon\u2019s plans to open a second headquarters drew more than 200 bids.In Berlin\u2019s city government, opinion is split.Sebastian Czaja, the head of the pro-business Federal Democrats faction in Berlin\u2019s House of Representatives, said that Google\u2019s retreat will discourage other companies from settling in the city, which bills itself as the start-up capital of Europe.\u201cEven if the new use of the venue is welcome, the message to all future companies and investors is fatal: Do not come to Berlin, certainly not to Kreuzberg,\u201d he said in a statement.Progressive politicians lauded Google for its decision to focus on social services, charities and neighborhood groups.\u201cThere is a lot of potential for solving societal challenges,\u201d said Ramona Pop of the Greens, the city senator responsible for the economy, in a statement praising Google\u2019s announcement.Mr. Koppitsch\u2019s record store, across the street from the Google site, is typical of the old Kreuzberg, an informal community center where people come to chat and browse through the 10,000 discs.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very positive turn of events, and doing something social is much in tune with what Kreuzberg is about,\u201d he said.Ulrike Ebeling, 46, of GIZ, a corporation that works with the government in international aid and development, says she sees herself as a recently arrived gentrifier. Doing her wash in a Kreuzberg laundromat, she said she understood the local groups\u2019 arguments, but was not sure Google\u2019s withdrawal was good for the city.\u201cI think it would be good for a capital to have some big employers, not just the big stodgy government as an employer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut does it have to be in Kreuzberg? I don\u2019t know.\u201dGoogle, which first announced plans in late 2016 to open a 32,000-square-foot start-up campus, said this week that it had taken note of the protests, but took pains to counter the idea that it had been pressured into changing its plans. An incubator specifically for start-ups was no longer as needed as it was two years ago, the company said.\u201cFrom the beginning, our goal with the campus was not only to create a space for start-ups, but also to open the space up to social organizations,\u201d Rowan Barnett, the head of Google for start-ups in Germany, said in a statement.\u201cBut to do it, you need friends like Google on your side,\u201d he said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A.I. Is Helping Scientists Predict When and Where the Next Big Earthquake Will Be", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Countless dollars and entire scientific careers have been dedicated to predicting where and when the next big earthquake will strike. But unlike weather forecasting, which has significantly improved with the use of better satellites and more powerful mathematical models, earthquake prediction has been marred by repeated failure.Some of the world\u2019s most destructive earthquakes \u2014 China in 2008, Haiti in 2010 and Japan in 2011, among them \u2014 occurred in areas that seismic hazard maps had deemed relatively safe. The last large earthquake to strike Los Angeles, Northridge in 1994, occurred on a fault that did not appear on seismic maps.Now, with the help of artificial intelligence, a growing number of scientists say changes in the way they can analyze massive amounts of seismic data can help them better understand earthquakes, anticipate how they will behave, and provide quicker and more accurate early warnings.\u201cI am actually hopeful for the first time in my career that we will make progress on this problem,\u201d said Paul Johnson, a fellow at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who is among those at the forefront of this research.Well aware of past earthquake prediction failures, scientists are cautious when asked how much progress they have made using A.I. Some in the field refer to prediction as \u201cthe P word,\u201d because they do not even want to imply it is possible. But one important goal, they say, is to be able to provide reliable forecasts.The earthquake probabilities that are provided on seismic hazard maps, for example, have crucial consequences, most notably in instructing engineers how they should construct buildings. Critics say these maps are remarkably inexact.A map of Los Angeles lists the probability of an earthquake producing strong shaking within a given period of time \u2014 usually 50 years. That is based on a complex formula that takes into account, among other things, the distance from a fault, how fast one side of a fault is moving past the other, and the recurrence of earthquakes in the area.A study led by Katherine M. Scharer, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, estimated dates for nine previous earthquakes along the Southern California portion of the San Andreas fault dating back to the eighth century. The last big earthquake on the San Andreas was in 1857.Since the average interval between these big earthquakes was 135 years, a common interpretation is that Southern California is due for a big earthquake. Yet the intervals between earthquakes are so varied \u2014 ranging from 44 years to 305 years \u2014 that taking the average is not a very useful prediction tool. A big earthquake could come tomorrow, or it could come in a century and a half or more.This is one of the criticisms of Philip Stark, an associate dean at the University of California, Berkeley, at the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Dr. Stark describes the overall system of earthquake probabilities as \u201csomewhere between meaningless and misleading\u201d and has called for it to be scrapped.Scientists say seismic data is remarkably similar to the audio data that companies like Google and Amazon use in training neural networks to recognize spoken commands on coffee-table digital assistants like Alexa. When studying earthquakes, it is the computer looking for patterns in mountains of data rather than relying on the weary eyes of a scientist.\u201cRather than a sequence of words, we have a sequence of ground-motion measurements,\u201d said Zachary Ross, a researcher in the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Seismological Laboratory who is exploring these A.I. techniques. \u201cWe are looking for the same kinds of patterns in this data.\u201dHis first project showed that, at the very least, these machine-learning methods could significantly accelerate his experiments. He and his graduate students used a neural network to run an earthquake analysis 500 times faster than they could in the past. What once took days now took minutes.Dr. Meade also found that these A.I. techniques could lead to new insights. In the fall, with other researchers from Google and Harvard, he published a paper showing how neural networks can forecast earthquake aftershocks. This kind of project, he believes, represents an enormous shift in the way earthquake science is done. Similar work is underway at places like Caltech and Stanford University.\u201cWe are at a point where the technology can do as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 human experts,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Driving that guarded optimism is the belief that as sensors get smaller and cheaper, scientists will be able to gather larger amounts of seismic data. With help from neural networks and similar A.I. techniques, they hope to glean new insights from all this data.Dr. Ross and other Caltech researchers are using these techniques to build systems that can more accurately recognize earthquakes as they are happening and anticipate where the epicenter is and where the shaking will spread.Japan and Mexico have early warning systems, and California just rolled out its own. But scientists say artificial intelligence could greatly improve their accuracy, helping predict the direction and intensity of a rupture in the earth\u2019s crust and providing earlier warnings to hospitals and other institutions that could benefit from a few extra seconds of preparation.\u201cThe more detail you have, the better your forecasts will be,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Scientists working on these projects said neural networks have their limits. Though they are good at finding familiar signals in data, they are not necessarily suited to finding new kinds of signals \u2014 like the sounds tectonic plates make as they grind together.But at Los Alamos, Dr. Johnson and his colleagues have shown that a machine-learning technique called \u201crandom forests\u201d can identify previously unknown signals in a simulated fault created inside a lab. In one case, their system showed that a particular sound made by the fault, which scientists previously thought was meaningless, was actually an indication of when an earthquake would arrive.Some scientists, like Robert Geller, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, are unconvinced that A.I. will improve earthquake forecasts. He questions the very premise that past earthquakes can predict future ones. And ultimately, he said, we would only know the effectiveness of A.I. forecasting when earthquakes can be predicted beyond random chance.\u201cThere are no shortcuts,\u201d Dr. Geller said. \u201cIf you cannot predict the future, then your hypothesis is wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Schwarzman of Blackstone and Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock add to a string of ruptures between the business community and Saudi Arabia as questions continue to swirl over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi, who has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.Mr. Dimon, who was scheduled to be a headline speaker at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, announced that he was backing out on Sunday night. Other corporate leaders who have withdrawn include Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, Bill Ford, chairman of Ford Motor, and Diane Greene, the head of Google\u2019s cloud business.Behind the cancellations are allegations, made by Turkish authorities, that Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi operatives. The Saudi government has denied any wrongdoing, and says Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after his arrival.On Monday, conference organizers trumpeted a wide-ranging program of events and a roster of 150 confirmed speakers, indicating that they were undeterred by the cancellations.Turkish investigators are looking into the case of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and vanished.Snubbing the conference means that corporate chieftains have had to make difficult business calculations.The Saudi government is flush with cash from its vast oil reserves, and it has announced plans to invest billions of dollars around the world. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund, for instance, is one of Uber\u2019s biggest investors and sits on the ride-hailing company\u2019s board. And Blackstone has a partnership with the Saudi government on what is expected to be a $40 billion fund to invest in American infrastructure.But world leaders have increasingly turned up the heat on the Saudis over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.

They were perfectly clear \u2014 a sign of freshness.\u201cSee that beauty?\u201d said Mr. Dufays, his breath forming clouds in the glacial air. \u201cIt was caught this morning in Brittany, by independent fishermen in small boats.\u201dA buyer from a swank Parisian restaurant came by to inspect the fish, haggle over the price and secure delivery in time for a well-heeled lunch crowd later that day.Throughout the early morning, thousands of similar deals were unfolding inside more than 30 hulking meat, fruit, vegetable, dairy and flower pavilions nearby.By the time the sun peeked over the Paris skyline, throngs of workers had consumed nearly 3,000 coffees at Le Saint Hubert cafe, a local hangout, squeezed elbow-to-elbow at the horseshoe bar.\u201cThis is a working-class place,\u201d said Pascal Rolland, 56, a butcher, sipping white wine in a bloodstained apron at 5:30 a.m. after hacking meat carcasses all night. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here who doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201dWhen Les Halles outgrew its soaring glass-and-steel halls in central Paris, Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the president at the time, ordered it relocated to the suburb of Rungis.\u201cIf we don\u2019t press the fishmonger, the vegetable seller and the butcher to go digital, we\u2019ll disappear,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Layani, the president of Semmaris.But the idea of becoming cybermerchants has stirred a subtle \u201cr\u00e9sistance\u201d among many of Rungis\u2019s longtime denizens, most of them second- or third-generation sellers. Their forebears negotiated t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with buyers in Les Halles, a pen behind their ears to mark up orders and ledgers.\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think this can be done by computer,\u201d said Mr. Dufays, 58, pointing to stacks of brill and monkfish waiting to be sold. \u201cPeople need to see the fish, touch it, make sure it\u2019s fresh. You can\u2019t do that through a screen.\u201dThe only remote purchases he fielded were telephone orders from buyers who knew the quality of his goods.The prospect of earning fatter profits online, though, is alluring to many merchants here.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Desmettre, the president and a fourth-generation produce seller, said his grandfather traveled to farms with a wooden carriage to gather apples for resale. Today, Mr. Desmettre goes online to buy his cherries from Brazil, and has peaches delivered by train from southern France.Others aren\u2019t convinced of the online approach. Aurore Boussac, 30, a Parisian florist, stopped ordering online after receiving wilted flowers. Since then, she has resumed visiting Rungis to inspect tulips, roses and other blooms personally.\u201cWe\u2019re artisans,\u201d Ms. Boussac said. \u201cWe need to know what we\u2019re buying.\u201dMost important, she added, gesturing to the longtime flower sellers in the hall, \u201cwe have a relationship with the people here.\u201dWhether a deal is sealed among wheels of cheese or over a bottle of Bordeaux in a wood-paneled Rungis restaurant, such bonds are indispensable. And that extends to the relationships among the workers. Despite the market\u2019s vastness, it\u2019s more like a Proven\u00e7al village where food, work and pride transcend boundaries and bind people together.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work hard, you\u2019ll find a job,\u201d he said as a man swung a cleaver at a veal carcass. Mr. Fauch\u00e8re said he paid his workers nearly twice the minimum wage, and passes on his savoir-faire to give them skills for continued employment.Antoine D\u2019Agostino, 82, began working at age 12 in the teeming food pavilions in Les Halles, hauling produce in wooden carts.\u201cI never had time to go to school,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Agostino, lingering with his memories over an early morning cappuccino. \u201cBut I knew how to count.\u201dMr. D\u2019Agostino, a celebrity at the market, offered some memories of his early days in the business.Today, Mr. D\u2019Agostino helps his son run a wine wholesale business at Rungis, with Champagnes and Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus available on site and online.Still, with e-commerce, \u201cthere\u2019s no one who says hello or even thank you,\u201d he observed.\u201cPeople want to be treated like humans,\u201d he added. \u201cThe market is where that happens.\u201dEmma Bubola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Deutschland 86,\u2019 an East-West Thriller, Looks South", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou may find the scheme at the center of \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d a bit confusing. That\u2019s all right; so does Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), the reluctant East German spy roped into carrying it out.As it\u2019s explained to him, his government needs him to facilitate an illicit sale of West German weapons to South Africa, with the assistance of the African National Congress \u2014 even though the A.N.C. is bitterly opposed to the apartheid regime, and South Africa is allied with East Germany\u2019s rivals in the Cold War.Martin is told the deal is for the greater good. But he still has questions. \u201cEast, West,\u201d he says. \u201cWho are the good guys?\u201dIn the pulpy-serious \u201cDeutschland 86,\u201d the definition is very flexible.The drama was like a peppermint schnapps chaser to the moody vodka shot of FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans.\u201d It had a pop sensibility and stylish air, and it was as much a coming-of-age story as a Cold War thriller.Picking up three years later, \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d broadens its scope and shifts its axis, focusing on how the battle between capitalism and communism enfolded north and south as well as east and west.The series (subtitled in English) opens in Cape Town, where Lenora shares a stunning midcentury-modern apartment with Rose Seithathi (Florence Kasumba), an A.N.C. agent. (There\u2019s a striking scene in which the two operatives stride down a hallway, equal in their deadly confidence, then separately enter the \u201cWhites\u201d and \u201cNon-Whites\u201d elevators.)They\u2019re selling arms to the enemy because East Germany is dead broke, in debt to the West, cut loose by Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s Soviet Union. Its bureaucrats are left to try to salvage communism through fire-sale capitalism: selling off artworks, importing garbage from West Germany, allowing medical tests on its citizens. At least, they console themselves, they\u2019re not starving like the Romanians \u2014 yet.Needing help, Lenora finds Martin at an orphanage in communist Angola, where he\u2019s been exiled after disobeying orders, at the end of \u201cDeutschland 83,\u201d in order to stave off a nuclear war. He\u2019s a more somber character now, hardened and healthily mistrustful, but he agrees, in exchange for being allowed to return home and see his young son.The story feels more strained in its efforts to keep numerous characters from the \u201c83\u201d season busy. In East Germany, Annett (Sonja Gerhardt), the mother of Martin\u2019s son, has become a zealous functionary in the Stasi, where Walter (Sylvester Groth), Martin\u2019s father, is pitching an arms-smuggling plan inspired by a German version of \u201cThe Love Boat.\u201d Another thread, involving activists in West Germany and the growing AIDS crisis, feels detached.There\u2019s a lot of history and genealogy to recall in these subplots, and the three years that have passed since \u201c83\u201d are like three centuries in peak-TV time. \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d largely stands on its own, but you may need a Google tab open while watching.The show\u2019s strength remains Lenora and Martin, who are both partners and antagonists. He\u2019s a patriot but a confused one, trying to keep his moral bearings while his country loses its own. To Lenora, Martin is a callow, self-indulgent boy, unwilling to sacrifice the few to help the many: \u201cYou can\u2019t see past the end of your own nose.\u201d Schrader, radiating \u201980s Eurocool, gives swagger and charisma to what might otherwise be an empty villainess.For \u201cAmericans\u201d fans in withdrawal, this isn\u2019t a perfect replacement. It\u2019s not a slow burn but a potboiler, and it sometimes lurches into \u201c24\u201d-esque absurdity and James Bond sudsiness. (When Martin is assigned to seduce a mark, there\u2019s a cornball shot of him framed, \u201cGraduate\u201d-style, between her calves.)But it has a similar sense of espionage as an intimate entanglement and a theme of risking one\u2019s life for a lost cause, because family is family and home is home. And the details are remarkable, like the Angolan war orphans \u2014 at risk of being conscripted as soldiers in an exploitative proxy war \u2014 sitting on the floor to play \u201cRisiko,\u201d a variant of the global conquest board game Risk.That\u2019s \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d in miniature. It\u2019s good fun, but it knows that its subject is more than a game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s the Skinny: For Lean Production Processes to Work, a Company Needs to Be All In", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a company in Chesterfield, Mo., it involved something as seemingly simple as attaching a trash can to an employee\u2019s chair.For one in St. Louis, it meant leaving the cover off an electronic temperature controller.For others it\u2019s meant gathering employees from the chief executive on down for what\u2019s known as Kaizen events \u2014 based on the Japanese word for continuing improvement.What do these seemingly unconnected efforts have in common? They are approaches to what is known as lean manufacturing \u2014 or, more recently, lean production \u2014 aimed at streamlining production processes, enhancing employee engagement and increasing profits.In 2006, with Peter Desloge, the third-generation chief executive charge, the company adopted lean production principles.\u201cA competitive environment forced us to figure out how to lower our costs while also better engaging our people.\u201d Mr. Desloge said, adding, Watlow chose the lean route \u201cbecause the approach doesn\u2019t just reduce cost and drive productivity, but also \u201cincreases value to our customers and engages everyone in the business to eliminate waste.\u201dThis week, for example, the company discovered that it had been supplying a customer in the transportation industry a temperature controller with an unnecessary part. \u201cWhen it got to their facility, the customer was taking the cover off because they had to install it in their machine. We realized we could ship without it and eliminate both the effort on our end as well as for the customer.\u201dIn the world of lean production, these microdiscoveries can be as important as the big picture.The approach has its roots in the vaunted Toyota Production System developed in Japan in the late 1940s, which was aimed at streamlining processes to eliminate waste, improve productivity and, ultimately, grow profits. Known as either the T.P.S. or Toyota Way, it advocates for \u201can organizational culture of highly engaged people solving problems or innovating to drive performance,\u201d according to Jamie Bonini, vice president Toyota Engineering and Manufacturing North America.\u201cWhen we came up with the name lean production, what we meant was the complete system,\u201d Dr. Womack said. \u201cWhat the world heard was factories. But the frontier has been outside of the factory world for the last 20 years.\u201dWhichever term one uses, the goal is to improve the production process, said Rachna Shah, a professor at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.But not all companies have the same success because there\u2019s often a lot of starting and stopping. Without working on the streamlining continuously \u201cin a disciplined way over the long term, you cannot have the same levels of improvement in productivity,\u201d Professor Shah said.Those who do persevere often become evangelists, like Jim Lancaster, author of \u201cThe Work of Management.\u201dBut Mr. Lancaster found that the lean approach only worked for so long \u201cbecause of the natural deterioration that can occur. People change, tools get dull and an engineer may change the design without preparing others on the line.\u201d Profits from his company\u2019s newer products, while meaningful, were offset by declines in its base business.As a result, he said, the company needed to refocus on its original lines and bolster its processes. \u201cIt sounds boring, except for the bottom-line impact,\u201d he said.Sometimes, seemingly tiny changes exemplify the lean approach. Marc Braun, the president of Cambridge Engineering, a manufacturer of industrial heating and ventilation technologies in Chesterfield said a new entry-level line employee, Justin Meade, realized he was wasting time each hour just to discard trash.Mr. Meade, who had little technical training, came up with the idea of attaching a trash can to a chair to cut 15 steps. Over the next six months he continued to make more revisions, with the help of other employees, to devise an even better version. The result: shaving an estimated 70 minutes from a 90-minute job, Mr. Braun said.Most lean aficionados use Kaizen events that bring together employees at all levels to work and correct a problem. Watlow, for example, holds about 60 a year, Mr. Desloge said.Those who adopt a lean system say that they want to reduce waste but not reduce the work force in the process. Mr. Desloge said he \u201cfocuses on areas where we need more capacity. We will not let anyone go as a result..\u201dToyota is focused not just on its own work force, but on using its methods to encourage job growth generally in North America and for philanthropic efforts.Mr. Bonini, who leads the company\u2019s North American efforts, said that the organization had worked with the furniture-maker Herman Miller, the theater-seating company Irwin Seating and Ace Metal Crafts Company, among others.Jean Pitzo is the chief executive of Ace Metal, based in Bensenville, Ill., near O\u2019Hare International Airport, which fabricates components for food-processing equipment.Ace applied to the Toyota center and was accepted in 2014.Mr. Bonini helped the company with the welding part of its business, which was often a production bottleneck. Together, they worked on streamlining, eliminating waste and improving employee engagement. As a result, Ms. Pitzo said, her business has grown \u201can easy 30 percent\u201d and profits have gone up. The main reason is that we cut our lead time on new orders by 50 percent.\u201dBut, Mr. Desloge advises, don\u2019t try lean processes on your family. \u201cWhen people understand lean, they will frequently bring it home, suggesting to their husband or wife that there\u2019s a better way of loading the dishwasher,\u201d he said. \u201cThat typically doesn\u2019t go over very well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "FIFA, Hacked Again, Braces for New Revelations", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 FIFA acknowledged this week that its computer systems were hacked earlier this year for the second time, and officials from European soccer\u2019s governing body fear they also might have suffered a data breach.The information that was compromised in the second cyberattack on FIFA is not yet clear, but a consortium of European media organizations plans to publish a series of stories based in part on the internal documents as early as Friday. The group Football Leaks originally obtained the documents.UEFA officials were targeted in a so-called phishing operation in which third parties fool their targets into giving up password-protected login details, though the organization has been unable to find traces of a hack in its computer systems.In recent weeks, both FIFA and UEFA have received hundreds of questions, including several related to information contained in confidential documents. FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, was UEFA\u2019s most senior administrator before being elected to lead global soccer in 2016.FIFA officials discussed the prospect of a new hack, and more uncomfortable revelations in the news media, on the edges of the FIFA Council meeting last week in Kigali, Rwanda.The leaks have uncovered some of soccer\u2019s biggest secrets, shining light on dubious practices that have led to tougher regulations in soccer and in some cases, criminal prosecutions. FIFA earlier this year announced planned changes to the $6 billion transfer market, in part as a response to dealing unveiled by Football Leaks, and Spanish authorities have successfully prosecuted top players and coaches for tax evasion.Most recently, information obtained from the leak led to articles in Der Spiegel that revealed the details of a nondisclosure agreement Cristiano Ronaldo signed with a Las Vegas woman who accused the Portuguese star of sexually assaulting her in 2009. Ronaldo has denied the charges and, though his lawyers, threatened to sue the magazine.A coordinator with E.I.C. said he could not comment on the content of the next batch of articles, or even if any would be published. FIFA issued a statement criticizing the leaks of stolen information.\u201cFIFA condemns any attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in any organization using unlawful practices,\u201d FIFA said.Asked about the leaks, Infantino said he had tried to do his work honestly. That has meant having discussions and sharing ideas and documents with numerous people, he added.\u201cIf then this is being portrayed as something bad then I think there\u2019s not much I can do other than my job,\u201d he said during a conversation in Kigali last week. \u201cWe are not stealing.\u201dDetails of the person or group behind Football Leaks were presented in a book written by two reporters from Der Spiegel and published earlier this year. The group told the authors that its aim is to cleanse world soccer by exposing bad actors.Football Leaks is not the only major data breach that has roiled soccer, or global sports. In October, the United States Department of Justice announced charges against seven Russian intelligence officers who it said had successfully compromised the networks of organizations including FIFA and The International Olympic Committee.Advertisement"}
