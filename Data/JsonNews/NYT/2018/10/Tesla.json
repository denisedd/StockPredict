Individual investors, big and small, pressing boards to diversify:Firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, are already working to effect change. BlackRock has told companies that it wants to see at least two female board members at the companies it invests in. Calpers wrote to 504 companies in 2017 asking them to improve diversity, and has voted against directors at companies that have failed to respond to its requests. Hopefully, the constant drumbeat on this topic will only drive additional responsible companies to make progress.Mr. Flannery was supposed to turn G.E.\u2019s fortunes around.

That would weaken China\u2019s ability to produce next-generation technology and put additional pressure on Beijing to make trade concessions sought by the U.S.Mr. Trump appears happy to play a long game. \u201cChina wants to talk very badly,\u201d he said at a news conference yesterday. \u201cI said frankly it\u2019s too early to talk, because they\u2019re not ready.\u201dMr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options. The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit.

When it comes to financial services, he says, clients ultimately want to talk to a live person \u2014 in a web chat, on the phone, or at a branch office. In 2016, less than a year after introducing its robo-adviser, Charles Schwab began offering fee-based personal consultations for accounts of at least $25,000.Companies such as Ant Financial or Amazon, which analysts have speculated will eventually move into finance, would be challenged to build those kinds of offerings at Charles Schwab\u2019s scale, Bettinger says. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that we\u2019re a blend of Amazon and Nordstrom,\u201d he says.Harvard Business School received 9,886 applications for this fall\u2019s entering class, down 4.5 percent from last year \u2014 the biggest drop since 2005.

{"Headline": "What Isaac Asimov Taught Us About Predicting the Future", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayIn February, the spaceflight company founded by Elon Musk conducted a test launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which successfully sent its payload into orbit around the sun. Its cargo included a Tesla Roadster \u2014 which now looks like a sign of Musk\u2019s midlife crisis \u2014 and a digital copy of the Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov. Two months later, Apple announced that it was developing a television version of the classic science-fiction saga for its new streaming service. Previous attempts to adapt the series have failed, which might not have surprised Asimov, who, after rereading it, confessed, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help noticing, of course, that there was not very much action in it.\u201dIf the Foundation trilogy still appeals to a wide audience \u2014 as well as to corporations hoping to associate themselves with its vision of tomorrow \u2014 this has less to do with the plots or characters than with the books\u2019 fictional science of psychohistory, a system for predicting future events even thousands of years from the present. The notion captivated fans like the economist Paul Krugman, who recalled of the mathematician and psychologist portrayed by Asimov as the creator of psychohistory: \u201cI grew up wanting to be Hari Seldon.\u201d The books made an equally profound impression on a teenage Newt Gingrich, who later wrote, \u201cFor a high school student who loved history, Asimov\u2019s most exhilarating invention was the \u2018psychohistorian\u2019 Hari Seldon.\u201dThe historical moment that inspired Asimov has striking parallels to our own. On Aug. 1, 1941, Asimov, then a 21-year-old writer and graduate student at Columbia University, was riding the subway in New York. He was headed to his monthly meeting with John W. Campbell Jr., the editor of the pulp magazine Astounding Science Fiction, whom Asimov later praised as an intellectual mentor and \u201cthe most powerful force in science fiction ever.\u201d On the train, Asimov came up with the premise for a story about the decline of a galactic empire, and when he described it in the meeting that afternoon, he remembered, \u201cCampbell blazed up as I had never seen him do.\u201dAt the office, the two men hashed out the rules of psychohistory, and Asimov returned the following month with the first story of the series, which was published in the May 1942 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. The details of psychohistory were vague, but Asimov left no doubt about its effectiveness: \u201cA great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and human reactions sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweep of the future.\u201d As Hitler rewrote the map of Europe, Asimov\u2019s story implied that such events could be foreseen, even altered before they occurred, and the idea resonated with readers who were justifiably afraid of what the future might bring.Asimov later acknowledged that psychohistory amounted to a kind of emotional reassurance: \u201cHitler kept winning victories, and the only way that I could possibly find life bearable at the time was to convince myself that no matter what he did, he was doomed to defeat in the end.\u201d The notion was framed as a science that could predict events centuries in advance, but it was driven by a desire to know what would happen in the war over the next few months \u2014 a form of wishful thinking that is all but inevitable at times of profound uncertainty. Before the last presidential election, this impulse manifested itself in a widespread obsession with poll numbers and data journalism, as captured by a headline in Wired: \u201cI Just Want Nate Silver to Tell Me It\u2019s All Going to Be Fine.\u201dAs we all know by now, this approach has its limits, especially when it comes to \u201cblack swan\u201d events that upend our expectations about how the future will resemble the past. Such surprises can be exciting in fiction, if not in real life, and Campbell eventually realized that a science of prediction, taken to its logical conclusion, led to predictable stories. In 1945, after four more installments in the Foundation series had appeared, he ordered a reluctant Asimov to \u201cupset the Seldon Plan,\u201d the system of forecasts that Seldon\u2019s foundation of psychohistorians had devised to save civilization.After brooding over the problem, Asimov came up with the Mule, a mutant telepath who uses mind control to conquer the galaxy \u2014 a black swan that Hari Seldon could never have foreseen. The Mule also suffers from megalomania, an inferiority complex and \u201can intensely psychopathic paranoia,\u201d which may strike some readers today as uncomfortably familiar. When the journal Science devoted several articles to prediction in an issue last year, it included both an obligatory nod to Asimov and a huge picture of Donald Trump. As the journalist Chris Taylor noted on Mashable, upset wins like Trump\u2019s make psychohistory seem \u201cas useless, say, as pre-election polling in November 2016.\u201dFiction has an unsettling way of anticipating reality. In a later story in the series, a man who was brainwashed by the Mule reflects on how he\u2019s changed: \u201cHe had always loved the Mule. If there had ever been a time long before \u2014 as long before as five short years \u2014 when he had thought he hadn\u2019t loved him, that he had hated him \u2014 that was just a horrid illusion.\u201d Meanwhile, in our timeline, Gingrich, a lifelong Asimov fan, marvels at our current president\u2019s \u201csixth sense about connecting with the American people,\u201d while our Republican senators stand exposed as men who saw themselves as Hari Seldons, but who were ultimately willing to throw in their lot with the Mule.As the midterms approach, many of us have returned to compulsively clicking on the latest polling data, but we have no better sense than our predecessors did of how the story will end. In one of the first editorials in Astounding after the war, across from the opening page of \u201cThe Mule,\u201d Campbell ventured a prediction of his own: \u201cCivilization \u2014 the civilization of Big Power balances, of war and peace and bad international manners, of intolerance and hates, of grinding poverty and useless luxury \u2014 is dead.\u201d Hitler was gone, but the atomic bomb had introduced an existential threat of a kind we continue to face, and there was no guarantee of a happy ending. As Campbell reminded his readers: \u201cThe interregnum is beginning now, and we do not have a Hari Seldon.\u201dAlec Nevala-Lee\u2019s book \u201cAstounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and the Golden Age of Science Fiction\u201d came out in October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foretelling the Future of Oil", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is the future of oil?It\u2019s hard if not impossible to say for sure, but there are few more important questions, since the answer will be a key guide to the fate of humanity over the next century.It\u2019s worth speculating about because the climate will depend on it, with the burning of gasoline and diesel key drivers for global warming. The balance of international power is also in play, with the future fortunes of such foes as Russia and Iran tied to the commodity. Huge fortunes could be made or lost from any shifts in the energy economy, which is currently controlled by some of the largest private and state corporations in the world.Predicting the energy sources of the future has always been a fool\u2019s game. In the 1950s, nuclear energy was supposed to promise cheap power for all but is now in eclipse. Biofuels seemed to hold great promise a decade ago, but now are little more than an afterthought. When most experts thought the country\u2019s oil reserves were in decline, shale drilling unleashed a boom in natural gas and oil production that now seems to perpetuate the dependence on fossil fuels except coal.A plan by Norway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest of $40 billion in oil stocks is meeting reluctance from within the government.\u201cThe demand for oil continues to grow even as there is an increased focus on controlling emissions and addressing the climate agenda,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power.\u201d But he added that he would not discount an eventual change in the direction of energy markets, even while it is \u201cdifficult to predict a breakthrough that perhaps is now unimaginable. The big change may be a merger of Silicon Valley and Houston.\u201dBig oil is beginning to hedge its bets on the future, under pressure from activist investors and the public, while also worrying about future regulation. A pivot may be starting, with ExxonMobil and BP engineers working on advanced batteries, Royal Dutch Shell scientists working on hydrogen fuel cells, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund investing in Tesla, and the oil industry broadly deploying artificial intelligence, robotics and faster data processing throughout their operations.Many experts remain skeptical that oil companies will be at the forefront of change and undercut their own businesses. Regardless of who leads the change away from oil \u2014 if there indeed is a change \u2014 there are already growing signs that global demand for oil will peak and decline to some degree by the late 2030s.That would not be fast enough for the world to achieve the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial Age levels. Still, it would mark one of the most remarkable economic swings of the last century, given that global demand for oil has more than tripled since 1965.In what may be a sign of things to come, India has announced that by 2030, all new cars sold in the country will be electric.Norwegian risk-management firm DNV GL raised eyebrows across the oil industry in September by forecasting that demand for crude will crest in the early 2020s.Most of the major oil companies are counting on petrochemicals and plastics to continue to drive oil profits. They also hope the natural gas they produce and ship will continue to replace coal burning for electricity generation.Not surprisingly, oil executives typically scoff at the notion of a world without oil.Mr. Sealock and many other oil executives do not deny that climate change is an issue, nor that it is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.He points to technology as the solution that will allow societies to continue burning them safely, noting efforts by the billionaire investor Bill Gates and others to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through advanced industrial-scale engineering.Mr. Sealock and a few other oil executives see the possibility that natural gas, which frequently bubbles up with oil from the same wells, could provide the raw material for the production of hydrogen for fuel cells that would limit the exhaust of cars to drops of water.That may all be wishful thinking on the part of Mr. Sealock, who is managing a company that is attempting to unlock billions of new barrels of oil. If he is right, that could be a convenient solution not only for the climate (unless there are unintended negative consequences to fiddling with the atmosphere as some fear), but also for a slew of countries that rely on oil for their economic well-being across much of Africa and the Middle East, as well as Russia, Mexico and emerging producers like Brazil and Guyana.But there is another view, decidedly a minority one still, that believes the days of the fossil fuel age are numbered. One such futurist is Dieter Helm, an Oxford University energy economist and author of \u201cBurn Out: The Endgame for Fossil Fuels,\u201d published last year, who says he believes that the world is poised for a technological transformation that will produce new sources of power, advanced energy storage and a rise in the efficiency of the economy so less energy is needed.\u201cWe know the supply of solar is infinite,\u201d Mr. Helm said. And in the next 20 years, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have factories that run on robots, we\u2019ll have 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and so on that will make energy demand remarkably more flexible in factories, offices and houses too.\u201dSuch technologies are already taking hold, and in Mr. Helm\u2019s view they will speed up as global leaders are forced to manage the impacts of climate change, which appear to be accelerating. It\u2019s not going to immediately happen, but he says he believes the big oil companies will eventually go the way of the horse and buggy.\u201cWhy do you think Exxon is better at battery or new storage technology than a start up?\u201d he said. \u201cJust like the Telcos didn\u2019t take over the internet world, they will try, they will do a bit, but I think very gradually they will decay.\u201dSome oil company executives say they are accepting the challenge of a lower carbon world, and they are ready to adapt.One of the leaders is Eldar Saetre, chief executive of the Norwegian oil giant Equinor, whose company is a pioneer in offshore wind power.While Equinor has acknowledged that it will have to leave some hydrocarbons in the ground, Mr. Saetre said his industry is going to have to adjust faster.\u201cThere are companies that could do more,\u201d Mr. Saetre said, choosing his words carefully.\u201cI see a lot of players with a conscious and aggressive approach, but it\u2019s an evolution and there is room for more engagement in our industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Electric Cars Is Brighter With Elon Musk in It", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "OpinionFederal regulators were right to rein in his reckless management, but the company and the global auto industry need him.Supported byMr. MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.His leadership matters well beyond Silicon Valley. Tesla, under Mr. Musk, has been the single most significant force driving the global automotive industry \u2014 and the consumers who purchase cars \u2014 to take the prospect of a fully electric vehicle future seriously. No other electric vehicle initiative \u2014 from Nissan\u2019s Leaf and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt and Bolt to the new wave of luxury electric cars being rolled out by German automakers and new companies funded by Chinese billionaires \u2014 has achieved the impact on the public\u2019s imagination, brand loyalty or sales success of Tesla. Those initiatives might not even have occurred without the prod of Tesla\u2019s example. Aside from his vision for electric vehicles, Tesla under Mr. Musk has accomplished a remarkable feat: the creation of a new automaker. In the modern era, nearly all new entrants have started in developing countries, at the low end; most new automakers founded in the United States and Europe have failed. Tesla\u2019s approach is not what most expected from a Silicon Valley disrupter. Unlike Apple\u2019s iPhone \u2014 \u201cdesigned by Apple in California, assembled in China\u201d \u2014 nearly all of Tesla\u2019s value chain from product conception through delivery to customers is carried out by the company itself. Tesla\u2019s travails in mastering high-volume production of a mass-market product, the Model 3, are well known, and it may never attain Toyota-like levels of efficiency. But if Tesla can persevere, it could achieve the elusive high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle that would be a tipping point for the future of the industry.Tesla under Mr. Musk has also established a template for what the \u201cmobility\u201d firms of the future must do. Chief among these is the ability to update vehicle functionality via over-the-air software updates; the addition of algorithm-driven features that offer partially autonomous operation along with the collection of data to improve those algorithms; connectivity with the consumer to provide services; and the ability for a customer to configure and purchase a vehicle online. Tesla under new leadership, or as a unit of a much larger company, might be able to maintain what Mr. Musk has achieved. But Tesla\u2019s survival thus far has been a tightrope act, and falling off is virtually guaranteed without Mr. Musk. He has proved uniquely and idiosyncratically able to sustain the loyalty and fervent belief of investors, customers and employees. While Tesla has benefited from public subsidies such as consumer tax credits, federal grants, and the sale of zero emission credits to other automakers, Mr. Musk\u2019s ability as a salesman is apparent in his success at raising private funds and sustaining high valuations. Even Tesla\u2019s luck in buying its factory in Fremont, Calif., at a bargain-basement price from Toyota is attributable to Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to charm Toyota\u2019s chief executive. Tesla owners also seem to identify closely with Mr. Musk. For the Model 3, they had to put down a $1,000 deposit, and most have been waiting months for their new cars. This willingness to commit to a purchase before the vehicle is even available for viewing has enormous value. It means Tesla spends almost no money on marketing, and it knows before building each vehicle who the customer will be and how he wants it configured. No other auto manufacturer enjoys this type of prerelease enthusiasm \u2014 and it is Mr. Musk who single-handedly sustains it. Were Tesla to become the electric car division of an existing automaker, even if its products stay strong, this pattern of advance demand commitments would be unlikely to continue.To be sure, Mr. Musk needs help as a manager. Steve Jobs eventually found Tim Cook; Mark Zuckerberg found Sheryl Sandberg. Mr. Musk has already found a strong managerial partner, Gwynne Shotwell, for SpaceX. He has pointed to his elevation of Jerome Guillen, a seasoned auto industry executive, to president of automotive as a similar move for Tesla. Mr. Guillen has not yet stepped forward in a prominent way as co-leader, but the S.E.C.\u2019s action, along with a much stronger board of directors, could nudge Mr. Musk toward expanding Mr. Guillen\u2019s influence.

{"Headline": "Comforts, but Few Creatures (Unless You Count the Dog)", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA visit to the new home of Mia Sara and Brian Henson requires a wavy excursion through the Hollywood Hills and down to a promontory. There you find, perched at the land\u2019s edge, a garage displaying the elegant rear ends of two Teslas, a Model S (his) and a Model 3 (hers).When a visitor is buzzed in, a gate slides open. Steps descend to a wood and steel bridge that leads over a pocket garden to a bronze Brombal door in a cedar-clad wall.These are the curtain-raisers on a house in the Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, built by Mr. Henson, scion of the Henson Muppet empire and director of the new R-rated puppet film \u201cThe Happytime Murders,\u201d and Ms. Sara, an actress and poet.The house was designed by Kristen Becker of Mutuus Studio while she was an associate at Olson Kundig in Seattle. That architectural firm is known for its embrace of natural settings and materials, artisanship and \u201ckinetics\u201d: industrial-scale, movable building elements, like hand-cranked skylights on chunky hinges.Ms. Becker had previously remodeled the couple\u2019s loft in TriBeCa and easily grasped her clients\u2019 shared aesthetic, which Ms. Sara, 51, called \u201carchaic\u201d and Mr. Henson called \u201ccontemporary medieval.\u201dJust over the threshold, stairs lined with Stick Sconce lights \u2014 a modern variant of antique metal sconces \u2014 lead to a very spacious room. A kitchen area \u2014 dark with blackened steel and walnut veneered cabinets \u2014 is at the back, dining is in the middle and living at the sunny end. Light pours from black-framed and mullioned Brombal windows and clerestories on three sides. The far wall is all glass and looks south onto a stunning panorama of Los Angeles.The room is filled with idiosyncratic objects \u2014 Mr. Henson\u2019s cast from a childhood bone break, covered in cartoons by his father, Jim, and displayed in a case, like a relic; a Willy Daro bronze table; African masks chosen by Ms. Sara\u2019s father, Jerome Sarapochiello, a former photographer, onetime draftsman for George Nelson and now, as Ms. Sara described him, \u201cpicker extraordinaire.\u201dOver coffee at a Finn Juhl teak dining table, under a chandelier made of bicycle chains, with Casper the longhaired dog underfoot, the couple explained why this room, about 900 square feet and 13 feet high, is the heart of the house.\u201cMia loves to cook,\u201d Mr. Henson, 54, said. \u201cWe also just felt like the whole grand-room lifestyle for a family really keeps you all connected, particularly today when everybody vanishes to different corners of the house.\u201dThe couple took cues from an Irish medieval tower keep called Bunratty Castle they had once visited.It wasn\u2019t the dour architecture they wanted to emulate, clarified Ms. Sara, who worked closely with Ms. Becker on the design: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do some oldy-worldy, strange medieval-looking thing in the middle of Los Angeles. But I liked the feeling because there are certain very elemental things like a central hearth and one big room with a sort of great hall.\u201dAnd, this being Los Angeles, the \u201cgreat hall\u201d has an indoor-outdoor aspect as evocative of Case Study houses as castle keeps.Mr. Henson revealed this when he leapt up to turn the wheel of a heavy metal gear-and-chain contraption at the side of the west window. The window pivots like a garage door, opening up the room to a terrace for outdoor dining and to a zigzag pathway down to the pool and guest rooms.The house, in other words, is both steampunk and greentech, Arthurian and Manhattanite, sumptuous and earthy.Ms. Becker, who was mentored by Tom Kundig, a principal of Olson Kundig, through the design process, mixed blackened steel, a hallmark of the firm, with brass and copper. Floors and stair treads are antique fumed oak; the master bath and bedroom upstairs are separated by a sliding screen made of woven copper strips. The building, composed of intersecting volumes that step down and hug the hillside, has walls that are cast-in-place concrete or clad in stained cedar siding.And where, you may wonder, are Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog? You won\u2019t find them. With the exception of a mound of stuffed Muppets in the room of their 14-year-old daughter, Millie, and two stone stools on the deck with monster feet, the house does not scream goofy creatures.Growing up, \u201cwe always owned workshops and those places are where you would find all the creatures and that feeling.

The topic comes up during a visit to the garage, which has two slender vertical windows (one for each Tesla) offering a sneak peek of the view.Ms. Becker joked that she and her clients considered installing a large pane of glass in a \u201ckind of a nod\u201d to the window crashed through by a Ferrari that belonged to the father of one of Ferris\u2019s friends. However, they did not want to tempt the couple\u2019s children into reckless behavior (Ms. Sara\u2019s son, Dash, from her marriage to Jason Connery, is now 21). \u201cSo we maintained this view, but it\u2019s just now a little bit more modest.\u201dSolar panels carpet the roof of the garage, but fall just short of fully powering the house \u2014 ironically because the two e-cars chug too much electricity.Nonetheless, the building, which also has a gray-water system, delivers a \u201csuper luxurious lifestyle\u201d while being \u201cenvironmental without being weird,\u201d Mr. Henson said. \u201cWeird,\u201d he explained, describes \u201cthe people who can never turn their air-conditioners on,\u201d even \u201cwhen it\u2019s really, really hot.\u201dThat lifestyle is also about occupying a reasonable amount of space. The house, with its garage and mechanical systems, takes up about 4,200 square feet, on an almost 12,000-square-foot site. The family uses about 3,000 square feet, down from 5,000 in their previous home, and an area they believe is just right.\u201cParticularly in L.A., everybody just goes big,\u201d Mr. Henson noted.\u201cWe don\u2019t plan on ever selling the house,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the way I approached it was, how much less wealthy am I comfortable being to have a house that I will have forever and I\u2019ll never get a return on the money?\u201dHe likes to think the house sets an example for a certain class of owner: \u201cI think this is the way wealthy people should live,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Computer Chauffeur Is Creeping Closer", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo yes, computers may prove to be safer at the controls. It\u2019s not a high bar.The secret sauce of those computers\u2019 becoming our chauffeurs is the ubiquitous force of artificial intelligence, which is already active in virtual personal assistants and a bank\u2019s customer-service chat bot. But it\u2019s the automobile where A.I. could have a critical role for the greatest number of people. Few A.I. applications carry the responsibility of automotive safety systems, where actions must be carried out in nanoseconds and an ill-considered response may have costly consequences.Still, A.I. is already quietly making driving safer. Beyond the applications now found in new cars, typically in conveniences like the speech-recognition feature of infotainment systems, are the subsystems that make up the packages of safety features common largely in luxury vehicles. Enhancements like night vision, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping all depend on processors that use sensors and computer instructions to warn drivers of danger or act to avoid collisions.Data is also collected by radar, or lidar, its light-beam equivalent.A high degree of refinement of the data, covering every possible situation, is vital to assuring that the safety systems don\u2019t issue excessive warnings, an annoyance that may lead a driver to ignore such signals.The collecting of data to inform automotive A.I. systems will be greatly improved by a coming generation of connected cars, \u2014 50 million communicating wirelessly with each other by 2020 \u2014 according to Mr. Lulla. The 350 megabytes of data per second generated by these cars, covering such things as local weather and road conditions, will be a huge benefit to the entire community of connected vehicles.Some of the tasks where A.I. takes an important role happen inside the car. Driver monitoring is a major component of advanced safety systems, with cameras mounted in the dashboard watching eye and head positions and even pulse rate through a steering-wheel sensor. The concept, IBM says, is to add context \u2014 the driver\u2019s condition and degree of engagement \u2014 to complete the picture of the situation in the car and on the road.The information, along with factors like pitch of voice and use of aggressive words, has multiple uses. Evaluations of alertness and fatigue based on A.I. analysis are already built into several car models, with dashboard warnings for countering stress and anger. When fully autonomous driving for privately owned vehicles becomes available, the potential for a car to sense a driver\u2019s illness and head for a hospital becomes a reality.One of A.I.\u2019s strengths is simple object recognition.\u201cIf you can solve a problem using a traditional method, it\u2019s incredibly efficient,\u201d said Mr. De Vos of Aptiv, referring to existing safety systems. \u201cIn the case of a vision system identifying a person standing next to the road, you can write a relatively simple rule to determine what should be done.\u201dBut when a problem becomes more complex, like when an obstacle is detected in the road during a snowstorm, the advantage of using A.I. is its ability to solve problems that are otherwise too complex for existing systems. A.I. simply gets answers a lot faster.\u201cA fundamental weakness of the systems is that it\u2019s a black box,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said, referring to the challenge of analyzing the actions of algorithms. \u201cIt\u2019s not always predictable, and you can\u2019t always tell why a decision has been made, so robust training and validation are needed.\u201d\u201cIdeally, we want to have the system recognize an image it\u2019s never seen, like a person figuring out what an orangutan is because he knows what an ape looks like,\u201d Mr. Hadi said. \u201cThis is the tuning part of developing A.I. and takes a lot of time.\u201dThe computing power it takes to operate a car with self-driving capability is staggering. A graphics processing unit to perform object recognition works at a computer speed of a trillion floating-point operations per second. The main processor\u2019s performance is measures in millions of instructions per second.Stepping up from the partial automation of the Mercedes-Benz driver assistance system to fully automated driving, which may require a car to have up to a dozen cameras, demands a hundredfold increase in computer power, and Veoneer says the requirement is increasing by a factor of three to five every other year.This does not come cheap. For the conditional automation known as Level 3, Aptiv estimates that the hardware \u2014 sensors, computer and communications gear \u2014 will cost $4,000 to $5,000 per car. That figure does not include software.While automakers have embraced the goal of eliminating all fatalities, deploying A.I. and autonomous vehicles can go only so far toward achieving that. A drunken driver of an older car could still blow through a stop sign, and road conditions will still be responsible for some collisions.So where are we on scale of true intelligence in cars?\u201cI honestly believe we are still scratching the surface of applying the technologies of deep learning and neural networks,\u201d said Mr. Lulla of IBM. \u201cAs computing increases, we will see this scale to true potential. The big issue is to perfect autonomous driving with human driving. Autonomous vehicles driving with other A.V.s seems far along, but when there is someone on a bike it gets tricky.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the S.E.C. Is Trying to Push Traditional Corporate Governance Upon Tesla", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchResolving the case quickly was far better for Tesla than a drawn-out legal battle. Mr. Musk would have been the key witness. That\u2019s something Tesla would have probably wanted to avoid, given his proclivity for boastful, and perhaps sometimes fanciful, statements.For the S.E.C., this is one of its highest-profile cases in recent years. Just issuing a monetary penalty could have reinforced the perception that the agency has lost its edge as Wall Street\u2019s top cop. With the removal of Mr. Musk as chairman, the S.E.C. avoids that reputational hit. The penalty is a step toward changing how Tesla operates and shows that the agency is concerned primarily with the company\u2019s future governance.For investors, the settlement removed uncertainty around the leadership of Tesla and Mr. Musk\u2019s private companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company. The S.E.C.\u2019s lawsuit sought to bar Mr. Musk from serving as a director or officer of a public company. That would have pushed him out of his leadership role at Tesla, and also prevented SpaceX and the Boring Company from going public with him in an executive role or as a board member.It was not a given that the S.E.C. could remove Mr. Musk, even if it prevailed in proving fraud. Federal securities law allows a court to impose a permanent bar or one for a period of years \u201cif the person\u2019s conduct demonstrates unfitness to serve as an officer or director of any such issuer.\u201d An earlier version of the statute required showing \u201csubstantial unfitness,\u201d but the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 deleted \u201csubstantial\u201d from the law, making it easier to impose the prohibition.In considering the factors, a key issue would have been whether the S.E.C. could show that Mr. Musk intentionally made false statements, rather than just being reckless in discussing the going-private deal when the details had not been adequately vetted with Tesla\u2019s board or potential outside investors. If he were found to be reckless, there would not be as strong a case for imposing a bar.There are two other factors also cut against imposing a bar. Mr. Musk is not a repeat offender, and he may be more cautious about using Twitter to communicate market-moving information in the future.Uncertainty surrounding how the case would develop in court could have hung over Tesla for months, if not years. By agreeing to the settlement, Mr. Musk removed questions about his future at the company, something the company\u2019s devoted shareholders will celebrate.The government was clearly frustrated by how Mr. Musk seemed to act without any clear supervision from Tesla\u2019s directors in announcing the potential to take the company private, which whipsawed the company\u2019s share price. But whether adding new directors will solve the problem remains to be seen, especially with a chief executive as strong-willed as Mr. Musk.The settlement may be a way for the board to tame Mr. Musk and move toward a governance structure that is not entirely dependent on his views \u2014 and whims. If Tesla is to succeed in challenging the entrenched automobile industry, it will need stronger management that can avoid the distractions of provocative tweets and questions about its operations.The S.E.C. may be doing the dirty work for Tesla\u2019s directors by getting Mr. Musk to move the company toward a more traditional management structure so that he is not the focal point of its operations. Whether or not it succeeds, it will be worth watching.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Settled With the S.E.C., but Tesla\u2019s Troubles Aren\u2019t Over", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was chastened by federal regulators on Saturday night, agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla and to have his communications monitored.But Mr. Musk, the exuberant, relentless billionaire chief executive of Tesla, showed no immediate signs of changing his style.On Sunday at 1:08 a.m., just hours after settling the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s fraud case stemming from his impulsive tweet on Aug. 7, Mr. Musk sent an email to all Tesla employees. He implored them to work hard, even though it was the weekend.\u201cOne more day of going super hardcore and victory is ours!!\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong, but, to be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow (Sunday). If we go all out tomorrow, we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations. Go Tesla!!!\u201dInvestors reacted to the settlement with a \u201cGo Tesla!\u201d of their own. After plunging almost 14 percent on Friday after the S.E.C. filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s shares regained virtually all of that ground in premarket trading on Monday.For all of Mr. Musk\u2019s late-night enthusiasm and the stock bounce, however, Tesla faces many challenges in the months ahead.And Mr. Musk himself \u2014 who also runs SpaceX and the Boring Company \u2014 remains a wild card, prone to unpredictable behavior that often ensnares his various companies.\u201cI get the feeling that the S.E.C. wants to have more adults in the room,\u201d said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who contributes columns for the DealBook section of The New York Times. \u201cBut will Musk listen to them?\u201dNeither the company nor Mr. Musk has issued a statement officially commenting on the settlement.For the past 10 years, since Mr. Musk became chief executive of Tesla, he and the company have been practically synonymous. He is its animating force, setting its strategic direction, making virtually all important decisions and working on nearly every detail of design and manufacturing.His intensity and ferocious work ethic have led to a wave of executive departures in recent years, and Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 which includes Mr. Musk\u2019s brother, Kimbal \u2014 is not particularly independent by the standards of most big companies.The terms of the S.E.C. settlement are intended to change some of that.Tesla will have to add two independent directors to the board, Mr. Musk will not be able to serve as chairman for three years and the board will have to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk\u2019s communications with investors and the public, including his postings on Twitter and other social media. The members of this special committee will be subject to the review and approval of the S.E.C.Tesla also must \u201cimplement mandatory procedures and controls to oversee all of Elon Musk\u2019s communications regarding the company in any format,\u201d according to the settlement. The S.E.C. will monitor to make sure the company is in compliance with those procedures.Some critics of the settlement suggested that the S.E.C. \u2014 which sought to bar Mr. Musk from serving as a director or executive of a public company in a lawsuit it filed on Thursday, two days before the settlement \u2014 was letting him off easy.Remarks by the S.E.C.\u2019s chairman, Jay Clayton, about the settlement added to the perception that regulators were making an exception for Mr. Musk, who is so central to Tesla. Mr. Clayton said there was a need to balance penalties for violating securities laws with \u201cthe skills and support of certain individuals\u201d who may be important \u201cto the future success of a company.\u201dBut Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said removing Mr. Musk from a leadership role in the company would have been a mistake.\u201cI think banning him as C.E.O. would have been out of proportion considering what he did and that he is the founder, major shareholder and brains behind an innovative company,\u201d she said of Mr. Musk, who is officially a co-founder. The S.E.C. is a civil, regulatory body, she noted, and its aim is to protect investors. \u201cWhile it shares some of the same goals as federal prosecutors, its mission is different.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s email to employees was less bullish than previous forecasts he has offered about the quarter. Since late June, he has insisted Tesla will report profits and positive cash flow in both the third and fourth quarters.But in recent weeks, Tesla has been slashing costs and halting spending in hopes of turning a profit as Model 3 sales rise. In June, the company laid off 9 percent of its work force to lower costs, and recently stopped offering the Model 3 in certain colors. It has also delayed payments to suppliers. At the start of the third quarter, it owed suppliers $3 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe they will be profitable by traditional standards,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cYou can be very creative in your accounting in how you define profitability, and whether you include certain costs in that or not.\u201dWhile many analysts have focused on how many Model 3s Tesla is building, a more important indicator now is how many cars it is able to deliver. Unlike other automakers, Tesla doesn\u2019t generate revenue simply by making cars.It doesn\u2019t collect any revenue until it delivers them to customers. Companies like Ford Motor and General Motors book their revenue when cars are shipped to dealerships.Severe delivery problems would slow Tesla\u2019s revenue growth even if it is able to increase the number of cars it makes, and in the last several weeks, Tesla has encountered trouble shipping cars to end customers.On Sept. 16, just nine days after saying the company was having an amazing quarter, Mr. Musk acknowledged in a tweet that it was in \u201cdelivery logistics hell.\u201d Delivery problems have become so serious that Mr. Musk has suggested current owners could volunteer to help out at delivery centers around the country.\u201cThe difference between being a niche automaker and a volume automaker is vast, and as you scale up, it can be very expensive to have to deliver every car to every individual customer,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Analysts will also be watching closely to see if Tesla\u2019s third-quarter earnings meet Mr. Musk\u2019s stated goal of generating positive cash flow. In the second quarter, Tesla lost $742.7 million and used up more than $430 million of its remaining cash, decreasing its cash supply to $2.2 billion.Concerns about Tesla\u2019s cash position are all the more pertinent because Tesla is due to make a $230 million bond payment in November. A second bond payment of $920 million is looming in March. It can pay that obligation with stock, but only if the share price is above $360. On Friday, the stock closed at $265; it was trading around $306 before the market opened on Monday.As Tesla faces a decisive earnings report about a month from now, analysts \u2014 and the S.E.C. \u2014 will also be watching Mr. Musk\u2019s every remark, and tweet, to see if Tesla\u2019s corporate governance has changed.In effect, at the S.E.C.\u2019s instructions, Tesla\u2019s board must now babysit Mr. Musk to make sure he doesn\u2019t say anything that could get him or the company in trouble.\u201cI am not generally a fan of these type of governance provisions,\u201d said Jill Fisch, a professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Law and an expert on corporate governance. \u201cBut the ones in this case look pretty specific and well tailored to the conduct that is of concern.\u201dEmily Flitter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. O\u2019Dea may be master of his own hedge fund, but he could not be more disconnected from the Wall Street machine. No sell-side research clogs his inbox. He does not own a Bloomberg terminal. And there is no TV tuned to CNBC, the financial news hub ubiquitous on trading floors.\u201cI hardly watch it \u2014 and I don\u2019t have access to any of that other stuff, either,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cI get all my market access from Twitter and Real Vision.\u201dReal Vision offers a way to skip the traditional hedge fund path: slog away at an investment bank or a mutual fund, then settle down in Midtown Manhattan or Greenwich, Conn. For a modest fee, Real Vision will connect investors to a network of elite Wall Street analysts, traders and hedge fund managers, making it easier for novices like Mr. O\u2019Dea to jump the line.Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund executive who also worked at Goldman Sachs and runs an investment strategy service called Global Macro Investor, co-founded Real Vision. Since then, 20,000 people have signed up, paying $180 a year to hear directly from financial insiders.Real Vision also celebrates the hedge fund life \u2014 the outsize trades, houses and swagger \u2014 and tempts aspirants like Mr. O\u2019Dea into thinking that they, too, might join the club.It is a world that Mr. Pal, who earlier in his career pitched ideas to luminaries like Paul Tudor Jones and George Soros, knows well. He said he was motivated to start Real Vision after watching CNBC\u2019s coverage of the financial crisis and thinking there was an opening for deep dives into finance\u2019s most arcane areas.\u201cThe media was too busy treating finance as entertainment and sound bites,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to cheerlead while this thing is going up, you have to warn them of the risks. It is a moral obligation.\u201dBut there\u2019s still an element of theater to Real Vision. Recently, Mr. Pal interviewed Michael Novogratz, a billionaire investor specializing in cryptocurrencies, in his office. During the discussion on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, Mr. Novogratz wore pink jeans that matched his sneakers and took a seat in front of an original leather jumpsuit worn by the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, standing in a glass case under neon lights.Mr. Pal had flown in from his home in the Cayman Islands, and he displayed an untucked shirt, sneakers without socks and a stubble beard. It could well have been a scene from \u201cBillions,\u201d the television show about the machinations and appetites of hedge fund titans.\u201cI used to think that these guys were gods,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cBut if you spend enough time watching them, you can figure out what they are up to.\u201dAnd if his formative experience was being a world-ranked video game player \u2014 in both World of Warcraft and Smite, he said \u2014 not a striving investment banker, so what? Mr. O\u2019Dea watched the best gamers as he honed his craft once before. How hard could it be?\u201cIt has been my total school \u2014 I mean, I had no idea what a bear market or a bull market was when I started,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cIt was like watching people play video games.\u201dCurrently, 9,790 hedge funds are plying their trade, according to HFR, an industry tracker. With so many options, the pressure to perform has never been greater.The last time hedge funds collectively beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was 2008. So far this year, Hedge Knight is up 37 percent Mr. O\u2019Dea said, soundly beating the index\u2019s 9 percent increase and thrashing the near-flat return the fund\u2019s peer group has delivered.Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s grandfather Leonard E. Baum was Hedge Knight\u2019s main financial backer until his death. Propped up against Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s window is a faded photograph of Mr. Baum, a mathematician who put in place the trading framework that James H. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, employed to make his $84 billion Medallion Fund one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds. Sitting in a lawn chair, Mr. Baum has his toddler grandson in a tight hug.If his grandfather was Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s main source of capital, Real Vision is his source of inspiration.In the video, Mr. Hart wears his hair slicked back and spins tales of accumulating art, becoming an expert in Brazilian jujitsu and living in the moment \u2014 what he refers to as \u201cchasing flow.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be that guy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea recalled.He made a pilgrimage to Texas to meet Mr. Hart, and they bonded over biotechnology companies. Mr. O\u2019Dea was curious about the science of disease: His grandfather suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that erodes vision, and his younger brother Brennan \u2014 the only other employee at Hedge Knight \u2014 is afflicted with over a half-dozen autoimmune illnesses. Brennan O\u2019Dea spends nine months a year in a small cabin in Idaho, studying biology and scanning the market for cutting-edge companies. He has selected all 12 biotech stocks in Hedge Knight\u2019s portfolio.Real Vision has plenty of believers.\u201cI have been a subscriber since they were two months old,\u201d said Chase Taylor, 35, an Air Force officer whose dream is to sell investment research to hedge funds.He has not worked in the industry, nor did he go to business school. \u201cI figured if these guys are doing it, I can too,\u201d he said.When Mr. Pal told subscribers in early 2017 that he was raising $7 million from outside investors, 1,700 offered to invest. He ultimately increased the sum to $10 million, and 50 subscribers became shareholders, although neither Mr. O\u2019Dea nor Mr. Taylor is among them.Take Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s fund: a dozen biotechnology stocks, some with values below $50 million, and a bet that Tesla goes bankrupt. It is a very risky portfolio, especially for a manager with such limited experience.Real Vision is careful to present its strategies as trading ideas \u2014 not recommendations. At the end of each video, an employee warns investors to weigh their risk appetite before jumping in.Ultimately, Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s contention that in finance \u2014 as with video games \u2014 you can ascend to an elite level by scrutinizing what the best players do remains unproven.Which does not mean he won\u2019t give it a shot.\u201cNow, I know what I am doing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cAnd guess what: I am a 29-year-old hedge fund manager.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association.

Tents can now be found on sidewalks where just a block away, two-bedroom homes easily sell for more than $1 million. With the homelessness crisis reaching every corner of the state, many California children are now accustomed to seeing people sleeping on the street.My son is 8 1/2, and we live in San Francisco, very close to the Mission District, where there are a lot of homeless people living. There\u2019s a young homeless man who wanders the streets near our house, talking to himself and seeming lost, and we see him almost every day on our walk to school. A couple years ago, my son asked me why homeless people were called \u201chomeless,\u201d when they had tent homes on the sidewalk. We had to have a conversation about how that wasn\u2019t normal, and how people would probably prefer to live inside, especially when it rains and is very cold.

{"Headline": "3 Ways to Create a Climate Change Investment Strategy", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersScientist have been sounding the alarm about global warming for decades, but the report hit a chord: Time is running out before serious and possibly irreversible effects are felt.Debate on the causes and effects will continue, but money managers say this stake in the ground gives investors a concrete guide to understand how climate change will affect their investments.\u201cWhen you lay out what the challenge is, you\u2019re in a better position to attack it,\u201d said Stephen M. Liberatore, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Nuveen who manages $9 billion with an environmental, social and governance mandate.\u201cA report like that lays out the solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we need $2 trillion to invest to save the planet, here\u2019s what we need to do. I think it allows people to see what they need to do to accomplish their goals.\u201dIt has been getting easier for individuals to invest with climate change as a focus. Since 1995, assets in sustainable and responsible investments have grown 18-fold, to more than $11 trillion, according to US SIF, a membership organization of sustainable investors.There are two main approaches to creating a climate change investment strategy. One is investing in alternative energy. This can be done in a variety of areas, including solar, wind or geothermal production and distribution, or companies that make the infrastructure, like battery cells that power electric cars.The other way is what some call climate-proofing a portfolio. The premise is that a warmer Earth will create economic disruption and that companies need to prepare for this.In another example, Toyota, the maker of the Prius, has sold bonds whose proceeds were used to promote its hybrid technology.Here are three ways to consider climate change as a criterion for making investments:Investing in publicly traded equity and debt is an easy way to express a view on climate change. And their availability, along with the increasing number and size of mutual funds with a focus on the environment, offer plenty of choices.Yet these investments, like any other, carry risk. \u201cYou still have to do your homework,\u201d said Lloyd Kurtz, head of social impact investing for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cIf you buy an expensive stock with bad fundamentals, it could be green but it\u2019s still going to perform badly.\u201dThat was the case with many early solar investments and the selections that early green energy funds made, Mr. Kurtz said. But he said the case for renewable energy had been bolstered by companies, like Apple and Google, that adopted these sources to power their operations in the United States.The debt market has developed to a level that there are offerings for retail investors.Louise Herrle, managing director and head of socially responsible investing at Incapital, which underwrites bond offerings, said she had seen an increased interest from baby boomers who want a portfolio aligned with their values. This could mean offerings from the World Bank to fund water projects or bonds like the one from Toyota.\u201cRetail is going to drive this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to put their money where their mouth is. People are talking about the financial return and the social return.\u201dConstructing sustainable buildings is a major source of green investment, as are wind farms and solar arrays. But there are plenty of companies in a middle ground, working to retrofit buildings or using alternative energy to add to existing power sources.Kevin Walenta, who manages Fidelity\u2019s select environment and alternative energy portfolio, said he followed companies that saved energy in more traditional ways. These companies, like Ingersoll Rand, Lennox International, Honeywell and Johnson Controls, install efficient lighting or heating and cooling systems in commercial buildings. The result is significantly less energy consumption, higher green ratings for a building and returns in just two or three years.Mr. Walenta said he looked at both parts of investing, the environmental impact and the total return.\u201cI am looking for the companies that are driving environmental change but have a durable business model, good returns, positive cash flow and strong balance sheets,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the context of environmental change, I want them to drive profits over long periods of time.\u201dAnother area for investors is electrical utilities, he said. In regions like Southern California and Arizona, the cost of solar energy makes it competitive with traditional energy. The same, he said, holds true for wind power in parts of the Midwest like Oklahoma.\u201cA decade ago, they weren\u2019t the best investments because you had significant premium for a wind turbine or a solar panel relative to the other options, like natural gas and coal,\u201d Mr. Walenta said. \u201cToday, that difference is nonexistent.\u201dSuch strategies aim to rebut the common belief that investing with an environmental focus reduces returns. There are examples of inferior investments made to achieve a social good, but there are companies focused on green initiatives that are profitable and may be more so as climate change intensifies.\u201cThere are three main misperceptions that I talk to every investor about: You give up performance to be responsible investors, responsible investing isn\u2019t mainstream, and you can\u2019t make an impact in public market securities,\u201d Mr. Liberatore said.Our investors are \u201clooking for return potential and impact,\u201d he added.Its decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement was big news, but the United States\u2019 pollution of the environment has stayed roughly consistent over the past 25 years, and Europe has decreased its carbon levels. The big polluters have been countries in Asia, China in particular.Vivek Tanneeru, portfolio manager of the Matthews Asia ESG Fund, said that 85 percent of the growth in emissions had happened in Asia, and that China had accounted for 61 percent of that growth.On the positive side, he said, the solar panels that China installed in the first nine months of 2017 exceeded all the solar panels in the United States up to 2016.\u201cIt tells you the Chinese government has the political will to do this,\u201d Mr. Tanneeru said. \u201cAnyone who is serious about addressing climate change needs to begin in Asia to have any global impact.\u201dHis investment focus is not in renewable energy. That industry, and solar panels in particular, has not had a great track record over the past decade, largely because of government support and low barriers to entry, which led to oversupply.Mr. Tanneeru said he was focused more on battery technology, which is produced almost entirely in Asia. Tesla uses Panasonic battery cells, BMW\u2019s i3 runs on Samsung technology, and GM used batteries from LG Chemical. It\u2019s also an area, he noted, that has high barriers to entry.Another climate strategy in Asia is investing in the companies that run high-speed rail networks, like MTR in Hong Kong. In a decade, China went from zero to 125,000 kilometers of high-speed rail, making living outside polluted cities like Shanghai a possibility.Regardless of the investment type, most investors suffer from home-country bias, which is a tendency to invest more where they live even if concentrating their money there increases their risk. The same holds true for climate change investing, a fact that seems baffling given that by definition, rising temperatures are a global problem.\u201cThe U.S. has walked out of the Paris climate accord, but all of Asia is in,\u201d Mr. Tanneeru said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of appreciation of Asia\u2019s leadership in addressing these challenges. That\u2019s the big constraint in my mind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Future Is Not Yet Secured", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing the fortunes of Tesla has been a frantic, full-time job in 2018 \u2014 and that is not about to change.Tesla\u2019s stronger-than-expected third-quarter results last week relieved some of the pressure on the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, after a turbulent few months. Mr. Musk engulfed the company in controversy after he said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take the company private, a statement that regulators later said was misleading and false.The automaker posted quarterly profits and positive cash flows, which helped drive its stock sharply higher. Strong sales of its latest car, the Model 3 sedan, delivered a surge in revenue. The company managed to restrain its expenses in the quarter, though that may be hard to sustain for a company that intends to expand quickly.Tesla is definitely making progress, but some fundamental questions hanging over the company remain unanswered.Tesla sold 56,065 Model 3 vehicles during the third quarter, making it one of the top selling passenger cars in the U.S. during the period.It was also one of the most expensive. Jeffrey Osborne of the financial services firm Cowen estimates that buyers on average paid $58,800 for the car in the third quarter. The price was high because Tesla is first selling the car with premium features.Unfortunately for Tesla, the demand for sedans is plunging, which may undercut one of Mr. Musk\u2019s arguments for why a large market exists for the Model 3. On Wednesday, he said the Model 3 competes well against BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans. But sales of 3 Series cars have suffered as consumers turn to larger vehicles. Tesla may end up fighting for a share of a shrinking market.It\u2019s not so simple. The company plans to offer lower-priced Model 3s but selling them with a high price tag bolsters profitability. Tesla\u2019s gross profit on the Model 3 is around $13,000. That\u2019s important because the company needs cash to finance an increase in Model 3 production that is necessary to satisfy the surge in demand that will, in theory, materialize when Tesla offers a price cut.This could leave Tesla walking a tightrope. If demand for higher-priced Model 3s comes in below expectations, Tesla again will have to tap its pile of cash, raising concerns about its financial health.Tesla is selling a $46,000 version of the Model 3 with a less powerful battery that allows the car to be driven for 260 miles before a recharge, rather than the 310 miles possible with the higher-priced models. Tesla then plans to offer a $35,000 Model 3 in 2019.But here\u2019s the problem: The cost of making Model 3s still exceeds $35,000. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk said it was Tesla\u2019s goal to get the figure down to $30,000 or below. Tesla managed to control expenses in the third quarter, and the longer its production lines are in place, the more costs can be removed. But consistently making big efficiency gains is not easy. If Tesla struggles to produce a $35,000 Model 3, its strategy of broadening its customer base will be in doubt.It could go out and raise billions of dollars of new money in the markets. Wall Street analysts expect such deals to happen. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk sounded slightly more receptive to the idea of raising new capital. Judging by the high valuation on Tesla\u2019s shares, stock investors seem to be in the mood to give Tesla fresh money.But the company would still need to sell a lot more cars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Satellites Aid the Chase for Better Information on Oil Supplies", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In a wing of a massive former bank building here in the French capital, dozens of youthful women and men gather around computer screens. This collection of around 100 mathematicians, software engineers and petroleum analysts are bent on shaking up the opaque world of information on the world energy markets.On a recent day, one group was sifting satellite images for clues to oil output in Venezuela \u2014 once a major oil producer but now in decline. Another cluster was checking the levels of crude in a tank farm in China.\u201cI was amazed by the fact that the data that everyone was using to make decisions were incomplete facts and most of the time incorrect,\u201d Mr. Rostand said in an interview. \u201cThe largest industry in the world was making trillions of decisions \u2014 investments and trading and whatever \u2014 based on completely incorrect data.\u201dMr. Rostand was referring to a longstanding oil industry complaint about the quality and timeliness of industry statistics.Mr. Lynch said that at any given time there was likely to be some uncertainty about the exact number of barrels of oil being produced on any given day. That uncertainty \u2014 typically ranging from 500,000 to 1.5 million barrels a day \u2014 can affect the oil market, leading either to oil gluts or the draining of tank farms. Either can have a major impact on prices.That may not seem like a lot given that the world produces and consumes close to 100 million barrels a day, but it is a big number considering that over time, differences in supply and demand of that order can lead to either a rise or fall in inventories and impact prices.Oil industry statistics are largely furnished by government agencies. The numbers supplied by these departments are considered mostly reliable in the major industrialized countries, which make up about 50 percent of oil consumption. But much of the data is annoyingly slow to arrive.The rest of the world is \u201ca very, very patchy picture indeed,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. For instance, the Paris organization and other analysts only manage to put together estimates of how much oil China, a major consumer, is using with \u201cdetective work,\u201d through extrapolating from trade and refinery figures and other clues, Mr. Atkinson said.As for the supply side, OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which accounts for about one-third of global oil output, is a \u201cbig black hole,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. Wary of disclosure that could lead to embarrassments like owning up to cheating on agreed production ceilings, the OPEC member states have not \u201cproduced or published reliably transparent data for many, many years,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said.Kayrros is one of several firms trying to make money by using emerging technology to fill in pieces of the data jigsaw. Often these activities focus on giving traders an edge by providing advance forecasts of government data releases on matters like how much oil is in storage. Kayrros mostly focuses on satellite images, which are becoming more readily available at lower cost as satellite companies scan the planet with instruments that are smaller and less expensive through smartphone technology and other breakthroughs.Rather than pore over individual pictures, the company\u2019s computer scientists and analysts have developed programs that sift through an average of 10,000 images a day of tank farms, oil fields and other facilities and then flag developments that might give clients an edge.When it comes to divining how much oil countries like China have on hand, Kayrros turns to satellites that bounce radar probes off the tanks. Many storage tanks have floating roofs that rise and fall depending on the volume of oil they hold. The company\u2019s algorithms analyze the signals coming off the tanks to produce an estimate of the volumes they contain. Aggregating these numbers sheds light on how much oil China has on hand and may be consuming \u2014 increasingly important pieces of information for the markets.Mr. Rostand\u2019s troops also use programs to sift through social media posts and other chatter for energy news that could move markets. For instance, he says that through such tactics his analysts were able to detect a recent refinery explosion in Germany ahead of news outlets.Mr. Rostand said Kayrros, which raised $24 million from venture capitalists recently, is a start-up that is burning cash, but clients seem to like the combination of satellite surveillance and oil industry savvy.The company also maintains large numbers of sensors to check on flows through facilities like pipelines. It even mounted cameras near the California manufacturing plant of the electric car company Tesla to try to determine how many vehicles were coming off the line. \u201cWe create our own intelligence,\u201d said Clay Seigle, managing director for oil at the company.Both Kayrros and Genscape have substantial staffs and presumably charge accordingly for their products, though they declined to disclose their fees.\u201cThey are starting to go rogue,\u201d he said of the Iranians, though he said he doubted that sophisticated observers would be fooled. \u201cIt is quite silly of them to do this; they are going to be spotted anyway.\u201dMr. Madani said his group was able to work on a shoe string by choosing not to cover the whole industry, instead homing in on a few key areas. \u201cWe focus on hot spots of interest, and we try to provide the back story as well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}

Stock investors were whipsawed on Tuesday, as earnings from a pair of industrial firms initially added to concerns about the global economy, but a tumble in oil prices later propped up consumer companies.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended the day down 0.55 percent, at 2,740.69, after falling more than 2 percent. Stock markets in China, Japan and Germany \u2014 among the countries most heavily exposed to a slowdown in global trade \u2014 set the tone with overnight trading declines, before high-profile earnings reports in the United States added to the dour mood. After reporting weaker-than-expected third-quarter sales and profits, 3M fell 4.4 percent. The company cut its full-year estimates for profits, citing, in part, signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Rising commodity costs, and their potential to crimp profit margins that have been fattened by corporate tax cuts this year, have become a key concern for stock investors recently.\u201cThe market is quickly changing its focus toward whether the best news from tax cuts is already reflected in earnings,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the stock market research firm Ned Davis Research. \u201cEarnings are very unlikely to decline, but the growth rate is going to slow. So any sign that that inflection point is here is going to be viewed negatively by the market.\u201dThe drop in oil prices rippled through stock markets, sending American energy stocks down more than 2.5 percent.But falling energy prices also seemed to lift shares of companies that rely on consumer spending and could benefit as consumers spend less on gasoline. Companies selling consumer staples, such as groceries, rose slightly Tuesday. Even beyond staples, the picture wasn\u2019t all bad in the United States. Shares of the Pulte Group, a homebuilder, rose 7.3 percent after it reported stronger earnings on higher home prices, helping to pull its fellow homebuilder Lennar higher. That\u2019s a welcome sign for the industry, which has been hammered this year as rising mortgage rates have hurt affordability. McDonald\u2019s reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and revenue, and its shares jumped 6.3 percent. And shares of Verizon rose more than 4 percent after its results exceed expectations. The electric-car maker Tesla surged more than 12.5 percent after the company announced late Monday that it would move up its third-quarter earnings announcement to Wednesday. Some analysts interpreted the move as an indication that good results were on the way. Tesla shares were also helped when a high-profile Tesla critic and short-seller, Andrew Left of Citron Research, made an about face and announced that he was now betting on a rise in the price. Such isolated bright spots have been swamped out by the overall gloom in the stock markets this earnings season as investors scour results for indications that earnings growth will slow. The S.&P. 500 is down more than 6 percent since peaking on Sept. 20. Back then, the benchmark stock market index was up nearly 10 percent for the year. The tumble in stocks has cut that gain to less than 3 percent. \u201cPeople have been assuming that both fourth-quarter and, more importantly, 2019 growth, in terms of G.D.P. growth and earnings, will continue along the path that it was on this year,\u201d said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at the brokerage firm Miller Tabak. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re hearing otherwise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Reports a Rare Quarterly Profit, Its Biggest Ever", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla on Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit in two years and its biggest ever. But for the electric-car maker and its unpredictable chief, the question is whether it can keep making money.The company\u2019s third-quarter earnings were helped by cost-cutting, spending less on future models, delaying payments to suppliers and, most important, rushing to sell as many cars as possible. It may not be able to do all those things quarter after quarter.The company declared it a \u201chistoric quarter\u201d and its chief executive, Elon Musk, promised that future would be brighter still, telling analysts on a conference call he expected Tesla to be profitable in the fourth quarter and in \u201call quarters going forward.\u201d He was saying in effect that his company was no longer in start-up mode.Tesla reported a $312 million profit for the three months that ended Sept. 30, thanks to a surge in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The company has long promised that the model would help make electric vehicles and Tesla itself a mass-market phenomenon.On Wednesday, he was even-tempered on a conference call with analysts. He declined to answer a question about the makeup of the company\u2019s board, saying he would discuss only operational issues. (In the agreement with the S.E.C., Tesla agreed to appoint two new independent directors to its board.)In the 15 years since Mr. Musk and his partners founded Tesla, the company has never reported an annual profit. In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars. To finance its operations, Tesla, which also makes solar panels and batteries, has had to sell stock, take out loans and ask customers to make $1,000 refundable deposits for cars and energy products that they might not get for many months.The profit the company reported in the third quarter will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances and end a streak of quarters in which the automaker used close to $1 billion in cash. In the second quarter, the company reported a $718 million loss.Tesla ended September with $3 billion in cash compared with $2.2 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The company generated $881 million in free cash flow \u2014 cash produced through operations less capital expenditures. \u201cThe cash-flow number is impressive,\u201d said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of cash for a company their size.\u201dBut the company could face difficulties ahead. The increase in sales of the Model 3 could cause demand to soften in the fourth quarter.The company, which until recently only sold tens of thousands of luxury cars a year, will need to find many more buyers for the Model 3, which sells for $46,000 to $64,000 before federal and state tax incentives. Mr. Musk said that the company expected sales to remain strong as it starts shipping the car to Europe in the first three months of next year and Asia after that.\u201cAs long as they keep producing more cars than the previous quarter, there\u2019s a good chance they can keep profits going,\u201d Mr. Whiston said.In a sign that buyers are still interested in the car after months of waiting for it, Tesla said that of the 455,000 Model 3 reservations it reported having in August 2017, fewer than 20 percent had been canceled.Tesla next year is supposed to start making a more affordable version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, and Mr. Musk has said that Tesla would lose money on that model if the company produced it now. The cheaper Model 3 is important because the $7,500 federal tax credit available to buyers of Tesla cars will be cut by half on Jan. 1 and phased out entirely over the course of 2019, making the company\u2019s cars more expensive.Tesla recently began offering a Model 3 priced at $46,000 as an interim step before it can produce the $35,000 version. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have the ability to get to $35,000 right away,\u201d Mr. Musk said, but he said Tesla was \u201cprobably less than six months from that.\u201dEven though Tesla is finally hitting its stride in production, \u201cthe company isn\u2019t out of the woods yet,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, a market researcher. \u201cThe $35,000 Model 3 remains a fantasy, and with the full tax credit for that car now off the table, it will be interesting to see how many buyers are willing to keep waiting for it to be a reality.\u201dThe company is still struggling to deliver cars to customers, which Mr. Musk has described as \u201cdelivery logistics hell.\u201d The quality of the Model 3 has also come under question as many customers have complained about receiving cars with scratched paint, cracked windows and other defects.If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.As of Sept. 30, Tesla owed its suppliers $3.6 billion, up from $3 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company\u2019s debt totaled more than $10 billion.Tesla shares closed at $288.50 on Wednesday before its earnings were released, down more than 20 percent from early August. The stock was up 10 percent in aftermarket trading.An earlier version of this article misstated Tesla\u2019s cash at the end of the second quarter. It was $2.2 billion, not $2.4 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Become Rich. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Great at Everything.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn allowing the best competitors to rise to the top in our market economy, we allow enormous wealth to concentrate in relatively few hands. The competition that produced Apple, Tesla and Google has also produced billionaires.Perversely, the wealth generated this way is having an unintended consequence. Wealth accumulated in one arena is frequently used to acquire control in others. The result is far from efficient, since success in one arena hardly assures success in another.The problem is obvious in sports.In basketball or baseball, for example, teams place their best players in the game in the crucial moments that separate a win from a loss. You might think that there should be similar care taken in the executive suite, too, so that the best managers are in place to make the crucial business decisions. Yet sports superstars like Michael Jordan or Derek Jeter \u2014 as well as businessmen like James Dolan of the Knicks and Rangers, but originally of the Cablevision empire \u2014 have been running teams with less than monumental success in the won-lost column.It\u2019s quite possible, of course, that the best days are still to come for Mr. Jordan\u2019s Charlotte Hornets, Mr. Dolan\u2019s teams and for the Miami Marlins, which Mr. Jeter hasn\u2019t run for very long. But it still seems fair to say that while money is portable from one field to another, talent often is not.This problem is hardly unique to sports. It is endemic in free markets. Success and wealth that move from one arena to another often breed inefficiency.Of course the leap from talented salesperson to manager is nowhere near as large or as consequential as the leaps that great wealth allows.A hedge fund manager who buys a newspaper has the power to decide what constitutes news. A rich app developer who starts a foundation can decide which philanthropic projects are worthwhile. A real estate developer who donates heavily to a local theater may have considerable influence over which plays will come to life.Neither wealth accumulation nor the use of wealth to influence a wide array of unrelated ventures is particularly new, of course: The rich have been patrons of the arts and sciences for decades.But the phenomenon of wealthy people seeking to influence areas in which they have no particular expertise appears to be particularly severe today, partly because of the young age at which people can now become wealthy. The problem is not that younger people are less able than older ones. It is that they have more years in which to meddle.Competition places some constraints on how long the wealthy can stay at the top. But not much.While reputation depreciates, wealth accumulates. An athlete cannot keep playing solely on the basis of his performance from a decade ago. Wealth, however, has a long memory, and it brings its own luck. Virtually all major league sports teams have increased in value, both the good ones and the bad ones. The biggest challenge is being wealthy enough to own one in the first place.Short of wholesale revamping of the economy, we cannot change the power wealth gives. We can, however, work to thwart one of the accomplices to the problem: our own psychologies, which magnify the power of wealth.Psychologists studying stereotypes have noted that one of the most basic dimensions for evaluating people is by their competence. The problem is that competence is often viewed as a general attribute; rather than realizing that people are skilled at individual activities, we imagine that they are talented at nearly everything. We overgeneralize ability.Few beliefs play to human hubris more than the belief in the universality of talent \u2014 a belief that successful people have the \u201cit\u201d that lets them do great things in every walk of life, certainly including politics.Wealth can be intoxicating, leading a billionaire into economically destructive narcissism. Like nepotism, this kind of narcissism favors familiarity over talent, except that the person being privileged is yourself.But the successful do not just benefit from their own wealth. They benefit from our mistaken perceptions. The fungibility of wealth amplifies this faulty and dangerous notion that money is equivalent to generalized ability.Each of us can temper how we view successful people, recognizing that their talents are specific. Running a tech startup that makes billions doesn\u2019t make one a virtuoso who can disrupt all industries. Managing an investment fund doesn\u2019t give one deep insight into which social projects will have the greatest impact on poverty. And so on.When someone builds a better mousetrap, the world should beat a path to his door. We shouldn\u2019t assume he\u2019s good at anything but building mousetraps, however, no matter how rich he is.Advertisement"}

(Tesla\u2019s shares plummeted on Friday, giving short sellers $1.3 billion in profit.)But how much will really change?The deal \u2014 which will now be called the \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u201d \u2014 includes big concessions:\u2022 Canada will ease protections on its dairy industry and give the U.S. more access to its markets.\u2022 The U.S. won\u2019t eliminate an independent tariff dispute system or impose auto tariffs on Canada. (Aluminum and steel ones may remain, though.)Sunday\u2019s breakthrough came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada became involved in the talks over the weekend. He even asked Mexico, which had already reached an accord with the U.S., to intervene.The hacking is another headache for Facebook. The company has been buffeted over the last year by scandals including the abuse of user data and the manipulation of the social network for election meddling.California\u2019s new laws are tougher than those enacted by the Obama administration. They forbid internet service providers from intentionally slowing web services or blocking online content, and ban them from accepting money to make some services run faster.More on what it means, from Tony Romm and Brian Fung of the WaPo:The F.C.C.\u2019s efforts immediately put Washington on a collision course with the states. To start, more than 20 states filed lawsuits against the F.C.C., arguing that the agency had acted arbitrarily in repealing the net neutrality rules. Their efforts have won the support of companies like Mozilla and trade associations representing tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google.About 165 companies will be affected. Facebook and Tesla don\u2019t currently comply, for example, and will need at least three women on their board by 2021.The bill has detractors. Even Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged that the law could face legal challenges.There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment.The mini-recession ended when China let banks borrow more and the Fed held interest rates steady. But Mr. Irwin notes that the dip may have had serious consequences \u2014 including making Donald Trump\u2019s economic message more attractive to those in the affected industries.\u2022 The median salary offer for a C.E.O. role at a Series C consumer products company is $325,000 in cash, with a 50 percent bonus and a 6 percent stock grant.\u2022 The median salary for a senior director of engineering at a young Series A start-up is about $200,000 in cash, with a 0.58 percent stock grant.Business Insider created interactive charts using the data, and they are worth studying to see how much these workers make \u2014 and how companies alter compensation as they get older.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Who Will Teach Silicon Valley to Be Ethical?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome think chief ethics officers could help technology companies navigate political and social questions. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. I think we can all agree that Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision right about now.Is the solution for its companies to hire a chief ethics officer?While some tech companies like Google have top compliance officers and others turn to legal teams to police themselves, no big tech companies that I know of have yet taken this step. But a lot of them seem to be talking about it, and I\u2019ve discussed the idea with several chief executives recently. Why? Because slowly, then all at once, it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds.It\u2019s probably no surprise, considering the complex problems the tech industry faces. As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank\u2019s giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape \u2014 $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis\u2019 funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It\u2019s an ethical swamp out there.That\u2019s why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business \u2014 like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border.Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues. At a recent company event, he elaborated: \u201cWe can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.\u201d23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer. In an interview I did this week with its chief executive, Anne Wojcicki, she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates, but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues. She acknowledged that the collection of DNA data is rife with ethical considerations, but said, \u201cI think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set, rather than just hire one person to determine this.\u201dWhen asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics, some point out that legal or diversity/inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top \u2014 the chief executive.Also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or, worse, get steamrollered. And, if the person was bad at the job, of course, it could drag the whole thing down.How can an industry that, unlike other business sectors, persistently promotes itself as doing good, learn to do that in reality? Do you want to not do harm, or do you want to do good? These are two totally different things.And how do you put an official ethical system in place without it seeming like you\u2019re telling everyone how to behave? Who gets to decide those rules anyway, setting a moral path for the industry and \u2014 considering tech companies\u2019 enormous power \u2014 the world.Like I said, adult supervision. Or maybe, better still, Silicon Valley itself has to grow up.Advertisement"}

And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Tesla Faces a Challenger in the Home Solar Business", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Just four years after its founding in 2006, SolarCity had emerged as the nation\u2019s leading rooftop solar power company. The company\u2019s founders, with the help of their billionaire cousin, Elon Musk, set out to be the vanguard of an age in which consumers weaned themselves from dependence on utilities for their electricity.In the short term, the biggest competition is coming from Sunrun, an installer of residential solar panels and energy storage that is capturing a growing amount of what had been SolarCity\u2019s signature market.\u201cIt is all but guaranteed that Sunrun will emerge as the top residential solar installer in the U.S.,\u201d said Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which provides consulting on various issues including energy and renewables. \u201cTesla\u2019s residential solar business is in rapid decline as the company has cut many sales channels.\u201dWood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, says Tesla accounts for 9.3 percent of residential solar installations nationwide this year, followed by Sunrun at 9.0 percent, in a fragmented industry. In 2015, SolarCity had one-third of the market while Sunrun had 5 percent.Since the acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla has worked to present itself as a one-stop shop for a homeowner\u2019s needs \u2014 an electric car in the garage, solar panels on the roof, and a battery called the Powerwall storing energy to help power both the car and the home. Tesla also makes a battery system it sells commercially and to utilities, called the Powerpack. The Powerpack stores energy from the electric grid as well as power collected from solar arrays larger than systems designed for home use.In the third quarter, the company\u2019s noncar battery business, as measured in megawatts, more than doubled from the same quarter a year earlier. But its solar installations, also measured in megawatts, have declined sharply. To match last year\u2019s installations, Tesla would have to sell twice as much in the fourth quarter as it did in the first three quarters combined.Sunrun says it has already surpassed Tesla, if the installations it finances through third-party contractors are counted. That could bring Sunrun\u2019s market share for residential installations to as much as 15 percent.Sunrun, founded in 2007 and based in San Francisco, says it has sold more than $3 billion in installed solar systems. Lynn Jurich, Sunrun\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said her company recently expanded into seven new markets and now has a presence in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Part of Sunrun\u2019s strategy has been to stay focused on financing and installing solar panels and batteries rather than producing those products itself.Ms. Jurich said, \u201cManufacturing, that\u2019s not our core competency.\u201dNew opportunities for both companies are opening up, especially in California, which is already the nation\u2019s leader in solar installations and is adding new mandates and incentives.Analysts say prices for comparable residential solar systems at Sunrun and Tesla are about the same. But as they move to take advantage of the growing appeal of home solar power, the companies are pursuing divergent paths.Visitors to Tesla\u2019s showroom in Burbank, Calif., will find a Model X and Model S parked on the showroom floor while a Powerwall and a single solar panel are displayed on a wall. A video shows how the products can be integrated.The approach of using Tesla stores replaced a long-established sales strategy that focused on a partnership with Home Depot in which Tesla representatives sold solar panels at the hardware giant\u2019s retail outlets. Tesla says selling its products under one roof \u201cwill save money and enable our colleagues to work together more effectively and efficiently.\u201dBut the partnership approach seems to suit Sunrun, which lacks its own showrooms and has struck a relationship with another giant retailer, Costco.That\u2019s where Ed Hanlon, of Carlsbad, Calif., recently encountered a Sunrun sales representative. After researching the company, Mr. Hanlon, 72, decided to buy a 7.5-kilowatt solar power system, including a battery, that workers began installing this month.\u201cWe live in California, so sunshine is a given,\u201d said Mr. Hanlon, a retired Marine. But what pushed him to go solar was frustration with the rate increases by his power company, San Diego Gas and Electric, over the last couple of years.\u201cI thought: \u2018O.K., what can we do to kind of dampen that down?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a feel-good part of it.\u201dNeither Sunrun nor Tesla makes its own solar panels. Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make panels at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo but uses other suppliers as well. Tesla manufactures all of its other products, including parts for installing the systems.The foreign origin of many panels has been a handicap for the industry since President Trump imposed tariffs on their import this year. Sunrun says that the tariffs have not slowed its business, while Tesla declined to comment about the impact.Sunrun\u2019s revenue in 2017 was $533 million, up from $477 million in 2016. Tesla\u2019s revenue from electricity generation and storage last year was $1.1 billion, but that includes some commercial and utility-scale products.Even with the traction that Sunrun has gotten, Tesla says it is intent on pushing ideas that are untested or have yet to gain widespread adoption or success.And it is building out its leadership team with the recent arrival of Sanjay Shah, who helped with growth and development at Dell and Amazon, as the senior vice president of Tesla Energy.\u201cCompetition is always healthy,\u201d Mr. Shah said in an interview, but he said Tesla and Sunrun were fundamentally different.\u201cInstead of focusing on the competition and the markets, we are focusing on where the world is going,\u201d he said. \u201cThe growth in terms of market share is just a matter of time. Our energy business will continue to grow, and it will be as big as our auto business.\u201dBut Vikram Aggarwal, the co-founder and chief executive of EnergySage, a solar comparison-shopping service, said Tesla\u2019s self-contained approach had made it challenging for Mr. Musk to execute his vision.\u201cThey wanted to be a fully vertically integrated product, manufacturing and installation company,\u201d Mr. Aggarwal said. \u201cThat is a very, very expensive strategy to implement where you have so many components. For one company to be really good at all of it is very difficult.\u201dMr. Shah described the changes as strategic moves to improve efficiency. Customers, he said, will ultimately visit and keep returning to Tesla stores because of the experience they will find in search of products to power their lives. \u201cWhen customers think renewable energy, they should think about electric vehicles, solar and battery \u2014 not just solar and a battery,\u201d he said.While Tesla announced a 9 percent job reduction across all its businesses in June, it has been hiring more installers and electricians to ramp up its solar power and energy storage business.The crown jewel of Tesla\u2019s solar products was supposed to be glass solar shingles that would be more visually appealing than the rectangular panels that sit on rooftops. Many people find boxy solar panels unattractive on roofs with ceramic barrel tiles, or simply don\u2019t like puncturing holes in their shingles to install panels.Mr. Musk promised to deliver the shingles at a price comparable to replacing a normal roof. But like other Tesla products, the shingles have been delayed, which the company attributed to their complexity. It said last week that it expected to ramp up production in the first half of next year.Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin Lyndon Rive, a co-founder and former chief executive of SolarCity, says he is optimistic about Tesla\u2019s long-term leadership in the solar and storage business. \u201cTesla is going to continue innovating and creating services,\u201d he said.Mr. Rive, who created SolarCity with his brother Peter in 2006, joined Tesla after his company was acquired. But the two left after a few months for undisclosed reasons.Mr. Rive acknowledged the delivery struggles that Tesla often experiences with its products. But he said the company would ultimately prevail in the solar and storage market.\u201cYes, they do have the ramp-up challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they solve them. They always do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are the Consequences of Elon Musk\u2019s S.E.C. Criticism?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchFirst, it was a tweet proclaiming \u201cfunding secured\u201d for taking Tesla private. That caused the Securities and Exchange Commission to sue Elon Musk, the company\u2019s chief executive, for misleading investors.The settlement included a permanent injunction \u2014 sometimes referred to as a \u201csin no more\u201d order \u2014 that raises the stakes for Mr. Musk if he violates the primary antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws again. But his tweets raise a question: Will Mr. Musk be able to avoid violating securities laws in the future?Mr. Musk\u2019s criticism of the agency appears petulant and poorly timed, given his need to have the settlement approved, but it is not the type of statement that misleads shareholders. It does indicate that he may not be as contrite as other defendants who settle with the S.E.C., however, and could violate the injunction. That could have serious consequences by allowing the S.E.C. to ask the federal court to impose additional penalties.One basis for justifying a permanent injunction is whether the defendant is likely to violate securities laws in the future. The securities laws prohibit both false statements and those that are so sketchy that they could mislead investors \u2014 something the 280 characters allowed on Twitter might foster.The S.E.C.\u2019s settlement with Tesla, which was sued separately from Mr. Musk, requires the company to \u201cemploy or designate an experienced securities lawyer whose qualifications are not unacceptable\u201d to the S.E.C.\u2019s staff to review future communications through social media by its senior executives. That person must stay in place as long as Tesla remains a public company, with the S.E.C. apparently hoping that the lawyer will be able to tone down Mr. Musk\u2019s social media commentary. In addition, the company must create a committee of independent directors who will oversee the controls that Tesla has been told to put in place regarding public statements by its executives.But can Tesla\u2019s board of directors or corporate counsel control Mr. Musk? The S.E.C. will certainly be watching and has the ability to punish him if he makes statements that are considered to be a potential violation.If that happens, the S.E.C. could pursue a civil contempt case, and Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets criticizing the agency could bolster it.To prove a violation, the agency would have to show clear and convincing evidence that the order was valid and lawful, clear and unambiguous, and that the violator had the ability to comply with the order. That is a higher standard than the one usually applied in civil cases because a contempt finding can have serious consequences.A federal judge who finds civil contempt can order that the defendant be incarcerated until the person complies with an order, but that is unlikely to happen if the matter concerns only misleading statements. The more likely remedy would be a corrective statement along with an additional monetary penalty for a violation. Given Mr. Musk\u2019s wealth, the likelihood is that any fine would make little difference to him.The S.E.C.\u2019s ultimate power if Mr. Musk made new misleading statements would be to seek an order barring him from serving as a director or an officer of a public company. This penalty was the greatest threat in the original lawsuit filed on Sept. 27, and perhaps a motivation for the settlement. One basis for issuing a bar is a repeat offense, so the settlement counts as a first strike against Mr. Musk.So now it becomes something of a parlor game: Will he say something that violates the antifraud rules? If the \u201cexperienced securities lawyer\u201d that the company must retain has real power, the likelihood of a violation is low. But if Mr. Musk posts comments on Twitter without having them vetted first, there will be a risk that the injunction could be violated \u2014 with potentially significant consequences.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s time to find out whether the \u201cGirls Trip\u201d star can make it last.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Tiffany Haddish almost had hot vacation sex last month.After a whirlwind year catapulting to fame and winning an Emmy, she went on holiday to Greece, one of the dwindling number of places she can still go unrecognized. There, she met a gorgeous man, and though he spoke only Greek to her, it was clear from their frisson and the way he touched her arm how the night could go.\u201cBut then I got scared,\u201d Haddish, who is 38, told me during an interview early in October in Santa Monica, \u201cI need at least a month to get to know a dude.\u201dShe paused, searched my eyes and let out a raspy giggle. \u201cYou would\u2019ve did it?!\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly that. I was wondering if the Greek fella had any inkling of what he had missed. This was, after all, the woman who, in her breakthrough role in the 2017 summer smash \u201cGirls Trip,\u201d introduced a wowser of a boudoir trick \u2014 it involves citrus \u2014 to the wider world.Her longtime friends and allies were not at all surprised. Tyler Perry, who wrote the forthcoming film \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d specifically for her, said after casting Haddish in his television series \u201cIf Loving You Is Wrong,\u201d he quickly realized that she outshone the part. \u201cShe was bigger than the room, bigger than what we were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that eventually she would hit.\u201dHart thinks Haddish should ignore any conversation about what she should do next and dig into her moment as a comedy star. \u201cEverybody wants change immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201dI wondered where all the love came from. What, I asked her, was the source?\u201cMy uterus?\u201d she replied. \u201cMy empty uterus?\u201dWe were sitting in the courtyard of a recording studio in a nondescript building just off the Santa Monica Freeway, where Ms. Haddish was doing voice-overs for \u201cLego Movie Two.\u201d Since demand for her went through the roof, she has been fighting fatigue with naps and five-hour energy drinks. She still looked great. Publicity shots were planned, so she had fixed her hair, put on eyelashes, and worn a cute red-and-blue outfit sent over by Tory Burch. A few days earlier, to celebrate the box office success of \u201cNight School,\u201d she posted a video to Instagram of her more au naturel self: barefaced and gorgeous, wearing an orange hair bonnet and sweats, skipping along the sidewalk of her neighborhood in South Los Angeles.About that love-thy-neighbor business. Ms. Haddish\u2019s first instinct after getting disrespected is to cuss the insulter out, but she said she holds back because she deeply believes in the golden rule. She cannot expect to be met with understanding and compassion unless she gives love out, a lesson she somehow internalized despite a brutal childhood.She was born in Los Angeles, and her father, an Eritrean refugee, left the family when she was a toddler. Her mother, an accomplished entrepreneur, married Haddish\u2019s stepfather and had four more children, but when Haddish was 8, her mother got into a horrible car accident. Her head went through the windshield, and she was left severely brain damaged, with a very limited vocabulary, which frustrated her to the point of violence. Haddish believes it led to her schizophrenia. (She also believes Kanye West\u2019s controversial embrace of Donald Trump could have roots in his 2002 car crash. \u201cYou could be suffering brain damage,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at football players.\u201d)Haddish became the de facto head of the house, and discovered during her tweenage years that she could head off her mother\u2019s outbursts by making jokes. \u201cAt that point it was not about being funny, it was a defense mechanism to avoid getting punched in the mouth,\u201d she said. Much of high school was spent away from her siblings in foster care, where she was molested.But Haddish left one devastating episode out, something she only revealed last summer. When she was 17, she said, she was raped by a man who told her he was a police cadet. She reported it to the police, she told me, but nothing was done.\u201cI can\u2019t fix it, and there\u2019s nothing funny about it, so I didn\u2019t put it in the book,\u201d she said, her husky voice cracking. \u201cI got my power stolen. You gotta claim that back.\u201dWe sat in silence for a few moments, or near silence, as she choked back sobs. Flashes of the attack hit her out of the blue, triggered by a song or a smell; she still cannot eat at the California burger joint she and her attacker went to together.Haddish found solace with girlfriends who had also been sexually assaulted, and tried to imagine her hymen growing back. But she grew leaden with despair. She had heavy, inexplicable vaginal bleeding, was reeling from a storm of unprocessed trauma, and living out of her Geo Metro, which made entertaining cosseted adolescents at bar and bat mitzvahs excruciating, especially when daughters danced with their dads.\u201cI literally wanted to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like everything in my life and everybody that came around was out to hurt me.\u201dThen, one night when she was 21, her stepfather told her she should buck up because she ought to have been dead. She said he told her he had snipped her mother\u2019s brakes before the crash, and that Haddish and her siblings were supposed to have been with her. Haddish still does not know if he was telling the truth, or lying to get her out of her funk. Either way, it worked. \u201cI was like, \u2018I must get revenge!\u2019\u201d she exclaimed, slamming her hands onto the table we were sitting at. She hatched schemes to get her stepfather imprisoned, plotting to date a police officer and then a lawyer, until her grandmother told her she had to let God handle it. (She said her stepfather was never prosecuted. Efforts to locate him were not successful.) \u201cHis life was going really great when I was trying to get revenge,\u201d Haddish said. \u201cAs soon as I stopped doing that, life started kicking him in the ass.\u201dMeanwhile, her life steadily improved.At the urging of a therapist, Haddish started doing stand-up comedy. The bleeding slowed, and her depression lifted. Even her crotchety mom started giving her kudos, in her own special way. After Haddish got her first big break, performing on the television show \u201cBill Bellamy\u2019s Who\u2019s Got Jokes?,\u201d she said her mother turned to her and crowed proudly, \u201cMy coochie makes stars.\u201dHaddish also reunited with her father and finally got to dance with him, at her wedding. He had agonized about abandoning her, saying maybe he could have protected her. \u201cI said, \u2018Well maybe then I\u2019d be a lame-ass bitch,\u201d she recalled. After their dance, she zipped to the bathroom to pray. \u201cI just said, \u2018Thank you so much for that experience and please send loving energy and my apologies to all the bat mitzvah girls I was hating on,\u2019\u201d she said. (Her father died last year.)Her dogged pursuit of success involved a formula she said she learned from assorted books, including the Bible. She knew what she wanted. She had faith that she could do it. And she took action, enrolling in acting classes, doing tons of comedy, going on endless failed auditions, and finally getting cast in TV shows (\u201cReal Husbands of Hollywood\u201d) and movies (\u201cThe Janky Promoters\u201d). She still is pushing to claim new ground and stars in the 2019 mob drama \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d with McCarthy and Elisabeth Moss.\u201cI executed a plan and I\u2019m getting the results, like when you decide to bake a chicken,\u201d she said. \u201cMy career is a delicious roasted chicken.\u201dNow, over a year into her fame, lots of things about her have not changed, at least not yet. She loves sex, but her faith in guys had been lastingly shaken, which was a big reason she did not hook up with the amorous Greek. \u201cI can\u2019t trust these men,\u201d she said.Aside from the occasional splurge, she doesn\u2019t like buying super pricey clothes or handbags. She has no plans to leave her South Los Angeles home, which she adores and bought way before \u201cGirls Trip,\u201d even though her fancy friends are urging her to move almost anywhere else. And she said a big chunk of her money goes to covering her family\u2019s medical bills and day-care costs, refurbishing her grandmother\u2019s house for accessibility, and paying for top meal plans, nurses, physical therapists and psychologists for her mother, whom Haddish moved out of a mental institution earlier this year.Haddish\u2019s new goal is to create an empire, though she is not sure exactly how to go about it, or if it will be in the entertainment business or what. But she wants to have 40 or 50 people working for her who will be able to buy houses, put their kids through school, and pass their money down. \u201cThe end goal,\u201d she said, \u201cis to create intergenerational wealth and spread joy, and make sure everyone who works with me can spread the same thing and have it trickle down.\u201dIn the meantime, she is dabbling in music and trying to make a rap album.She is also considering a return to Greece.\u201cSometimes, you\u2019re like, \u2018Whoever want it, come and get it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Haddish said. \u201cBut nobody wants you when you\u2019re like, \u2018ANYBODY?\u2019\u201dShe draped herself across the table, stomach down, posterior up, and looked slyly over one shoulder. \u201cAnybody?\u201d she continued, at a holler. \u201cNo takers. Please, please sir. No? O.K.\u2019\u201dShe promised me she would work it into a comedy bit.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the marriage of Tiffany Haddish\u2019s mother and stepfather. It was her mother\u2019s first marriage; she wasn\u2019t remarrying.slide showAdvertisement"}

As Andre Sapir, a former E.U. economic adviser, told the WSJ: \u201cI don\u2019t think Europe will want to enter into such an agreement \u2014 it would want to have balanced agreement.\u201dThe off-the-cuff remarks, the \u201chandsy\u201d office politics, the clubbable sexism are all being noted. And slowly, the penny is dropping. We don\u2019t much care for sexist opinion. And we\u2019re really not impressed by your Rabelaisian past.But Ms. Ellison adds that many accused men, like the comedian Louis C.K., are working again. And the debate over balancing the rights of the accused with those of the accusers is far from over, as the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination shows. For #MeToo, this may just be the beginning.The sight of Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top Washington official, sitting behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at last week\u2019s Senate nomination hearing angered many at the social network. They saw it as a kind of an endorsement from the company.This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.After the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. \u2014 still in the pact \u2014 began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. There\u2019s more at stake than one agreement.What the Europeans devised is a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks won\u2019t. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others haven\u2019t \u2014 and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Yes, in Your Backyard", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ & AAre accessory dwelling units the answer to the housing shortage? The designer Yves B\u00e9har thinks so, and he has a new prototype to prove it. It\u2019s basically an extra building you can build in your backyard. This is now being recognized as a solution for adding housing, whether it\u2019s for aging parents, students or people who are just starting out. It\u2019s a solution for housing stock in cities, and hopefully bringing costs down. And people can do it themselves rather than waiting for local government or developers.It\u2019s been a very fascinating field that has had its ups and downs. The traction prefabs were having was much lower than anticipated for single-family homes. What\u2019s really transformational for the field, I believe, are these new A.D.U. laws. Interest has really boomed. I\u2019m anticipating that the A.D.U. market will grow substantially in the next decade or two.The reason prefabs make so much sense in the A.D.U. context is that the added construction is easy on neighborhoods and neighbors. It can take two, three years to build something, with all the noise and visual pollution. And wasted materials that come with that. But with the YB1, it takes about a month to build it in a factory and a day to install. It comes prewired with all your electrical, HVAC, appliances \u2014 everything is ready to go. Prefabs make it so much more accessible for people to add housing stock, and it\u2019s so much cleaner.Designing a prefab to fit in someone\u2019s backyard is a different exercise than thinking about completely new construction on a virgin piece of land. It\u2019s a smaller space, and it has neighbors, fences and privacy and light issues. I realized that a one-size-fits-all approach wouldn\u2019t function well, and would really restrict adoption.Our approach has been to think of it more as a system that allows maximum flexibility. It\u2019s built on a four-foot system: Every four feet, you can decide whether you have a full-height wall, a full-height window, a clerestory or a half-size window. You can decide how much light you have, and where the view comes from. You can maximize privacy and the program of the home to be really specific to your needs. There are two different flat-roof heights \u2014 one with clerestory, one without \u2014 and a pitched roof, which gives you the option to have a loft space upstairs. It can be modulated in ways that prefab traditionally hasn\u2019t allowed.It\u2019s a steel structure with concrete panels or slatted wood panels in a natural or black finish. There\u2019s a shutter system that creates shadow with an overhead awning. We have a roof that is designed to capture rainwater and connect to rain barrels. We have super-efficient mini-split heating and cooling. The house is designed to be solar ready. Essentially, all this means that it could be off-grid.They\u2019ll work across very different climates. We\u2019re working on a project right now in Tahoe, a pitched-roof version of the A.D.U. for a colder climate, in a snow area. We do have that in California.I like helical piles, but you can also put it on a standard foundation. Just the amount of disruption to the land \u2014 and the amount of noisy or dirty work that has to happen \u2014 is less with piles than it is with a concrete foundation.This one has a lot of glass, almost all the way around, and is a full-featured one with really nice appliances and finishes. So it\u2019s toward the higher end of what we build.Plant Prefab is investing in robotic construction and new assembly technology, which will help us to bring the cost down. We think of it a little like a Tesla Model S versus a Tesla Model 3, with a progression of products that will be priced differently.We\u2019re working on it right now and actually have a project for low-cost housing here in Northern California, where they\u2019re interested in a nice little number of them. Based on that particular project, I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity in the next year or so.Advertisement"}

California being California, the ballots will be full of confusing ballot initiatives, one of the more contentious of which is a statewide rent control measure called Proposition 10.Specifically, it prevents cities from applying rent control to single-family homes and apartments built after 1995. It also ensures that landlords can raise rents as much as they like after a rent-controlled tenant leaves.The evictions and economic displacement that have accompanied rising home prices have awakened a long-dormant renters\u2019 movement. Proposition 10\u2019s main backer, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles, has promised to bring it back if voters reject it this year.

{"Headline": "Unraveling a Tesla Mystery: Lots (and Lots) of Parked Cars", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "Groups of new vehicles are being detected in unexplained locations across the country. Evidence being posted online has raised questions about production, logistics, quality and even demand. Supported byOne group of internet sleuths thinks it has found clues in plain sight, pointing to lots and garages in California, New Jersey, Arizona and other states where Tesla cars have been found parked in large numbers.The group\u2019s efforts to document those sites could shed light on the delivery troubles that the Tesla chief has acknowledged, and reveal whether demand for the company\u2019s cars is as high as he has suggested. Since July, Tesla has been parking anywhere from a couple of dozen to a few hundred cars at a lot in Burbank, Calif. In Lathrop, 70 miles east of San Francisco, Tesla has as many as 400 cars at an industrial site. A similar number turned up outside an industrial building nearby. At times cars have been seen entering and leaving the building, suggesting it may be a collection point or repair center.The parked vehicles were discovered over the last two months by the amateur detectives, who in at least some cases are also investors betting that Tesla\u2019s share price will fall. Some have flown drones over the parking lots to take pictures of the cars. At least one has access to a plane and shoots high-resolution photographs from the air. They post the photos on Twitter and have taken to calling themselves the Shorty Air Force.The sleuths \u2014 including three interviewed for this article, who asked not to be identified \u2014 say they feel Mr. Musk has not been candid about the company\u2019s situation, particularly its sales.A Tesla spokesman, Dave Arnold, said by email that the large lots of vehicles were \u201clogistics transit hubs\u201d and added, \u201cAnyone observing those lots will see a change from one day to the next.\u201d (He said Monday that the cars in Bellevue were awaiting delivery. Photos posted online on Sunday show hoods open, possibly indicating maintenance work.)As the sightings continue, here are some of the things worth watching. Mr. Musk recently acknowledged that the company was having difficulty shipping cars to customers, saying Tesla was in \u201cdelivery logistics hell.\u201dHe attributed the problem to a shortage of trucks to haul cars around the country.\u201cThat\u2019s total nonsense,\u201d said Mark B. Spiegel, a managing partner at Stanphyl Capital, which has a large position shorting Tesla. He is a vocal critic of the company and Mr. Musk on Twitter. \u201cA quick search would reveal plenty of car hauler capacity. Perhaps Tesla doesn\u2019t have the cash to pay for them.\u201dThe Auto Haulers Association of America is not aware of any shortage of car haulers, nor of any other automakers that are having trouble shipping new vehicles. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few carrier companies in California,\u201d said Guy Young, the association\u2019s general manager.Mr. Musk also said last week that Tesla had started producing its own trailers to transport cars to customers. Tesla has declined to say where the trailers are being made and whether the design has been approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates buses and transport vehicles.Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst at Gartner, said he surmised that Tesla, in some cases, was simply gathering cars together before shipping them to customers, or bringing cars with defects together to repair them before delivery.If so, that suggests Tesla failed in a critical task: It didn\u2019t set up an efficient way of delivering hundreds of cars a day as it was scrambling to produce 5,000 a week. \u201cHow can you not have this in place beforehand?\u201d Mr. Ramsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is unexpected demand. They should have had logistics in place in advance.\u201dA more worrisome problem would be if Tesla built these cars and now doesn\u2019t have customers willing to take them. Mr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options.The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Many who put down deposits may be waiting for the more affordable base model.Holding inventory is itself an issue for Tesla. The company has reported that it is selling almost all of the cars it is making. Each quarter, the number produced was close to the number delivered or in transit.Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays Capital who follows Tesla, said he suspected that the company had a mismatch between inventory and demand \u2014 that it had built more rear-wheel drive Model 3s than it could sell. He noted that Tesla was telling customers that it could deliver rear-wheel drive models in four weeks but that all-wheel-drive and pricier versions require waits of four to 12 months.\u201cThat suggests there is unmatched rear-wheel-drive inventory,\u201d he said.At the same time, Tesla has been offering sales enticements to lure buyers. In July it offered free lifetime use of its network of fast-charging stations to customers who bought the \u201cperformance\u201d version of the Model 3, which starts at $64,000. The company extended the program several times before ending it on Sept. 18. Mr. Musk acknowledged in a tweet that the offer was not economically \u201csustainable.\u201dThe company also held a \u201csales event\u201d in early September at its factory in Fremont, Calif., where potential customers could browse among a few hundred Model 3s and pick one to buy. Later in the month the company sent emails offering free overnight test drives of its Model S luxury sedan and its Model X sport-utility vehicle, another move that suggests Tesla is trying to stimulate demand.In some cases, cars have been marked \u2014 with a bar-coded sticker or with grease pencil on the windshield \u2014 to indicate that they are inventory vehicles, meaning they have no customers awaiting them. Some markings indicate repairs required before the cars can be sold, like scratches, dents or components that don\u2019t work.That was the case with cars in a lot in Scottsdale, Ariz., that was photographed in mid-September by The New York Times.Mr. Arnold, the Tesla spokesman, declined to explain why those cars were being stockpiled and how they figured into the company\u2019s production numbers.In the rush to ramp up Model 3 production, Tesla has faced growing issues with vehicle quality. Some customers have complained that cars arrived with scratches, loose parts and other manufacturing defects.Over the summer, Tesla advertised online for technicians to repair vehicles coming off the assembly line, suggesting that a significant number needed reworking. That may dovetail with a new headache that has cropped up: severe shortages of replacement parts. Some owners needing collision repairs have complained of waiting a month or longer for new bumpers, centers, door panels and taillights to arrive.Gabe Hoffman, general partner at Accipiter Capital Management, a hedge fund that has shorted Tesla stock, said he was skeptical that the company would follow through. \u201cIt would be spending money they don\u2019t have,\u201d he said.The long wait for parts suggests that Tesla has none or very few on hand. \u201cTo me, that shows a company in financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.Some answers may be on the way. In the coming days Tesla is expected to report production and delivery data for the last three months. A closer look at the company will come in about a month when it presents its third-quarter earnings. It\u2019s a report the Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to scrutinize.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Uber and Lyft Are in an I.P.O. Race", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber and Lyft compete aggressively in the American ride-hailing market. And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year. Beijing could struggle to contain this latest debt bubble.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Ultimatum to Tesla: Fight the S.E.C., or I Quit", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSecurities and Exchange Commission officials were understandably taken aback on Thursday morning when Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 and its chairman, Elon Musk \u2014 abruptly pulled out of a carefully crafted settlement.After the S.E.C. responded by accusing Mr. Musk, but not the company that he had co-founded, of securities fraud, the board further defied regulators, issuing a provocative statement saying that the directors were \u201cfully confident in Elon, his integrity, and his leadership of the company.\u201dIt was a stunning reversal: The board had rejected a settlement that was extraordinarily generous \u2014 it would have allowed Mr. Musk to remain as chief executive, and required him to step down as chairman for only two years. Now, the company was at risk of losing Mr. Musk as chairman and chief executive if regulators prevailed in court.\u201cWhat it tells us is this board, as a strategic plan, must be using the Jim Jones-Jonestown suicide pact,\u201d Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, said Friday on CNBC. \u201cThey are drinking the Kool-Aid of the founder. It is completely as self-destructive as Musk is.\u201dBut Mr. Musk had given the board little choice: In a phone call with directors before their lawyers went back to federal regulators with a final decision, Mr. Musk threatened to resign on the spot if the board insisted that he and the company enter into the settlement. Not only that, he demanded the board publicly extol his integrity.Threatened with the abrupt departure of the man who is arguably Tesla\u2019s single most important asset, the board caved to his demands, according to three people familiar with the board\u2019s decision.The next day, Tesla\u2019s lawyers were back at the S.E.C., all but groveling for a second chance \u2014 this time with Mr. Musk\u2019s grudging approval.One factor in Mr. Musk\u2019s change of heart: Tesla\u2019s stock plunged Friday morning as investors absorbed news of the rejected settlement and the possibility that the S.E.C. would force Mr. Musk to step down. It would finish down almost 14 percent on Friday.On Saturday, the company and Mr. Musk finally agreed to settle the matter, ending a crisis that began with Mr. Musk\u2019s now-infamous Twitter post saying that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a buyout at $420 a share.Mr. Musk\u2019s 48 hours of obstinance came at a significant price to him and the company. They had passed on Thursday\u2019s generous offer, and the S.E.C. felt compelled to extract greater concessions. The ban on Mr. Musk\u2019s serving as chairman went from two years to three, and his fine doubled to $20 million. Tesla will also pay a $20 million fine, and Mr. Musk agreed to personally buy the same amount in Tesla stock.The S.E.C. is also requiring the company to add two independent directors and to elect an independent director as chairman.\u201cRejecting such a favorable settlement is proof that he needs monitoring,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a legal leg to stand on, and I\u2019m sure his lawyer told him that. But he got very touchy about not being able to proclaim his innocence.\u201dFrom Mr. Musk\u2019s view, that had been a crucial problem with a settlement from the beginning. Mr. Musk neither admitted nor denied guilt as part of the agreement, and he cannot publicly contest the S.E.C.\u2019s allegations. He cannot say, as he did on Thursday, that \u201cI have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors\u201d and \u201cthe facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock has rebounded this week, reflecting investors\u2019 relief that Mr. Musk will remain as chief executive while the company puts mechanisms in place to curb his increasingly impulsive behavior. The board will closely watch Mr. Musk\u2019s communications with investors, and establish a permanent committee responsible for, among other things, monitoring disclosures.But it remains to be seen how effective the board can be, given Mr. Musk\u2019s erratic temperament and his dominant role in the company.People involved in the board\u2019s deliberations this week told me that some directors have proposed their fellow director, James Murdoch \u2014 the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, most of which is being sold to the Walt Disney Company \u2014 as chairman. But Mr. Murdoch hasn\u2019t volunteered for the post nor has he discussed it with any other director. And another person close to the selection process said the board hadn\u2019t yet engaged in any \u201cserious\u201d discussions of who should be chairman. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the board discussions were private.Under terms of the settlement, the board has 45 days before Mr. Musk must resign. Whether it is Mr. Murdoch or another similarly qualified candidate who takes over as chairman, managing Mr. Musk will be no easy challenge.Independent directors frequently face difficulty asserting themselves in any company with an outsize figure like Mr. Musk, whether it be a founder, controlling shareholder or powerful chief executive, said Lucian Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert in corporate governance. Such people can often replace any director who crosses them, he said.\u201cAdding two independent directors can be expected to help, but its impact is likely to be limited,\u201d Professor Bebchuk said. \u201cAs courts and governance researchers have long recognized, the presence of a dominant shareholder is likely to reduce the effectiveness of independent directors as overseers of the C.E.O.\u2019s decisions and behavior.\u201dIn the end, it took legal action by the S.E.C. to accomplish what had been increasingly obvious to most Tesla observers, including many of Tesla\u2019s own directors: For all his brilliance, Mr. Musk\u2019s reckless impulses must be kept in check.Foremost among those should be threats to quit if he doesn\u2019t get his way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tesla Could Do Better Than James Murdoch for Chairman", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTesla can find a better chairman than James Murdoch.Replacing Mr. Musk with an independent chair is required as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that he made false and misleading statements via Twitter about a potential buyout of the company.Mr. Murdoch is one of only three Tesla directors who safely qualify as independent: The others have too much history with Mr. Musk. Mr. Murdoch also has experience as an executive at big public companies like 21st Century Fox. True, he worked alongside his tycoon father, Rupert \u2014 but at least he knows how to deal with an entrenched shareholder-executive.Mr. Murdoch has no background in cars, though. And he had to step down as executive chairman of News International in 2011 after a phone-hacking scandal.Moreover, Mr. Musk\u2019s latest tweet reinforces how neither Mr. Murdoch nor the rest of the board has yet proved able to rein him in. Publicly commenting on the chairman search gives the impression that the chief executive is playing a central role, when he should have little to no say. Another part of the S.E.C. deal requires the board to set up \u201cadditional controls and procedures\u201d to oversee Mr. Musk\u2019s communications.To date, directors have either supported Mr. Musk \u2014 as they did after he rejected the initial settlement offered by the S.E.C. \u2014 or remained silent about his controversial remarks. They have not obviously curbed his penchant for going public with unrealistic business targets, either.Aside from tough love for Mr. Musk, improving investor relations, mass production and corporate finance are all on Tesla\u2019s to-do list. That all makes appointing a respected outsider a better option than Mr. Murdoch. That could be former Ford Motor boss Alan Mulally, erstwhile Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney or even a hard-nosed finance type like the Goldman Sachs and White House alum Gary Cohn.Advertisement"}

The S.E.C. declined to comment.Later on Thursday, Mr. Musk returned to Twitter to deride short-sellers.

After initially pulling out of an agreement to resolve the claims, he reached a settlement on Saturday that will require him to step down as chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine. The settlement also requires Tesla to add two independent directors to its board.The terms of the settlement were more strict than those of the one he walked away from two days earlier.\u201cMr. Musk has excellent attorneys,\u201d said Marc Leaf, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath in New York who used to work for the S.E.C. as an adviser to a commissioner. \u201cHe should listen to them.\u201dOver the weekend, when Mr. Musk sent out an email to employees saying Tesla was nearing profitability, the company filed that statement with the S.E.C. to avoid any regulatory issues.Mr. Musk has been relatively quiet on Twitter since the settlement. On Monday, he tweeted a link to a music video by the group Naughty by Nature with a winking emoji. Just before his jab at the commission and short-sellers on Thursday, he responded to a Business Insider tweet that had given Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan a positive review.\u201cGreat verdict,\u201d he wrote.James B.

(The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny.

{"Headline": "C.E.O.s May Avoid Riyadh Conference but Not Saudi Money", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Saudi Arabia is pouring $20 billion into a new investment fund run by Wall Street\u2019s Blackstone Group. The French oil giant Total just inked a nine-billion-euro petrochemical deal with the kingdom. The British defense company BAE Systems is selling 48 Typhoon combat jets to Riyadh for an estimated five billion British pounds.Companies are still assessing the situation, which shifted rapidly as the kingdom announced on Friday that Mr. Khashoggi was dead and that it had arrested 18 Saudis in the case. But short of sanctions on Saudi Arabia, or a wholesale change in policy by the United States, Britain or other governments to curb political or commercial ties, big business won\u2019t readily quit its relations with Riyadh.\u201cSaudi Arabia still has enormous wealth and powerful cachet,\u201d said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst and an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt will continue to be a crucial economic player, and it cannot be ignored. The question is whether business as usual will go on.\u201dCompanies don\u2019t always break out how much money they have reaped from Saudi connections. But a review of the kingdom\u2019s broad spending on its military, infrastructure, oil, chemicals, technology and even entertainment underscores how Riyadh is simply too big a customer to ignore.American start-ups have benefited from the largess, as Saudi Arabia became their biggest source of capital last year. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund recently invested $1 billion in Lucid, a competitor to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla car company, and $3.5 billion in Uber.Western banks have lined up for the chance to advise the Saudis. The kingdom has generated about $1.1 billion worth of fees for banks since 2010 in a variety of deals, including mergers and acquisitions and the arranging of loans and bonds, according to data from Dealogic.While Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, dropped out of the conference on Monday, the firm has no plans to sever ties with the kingdom.\u201cWe have relationships with them, their institutions, over decades,\u201d Jonathan D. Gray, Blackstone\u2019s president, told analysts on an earnings call on Thursday. \u201cWe think of ourselves as long-term, responsible stewards of capital.\u201dSome companies did not even try to distance themselves from the Saudis amid the Khashoggi furor. A spokeswoman for BAE said in a statement that it would send several senior executives to the Saudi conference.Separating itself from the Saudis would be difficult for a defense contractor like BAE, which has 6,000 employees in the kingdom. The company counts on Saudi Arabia for at least 15 percent of its revenue, from both the sale of equipment like the Typhoon and the contracts to service them.The situation is also critical for France, which has longstanding ties to Saudi Arabia and is the third-largest foreign investor after the United States and the United Arab Emirates. France sold \u20ac11 billion worth of arms to the kingdom in the last decade, and recently approved licenses for more sales potentially worth \u20ac14.7 billion. That doesn\u2019t count \u20ac4 billion in French exports to the kingdom last year, and oil and chemical deals worth over \u20ac20 billion signed in the last two years.Even as the conference has caused consternation, companies still appear to be laying the groundwork for deals.Though the chief executive of Thales, Patrice Caine, pulled out of the conference, the French company is sending a subordinate the Saudis would respect, and a spokesman, C\u00e9dric Leurquin, said Thales hadn\u2019t changed its position on investing in Saudi Arabia. Although Mr. Leurquin would not divulge sales figures for Saudi Arabia, Thales has 700 employees in the kingdom, which it supplies with military hardware, missiles, electronic warfare systems and even high-tech security surveillance systems for Mecca and other holy sites.A week after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance made headlines, Total, one of the world\u2019s largest oil and chemical groups, announced a \u20ac9 billion joint venture with Saudi Aramco for a refining and petrochemical complex in Jubail. Total did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThis is a very serious topic where you cannot win,\u201d Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of the German industrial giant Siemens, said this week as he tried to decide whether to attend the conference. The company received a blockbuster order last year for five gas turbines in Saudi Arabia, and has a gas turbine factory in its Eastern Province.\u201cIf we skip communicating with countries where people are missing, I can just stay home,\u201d Mr. Kaeser declared.An earlier version of this article misidentified the leader of the Saudi-French Business Council. He is Dr. Mohammed bin Laden; he is not the leader of the Saudi Binladen Group or the father of Osama bin Laden.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}

But to get voters to listen, she needed to make an impression first, with precious little time left before the November election.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jacky,\u201d she said over and over in a hot breeze that smelled like corn dogs \u2014 the world\u2019s best, if you trusted the truck making them. An aide motioned for someone to take a picture. \u201cI\u2019m Jacky.\u201dSome people nodded. Others looked confused.A first-term congresswoman, Ms. Rosen is in an extraordinary, and tricky, situation: She is running against Senator Dean Heller, the Republicans\u2019 most endangered incumbent, in a year when his party can only afford to lose one seat. And she initially had a powerful weapon: The G.O.P.-led confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, which enraged many women and Democrats, and Mr. Heller\u2019s gaffe that the sexual assault allegations against the nominee would just be a \u201chiccup\u201d in his rise to the Supreme Court.But Ms. Rosen, a 61-year-old former synagogue president, is now among the Democrats nationwide facing new energy from Republican voters who are defending Judge Kavanaugh and his patron, President Trump.It\u2019s a political moment that requires deft skills on the campaign trail \u2014 but Ms. Rosen is still a newcomer to politics, neither cagey nor glossy nor particularly electrifying. In a campaign season filled with rising Democratic stars like Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, she is not a phenomenon.Perhaps more significantly, Nevada is Nevada. Yes, the state voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 by more than 2 percentage points, but it has not had a Democratic governor since 1999. Neither quite red nor quite blue, it may be receptive to a fiery takedown of Mr. Heller over Judge Kavanaugh. Or it may not be.Unlike other states with competitive Senate races where the Kavanaugh issue has thundered into prominence, including North Dakota and Missouri, it is far from clear how the bitter nomination battle will affect the Heller-Rosen race. Political observers say Republican enthusiasm for getting the judge confirmed \u2014 which should be decided this weekend \u2014 could help Mr. Heller. But the issue also may not measurably change the turnout for either party\u2019s base in a state where political energy is focused elsewhere.Even Ms. Rosen isn\u2019t sure. In an interview, she did not criticize Judge Kavanaugh nearly as much as some other Democrats have, and added that she would hit Mr. Heller over the confirmation process but also talk plenty about health care, education and immigration.If Senator Heller votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, she said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to do a little bit of answering for that.\u201d It hardly served as a sharp rebuke. A moment later, however, she warmed to the subject, saying of her opponent: \u201cHe\u2019s just not listening to the voices in Nevada, to Nevada women, to their families who love women, who may have been victims of sexual assault.\u201dOn most issues and political fights, however, Ms. Rosen talks about collaboration and compromise, even as the Democratic base nationally clamors against President Trump. She does not extol the virtues of Medicare for All or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She does not extol much of anything at all.Yet it is Jacky Rosen, whose most notable previous political experience was perhaps keeping the peace among spirited congregants at Congregation Ner Tamid, who must choose a strategy in these final weeks on Mr. Heller, Judge Kavanaugh and so much else.Her allies, at least, are confident that she has the savvy and instincts to help deliver the Senate for the Democrats in November.\u201cIf you can be president of a synagogue,\u201d said Shelley Berkley, a former Nevada congresswoman, \u201cyou can be president of the United States very easily.\u201dRecent polling shows Ms. Rosen in a very tight race against Mr. Heller, a longtime politician who beat Ms. Berkley in 2012 in his Senate bid.Asked to explain her swift political rise during a separate interview at her campaign office here, Ms. Rosen \u2014 polished, practiced, composed \u2014 spoke about her willingness to take chances and the support she has received, then drifted into platitudes.But she knows a few. In early 2016, then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \u2014 whose influence over the state\u2019s Democratic Party has its own moniker, the \u201cReid machine\u201d \u2014 handpicked Ms. Rosen to run for an open House seat. She won, even as Mr. Trump won her district. It was Mr. Reid, too, who helped persuade Ms. Rosen to run for Senate. Mr. Reid, through an intermediary, declined to comment.\u201cI tell my daughter who just graduated college, I always tell her, \u2018Don\u2019t not do something just \u2019cause it\u2019s hard. Time is going to go by anyway,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rosen said.Nevada\u2019s electorate is divided between heavily Republican rural areas in the north and a growing Democratic population revolving around Las Vegas in the South. A growing number of Californians \u2014 left-leaning, Democrats hope \u2014 along with companies like Tesla and Google, are moving to the state, and the unemployment rate is below 5 percent. Its population is increasingly diverse. Because it is so split politically, Nevada\u2019s statewide officials tend toward relative moderation.Ms. Rosen\u2019s supporters view her as a viable alternative, a left-of-center Democrat whose biography and sparse voting record leave Republicans with little to attack. She supports a Medicaid buy-in program. She wants comprehensive immigration reform and has backed stricter gun control legislation. If Ms. Rosen is understated \u2014 more Mojave Desert beige than Las Vegas neon \u2014 that, her backers say, is the point.Mr. Heller, though, has never lost a race, and his defenders believe he will ultimately prevail.\u201cI think you have to have a very compelling reason to get rid of an incumbent U.S. Senator,\u201d said Sig Rogich, a longtime Republican strategist in Nevada, \u201cand there isn\u2019t one.\u201dLate last month, Mr. Trump appeared alongside Mr. Heller at a rally in Las Vegas and criticized Ms. Rosen. \u201cWacky Jacky,\u201d he called her, employing his fondness for derogatory nicknames. \u201cShe\u2019s wacky.\u201dMs. Rosen was born and raised in Chicago. Her father, a first-generation American who spoke Yiddish as his first language, was an auto salesman. Her mother was a homemaker. Ms. Rosen was a member of the drama club and remembers playing Mrs. Webb in a high-school production of \u201cOur Town.\u201dWhen Ms. Rosen was in college at the University of Minnesota, her parents moved to Las Vegas, where she spent a summer working as a cocktail waitress at Caesars Palace. \u201cI was a college student from the Midwest,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was very much like a fish out of water.\u201dShe graduated in December 1979 with a degree in psychology, then moved to southern Nevada and worked for many years as a computer programmer.Several years ago, she was elected president of Congregation Ner Tamid, among the biggest synagogues in the state. There, she helped reduce the synagogue\u2019s expenses, in part by installing solar panels.\u201cShe was very fiscally sound,\u201d said Rabbi Sanford Akselrad, the synagogue\u2019s spiritual leader and one of Ms. Rosen\u2019s friends.Ms. Rosen\u2019s leadership drew the attention of one of the synagogue\u2019s members, Elissa Cadish, a district judge. After many people rebuffed Mr. Reid\u2019s overtures to run for the open congressional seat, Judge Cadish recommended he call Ms. Rosen.\u201cThey asked a lot of the usual kinds of people to run,\u201d Ms. Rosen said, before speculating that other possible candidates saw the race as too risky. \u201cNo one told me that. But I\u2019m assuming this is why they didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201dAnd though some friends say she was never particularly political \u2014 \u201cWho knew she was going to go into politics?\u201d Mr. Akselrad said \u2014 they also say the ease with which she has taken to public office is not surprising.Quincy Branch, 41, who runs an independent insurance agency and previously voted for Mr. Heller, noted the senator\u2019s advantage before a round-table Ms. Rosen held recently with African-American entrepreneurs.\u201cHe\u2019s been here,\u201d Mr. Branch said, about Mr. Heller. \u201cIf Jacky can wedge that, then I think she has a stronger chance.\u201d He said he was undecided in this race.Ms. Rosen, as most candidates do, projected confidence heading into the last weeks before the election, brushing off the suggestion that Mr. Heller\u2019s name recognition would help. \u201cThey may know him,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not happy with him.\u201dOn a recent weekend afternoon, before she made her way to the Mexican Independence Day celebration, Ms. Rosen was in East Las Vegas, a lower-income part of the city. A small, largely Hispanic crowd \u2014 part of an important coalition of voters for Democrats \u2014 had gathered for an event to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, and Ms. Rosen paused frequently to allow a translator to repeat her words in Spanish.\u201cI\u2019m the granddaughter of immigrants,\u201d she said. A child hummed somewhere in the audience.At the end of her speech, she urged everyone to get out the vote. She told them to text a number to support her campaign, and tried repeating the number in Spanish.\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, triumphantly.Then she set off into the desert heat, ready to introduce herself anew.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sovereign Wealth Funds Embrace Their Growing Ambitions", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Lucid investment is just the latest deal in the P.I.F.\u2019s multibillion-dollar spending spree over the past two years, which highlights the evolution and growing ambitions of so-called sovereign wealth funds.Once regarded mostly as sources of money for professional money managers, sovereign funds have matured into ambitious investors. They have stocked their ranks with experienced dealmakers and are searching for opportunities to strike their own deals.\u201cThey\u2019ve evolved into becoming more direct investors,\u201d Michael Maduell, the president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research group. \u201cThey are competing more against the Carlyles and the Blackstones of the world.\u201dGovernments have long needed ways to invest their surplus cash, particularly those nations whose petroleum reserves gushed money. Sovereign funds offered one way to deploy that capital to generate income for decades to come.Such funds hold vast sums of money: roughly $7.8 trillion as of June 30, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The biggest in the world, Norway\u2019s Global Pension Fund, manages just over $1 trillion, or more than double what Blackstone oversees.Early on, many of these funds placed money with professional money managers. But starting a decade ago, some government funds began to assert themselves as direct investors.Their ambitions have continued to grow in the years since the financial crisis. The 10 biggest deals by such funds were all struck within the past decade, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The biggest on record, Blackstone\u2019s sale of the warehouse operator Logicor to the China Investment Corporation, was for roughly $14 billion.To help hunt down opportunities, many of the funds have built up their in-house investment teams, hiring experienced rainmakers from top international banks and private equity firms.From 2012 to 2016, for example, Temasek\u2019s head of the Americas was Boon Sim, who had been Credit Suisse\u2019s head of global mergers and acquisitions. During the past year, the P.I.F. has hired Alireza Zaimi, a senior banker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Abdulmajeed Alhagbani, who led HSBC\u2019s Saudi asset management team.To attract top managers, some of these funds have offered compensation packages competitive with Goldman Sachs and K.K.R., a far cry from the salaries normally paid for what are essentially civil-servant positions.There are a number of factors behind sovereign funds\u2019 push to make direct investments.One is simple: These funds are awash in money, more than what professional investment firms can put to work.\u201cThe key driver for them is that they want to invest privately more than what private equity firms allow them to do,\u201d said Francesco Rossi Ferrini, the head of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s sovereign wealth funds advisory team for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Striking deals directly also helps sovereign funds save on fees charged by money managers.A month after Mr. Musk\u2019s scandal broke, the P.I.F. announced its investment in Lucid.Advertisement"}

Fink, and Blackstone Group\u2019s chief, Stephen Schwarzman, said two people familiar with the conversations. All three depend on the kingdom for revenue.Mr. Dimon, Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event, the two people said. The three executives and their staffs reached out to the Treasury Department and urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press for the event to be postponed or to publicly make his attendance conditional on more disclosure from the Saudis about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Mr. Dimon\u2019s decision follows those of Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, Bill Ford of Ford Motor and other C.E.O.s. At issue: the disappearance and possible murder of the Saudi exile Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Saudi officials deny any involvement.Alongside the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Lampert stepped down as Sears\u2019s C.E.O. but will remain chairman. The retailer will close at least 142 stores, and lenders have given it $300 million in loans to keep operating through bankruptcy proceedings, with the aim of preserving the company at least through the holidays.But that lifeline may not be enough for Sears to fix itself and avoid liquidation.Stock markets around the world took a battering last week, as a confluence of factors \u2014 nascent inflation, rising interest rates, tightening fiscal policy and trade tensions \u2014 spooked investors. Overnight, Asian markets dropped, while European ones held their ground.What to look out for:\u2022 Bank earnings are expected to be strong, rising by as much as 41 percent, according to numbers from Refinitiv.\u2022 Energy companies are expected to do well, with profits potentially more than doubling from a year ago.\u2022 Industrial companies may fare worse, as their supply chains take a hit from the extra costs of tariffs.Nothing in the documents suggests Mr. Kushner broke the law, and a spokesman for his lawyer said that he \u201cpaid all taxes due.\u201dNot everyone is convinced it will work. As Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute told the NYT: \u201cWe\u2019ve finessed the public relations problem. But we aren\u2019t really competing with the Chinese.\u201dDiscussion about Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hit an impasse last night. Dominic Raab, the country\u2019s Brexit secretary, told his European counterpart, Michel Barnier, that his government could not agree to the bloc\u2019s current terms, with Prime Minister Theresa May having called a draft a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dE.U. leaders may conclude there is not sufficient progress to justify proceeding to a special Brexit summit in November to seal a deal, leaving talks in limbo and Britain heading towards an economically damaging \u201cno deal\u201d exit next March.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Trump Reaped Riches From His Father", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 His father\u2019s housing empire started paying Mr. Trump during childhood \u2014 the equivalent of $200,000 a year in today\u2019s money when he was three.\u2022 Mr. Trump has often said that his father lent him only $1 million. He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.\u2022 Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.\u2022 The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT.Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. \u201cThey\u2019re making more cars,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to say if they are making money on every one.\u201dFacebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache.Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman \u2014 and it could continue.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. \u201cThese developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry\u2019s challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.)Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode.

{"Headline": "Tesla Reports Progress on Model 3 Car Production", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last two months, Tesla has faced no shortage of distractions.Model 3 output nearly doubled from the previous quarter \u2014 a key achievement because that is the car Mr. Musk is counting on to drive Tesla to profitability.The electric-car maker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers. Of those, 55,840 were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.Nevertheless, the company faces many challenges, one of which is: Can it make money?In the 15 years since it was founded, Tesla has never reported an annual profit. Mr. Musk based his forecast for profits in the third and fourth quarter on production of at least 5,000 Model 3s a week. The company said it fell short of that in the third quarter, averaging about 4,100.In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month.David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. \u201cThey\u2019re making more cars,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to say if they are making money on every one.\u201dPerhaps even less certain is whether Tesla can continue making money one quarter after another. Next year, it is supposed to start making a more basic version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, and Mr. Musk has acknowledged that Tesla would lose money on that car if the company produced it now.\u201cIt\u2019s great if they\u2019re profitable in the third quarter, but what about 2019 and 2020?\u201d Mr. Whiston said. Tesla plans to build new factories and develop several new vehicles, all of which will cost money, he noted, and \u201cit costs a lot of money to grow.\u201dThe S.E.C. is still looking into Mr. Musk\u2019s past claims about the company\u2019s production goals.An important test will be whether Tesla can clear up its shipping issues in the fourth quarter, analysts said.\u201cThe real question now is if Tesla can really sustain this pace, particularly in light of the delivery issues the company has faced recently,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, an auto-data firm.Tesla reported that it had 8,048 Model 3s and 3,776 other cars in transit to customers at the end of the third quarter.\u201cWith production stabilized, delivery and outbound vehicle logistics were our main challenges during Q3,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe made many improvements to these processes throughout the quarter, and plan to make further improvements in Q4, so that we can scale successfully.\u201dThe delivery problems could hurt Tesla\u2019s bottom line, because the company can book revenue only when it puts cars into customers\u2019 hands.The automaker needs more revenue because it uses up nearly $1 billion in cash almost every quarter. At the start of the third quarter, Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash, but it owed suppliers $3 billion. It also had about $11 billion in debt on its balance sheet.In its production update, Tesla also noted \u201cthe headwinds we have been facing\u201d as a result of the trade tensions between China and the Trump administration. Tesla vehicles shipped to China are now hit with a tariff of 40 percent, the company said.China is the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles.\u201cTaking ocean transport costs and import tariffs into account, Tesla is now operating at a 55 percent to 60 percent cost disadvantage compared to the exact same car locally produced in China,\u201d the company said.Tesla is in the beginning stages of planning a factory in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
