{"Headline": "What Has Actually Changed in a Year", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementIt\u2019s true that sexual harassment and assault are against the law, but again and again the law alone has not been enough to protect women. Criminal cases are notoriously difficult to bring, and civil rights laws are filled with loopholes. Many states are changing and expanding their laws, searching for a better solution.Advocates say that while the laws are still lacking, and do not yet cover the country, this is remarkable progress. We compiled a list of notable highlights from the past year.\u201cAll of the H.R. profession has had to engage in some serious introspection,\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., the president of the Society for Human Resource Management. Companies have seen that they, too, need to make changes.Beyond the entertainment industry, low-wage workers are seeing some changes, too. Buoyed by the momentum of the #MeToo movement and building on years of independent organizing, activists have successfully raised the \u201ctipped minimum wage\u201d, the pay that servers and bartenders are paid before tips, in some places, and won safer conditions for hotel and domestic workers. The continued momentum is palpable: Last month, workers across the country protested sexual harassment at McDonald\u2019s by going on strike for a day.Perhaps more than any new policy or law, the past year has been defined by a parade of once-powerful men resigning or being fired for sexual misconduct. In some cases, women are taking their place.So over the past year, men have fallen, corporations have changed their contracts, and some states have expanded their laws. But of course, there\u2019s a long way to go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Says It Will Sell Pentagon Artificial Intelligence and Other Advanced Technology", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the divergent paths also underscore concerns inside the American defense and intelligence establishments about how the United States will take on a rising China.In the past two years, the Chinese government has set goals for dominance in the next decade in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other technologies that it believes will allow its military and intelligence agencies to surpass those of the United States. Pentagon officials have questioned how committed domestic technology companies are to keeping the country on the leading edge, the way Raytheon, Boeing, IBM and McDonnell Douglas did during the Cold War.Even before Friday\u2019s announcement, Microsoft seemed like the only plausible alternative for the Pentagon\u2019s giant cloud project, called JEDI, in which Amazon is considered the front-runner.But the announcement by Microsoft may have a greater effect on future technologies, including warning systems and weapons powered by artificial intelligence. And the company\u2019s leadership, after brief debates this summer, concluded that by dropping out of the bidding, Google was also losing any real influence in how the weapons would be used.\u201cThis was not a hard decision,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview in his office. \u201cMicrosoft was born in the United States, is headquartered in the United States, and has grown up with all the benefits that have long come from being in this country.\u201dBut Mr. Smith seemed to be trying to strike a middle ground.He has sued the United States government repeatedly to halt Washington\u2019s efforts to gain access to customer information stored on the company\u2019s servers, and he is pressing for new international agreements to limit how the United States and its adversaries can use cyberweapons.He also argued in the blog post that \u201cto withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in a responsible way.\u201d\u201cWe are not going to withdraw from the future,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith\u2019s comments stood in sharp contrast to statements by Google this month. When the company dropped out of the competition for the JEDI cloud computing contract, officials said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be assured that it would align with our A.I. principles,\u201d a reference to a set of principles issued in June in which the company vowed not to design artificial intelligence products that would be used to harm people, or for surveillance or armaments. The contract is believed to amount to about $10 billion over a decade, but the shape of cloud computing that far into the future is hard to predict.Some industry experts saw Google\u2019s statement as an effort to gain political credit for backing out of a competition it was unlikely to win. Unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Google is missing some of the government certifications it would need to provide the software to the military.Microsoft is believed to have a good shot, in part because President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and the owner of The Washington Post. But even as Mr. Trump frequently dismisses the \u201cAmazon Washington Post,\u201d Amazon is considered the front-runner for the contract, in large part because of the company\u2019s experience in building the C.I.A.\u2019s cloud computing ability over the last five years. In an analysis published in June, Deutsche Bank Research concluded that Amazon \u201cis best positioned to win the lion\u2019s share of the JEDI contract\u201d and that Microsoft was the \u201cmain challenger.\u201dCulturally, Google and Microsoft are far different; while some Microsoft employees have expressed unhappiness with the company\u2019s government contracts, most recently with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the protests among Google engineers and other employees were far more intense and far more public.Microsoft has been far more willing, however, to challenge the government. It went to court to try to keep the United States from being able to subpoena Microsoft for the emails or other records of customers whose data was stored abroad. (The suit was rendered moot by federal legislation.) It has been pressing for a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that would, like the traditional Geneva Convention, wall off certain civilian targets. The United States government has resisted the idea so far, not wanting to limit a president\u2019s options to use cyberweapons against power grids or other targets on which civilians depend.\u201cWe can\u2019t control how the U.S. military uses our technology once we give it to them,\u201d Mr. Smith argued. \u201cBut the military is subject to civilian control. And we believe we will have an opportunity to influence those discussions \u2014 but it\u2019s not up to us.\u201dBut to a large degree, the import of Microsoft\u2019s announcement has more to do with the politics of confronting China and less to do with its immediate prospects.The Pentagon has struggled in recent years to bring the Silicon Valley innovation to new weapons systems and sensors. The acquisition and testing process is so long that many high-tech systems are outdated by the time they begin. While the Obama administration succeeded in creating an outpost in Silicon Valley, called DIUx, or Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, its budget was small and some promising off-the-shelf technologies \u2014 for example, small, inexpensive satellites that could be fired in large numbers over North Korea to detect mobile launchers \u2014 have been delayed for years.But the next challenge facing both the government and the companies is whether American-based companies will be limited in what kind of artificial intelligence technologies they can sell to China.In his interview, Mr. Smith would not indicate whether Microsoft would also provide all of its products to, say, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue we are going to have to work through,\u201d he said. But the reality, he and other executives in the technology field have noted, is that the Chinese would not accept American-made artificial intelligence code, for fear that the United States would turn off Chinese access to the cloud services in a time of conflict.Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Karen Weise from Seattle.Advertisement"}

The rich are banning screens from class altogether.Supported byThe parents in Overland Park, Kan., were fed up. They wanted their children off screens, but they needed strength in numbers. First, because no one wants their kid to be the lone weird one without a phone. And second, because taking the phone away from a middle schooler is actually very, very tough.\u201cWe start the meetings by saying, \u2018This is hard, we\u2019re in a new frontier, but who is going to help us?\u2019\u201d said Krista Boan, who is leading a Kansas City-based program called START, which stands for Stand Together And Rethink Technology. \u201cWe can\u2019t call our moms about this one.\u201dFor the last six months, at night in school libraries across Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., about 150 parents have been meeting to talk about one thing: how to get their children off screens.The psychologist Richard Freed, who wrote a book about the dangers of screen-time for children and how to connect them back to real world experiences, divides his time between speaking before packed rooms in Silicon Valley and his clinical practice with low-income families in the far East Bay, where he is often the first one to tell parents that limiting screen-time might help with attention and behavior issues. \u201cI go from speaking to a group in Palo Alto who have read my book to Antioch, where I am the first person to mention any of these risks,\u201d Dr. Freed said. \u201cThe digital divide was about access to technology, and now that everyone has access, the new digital divide is limiting access to technology,\u201d said Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired magazine.Some parents, pediatricians and teachers around the country are pushing back. \u201cThese companies lied to the schools, and they\u2019re lying to the parents,\u201d said Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting duped.\u201d\u201cOur kids, my kids included, we are subjecting them to one of the biggest social experiments we have seen in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens to my daughter if she can\u2019t communicate over dinner \u2014 how is she going to find a spouse? How is she going to interview for a job?\u201d\u201cI have families now that go teetotal,\u201d Dr. Burgert said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done.\u2019\u201dOne of those families are the Brownsbergers, who had long banned smartphones but recently also banned the internet-connected television.She and her husband, who runs a decorative concrete company, keep their children away from cellphones but found that even a little exposure to screen time changed the boys\u2019 behavior. Her older son, who has A.D.H.D., would get angry when the screen had to be turned off, she said, which worried her.His Christmas wish list was a Wii, a PlayStation, a Nintendo, a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.\u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Kiddo, you\u2019re not gonna get one of those things,\u2019\u201d Ms. Brownsberger said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the mean mom.\u201d\u201cIt takes a community to support this,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I was just talking to my neighbor last night \u2014 \u2018Am I the worst mom ever?\u2019\u201dMs. Boan has three pilots running with about 40 parents in each, looking at best practices for getting kids off phones and screens. Overland Park\u2019s Chamber of Commerce is supporting the work, and the city is working to incorporate elements of digital wellness into its new strategic vision.In Silicon Valley, some feel anxious about the growing class divide they see around screen-time. Kirstin Stecher and her husband, who works as an engineer at Facebook, are raising their kids almost completely screen-free.\u201cIs this coming from a place of information \u2014 like, we know a lot about these screens,\u201d she said. \u201cOr is it coming from a place of privilege, that we don\u2019t need them as badly?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a message out there that your child is going to be crippled and in a different dimension if they\u2019re not on the screen,\u201d said Pierre Laurent, a former Microsoft and Intel executive now on the board of trustees at Silicon Valley\u2019s Waldorf School. \u201cThat message doesn\u2019t play as well in this part of the world.\u201d \u201cPeople in this region of the world understand that the real thing is everything that\u2019s happening around big data, AI, and that is not something that you\u2019re going to be particularly good at because you have a cellphone in fourth grade,\u201d Mr. Laurent said.Dr. Freed, though, argues these tools are too relied upon in schools for low-income children. And he sees the divide every day as he meets tech-addicted children of middle and low-income families. \u201cFor a lot of kids in Antioch, those schools don\u2019t have the resources for extracurricular activities, and their parents can\u2019t afford nannies,\u201d Dr. Freed said. He said the knowledge gap around tech\u2019s danger is enormous.\u201cOnce it sinks its teeth into these kids, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d Dr. Freed said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Four Thousand Miles for the W\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "Not long ago, the Seattle Seahawks looked like a budding dynasty. With the franchise trying to rebuild on the fly, a trip to London came at the worst possible time. Or was it the best?The N.F.L. told the Seattle Seahawks last winter that they would face the Raiders in London on Oct. 14.Back then, months before the rest of the 2018 schedule came out, the Seahawks could never have anticipated that last weekend\u2019s trip to London would come at a pivotal juncture for the franchise: Their record stood at 2-3 after a tough loss to the Los Angeles Rams.Then it was time to spread the gospel of American football overseas. Instead of heading about 670 miles south to Oakland, Calif., the Seahawks would fly nearly 5,000 miles to England, eight time zones away.Sending an N.F.L. team overseas is a herculean venture. Players need passports, the equipment staff sends supplies months in advance, the travel director has to navigate an unfamiliar airport and hotel, and the trainers will often modify the players\u2019 diet and sleep regimens. Then there is the equipment, some 21,000 pounds of it, that must be transported.Maybe, with pressure mounting, a venture far away was exactly what this franchise needed.The Seahawks, who had a home game the Sunday before they left for London, practiced the next Tuesday and Wednesday, then left for London on Wednesday night, accompanied by a New York Times reporter and photographer.In the locker room, the mood was loose. Cornerback Neiko Thorpe challenged all comers in table tennis. At his locker, he had a Nintendo Switch gaming console that he was taking on the trip.\u201cHe was who he was, and I think that speaks more volumes about the fun or the type of person that he was that he brought to this locker room more so than anything,\u201d receiver Doug Baldwin said.Their warm comments were a reminder of how difficult it is to keep winning teams together in the N.F.L. The Seahawks were poised to win their second consecutive Super Bowl when, with the ball near the goal line, they opted to pass instead of hand off the ball to Lynch. The interception and loss that followed, against the New England Patriots, halted any talk of a dynasty and left some players, including Lynch, bitter.Now they had to defeat Lynch.They boarded a chartered Airbus A340-600 that included 45 sleeping pods in first class for the veteran players. Coach Pete Carroll sat in the first row of business class along with other coaches. Rookies and members of the practice squad sat behind them. About half the 170 passengers sat in coach, which was filled with giddy chatter before takeoff. The menu was the same for everyone: beef filet, Cajun chicken or herb roasted salmon.For this trip, Ramsden reversed the program: He told players to sleep as much as possible on the flight so when they arrived in London on Thursday afternoon, they would have enough energy to stay up until 9 or 10 p.m. and then get a full night\u2019s rest.\u201cWe try to protect their circadian rhythms as much as possible,\u201d Ramsden said.Ramsden\u2019s staff prepared sleep kits for \u201cmental alertness.\u201d They included blackout eye masks. Some players took melatonin or Ambien, while others used earbuds that played the sounds of wind and rushing water to induce sleep.A few people slept on the floor or were splayed across a row of seats. Wagner watched game video on his iPad. A half-dozen others, including the twins Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, played the card game Spades in the bar area in first class. They trash-talked, laughed and threw $20 bills to the winners. They seemed unaware that Carroll, who tries to give his players room to be themselves, was sleeping in a seat a few feet away.The urgency of the moment seemed intangible \u2014 and maybe that was the point.The players and coaches rolled off the plane on Thursday about 1:30 p.m. Some players struggled to stay awake, like defensive end Frank Clark, who draped his thick coat over his head.Buses took them to the Grove, a resort in Watford, north of London, that features grass tennis courts and a golf course.It has plenty of amenities, but nothing was left to chance. The team shipped 1,150 rolls of athletic tape, two tons of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 pairs of shoes and 240 pairs of socks. In all, the Seahawks had shipped 21,000 pounds of gear and products worth $770,000. Some items \u2014 toiletries, snacks, bottled water, Gorilla Glue, lighters (to burn off loose threads) and cayenne pepper, which when mixed with talcum powder keeps players\u2019 feet warm \u2014 were ordered from the Amazon U.K. website.In the evening, the players let off some steam at a Topgolf facility. Broken into groups of four, they tried to hit balls into giant holes to score points, and took grief every time they were wildly off target.\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Wagner yelled at Austin Calitro, another linebacker.Thorpe, a cornerback, dug into a pile of chicken wings and posted videos on social media. \u201cThis is how I imagined it,\u201d he said of the team\u2019s first day in England.Wilson was in the first booth and seemed to be taking his swings seriously as the three veteran offensive linemen who sat with him checked their cellphones.Then, finally, it was time to return to the hotel, for smoothies, bottles of water and sleep.After several hours of meetings and a practice, some veterans left on a coach bus for Covent Garden and their only chance to see central London. Another bus took about a dozen younger players, with money in their pockets and no family in tow, to Watford Junction station, where they rode the train into London.At a loss where to go, a few English rugby players, who watched the Seahawks practice that day, helped them find Nike Town at Oxford Circus.At the front of the store, mannequins dressed in Seahawks gear stood next to racks of N.F.L. jerseys and shirts. \u201cMan, there\u2019s a lot of Patriots stuff here,\u201d Azeem Victor, a linebacker on the practice squad, said. As he looked for a soccer jersey, two shoppers separately asked him for help, assuming he worked there.Italian tourists asked to take photographs with the players, which made Rashaad Penny, a rookie running back, feel like a rock star. He soon video-chatted with somebody to describe what had happened.Penny and the other players were enjoying the chance to get away from the endless meetings and practices, and the expectations of their coaches and veterans. Lavon Coleman, another running back, stood wide-eyed in the street as people streamed past. He asked strangers for directions and food recommendations. He posed for pictures with Raiders fans from Denmark.\u201cI like that I can be myself,\u201d he said.A group of players went looking for food, but didn\u2019t seem interested in challenging their taste buds. They ended up at a Shake Shack. Linemen Jordan Roos and Elijah Nkansah went to a pub. Surprised by how warm their pints of Guinness were, they went to another pub and ordered lagers that were chilled to their satisfaction. Several more pints were consumed before, with the clock ticking toward the midnight curfew, they made their way to Euston station. There, they bumped into Brett Hundley, the backup quarterback, and several others. The players filled half a train car and compared notes on their first glimpses of London on a commuter train back to Watford Junction.Carroll takes his players to the stadium the day before a road game so they can visualize conditions ahead of time. At 1:30 p.m., the Seahawks drove to Wembley, where they saw the locker room, which had been set up with their gear, and the field, the most famous soccer pitch in England. Worried about the slickness of the grass, Erik Kennedy, the equipment manager, had longer screw-in cleats available for the players.Carroll and the team returned to the Grove around 4 p.m. Wilson, Wagner, Baldwin and a few other players got ready to meet two dozen fans in a session that was broadcast on Facebook Live.In the green room beforehand, the players signed footballs and helmets. Wilson, mindful of his public image, asked a producer if there was anything to worry about. He was assured that the talk was in front of friendly fans.At the event, Baldwin did not sugarcoat his description of the team, even in front of his coach.\u201cPete wouldn\u2019t want to call it this, but it\u2019s a retooling, a process we\u2019re all going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a great job of bringing the young guys along, of establishing what our culture is again, re-establishing it so the young guys can buy into it. It\u2019s been a difficult process but I think, moving forward, we\u2019re going to be really good.\u201dN.F.L. players do whatever they can to relax in the early hours on game day.Some Seahawks packed, others looked at yet more video.D.J. Fluker, the team\u2019s enormous guard, found solace in the players\u2019 lounge, where he sat alone playing the Madden football video game. Fluker, who filled his roster with current and former stars like Antonio Brown and Ronnie Lott, played a virtual foe. He flicked through offensive formations, which he said were similar to those in N.F.L. playbooks. He liked the distraction.\u201cIt takes away my anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I think about football too much, I\u2019ll get antsy. You can be overprepared.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to worry. From the opening whistle of the game, the Seahawks seemed to have every advantage. The meticulous planning, the sleep kits, the choreographed downtime and maybe even the pints of Guinness seemed to help steady the players at a fragile moment. Or maybe they were just better.The defense stifled Lynch, the Raiders running back, while Wilson effortlessly led the Seahawks\u2019 offense up and down the field. Final score: 27-3.As the Seahawks piled back into their locker room, now 3-3 and brimming with confidence, one player yelled, \u201cFour thousand miles for the dub,\u201d a reference to a W, a win.Inside the locker room, before the news media were allowed in, the players were screaming and slapping shoulders. Rainn Wilson, an actor on the television comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d and a big Seahawks fan, was brought in to address the rowdy players. \u201cThat was Seahawks football today,\u201d he yelled as players whooped it up.Then Carroll, his voice hoarse, thanked the staff that organized the trip, \u201cthe whole thing.\u201dAt 1:30 a.m., the Seahawks departed Gatwick Airport. Coleman, sitting in economy class, collected piles of pillows and built a bed on the floor in front of an emergency exit.The flight home was far quieter than the one to London. The staff worked overtime during the four-day trip and many of them were asleep before takeoff. Exhausted after three hours of high-powered football, the players lumbered into their pods.Nearly 10 hours later, the plane landed in Seattle. Carroll spoke over the plane\u2019s intercom, announcing a day off for everyone who did not need to see the training staff. Cheers erupted.He called it a \u201cgreat week,\u201d and then said, \u201cTo everybody, thanks a lot, appreciate ya, love ya, bye.\u201dThe bliss lasted roughly 12 hours. In midafternoon, word spread that Allen, the team\u2019s owner and a co-founder of Microsoft, had died.In football and in life, even the best trips come to an end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Scientific Notebook, the Mind of a Genius at Work", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 As fascinating as Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s musings on the nature of the world and what makes it tick are, the intellectual and visual denseness of his treatises \u2014 which embrace a wide array of his interests, from mechanics to botany, engineering, mathematics, architecture and more \u2014 don\u2019t always translate into captivating shows.It\u2019s one thing to pore over a page of Leonardo\u2019s experiments on the ratio of the volume of steam to water, quite another to see his reflections come to life in animated form. That is the case, here, of his ruminations on the flight of birds, the luminosity of the moon, or the unbounded nature of water, which is the main object of Leonardo\u2019s scrutiny.The \u201cCodex Leicester,\u201d named after an 18th-century owner, Thomas Coke, earl of Leicester, is a compendium of ideas and investigations, and the expository panels are a refrain of firsts: an instrument that anticipated the modern odometer; observations on the speed of river flows, and detailed descriptions of waves and their impact; and a device to stay underwater for a long time, which Leonardo did not describe in detail \u201cbecause of the evil nature of men,\u201d who might use it to sink enemy ships and cause deaths, he wrote. One note Leonardo wrote to himself reads \u201cMake eyeglasses to see the moon larger.\u201d The first known record of a telescope came around a century later.As usual, Leonardo\u2019s musings were written backward, starting from the right side of the page and moving to the left, so that the words appeared normal only when seen with a mirror. Theories abound about why he did this: One simple explanation is that he was left-handed, and that writing this way didn\u2019t smudge.Next year is the 500th anniversary of Leonardo\u2019s death, as well as the 25th anniversary of Mr. Gates\u2019 ownership of the manuscript. \u201cWe felt the codex needed to be part of the picture,\u201d said Fred Schroeder, the curator of the \u201cCodex Leicester\u201d for Mr. Gates, and as homecomings go, Florence was the logical site for that celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for the codex to pay visit to its birthplace,\u201d Mr. Schroeder said.The exhibition\u2019s \u201cmoral mission,\u201d Mr. Galluzzi added, is to \u201cfaithfully relate his work,\u201d and not misinterpret or force the artist\u2019s vision \u201cto make Leonardo the pioneer of everything.\u201dThough his notebooks contain countless inventions and intuitions that came to life only centuries later, the exhibition seeks to put them into context, \u201cexpress his thought correctly.\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean diminishing his work,\u201d Mr. Galluzzi said, \u201cit means enhancing it.\u201dWith its three paintings by Leonardo that amply illustrate his \u201cscientific observations on water,\u201d the Uffizi was the \u201cright place for the exhibition,\u201d the gallery\u2019s director, Eike Schmidt, said in an interview.He described the \u201cBaptism of Christ,\u201d a joint effort by Leonardo and his teacher Andrea del Verrocchio, where the ripples of water around the feet of Christ and John the Baptist \u201cfully show Leonardo\u2019s scientific mind.\u201d Water in its various manifestations is also detailed in Leonardo\u2019s \u201cAnnunciation\u201d and in the preparatory drawing for the \u201cAdoration of the Magi,\u201d exhibited again this year after a five-year restoration.\u201cLeonardo couldn\u2019t have painted as he did without his scientific observation of nature,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. The presence here of the \u201cCodex Leicester,\u201d which is exhibited with pages from other Leonardo treatises, like the \u201cCodex Atlanticus,\u201d the \u201cCodex Arundel\u201d and the \u201cCodex of the Flight of Birds,\u201d \u201cis an opportunity for visitors to see his writings in conjunction with the three paintings,\u201d he said.Sections of the Leicester manuscripts subvert the Christian worldview of the time, rooted in Genesis, the first book of the Bible, which held that God created the world and humans just a few thousand years beforeLeonardo\u2019s observations of fossils begged to differ. \u201cPart of the \u2018Codex Leicester\u2019 is dedicated to a not explicit but clear polemic with Genesis,\u201d said Mr. Galluzzi, in particular with the question \u201cof the Great Flood.\u201d Leonardo\u2019s observations of fossils and geological stratification had convinced him that the world was much, much older than the Bible suggested.Had he published his considerations, he would undoubtedly have run afoul of the church, \u201cinstead these were jottings he kept in his pocket,\u201d Mr. Galluzzi said.Leonardo\u2019s gloomy predictions for the future of the planet appear more prophetic in the age of climate change.He contemplated that water would eventually erode mountains, submerging the entire planet under water. \u201cAnd this would be the end of all terrestrial creatures, those are his words,\u201d Mr. Galluzzi said. \u201cHe thinks that as life began, so it could end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Shouldn\u2019t Use Facebook to Log In to Other Sites", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI\u2019m going to quit using Facebook to log in to apps and sites online. You should, too.But the mere possibility is highly troubling \u2014 and if the hack allowed access to any other sites, Facebook should be disqualified from acting as your sign-on service.This is a classic you-had-one-job situation. Like a trusty superintendent in a Brooklyn walk-up, Facebook offered to carry keys for every lock online. The arrangement was convenient \u2014 the super was always right there, at the push of a button. It was also more secure than creating and remembering dozens of passwords for different sites. Facebook had a financial and reputational incentive to hire the best security people to protect your keys; tons of small sites online don\u2019t \u2014 and if they got hacked and if you reused your passwords elsewhere, you were hosed.But the extensive hack vaporizes those arguments. If the entity with which you trusted your keys loses your keys, you take your keys elsewhere. And there are many more-secure and just-as-convenient ways to sign on to things online.If for some reason you don\u2019t want to use a password manager, you can use another tech giant\u2019s sign-on service. When presented with different ways to sign on to sites, you can choose Google or Microsoft instead of Facebook.Yes, it\u2019s possible those companies could be hacked one day, too. After all, Yahoo was hacked, as was LinkedIn, as was Equifax. But at this moment, a sign-on service by Google or Microsoft has one big advantage over Facebook\u2019s: Those companies did not lose control of 50 million people\u2019s accounts, and Facebook did.Mr. Polakis allowed that there are tremendous convenience benefits and even some security benefits to a single sign-on. \u201cObviously, big companies like Facebook and Google have amazing engineers, and their security practices are generally ahead of the curve compared to other, smaller websites,\u201d he said.But no company, not even one as big and wealthy as Facebook or Google, can guarantee perfect security.And in some ways, Mr. Polakis said, Facebook\u2019s size and complexity work against its security. The Facebook hack, for instance, seems to have been caused by three different bugs acting in concert.\u201cThe codebase of these services is massive,\u201d Mr. Polakis said. \u201cYou have different teams working on different components, and they can interplay in different ways, and you can have a crazy hack that no one expects.\u201dThe other danger to signing on to everything with Facebook is the threat of phishing. Even if millions of Facebook accounts hadn\u2019t been hacked, people\u2019s individual accounts are hacked all the time through online trickery. Single sign-on compounds the damage \u2014 whoever hacks your Facebook account gets access to everything else you tied to Facebook.Why is a password manager a better way to protect yourself than signing on through a big platform? Password managers can also be hacked, Mr. Polakis said, but \u201ccompared to massive platforms that have millions of different lines of codes and different functionalities, a password manager has one specific job, and so it minimizes the chances of something going wrong.\u201dI asked Facebook for a counterargument to stop using it for signing on. A spokesman said Facebook\u2019s sign-on was still more secure than the weak passwords that people create and reuse for everything.That\u2019s not a bad point. Password managers aren\u2019t as convenient to use as Facebook\u2019s button; if people respond to the Facebook hack by rolling their own passwords instead of using Facebook, that may be worse for everyone.I don\u2019t argue otherwise. I believe Facebook is taking this seriously. At some point, maybe, Facebook will regain my trust enough to handle my digital keys.But it will do so only if there\u2019s some cost to losing them. For now, that cost is: When I see the blue Facebook button offering an easy way to sign up for this or that digital doodad, I\u2019m not tapping it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In August, amid a leadership shakeup, the Australian government blocked Huawei, a Chinese company whose technology underpins mobile broadband for about half of all Australians, from building the country\u2019s future 5G networks.The ban was made under the pretext of protecting national security, yet there is no evidence that Huawei gear is insecure. Because it is headquartered in China, Huawei has undergone more scrutiny than any other ICT supplier in the world. In several markets, including the U.K., its source code is reviewed by independent security experts. In the 31 years since Huawei\u2019s founding, no public evidence of wrongdoing has ever come to light. Canberra\u2019s decision to ban the company was purely political.Australian citizens will be paying for that decision for decades to come. 5G will form the basis of future broadband networks. By keeping a leading 5G provider out of its market, Australia has reduced the country\u2019s supply of telecommunications infrastructure just as demand for 5G is starting to grow. Basic economics dictates that when supply drops, costs rise. Perhaps that is why Americans live with the second-highest prices in the world for mobile phone services. In the United States, 90 percent of wireless infrastructure sales are made by just two companies, Ericsson and Nokia. Meanwhile, the quality of U.S. mobile service measured by download speeds is ranked 61st in the world, after Chile, Egypt and Peru.National security obviously takes precedence over download speeds. But if security is the goal, banning telecom suppliers on the basis of geographic origin makes no sense. Today\u2019s telecommunications industry is transnational and borderless. Threats can originate anywhere. Programmable code can be implanted virtually in hardware and software, allowing malicious actors to spy or launch a cyberattack. Unauthorized functionality can compromise the product of any company, anywhere in the world.While no evidence exists that Huawei has been compromised by the Chinese government or any other actors, the United States, by contrast, has a long track record of modifying products to achieve its goals. From the 1940s until the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) rigged encryption systems sold by Crypto AG, a Swiss company, enabling the agency to read the coded diplomatic and military traffic of more than 120 countries. Later that decade, it reduced the level of security in non-U.S. versions of internet browsers and email programs made by Lotus Notes, Netscape and Microsoft to make files encrypted with those programs easy to decrypt. More recently, the NSA intercepted Cisco routers and covertly installed spyware on them before they were shipped to customers. The agency\u2019s ongoing Bullrun program places back doors into commercially available cryptographic software and hardware, or weakens the encryption so that the NSA can break the code. Australia\u2019s government does not trust Huawei, or China, or any Chinese company. Nor should they \u2014 in the digital domain, no one should be trusted. Negotiating arms treaties with the Soviet Union, former U.S. President Ronald Regan said that the best approach was to \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d Today, smart governments will dispense with trust and proceed straight to verification. Instead of pointlessly banning individual companies, they will establish comprehensive risk-mitigation procedures based on global best practices. These include hiring independent security experts to review source code and monitoring supply chains for breaches. Any other approach creates an illusion of security that actually increases risk. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Will One State Go It Alone to Make Polluters Pay?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProponents say Washington State is a good place to try out carbon reduction ideas because it has abundant hydropower and a waning reliance on fossil fuels. The coal-fired power plant near Centralia, Wash., is scheduled to start shutting down in the next few years.CENTRALIA, Wash. \u2014 The last coal mine in Washington State closed down about a decade ago in Centralia, about 65 miles south of Seattle, leaving scars on the land and the local economy. Now, a solar electricity project \u2014 perhaps the largest in the state \u2014 is planned for the same location, by the same company that once ran the mine.Bob Guenther sees that as a sign that the struggling stretch of Washington State where he has lived most of his life can find a new way forward.\u201cThat\u2019s the vision, a clean energy hub,\u201d said Mr. Guenther, 74, who worked for three decades at a coal-fired power plant in Centralia that is scheduled to start shutting down in a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new economy, and we\u2019re going to have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and do everything we can to get it.\u201dOne piece of that transformation, Mr. Guenther said, will be decided on Election Day by people across the state, who will vote on whether to charge companies and utilities for their carbon emissions. The proposed carbon fees, aimed at curbing climate change by making the burning of fossil fuels more expensive, would be the first such state initiative in the nation, and other states are closely watching the election outcome.Opponents like Gary Stamper, a county commissioner and former school principal, said he feared that the rural area around Centralia would see little of the financial benefit from the fees the state collects, while the companies that pay the fees would pass the extra costs along to residents. That would be hard on Centralia, which is still trying to recover from the coal mine closure in 2006 and the national recession that followed.\u201cIt would hurt my constituents,\u201d Mr. Stamper said, adding that the last thing this region needs are more economic challenges: \u201cNot that I\u2019m not supporting clean air or clean water and all the things that go along with it, but it seems to me we\u2019re going to bear the brunt.\u201dIf the initiative passes, the fees would start at $15 for each ton of gases produced in fossil-fuel combustion, and would rise over time. Some major industries, like aviation, would be exempt, but even so, the fees would still be expected to raise $2.3 billion in the first five years.A previous carbon-pricing effort was defeated by Washington voters in 2016, and a plan by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to pass a carbon pricing system through the Legislature died earlier this year without a vote. Shaping those debates was Washington\u2019s defining political tension, between liberal-leaning residents of the economically booming Puget Sound area near Seattle and the more conservative, less prosperous rural areas to the east and south.This time around, there are notable differences. The earlier efforts called for carbon taxes; this year\u2019s version is technically not a tax but a fee, which may sound more palatable to voters. Unlike tax receipts, which legislators could get their hands on to use for other purposes, the fee revenue would have be spent on efforts like carbon and pollution reduction and forest health programs under a specified formula.Some environmental groups opposed the previous ballot measure because it also would have lowered other taxes, meaning that the state would not have netted much new revenue for climate or energy projects.If the carbon fee initiative passes, the investments it would finance could include anything from energy efficiency upgrades to electrified transit projects. Aid to low-income residents and to workers who are displaced from fossil-fuel industries are built into the measure as well.Washington starts the conversation about energy at a different place than any other state in the nation. By virtue of the region\u2019s topography, hydrology and the engineering feats of the federal dam builders who began remaking the Columbia River basin in the 1930s, the energy debate in the Pacific Northwest is distinct.Large-scale power production from the dams \u2014 more than twice as much as Oregon, the No. 2 state for hydropower output \u2014 means that Washington already emits less carbon dioxide for each unit of energy it produces than any other state, according to federal figures. What\u2019s more, the Pacific Northwest has little oil or gas to drill for or fight over, and the region\u2019s coal deposits have played out or become uneconomical.Supporters of a carbon fee say the state\u2019s extensive base of renewable, nonpolluting energy makes it the perfect laboratory to test efforts like this, because the economic impact would be less dramatic than in big coal states like West Virginia or Kentucky.Opponents say the state\u2019s unusual characteristics and the way the ballot measure is structured will make the carbon fee unfair and unlikely to have an impact on air quality or climate change. Consumers could pay higher costs, they say, and some industries will be hit far harder than others because of the exemptions. Among those who would receive exemptions is TransAlta, which owns the soon-to-close coal-fired power plant in Centralia as well as the old coal mine where the new solar installation is planned.The pain of a long economic downturn, though, runs deep. Unemployment remains higher in Lewis County, which includes Centralia, than the state average, and wages there are lower.Not long ago, TransAlta donated 1,000 acres of land to go toward new economic development. But the industrial park planned for that land is empty so far, home to elk, geese and an occasional wandering bear. Some potential tenants have expressed hesitancy to make a commitment until the carbon-fee question is answered at the ballot box, said Allyn Roe, the industrial park\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cThe uncertainty is not helping,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, does not have any independent policymaking authority, making the costly race even more peculiar.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Why Facebook Broke Its Revenue Growth", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe social network reported slowing revenue growth in its quarterly earnings yesterday \u2014 and said that would probably be the new normal.Facebook does not charge as much for advertisers to run ads on \u201cStories\u201d as it does in the News Feed, so shifting to ephemeral messaging may not be as lucrative, the company said. That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association. FedEx said it wasn\u2019t a response to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, but because the partnership didn\u2019t bring in enough business.The company had faced pressure from gun-control activists to end the program, in particular after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February. At the time, companies including Delta, United Airlines, MetLife and several car-rental outlets dropped deals with the N.R.A.But FedEx had refused to do so. In February, the company said that while it opposed civilian ownership of assault rifles, it \u201cdoes not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.\u201dA single number could unsettle China\u2019s economy in the coming weeks. If Beijing lets the renminbi\u2019s value weaken past 7 to the dollar, it could intensify a trade battle with the U.S. \u2014 bringing benefits, but the risk of damage, too.Many employees at Google have expressed anger and disappointment about the way the company has handled cases of sexual misconduct, and more than 1,000 plan to walk out of the company\u2019s offices tomorrow in protest.Not part of the agreement: the U.S., as President Trump withdrew from negotiations nearly two years ago, saying that TPP would be a bad deal for America.

As suburbs stretch out with their larger lawns and malls, the map grows lighter. Your eye can follow the ways that development conforms to landscape features like water and slopes.You can read history in the transition from curving, paved-over cow paths in old downtowns to suburban sprawl; you can detect signals of wealth and poverty, sometimes almost next door to each other.

Strong earnings from companies like Twitter and Microsoft seemed to ease some worries of investors, who have been focused on issues like the trade war with China, rising interest rates and the midterms.The stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage. The stock market looks forward, not back \u2014 share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.Some key points from the WSJ\u2019s Shalini Ramachandran and Joe Flint:\u2022 \u201cEmployees are encouraged to give one another blunt feedback. Managers are all told to apply a \u2018keeper test\u2019 to their staff \u2014 asking themselves whether they would fight to keep a given employee \u2014 a mantra for firing people who don\u2019t fit the culture and ensuring only the strongest survive.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe firings can be insensitive, several former employees said.

The emails about firings can reach hundreds of employees across multiple divisions and can be painfully specific, calling out an employee\u2019s flaws, while inviting more questions and gossip, many employees say.\u201dProminent Western business executives like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Larry Fink of BlackRock abandoned this week\u2019s big Saudi investment conference, and the crowd was mostly made up of lower-profile Russian, Asian and Arab attendees. And the scandal may reduce Prince Mohammed\u2019s ability to work with international investors while finding new places to invest his country\u2019s wealth abroad.As Denis Florin of the consultancy Lavoisier Conseil told the NYT, \u201cPractically, is this going to delay M.B.S.\u2019s ambitions? Yes. Is it going to wreck them? No.\u201dTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be watching closely.

{"Headline": "Bulletin Board", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA collection of views, news and more from the Learning section.For many college students, the library is a place to hole up and finish a paper or to gather an armful of books from the stacks. But for 40 undergraduates in Brooklyn, their college is the library.Since January, Bard College has given students often overlooked by higher education \u2014 military veterans, working parents, young people aging out of foster care \u2014 the chance to earn an associate degree, for free, at the Brooklyn Public Library on Grand Army Plaza. It\u2019s the latest \u201cmicrocollege\u201d from Bard, which started a college-in-prison initiative in 1999 and a program for student mothers in 2016.One of the first to apply to the new program was a library security guard.Inside the grand, Art Deco-influenced library, students study rhetoric and sociology, Antigone and anthropology. Classes run from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., taught by a mix of Bard professors and scholars hired for the program. To critics who argue that the liberal arts are for dilettantes, Max Kenner, a Bard vice president, says, \u201cThere is no education for a successful career in the 21st century better than a liberal education.\u201dPurvis Thompson wasn\u2019t so sure at first. The 39-year-old former waiter dropped out of Dillard University nearly 20 years ago because he could not afford it. In thinking about refocusing his career, he considered a community college in Queens before rolling the dice on Bard.Because you cannot do homework or activities during a REM cycle, some students view getting an appropriate amount of shut-eye as slacking off.They think, \u201cYou must not be involved enough, you must not be studying hard enough, you must not be active enough to have enough time to get that much sleep,\u201d said Janet Lewis Muth, director of health promotion at Carleton College in Minnesota.To enable students to shift their circadian rhythms, Ms. Muth\u2019s department provides tools, such as light boxes, to help students get drowsy and wake up at the right times. The department also offers ear plugs and sleep masks.Good news, aspiring astronauts: You no longer need years of training to participate in a mission to space. Students can experience what it is like to be in a NASA Mission Control Center by visiting one of 43 Challenger Learning Centers around the world.The centers schedule two-hour visits for 160,000 young people each year. Students take over simulated Mission Control rooms, acting as NASA personnel, astronauts and engineers. They manipulate real dashboard equipment to solve emergencies and complete missions.The centers, which serve 26 states and four countries, offer a way to stimulate students\u2019 interest in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. They are run by a partnership that includes NASA and the Education Department.Lance Bush, president and chief executive of Challenger Center, says the organization has programs for all ages but focuses particularly on engaging students in middle school, which is the stage at which research shows many students turn their backs on STEM.\u201cToo many students are losing interest in these crucial STEM subjects at a really early age,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cTo succeed in this rapidly changing world, students need exposure to these fields.\u201dAnayya Davis finds the heart to be the most surprising thing about the human body. Last year the sixth-grader at Ebeling Elementary School in Macomb Township, Mich., about 30 miles north of Detroit, got to look inside a heart.Virtually, of course.Anayya\u2019s school has a virtual reality lab. With a pair of glasses and a stylus, and using a program called zSpace, she could move organs, take them out of the body, see how they function and then put them back. The virtual tour followed a more traditional introduction to human anatomy, but she said reading about the body was not as helpful because books offer only explanations.\u201cIn zSpace, you can see it up close and take it apart,\u201d Anayya said.Her classmate Andrew Ciacchella said the lab was \u201clike being a surgeon, but on a computer.\u201dEbeling got its virtual reality lab four years ago; children in third through sixth grades visit weekly to supplement science classes in ways that were not possible before. To learn about how environmental factors affect animal habitats, for example, students can change the pH level in a virtual pond and see the consequences as fish and frogs thrive or die.While a number of schools offer virtual reality \u201cfield trips\u201d that let students see places they would likely never see otherwise, Ebeling\u2019s lab is rare.And the novelty is not lost on the students.Many schools lend students laptops or tablets to take home each day. Parents with memories of computer labs and backpacks full of books might not know what to ask when their child is issued a sleek, school-supplied device. Here is a guide.Are students consuming or creating?In today\u2019s world, it is no longer enough to find information and recite it. Ask teachers and your children what they do with their computers. Are they passively watching YouTube tutorials? Filling out electronic quizzes? Or are they using the devices to create something to demonstrate what they are learning?What does the school monitor?Assume that there is no privacy on a school-owned device. Digital monitoring systems probably track everything students type into a computer, including the websites they visit, said Douglas A. Levin, a school security expert. \u201cDifferent school communities may have different viewpoints on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be a secret.\u201dWho is responsible for damages?When a child gets a computer worth several hundred dollars, parents are right to worry about who will be responsible if it is lost, stolen or broken. Ask to see a school district policy.What student data is collected?The F.B.I. recently released a security warning about third-party apps and programs used by schools. Parents should ask what data teachers upload into educational apps and what schools are doing to safeguard student information.How will students take notes?What app or website do you use to help you with your schoolwork?Grand Canyon University, 40, class of 2020App: SpeechifyAbout: Instantly convert written text to an audio file\u201cIt allows me to listen to my nightly reading while commuting to and from school.\u201dColumbia University, 19, class of 2021APP: NotabilityAbout: Import documents and take notes directly on them\u201cNotability can even compete with Microsoft One Note in its ease of use, accessibility to notes, and versatility.\u201dColumbia University, 22, class of 2019App: NotabilityAbout: Import documents and take notes directly on them\u201cIf you take a note/highlight while recording, the app allows you to go to the exact recorded moment when you click on your note.\u201dUniversity of Massachusetts Boston, 31, class of 2020Website: Khan AcademyAbout: Online tutoring via short YouTube videos\u201cThe narrator\u2019s voice and cadence are perfect for keeping pace, and Khan\u2019s explanations only rarely leave me with questions.\u201dUniversity of California Berkeley, 18, class of 2022Website: WordReferenceAbout: Combined online dictionary and translator\u201cIt is really helpful for language classes because it\u2019s a dictionary that also gives you examples for what a word might mean in a given context.\u201dNorthwestern University, 20, class of 2021 Website: Stack OverflowAbout: Computer programming question-and-answer forumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Is Teaching Children How to Act Online. Is It the Best Role Model? ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant is positioning itself in schools as a trusted authority on digital citizenship at a moment when the company\u2019s data-handling practices are under growing scrutiny.Google is on a mission to teach children how to be safe online. That is the message behind \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d a so-called digital-citizenship education program that the technology giant developed for schools.Among other things, these critics argue, the company\u2019s lessons give children the mistaken impression that the main threat they face online is from malicious hackers and bullies, glossing over the privacy concerns that arise when tech giants like Google itself collect users\u2019 personal information and track their actions online.As an analysis of Google\u2019s curriculum published in Emerging Library & Information Perspectives, a graduate student journal at Western University in Ontario, put it, \u201c\u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 generally presents Google as impartial and trustworthy, which is especially problematic given that the target audience is impressionable youth.\u201dJim Accomando, the president of the National P.T.A., said that the organization \u201cdoes not endorse any commercial product or service,\u201d although companies that give money to the group may receive \u201cpromotional consideration.\u201d\u201cGoogle is a great example of a partner that aligns with our goals, and they have deep tech knowledge that they bring to the table,\u201d he said.The cartoon game, Interland, offers an animated world \u201cpresented by Google.\u201d In it, children navigate spammers and hackers in \u201cReality River\u201d and consider who in their social network can see what they post online on \u201cMindful Mountain.\u201dThe game, which comes with a lesson plan and classroom activities, is meant to teach children \u201cthe fundamentals of digital citizenship and safety so they can explore the online world with confidence,\u201d according to Google\u2019s site description. Once students learn skills like how to create strong passwords and not share information with strangers, the program encourages them to be \u201cfearless\u201d online explorers.Kerry Gallagher, an assistant principal at St. John\u2019s Preparatory School in Danvers, Mass., said Google\u2019s program helped students learn concrete ways to be safer and kinder online.\u201cRather than being a bystander, they feel as though they have the skills to intervene\u201d when they observe other children being mean online, Ms. Gallagher said. She added that younger students also gained a \u201cbetter sense for who they should share things with and who they shouldn\u2019t, depending on what that content is.\u201dGoogle\u2019s name appears on every screen of Interland and the program\u2019s certificates, which also incorporate Google\u2019s colors. The curriculum features cartoon robots that resemble the company\u2019s Android robot icon. To some observers, the game is essentially a big ad for Google.David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit advocacy group, likened the program to asking Budweiser to talk to parents and children about underage drinking.\u201cThere is an increasing awareness of the fact that all these supposedly free platforms are not free and that all of us are being tracked and our information is really the commodity we\u2019re paying,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cThis seems like the wrong time to be pushing resources that tell kids to be brave and fearless on the internet without telling them to be cautious and without giving them the information they really need.\u201d\u201cWe are helping them become more knowledgeable about what the digital landscape is like,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said of his students, \u201cso they can make choices about what they use and what they don\u2019t use.\u201dMs. Yi of Google said the company was aware that multiple efforts were needed to help children learn to navigate the digital world. In addition to \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve also built products like Family Link, which lets parents supervise their kids\u2019 Google accounts; have hosted online safety school assemblies for years; and will continue to develop new tools and resources for kids, parents and educators.\u201dAmerican corporate giants are no strangers to the country\u2019s schools.\u201cThe best solution would be for this kind of training to be undertaken by an organization less invested in how consumers conceive of privacy on the internet,\u201d the authors of the journal article wrote. \u201cAt the very least, \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 should have significantly less Google branding.\u201d But even teachers like Mr. Hodgson, who uses Google tools with his students, are leery of the company\u2019s presence in schools.\u201cMaybe it has some good for the public if you use it in certain ways,\u201d he said of the \u201cBe Internet Awesome\u201d program.

{"Headline": "New Pixel Phones and Other Gadgets Keep Google in the Hardware Hunt", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough sales of its devices have been slow, the search giant unveiled the Pixel 3, a smart speaker with a built-in screen and a tablet that doubles as a PC. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For much of the last decade, Apple and Samsung have dominated sales of smartphones. So why would anyone bother trying to sell a new phone?The gadgets are Google\u2019s third wave since it started making consumer devices in 2016. The internet company has pushed these products as a way to showcase its prowess in areas like artificial intelligence and image processing.\u201cThere\u2019s some skepticism about how committed Google is,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Creative Strategies, a consumer electronics research firm. \u201cThey are still nowhere near where they need to be to make a dent in the industry.\u201dGoogle has said that hardware businesses rarely become overnight successes and that it remains focused on the long term. The company said it put more stock in indicators like high customer satisfaction in its effort to build a loyal base. Google doesn\u2019t break out revenue or profit for its hardware business.While the handset market is no longer growing as much as it did five years ago, the company wants Pixel to be a blockbuster and to set the bar for devices running Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system, said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware.\u201cIt is our objective to sell as many Pixel phones as we can,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re investing accordingly to be able to do that.\u201dHere\u2019s a closer look at Google\u2019s newest devices.Similar to the latest iPhones and Samsung phones, the new Pixel 3 phones, which will become available on Oct. 18, have glass bodies to support wireless power charging. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field to create voltage that powers the phone.Yet the screens are smaller than those of Pixel\u2019s competitors: The $799 model has a 5.5-inch screen, while the $899 model, the Pixel 3 XL, has a 6.3-inch screen. For comparison, Apple\u2019s new iPhone screens range from 5.8 to 6.5 inches diagonally, and the Samsung Galaxy screens measure 5.8 to 6.4 inches.The new Pixels also have a feature to make it easier to take good photos. The tool, Top Shot, captures a series of images when someone takes a photo; Google uses algorithms to recommend the best photo among the shots. Computers analyze millions of images to extrapolate the characteristics of a good photo, like smiles and clear faces. The analysis of the photos is done on the Pixel 3, not in Google\u2019s cloud; users will see a small chip icon marking the recommended photo. People can use the Home Hub\u2019s screen to watch videos and control smart home devices like security cameras. Notably, the Home Hub, unlike Amazon\u2019s smart screen products, lacks a camera for videoconferencing. Google said it had made that decision partly because of privacy concerns inside the home, especially bedrooms.The company\u2019s third new product, the Pixel Slate, is a convertible laptop, like a tablet with a removable keyboard similar to Microsoft\u2019s Surface.

Sometimes, the right reviewer is someone who has proven expertise in a given topic \u2014 a thriller author like Mr. King on another thriller author like Ms. French \u2014 or a neighboring topic. But a surprising pairing can be part of the magic, editors said: somebody who knows the subject matter or the themes well, but who is not \u201ctoo matchy-matchy,\u201d as Mr. Beckerman put it. In those cases, the writers might be competitors in their topic area, or the review might read as boring or insular.\u201cThe review itself should be something that informs and enlightens,\u201d said Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review. \u201cAbove all, we\u2019re looking for someone who can write an informative, authoritative, honest and engaging review\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s negative, positive or somewhere in between.Gregory Cowles, a senior editor for the Book Review, said that when he was an assigning editor, he \u201cwould sometimes just walk into a bookstore and kind of let my eyes rove over the shelves to see if anything jumped out at me that I hadn\u2019t thought of for a while.\u201d Pairing is not an easy aspect of the job, but for those who bring together the Book Review each week, it can be among the most rewarding. \u201cIt\u2019s been a magical job in terms of working with some of the people that I grew up reading,\u201d Mr. Cowles said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Stephen King, who, for a time during middle school, was the one person that I read.

{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading.

The Blazers got an unexpected boost from Nik Stauskas, who somehow managed to outshine James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, by scoring 24 points off the bench.The Lakers struggled with their outside shooting, finishing 7 of 30 from 3-point range.James arrived two-and-a-half hours before the game and went through a metal detector before entering the arena. (LeBron: Just like us.) He proceeded to embark on his usual pregame routine: the stretching and the shooting, along with all the mental preparation that has come to define his career nearly as much as the late-game dramatics and the championships.Lakers Coach Luke Walton has kept his team\u2019s goals this season close to the vest, and he did so again before Thursday\u2019s game \u2014 though he did acknowledge that he had talked to James about them. But that was about as far as Walton was willing to go.\u201cThat\u2019s nothing I\u2019m going to share with you guys,\u201d Walton told reporters. \u201cBut we\u2019ve talked.\u201dFew pundits expect the Lakers to vie for a championship this season. They are too young, their chemistry is too raw and the Western Conference is already loaded with contenders, a batch of heavyweights led by the Golden State Warriors, who are prohibitive favorites to win it all again.But James is a force, and he seemed to send a statement early in Thursday\u2019s opener. In about 9 minutes of playing time before he took his first breather, he collected 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting, 3 rebounds and an assist.But the rest of his night was full of challenges. He was called for his third foul with just over 6 minutes left in the second quarter and went to the bench. His absence could have been problematic for the Lakers, who were already trailing by double digits. But his teammates picked up the slack, and the Blazers led by just 2 at halftime.The Lakers missed their first 15 3-point attempts before Josh Hart, who was terrific for them the bench, connected from long range for an 85-83 lead late in the third quarter.But Portland was solid down the stretch behind their All-Star backcourt of Damian Lillard (28 points) and C.J. McCollum (21 points).Before the game, the Blazers honored Paul G. Allen, their longtime owner, with a moment of silence. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, died Monday from complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Earnings Surge, as Cloud Bet Continues to Pay Off", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Apple has its cash cow, the iPhone, which has made it the world\u2019s largest public company. Amazon transformed an array of industries, from logistics to the way consumers buy, to become the second largest. For Microsoft, which is gaining ground on Amazon, growth runs straight through the cloud.In the past several quarters, Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud offerings have grown by big leaps, helping push the company\u2019s market cap to about $785 billion. On Wednesday, the company reported that the fast growth had continued in the latest quarter, as part of an earnings statement that beat analyst expectations and the company\u2019s own guidance across every segment of its business.Microsoft\u2019s first-quarter revenue was up 19 percent over the previous year, to $29.1 billion. Net income rose 34 percent, to $8.8 billion.\u201cWe are seeing larger and longer-term customer commitments to the cloud,\u201d said Amy Hood, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Shares in the company rose as much as 4.6 percent in aftermarket trading, in response to the earnings. During market hours, shares had fallen more than 5 percent in a marketwide sell-off.\u201cIf you told an investor a few years ago that Microsoft is on the cusp of a $1 trillion market capitalization and could surpass Amazon, they\u2019d think you were crazy,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt speaks to how significant this cloud shift is, and what a strong hold Microsoft has on the cloud.\u201dWhen Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft largely depended on selling its Windows operating system on personal computers, even as smartphones were ascendant. He shifted the company to focus much more on its cloud computing business.The breakneck growth of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud offering, slowed more in the most recent quarter than some analysts had expected. It was up 76 percent, after several quarters of being up from 85 to 98 percent. And Azure may not even be profitable, said Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, as the company heavily invests engineering resources in new products and the construction of new data centers around the globe.But analysts and investors say the company is well positioned for the increasingly popular approach called \u201chybrid cloud,\u201d which lets enterprises, like companies or government agencies, use one set of tools to manage what they store both on their own servers and on shared space in the cloud.\u201cMicrosoft is unique in the sense that it has the ability to play in both environments,\u201d said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager in Seattle at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. \u201cLegacy customers are already working on Microsoft products, and it provides a level of continuity to transition to the cloud.\u201dIn a call with analysts, Mr. Nadella said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think of hybrid as some stopgap to move to the cloud,\u201d and that Microsoft was investing in building out its hybrid offerings.\u201cThis is a place where we are leading,\u201d he said.The company\u2019s year-over-year growth in server products and cloud services was 28 percent, which Ms. Hood said was a sign that the company was meeting customer demand. That makes it \u201cnot a challenging decision\u201d to invest heavily in the cloud business, she said. And the company has money to spend in part because the legacy Windows business is still lucrative.\u201cThey have been telegraphing that Azure\u2019s profitability is improving, and that is enough,\u201d Mr. Keirstead said. \u201cIt is probably the most amazing growth engine we have seen inside Microsoft since basically the origins of the Windows business.\u201dAnother key part of the cloud transition is how Microsoft moved its suite of Office programs from software to the cloud, called Office 365. The product\u2019s revenue was up 36 percent in the first quarter.\u201cIt\u2019s not as sexy Azure, but it\u2019s really important,\u201d said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cIt drives a lot of your profit.\u201dMr. Weiss said that once companies moved Office to the cloud, it was easier for Microsoft to sell them additional services, like video calls on Skype for Business or group chats on Microsoft Teams, a tool similar to the Slack messaging system.\u201cIf you can get someone to pay you 20 percent more by just switching on some functionality, that\u2019s great for you,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Aside from the core cloud business, Ms. Hood said, gaming revenue increased 44 percent, outperforming expectations as Microsoft expands its gaming platform.\u201cFortnite is a key component of that, but it\u2019s not the only contributor,\u201d she said, referring to a popular game.LinkedIn revenue also had higher-than-expected revenue, up 33 percent over the previous year, as engagement increased.\u201cRight now, it's like they are firing on all cylinders,\u201d Mr. Ives of Wedbush said. \"The biggest risk to the name is that expectations have increased.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a popular video game. It is Fortnite, not Fortnight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Faces Internal Backlash Over Handling of Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is struggling to contain a growing internal backlash over its handling of sexual harassment and its workplace culture.Google later said it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years; none received an exit package. Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai also issued apologies, with Mr. Pichai later saying his initial statement \u201cwasn\u2019t enough\u201d and apologizing again. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned on Tuesday and did not obtain an exit package.But employees\u2019 dissatisfaction has not subsided. On Thursday, more than 1,500 \u2014 most of them women \u2014 plan to walk out of almost two dozen company offices around the world to protest the treatment, organizers said.Google declined to comment.At a staff meeting last year, Google\u2019s founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, also struggled to answer a question about who their female role models were, said two employees who saw a video of the meeting.Mr. Brin tried to recall the name of a woman he had recently met at a company event who had impressed him, the people said. Mr. Page eventually reminded Mr. Brin that the woman\u2019s name was Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer. Mr. Page said his hero was Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google and Alphabet, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Last week, The Times reported that Google had paid Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile software, a $90 million exit package even after the company concluded that a harassment claim against him was credible. (Mr. Rubin has denied any misconduct and has said the report of his compensation is a \u201cwild exaggeration.\u201d) Google also paid millions of dollars in an exit package to another executive who was accused of harassment, and continued employing a third despite a harassment claim.\u201cI know this is really an exceptionally painful story for some of you, and I\u2019m really sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Page said at the time.The meeting did little to quell the anger. On Friday, Ms. Stapleton said, she created an internal mailing list to organize a walkout. More than 200 employees joined over the weekend, she said, and the numbers have since grown to more than 1,500.That same day, Mr. Pichai sent an apologetic email to employees saying he would support this week\u2019s protest. He said that some workers had already raised constructive ideas of how to improve policies around harassment and that he hoped to \u201cturn these ideas into action,\u201d according to the email, which was obtained by The Times.Employees organizing the walkout have called on Google to end the practice of private arbitration \u2014 which requires people to waive their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements \u2014 in cases of sexual assault and harassment. They also are demanding publication of a transparency report on instances of sexual harassment, more disclosure of salaries and compensation, an employee representative on the company\u2019s board and a chief diversity officer who could make recommendations directly to the board.Other employees said they were disappointed that senior executives such as David C. Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, who had a child with a female subordinate, and Mr. Brin, who had a public extramarital relationship with an employee, remained in influential positions. Some raised questions about whether it was appropriate for Eric Schmidt, the company\u2019s former chief executive and chairman, to remain on Alphabet\u2019s board after former and current employees said he had retained a mistress as a company consultant.Thursday\u2019s walkout is set to begin in Google\u2019s Tokyo office and then circle the globe, with employees leaving work around 11 a.m. in their time zones, Ms. Stapleton said. People can choose whether or not to return to work, she said.\u201cWhile Google has championed the language of diversity and inclusion, substantive actions to address systemic racism, increase equity and stop sexual harassment have been few and far between. ENOUGH,\u201d organizers of the walkout wrote on an internal website, which was viewed by The Times. \u201cTime\u2019s up at Google.\u201dKate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Homeland Security\u2019s Computers Couldn\u2019t Track Separated Families, Report Finds", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the Office of Field Operations, another part of Customs and Border Protection, could not. Customs officers, who staff ports of entry, had to send their information to Health and Human Services in emails with Microsoft Word documents as attachments. (Under federal law, unaccompanied children may be held for no more than 72 hours before being transferred to the health agency\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement.)\u201cEach step of this manual process is vulnerable to human error, increasing the risk that a child could be lost in the system,\u201d the auditors wrote.The report also concluded that a database said to be developed jointly by the homeland security and health departments to track the separated families did not exist. The agencies would later admit that there was no \u201cdirect electronic interface\u201d between their computer systems.The Department of Homeland Security also detained migrant children far longer than the 72 hours allowed by law in facilities that were designed only for short-term detention.The report found that 564 children in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, for example, were kept in these facilities for longer than three days. In the El Paso area, 297 children were detained in the short-term facilities for more than 72 hours, according to the report.In an emailed statement, Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said the inspector general\u2019s report illustrated the \u201cdifficulties in enforcing immigration laws that are broken and poorly written.\u201dMs. Waldman also criticized the report for including steps the agency took to address migrants seeking asylum legally at ports with those caught by the Border Patrol trying to cross the border illegally. Asylum seekers who arrived at ports of entry were not subject to the zero-tolerance policy, she said.\u201cThis administration will no longer turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and will continue to refer illegal border crossers for prosecution,\u201d Ms. Waldman said.The report is the first after-action report issued by the watchdog office about the administration\u2019s so-called zero-tolerance policy, announced in April by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Under the policy, prosecutors from the Justice Department on the southwestern border were told to charge every illegal entry offense \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201dA month later, Mr. Sessions announced that the Department of Homeland Security would refer \u201c100 percent of illegal southwest border crossings\u201d for criminal prosecution \u2014 a decision that led to the separation of families at the border.That decision set off weeks of protests, with Democrats and many Republicans calling on Mr. Trump to end the policy.Facing international condemnation, Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June ending the policy. Later that month, a federal court ordered the government to begin reunifying children with their families. Many of the children, some younger than 5, had been placed in detention centers thousands of miles from their parents.On Tuesday, Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, to resign over what he said were misleading statements she made to Congress over the zero-tolerance policy.Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by two groups seeking greater government transparency \u2014 the Project on Government Oversight and Open the Government \u2014 suggest that Ms. Nielsen signed off on actions that led to children being separated from their families.But during a May 15 Senate hearing, Ms. Nielsen told Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, \u201cWe do not have a policy to separate children from their parents.\u201dMr. Durbin disputed that on Tuesday.Ms. Waldman, the homeland security spokeswoman, said the document cited by Mr. Durbin was taken out of context.\u201cThe oft-cited quote pulled from the April 23 memo simply states the premise that D.H.S. has the legal authority to take an action \u2014 however, it did not direct a policy of family separation for the purposes of deterrence,\u201d she said. \u201cConflating authority versus actual policy based on a redacted memo provides a disservice to the public and does not show the full picture of considerations presented to the secretary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Maps to Tell the Story of How Americans Live", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo graphics editors with graduate degrees in geography saw an opportunity in a database of satellite images released this summer.The section features nine black-and-white maps showing, for the most part, where there are buildings and where there are none. They range in perspective from the entire United States, to one section of Washington, D.C. Together, they tell a story about the things that shape the way we build and, in turn, how we live.\u201cIt\u2019s always been really interesting to me how these kind of structures and processes and things that surround us as we go through life really affect how we live our lives and affect how people relate to one another,\u201d said Derek Watkins, one of the two Times graphics editors who made the maps. \u201cBut so many of them are difficult to see.\u201dThe other editor was Tim Wallace (who recently left the paper to work for a start-up). The maps were drawn using a huge database of building footprints that Microsoft released to the public this summer. The company compiled the data using artificial intelligence to identify the outlines of buildings in satellite images.When the data was released, people on the Times graphics desk took notice. Mr. Wallace said they knew it would be useful as a reporting tool, but they also wanted to do something fun with it. He considered a few ideas, but the thing that most compelled him was simply looking at a visual representation of the data, seeing the lakes of Minnesota outlined by the structures people have built around them, for instance. He and Mr. Watkins thought readers would find it compelling, too, and their editors agreed.So he and Mr. Watkins \u2014 who have graduate degrees in geography \u2014 wrote a script to turn the data into graphics, where buildings were black and open space was white. Then they spent some time poring over them, letting their eyes catch on whatever stuck out to them and sharing their insights with each other along the way.For the final maps, they highlighted six areas that were both visually interesting and demonstrative of how things like geography, history and culture can shape the way we build. They include squiggly suburbs in Mesa, Ariz.; buildings sprinkled among the Appalachian Mountains, built where they could be; and \u201clong lots\u201d branching off a Louisiana bayou, a style of development leftover from the area\u2019s cultural history under France.Mr. Wallace also sent some of what had jumped out at them to Fred Bierman, director of news design for The Times\u2019s print operation and the section\u2019s designer. Mr. Bierman had long wanted to find a map from graphics to print as a panoramic, a massive 48-inch sheet of paper as big as four pages of the newspaper side by side, which is a relatively new capability for the Times. (Todd Socia, who oversees print production and distribution, said he understands The Times to be the only newspaper in North America with the equipment to print a panoramic.)The maps made from the building footprint data were a perfect candidate. Mr. Bierman also had the idea to zone the section, meaning they could make maps of different regions of the country and deliver them to readers who live in those regions. Mr. Wallace jumped on the idea, and they settled on six versions, each of a different city or region: New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay and Dallas/Fort Worth. Online, Mr. Watkins created an interactive map that allows users to search the building maps by city or ZIP code.The cover of the section gives a broad view of the region it was printed for, with heavy splotches of black fading to gray farther from city centers. Then the first two-page spread just inside holds the same maps in every version: a map of the entire United States and the six development patterns that Mr. Watkins identified.\u201cThe idea was hopefully those six things will prime people\u2019s imaginations so that when they open the really big spread, they are kind of already thinking about the types of things you can see in this data,\u201d Mr. Watkins said.Unfurling the pages all the way brings readers to a close-up of each city, sprawled across four pages. Cities, neighborhoods, and notable structures are labeled, but most of the map is left to be identified. Where buildings are packed close together, the lines and blocks on the map are darker, more solid, while open areas jump off the page as breaths of white space.John Schwartz, a climate reporter for The Times, wrote the introduction for the section and a few blurbs inside guiding the reader\u2019s eye here and there, according to observations from Times reporters around the country who cover those regions. But gazing at the huge centerfold is the time to recall a simple instruction that Mr. Schwartz offers on the cover page: Look.Mr. Watkins and Mr. Wallace\u2019s wishes for how they want readers to interact with this oddity that arrives on a Sunday are just as gentle: Find something familiar, puzzle over something unfamiliar.\u201cI would just hope that people explore,\u201d Mr. Wallace said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Asked and Answered", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.You asked, we answer!Many of you responded to our call this week for questions about the midterms, 2020 and anything else on your mind. We picked a few to answer in today\u2019s edition \u2014 and called in some friends to help.First, Tom Nicolson wondered:Will anyone challenge President Trump?Some strategists took that as a confirmation of something they had already suspected: There\u2019s little room to challenge Mr. Trump. Despite middling approval ratings, he\u2019s kept a tight hold on his base \u2014 one that has only grown stronger since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Of course, politics are unpredictable, particularly in this administration. But right now, it\u2019s hard to see an electoral path for a credible Republican challenge. John Begley posed this question on one of the biggest races of the year:What is the likelihood that Beto will beat Cruz? Can he get out the Hispanic, minority and youth vote?Craig Scherfenberg asked:Who are the writers behind Trump\u2019s speeches? And what do they know about the historical context in which they are operating?The backbone of President Trump\u2019s speeches comes from Stephen Miller, his senior adviser in the White House. Mr. Miller used to be the one who would come out at Trump campaign rallies to warm up the crowd with a red-meat introduction. He liked to pair apocalyptic language about the state of the country with over-the-top praise of Mr. Trump, leaving the audience practically baying for the candidate.As the midterm campaign has heated up and Mr. Trump\u2019s own re-election apparatus has taken shape, Brad Parscale, the 2020 campaign manager, has become more involved in the president\u2019s remarks.Do they ponder the historical context of the words they\u2019re giving Mr. Trump to say, or the impact on the country? I would be guessing. But there is no question that Mr. Miller \u2014 like his boss \u2014 likes the kind of divisive rhetoric that outrages progressives and thrills the base.And finally, Wendy Rosen sent us this, which is not really a question, but we wanted to address it anyhow: Please stop using \u201cprimary\u201d as a verb. The world is falling apart but must our language sink to such low levels?____________________Last Thursday I was at an event at a local Flint church, where Kaleka Lewis-Harris, a 42-year-old dynamo of a person, was directing a line of cars that stretched more than a mile. \u201cEight cases,\u201d she called out to one of her volunteers, who was wearing a \u201cFlint Lives Matter\u201d T-shirt. The cars, of course, were waiting for bottled water, more than four years after the city\u2019s supply was first contaminated.If you believe Gov. Rick Snyder, the Flint water crisis is effectively over, and the city\u2019s state-issued water is safe to drink and use. But if you believe Flint residents, the same ones who first warned Mr. Snyder\u2019s administration about the contamination, the progress has been pedestrian.About 80 percent of the city\u2019s water service lines have been replaced, but some residents want the state to provide new indoor plumbing in their homes, improved water filters, and health care for previous health problems. Other residents said the issue is one of trust \u2014 and they just can\u2019t imagine using Flint water again, under any conditions.Both the state\u2019s candidates for governor \u2014 Gretchen Whitmer, the Democrat, and Bill Schuette, the Republican \u2014 have said they\u2019d make fixing Flint\u2019s water a priority. Still, residents, who have seen loads of politicians fail to deliver on such promises, are skeptical.\u201cPeople are tired,\u201d said David Brooks, a 72-year-old retired General Motors laborer. \u201cIt feels like this country just doesn\u2019t care about you.\u201d\u201cMy kids ask me what in the world is going on here, and I try to explain it, and they just don\u2019t believe me,\u201d said Louis Dinnan, a 60-year-old forklift driver.He was waiting in line to pick up bottled water distributed by Ms. Lewis-Harris and her volunteers. The good news is that the church had 30 pallets in total, provided by private companies and The United Way. The bad news: The state has ended its free bottled water distribution, and it\u2019s unclear what residents will do once the private donations dry up.____________________There is only one congressional district in North Dakota: It covers the entire state of North Dakota.Yes, NoDak, as some locals shorthand it, has one of the country\u2019s seven at-large House districts.This being the Great Plains, where Midwest meets West, there\u2019s plenty of bison. But there are also lesser-known local delicacies. For example, knoephla, a German-rooted dumpling soup. I had a cup at the Peacock Alley, a historic restaurant in Bismarck, and another at the very hip Hotel Donaldson in Fargo.Both spots were excellent, and the steak (beef or bison) was exquisite.If you\u2019re still feeling in the mood for the Germanic, also check out W\u00fcrst in Fargo for a bratwurst.But whatever you do, try to visit the state during the summer. I\u2019ve been to North Dakota twice this year, in April and October, and there was snow on the ground both times. It was enough to make a guy hungry for dumpling soup._____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading. Politics is more than what goes on inside the White House.

So in a meeting last month with Jeff Dean, the company\u2019s head of artificial intelligence, Dr. Poulson asked if Google planned to move ahead with the product and if his work would contribute to censorship and surveillance in China.According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit the company. Mr. Dean did not respond to a request for comment, and Google declined to comment.Across the technology industry, rank-and-file employees are demanding greater insight into how their companies are deploying the technology that they built. At Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, as well as at tech start-ups, engineers and technologists are increasingly asking whether the products they are working on are being used for surveillance in places like China or for military projects in the United States or elsewhere.That\u2019s a change from the past, when Silicon Valley workers typically developed products with little questioning about the social costs. It is also a sign of how some tech companies, which grew by serving consumers and businesses, are expanding more into government work. And the shift coincides with concerns in Silicon Valley about the Trump administration\u2019s policies and the larger role of technology in government.And the change is likely to last: Some engineering students have said they are demanding more answers and are asking similar questions, even before they move into the work force.\u201cWhat people are looking for \u2014 not just employees \u2014 they are looking for some clarity,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman. \u201cAre there principles that get applied? Even if you don\u2019t agree with the decision that gets made, if you understand the thinking behind it, it helps a lot.\u201dAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.The lack of information about what tech employees are working on was recently evident at Clarifai, an artificial intelligence start-up in New York City.Last year, a small team of Clarifai engineers began working on a project inside a private room at its downtown New York office, said three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation. Paper covered the windows, and employees called the room \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets,\u201d in a sly reference to the second Harry Potter novel. Even the eight engineers and researchers working inside the room did not entirely realize the nature of the project, the people said.When employees asked about the project in meetings, Clarifai\u2019s chief executive, Matt Zeiler, said it was a government project related to \u201canalytics\u201d or \u201csurveillance\u201d and would \u201csave lives,\u201d according to the people.After employees read documents posted to Clarifai\u2019s internal systems, it became clear that the company had won a contract for Project Maven and that workers were creating something for the Defense Department, the people said. One engineer quit the project immediately after a meeting with the Defense Department where killing was discussed in frank terms, they said.A Clarifai spokesman said that at the very beginning of the project, the company sat down with those chosen for it to brief them on the nature of the work, and one employee quit the project then. \u201cEvery member of Clarifai\u2019s Project Maven team agreed to work on the project, and the two people who chose not to participate were assigned to different efforts across the company,\u201d the spokesman said.Dr. Poulson, whose work involved incorporating a variety of languages into Google search, said he did not initially think his research could be involved in Dragonfly \u2014 until he noticed Chinese had been added to a list of languages for his project.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know the holistic scope of what they\u2019re building,\u201d said Dr. Poulson, 32, who worked at Google for over two years. \u201cYou don\u2019t have knowledge of where it\u2019s going unless you\u2019re sufficiently senior.\u201dThe difficulties of knowing what companies are doing with technologies is compounded because engineers at large tech companies often build infrastructure \u2014 like algorithms, databases and even hardware \u2014 that underpins almost every product a company offers. At Google, for example, a storage system called Colossus is used by Google search, Google Maps and Gmail.\u201cIt would be very difficult for most engineers in Google to be sure that their work wouldn\u2019t contribute to these projects in some way,\u201d said Ms. Nolan, who helped to keep Google\u2019s systems running online smoothly. \u201cMy personal feeling was that if the organization is doing something I find ethically unacceptable, then I was contributing to it.\u201dYet executives at tech companies have claimed that complete transparency is not possible.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had confidential projects as a company. I think what happened when the company was smaller, you had a higher chance of knowing about it,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said at a staff meeting in August, according to a transcript provided to The New York Times. \u201cI think there are a lot of times when people are in exploratory stages where teams are debating and doing things, so sometimes being fully transparent at that stage can cause issues.\u201d\u201cWe are students opposed to the weaponization of technology by companies like Google and Microsoft,\u201d the pledge stated. \u201cOur dream is to be a positive force in the world. We refuse to be complicit in this gross misuse of power.\u201dAlex Ahmed, a doctoral candidate in computer science at Northeastern University in Boston, said she organized a student discussion on campus this month to debate whether they should work for tech companies that made decisions they believed to be unethical.\u201cWe\u2019re not given an ethics course. We\u2019re not given a political education,\u201d Ms. Ahmed, 29, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to do this unless we create the conversations for ourselves.\u201dOver the summer, she said, students at Northeastern also protested the school\u2019s multimillion-dollar research contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under which it would provide research on technology exports to the agency. A Northeastern spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Bridget Frey, the chief technology officer at the online real estate company Redfin, said job candidates had increasingly raised ethical questions in interviews. This summer, interns questioned Redfin\u2019s chief executive, Glenn Kelman, about whether the way the site displays school information and test scores could contribute to socio-economic divides in neighborhoods. In response, the company said it planned to add more context about the test score information early next year.Employees are now frequently asking, \u201cIf you don\u2019t share the information with me, how can I make sure this isn\u2019t happening here?\u201d Ms. Frey said.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the real estate company Redfin\u2019s addition of context to school test score information it publishes online. It plans to add that context early next year; it has not already added it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Future Where Everything Becomes a Computer Is as Creepy as You Feared", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtMore than 40 years ago, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft with a vision for putting a personal computer on every desk.No one really believed them, so few tried to stop them. Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft\u2019s monopoly back in the bottle.It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry\u2019s largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There\u2019s just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.The industry\u2019s new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets \u2014 these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting \u201csmart.\u201d Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend \u2014 known by the marketing catchphrase \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung.Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet.\u201cI can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,\u201d he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. \u201cIn our government-can\u2019t-do-anything-ever society, I don\u2019t see any reining in of the corporate trends,\u201d he said.At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a \u201csmart\u201d fan using Amazon\u2019s chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan\u2019s control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code \u2014 in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code.And that\u2019s it. The fan\u2019s digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in.This system illustrates Mr. Schneier\u2019s larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet.Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don\u2019t connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do.The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don\u2019t often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple\u2019s brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors.The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry.Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason techies don\u2019t like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn\u2019t a terrible idea.Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast. Why not go slowly into the uncertain future?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Executives Pull Out of Saudi Conference", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello from Washington, D.C., the hot seat of late for big Silicon Valley companies accused of being too powerful, undermining democracy and profiting off the personal details of our lives without our permission. I\u2019m Cecilia Kang, The Times\u2019s technology policy reporter covering tech\u2019s reckoning and other policy issues that fall at the intersection of tech and government.This past week, the nation\u2019s capital was quiet as many lawmakers were back in their districts campaigning for the midterm elections. And the biggest stories for tech were overseas, with the technology industry\u2019s response to claims of Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the possible killing of a dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.Mr. Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber and an Iranian-American, told the conference\u2019s sponsor in a phone call that the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi were \u201cterrible,\u201d and that he would not go to Riyadh unless the questions about the journalist\u2019s fate were cleared up, according to two people briefed on the conversation.But Uber is not alone. Saudi Arabia has become a top investor in American start-ups, including the office-sharing company WeWork and the augmented-reality device maker Magic Leap, according to The Wall Street Journal.Sprint, which is owned by SoftBank and is applying with regulators for an acquisition from T-Mobile, has been walking a fine line on how to respond.\u201cAt this point in time, we, like most companies that have a relationship with Saudi Arabia, are watching developments and seeing where this goes,\u201d said Marcelo Claure, the executive chairman of Sprint and chief operating officer of SoftBank.In other news:Michael and Kate added that nearly 200 companies had raised more than $53 billion in initial public offerings in American markets in 2018, making it the busiest year for tech newcomers to Wall Street since 2014, according to data from Dealogic.\u25a0 Paul Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, died.

Gov. Gavin Newsom.I just built 30 units at a property in southern Indiana. The land is a lot cheaper than in California, but the other costs \u2014 roofing, lumber, windows, appliances, carpeting, drywall \u2014 those costs aren\u2019t that much more expensive in California than they are in Indiana.The difference: I build those units for $90,000 a door. In Los Angeles you would be talking $450,000 to $500,000. The difference is delay, impact fees, red tape, litigation, regulations, mandates. Which is all government created. I think I can work on streamlining those things.I think immigration enhances this country. Look at what Silicon Valley has done with a whole bunch of people who came to this country.

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is \u201camong the first examples of an authoritarian government\u2019s using the social network against its own people.\u201dThe Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which returned years after he had been treated for it.Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons.In a statement, Mr. Gates said that he was \u201cheartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends,\u201d adding that \u201cpersonal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dMr. Icahn said in a letter yesterday that he owns 8.3 percent of a special Dell stock that tracks the company\u2019s holdings in the publicly traded company VMware. Dell announced this summer that it plans to buy out owners of that stock, known by its ticker symbol, DVMT, for $21.7 billion.

Millie Tran, a global growth editor for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Then think of all the different and potential audience segments. Each will have slightly different formulas, and you have to constantly experiment, learn and calibrate. In practice, that means I\u2019m looking at a lot of data, reading a lot of reports, talking to a lot of people, trying to understand all these different contexts, and working to distill and communicate everything I\u2019m learning to the rest of the newsroom.What tech tools do you rely on to keep track of audience and expanding our audience?I\u2019m a big fan of contextualizing any number or piece of data, whether that\u2019s for benchmarking (is that higher or lower than we expected?) or explaining why we care about that figure (is it connected to our newsroom, to business goals or to both?). It\u2019s making a piece of information more sophisticated but also simplifying it. It comes down to our audience: How can I help my colleagues around the newsroom empathize more with our readers, viewers and listeners around the world?What is your personal tech setup like?It has changed a lot over the years. Almost a decade ago, I wrote my college senior thesis on cyberwar and taught a seminar on the same subject, so I used to be hypervigilant about all of that. Then, when I was working on the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and newsletter, I had my iPhone, an Android and lots of news apps to check out their push notifications, and email apps to test how an email would be experienced and read. (I was most recently the director of global adaptation at BuzzFeed.)Since starting work on international growth, I\u2019ve simplified my hardware \u2014 mostly one phone, an iPhone X, and my good old Moto X when I need to see something on Android \u2014 but I have as many apps as ever: 314.In terms of apps and software, I am constantly tinkering and trying new apps. For (mostly) work, it\u2019s the whole Google suite, Slack, Things for my to-dos, Bear for notes, Instapaper, Nuzzel, Spotify, Pocket Casts and, of course, the New York Times app. I\u2019m looking for a better mail app right now. The apps I use daily for everything else are Citymapper, Citi Bike, Weather Underground (though I have a whole folder of weather apps), Sleep Cycle and Nike Training.Translating our articles for non-English-speaking audiences is one growth avenue. What do you think of translation software? Or is it better to rely on people? Why?What tech do you and your family love outside of work? My best friends and family are all over the place, so there\u2019s a lot of video chatting through FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Facebook Messenger. I love randomly FaceTiming my friends.I travel to Vietnam every year to see my family, and it\u2019s incredible how quickly they\u2019ve all adopted Facebook, Uber and a bunch of other apps. Viber used to be the primary way for us to communicate, but now we\u2019re mostly chatting on Messenger.Finally, lots of travel sites and apps to find good flight deals to get to all of them!What do you do to take a break from tech?Honestly, I\u2019m rarely without my phone or some piece of technology and do believe in making tech work for me and my life, not the other way around. That said, I\u2019m a very tactile person, and you obviously lose a lot of that when you work on the internet. So I love activities like grocery and clothes shopping, and I love my plants and the deeply satisfying feeling of watching something you take care of grow.

{"Headline": "Stocks Climb, Recovering From a Decline That Wiped Out 2018\u2019s Gains", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks rebounded on Thursday as strong earnings from major tech companies seemed to ease some of the worries driving a recent wave of selling that had wiped out the market\u2019s gains for the year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose by 1.9 percent, to close at 2,705.57. The rise pulled the stock market back into positive territory for 2018 a day after a turbulent session had erased the last of the year\u2019s gains. Stocks are now up 1.2 percent this year.The rally on Thursday was a rare upward jolt in what has been a rough run for stocks. Investors have dumped shares over the past month, worried about factors that could threaten the economic and profit outlook for 2019, including the trade war with China, the Fed\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates and the midterm elections.Those worries have largely outweighed the strong third-quarter sales and profit numbers that companies have reported since earnings season began this month. Thanks to a strong economy and corporate tax cuts, third-quarter profits for S.&P. 500 companies were on track to be up more than 22 percent, according to an analysis of reported results and projections by the market data firm Refinitiv.Instead, investors are scanning results for any indication \u2014 either in the profit guidance companies offer to analysts or in commentary from executives \u2014 that their fears of a rocky time ahead are warranted.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the guidance,\u201d said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving stock movements.\u201dOn Thursday, stock in International Paper rose 10.3 percent after it posted better-than-expected results. Executives said they expected strong sales and profit performance \u201cto continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.\u201d The chip giant Intel rose 4.5 percent after it raised its profit guidance for next year. Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips used in large data centers, shot up more than 15 percent after it increased full-year profit guidance.And Xilinx was only the S.&P. 500\u2019s second-best performer.Twitter posted its results, with revenue and profit topping forecasts, before the start of trading on Thursday, and its stock jumped 15.5 percent. Large tech companies also climbed. Shares of Microsoft, which reported positive results after the close of trading on Wednesday, rose 5.8 percent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 3 percent and is now up 6 percent for the year, but is nonetheless down 9.8 percent from its peak in early September.If investors were hoping that Thursday\u2019s rise means the latest period of volatility is at an end, they\u2019ll most likely be disappointed.Amazon, which rose more than 7 percent during the day, promptly tumbled in after-hours trading, after the release of its earnings report, which included a holiday forecast investors found underwhelming. And Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, whose shares had risen, dropped sharply when its results likewise disappointed.As long as investors feel that they don\u2019t have a good sense of what next year will look like, such volatility will almost certainly continue. More market swings could leave it ultimately treading water until conditions become more clear, Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cUntil we get through this we\u2019re just going to have this range-bound and very choppy market,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Wants to Strike Back on Trade. Big U.S. Deals Could Suffer.", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow China is looking for new ways to retaliate in the intensifying trade drama \u2014 and experts warn that some corporate deals with American buyers could be in jeopardy.China\u2019s antitrust regulators disclose little about their deliberations. But some companies worry that this opacity could provide cover for retaliation in response to tariffs that the United States has placed on Chinese goods \u2014 and wonder if long-negotiated deals could become collateral damage in the trade war.\u201cGiven the level of trade tensions now, in some exceptional cases you cannot exclude the possibility that individual transactions may be implicated,\u201d said Fay Zhou, a partner at the law firm Linklaters in Beijing.Officials at China\u2019s antimonopoly agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to requests for comment.American companies have prospered by exploring new markets and taking risks to extend their global reach. But President Trump warned last week that these were early days in his trade strategy \u2014 \u201cChina wants to talk, very badly, and I said, \u2018Frankly, it\u2019s too early to talk\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and American companies may encounter some backlash from Beijing.So China has only so many avenues to inflict pain. They could include slow inspections for imports at Chinese ports and tighter regulatory scrutiny of American companies doing business in China.Deals are a ripe area, too.\u201cThis is a way for China to put pressure on American corporations to get them to work on the U.S. government,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance and the director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong.Blocking American deals comes with some cost. Aggressive regulators could spur foreign companies to retreat from China just when economic growth there is slowing.\u201cChina has valid reasons to be angry with the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist tariffs,\u201d said Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China. But, he added, \u201cit is unlikely to direct its anger at American businesses.\u201d\u201cOn the contrary, China is trying to cultivate ties with them,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Regulators in China have a wide scope for denying deals by American buyers, even if Chinese companies aren\u2019t involved. Chinese officials can block a deal for any new venture that they deem would have too much market control in China. The country\u2019s broadly defined antimonopoly law allows regulators to consider more than what an individual deal might cost consumers or a specific Chinese business.\u201cAuthorities are obliged to consider not just the competition merits of a deal but also the impact of a deal on China\u2019s national economy,\u201d said Ms. Zhou, a former official at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, which until recently was in charge of greenlighting deals.United Technologies said it was still on track with regulatory approvals needed for its Rockwell Collins deal. But when asked on a conference call in June whether the trade war could prevent the deal from going through, Akhil Johri, United Technology\u2019s chief financial officer said, \u201cThat is something you always have to think about or worry about.\u201dLast Monday, United Technologies received a green light from regulators in the United States. \u201cThe process for closing on Rockwell Collins is moving forward with the recent U.S. Department of Justice approval being the latest milestone,\u201d said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for United Technologies. China\u2019s approval is the last step.The Disney-Fox and United Technologies-Rockwell Collins deals may be less likely to attract scrutiny because they aren\u2019t as central to Chinese business as Qualcomm. The chip maker supplied essential parts for the country\u2019s big smartphone manufacturers.It is unclear whether the Chinese authorities will scrutinize the Disney-Fox deal in particular, but experts said a deep review would be consistent with traditionally tight regulatory controls over foreign content and information.\u201cThe party has been more interested in containing American influence in the cultural space and entertainment space,\u201d Mr. Chen, of the Asia Global Institute, said. \u201cBlocking such a deal would serve to keep the American influence away and also make a point to America.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul G. Allen, Microsoft\u2019s Co-Founder, Is Dead at 65", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later.The company\u2019s first product was a much-compressed version of the Basic programming language, designed to suit those underpowered machines. Yet the company\u2019s big move came when it promised the computer giant IBM that it would deliver the operating system software for IBM\u2019s entry into the personal computer business. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen committed to supplying that software in 1980.At the time, it was a promise without a product. But Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981.That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons \u2014 point-and-click computing rather than typed commands. The company would also produce the Office productivity programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations.Mr. Allen\u2019s partnership with Mr. Gates began when they were teenagers attending the private Lakeside School in Seattle. It was there that they got their start in computing, working from a school Teletype terminal that was linked to a far-away mainframe computer under a so-called time-sharing computer system, in which operators paid for the computing time they used. Funds for the system were originally supplied by proceeds from a school bake sale.Mr. Allen scored a perfect 1,600 on his SAT test, and went on to Washington State University. But after two years he dropped out to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston. Mr. Gates was nearby, attending Harvard University.When an early microcomputer was introduced, appearing on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine, Mr. Allen persuaded Mr. Gates to drop out of Harvard and move to Albuquerque, where a start-up called MITS had built a machine that has been credited as the first personal computer. The machine lacked software, and Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates, showing up at the MITS offices, promised that they could supply it.Their first offering was Microsoft Basic. Both Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen were skilled code creators, but Mr. Gates was more the hard-charging, volatile businessman, while Mr. Allen played the peacemaker and negotiator in those early days.Within a few years, Microsoft moved from New Mexico to suburban Seattle. Though Mr. Allen stepped away from daily duties at Microsoft in the early 1980s, partly because of a deteriorating relationship with Mr. Gates, he remained on the Microsoft board until 2000.Mr. Allen left Microsoft after he learned he had lymphoma. But tensions had also flared with both Mr. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, a close lieutenant who eventually succeeded Mr. Gates as chief executive. In his 2011 memoir, \u201cIdea Man,\u201d Mr. Allen recalled overhearing the two talk about reducing his stake in the company.\u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Mr. Allen wrote.But Mr. Allen held his ground and his shares.Mr. Gates said in a statement on Monday: \u201cFrom our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dAs Microsoft became the dominant personal computer software company, Mr. Allen, as well as Mr. Gates, who was the face of the company, became immensely wealthy. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he had a net worth of $26.1 billion.He was also an investor and a generous philanthropist.Mr. Allen donated more than $2 billion toward nonprofit groups dedicated to the advancement of science, technology, education, the environment and the arts. Among the scientific research organizations he funded were the Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003 and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2014.And while some of his philanthropy was global, like a passion for ending elephant poaching, much of his post-Microsoft work centered on Seattle, where he became a transformative force behind many of the city\u2019s leading cultural institutions.He restored the old Cinerama movie theater to modern standards seemingly ideal for watching science-fiction films, and he hired Frank Gehry to design the Museum of Pop Culture, which Mr. Allen founded in 2000 under the original name of the Experience Music Project. The wild, undulating building displayed items revealing Mr. Allen\u2019s cultural obsessions, including guitars owned by Jimi Hendrix and Captain Kirk\u2019s command chair from the 1960s television series \u201cStar Trek.\u201dIn the 1990s, Mr. Allen bought a swath of land in the South Lake Union neighborhood to help build a Seattle version of Central Park, but the public ultimately voted down the plans. He took those real estate holdings and, through his company, Vulcan, developed South Lake Union into the home of Amazon. Google and other tech companies have been opening offices in that now revitalized neighborhood.\u201cHe has a definitive role of what we understand as today\u2019s Seattle, which is about technology, about real estate and about a distinctive local culture with international visibility,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington.Mr. Allen also used his wealth to acquire the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association in 1988 and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League in 1996.Yet in 1988, at 35, he bought the Trail Blazers and promised to keep the franchise in the city, one of the smallest in the league. He often flew to games from Seattle and sat courtside with his mother. Soon after he bought the team, the Trail Blazers had one of their best runs in franchise history, making it to the N.B.A. finals twice in three years, losing both times.In a statement, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, called Mr. Allen \u201cthe ultimate trail blazer \u2014 in business, philanthropy and in sports.\u201d Mr. Silver said Mr. Allen, one of the longest-tenured owners in the league, was particularly interested in the league\u2019s growth internationally and its embrace of new technologies.Mr. Allen set about building the team a new home downtown. The team moved into CenturyLink Field in 2002, and Mr. Allen spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the stadium. Though he spoke infrequently to the media, he could often be seen at games, sometimes raising the \u201c12\u201d flag \u2014 representing the fans \u2014 before kickoff, a team ritual.During his tenure the Seahawks made their only three Super Bowl appearances, winning the title once, in 2014.\u201cI personally valued Paul\u2019s advice on subjects ranging from collective bargaining to bringing technology to our game,\u201d Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. Commissioner, said in a statement.One of Allen\u2019s companies also owned a stake in the Seattle Sounders, one of the most successful franchises in Major League Soccer. The Sounders won the league title in 2016.Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, to Kenneth and Edna (Faye) Allen. His father was a librarian; his mother a schoolteacher. He is survived by his sister, Jody Allen.Three years ago, when commemorating Microsoft\u2019s 40th anniversary, Mr. Allen posted on Twitter a bit of the code for the company\u2019s first software product. At the top, it said, \u201cCopyright 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird to look at bits of code you wrote 40 years ago and think, \u2018That led to where Microsoft is today,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Allen said at the time. He sounded genuinely amazed.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the cities in which Mr. Allen owned professional sports teams. He owned an N.F.L. team in Seattle and an N.B.A. team in Portland, Ore.; the teams were not both in Seattle.An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Allen\u2019s middle name. It is Gardner, not Gardener.Ken Belson and Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: \u201cThey just want to follow winners,\u201d the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google\u2019s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit.It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well. The NYT added that some students are asking similar questions \u2014 before they even join the work force.Mr. Ballmer\u2019s bottom line? \u201cStick with what you know.

{"Headline": "IBM to Buy Red Hat, the Top Linux Distributor, for $34 Billion", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIBM is making a big move to bring more software developers under its wing by acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the popular open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion.With the deal for Red Hat, IBM is trying to position itself as a kind of corporate \u201cSwitzerland\u201d in cloud computing \u2014 a trusted partner of businesses that are moving to the cloud, but are leery of becoming dependent on one major cloud supplier.In the cloud model, software developers write applications that run on remote data centers. The advantage can be lower costs and faster development of new business software.IBM is a champion of a hybrid approach to cloud computing. That means some crucial data and applications run on cloud technology inside a company\u2019s data centers, while other computing tasks run on the clouds of tech companies.The major third-party cloud platforms are Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Businesses complain that these cloud suppliers include proprietary technology that makes it difficult to switch from one cloud to another.The IBM cloud strategy is to supply both hardware and software for companies to build their own private clouds, and it also has a third-party public cloud offering.IBM, analysts say, cannot really compete broadly with so-called hyperscale cloud companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google \u2014 which tap their deep coffers to spend many billions of dollars a year to build more giant data centers.But IBM and Red Hat say they are well placed to be leaders in helping corporations make the transition to cloud computing without getting locked into the technology of an internet giant.The two companies say they plan to offer the technology to link a company\u2019s in-house cloud and multiple third-party clouds.\u201cEnterprises are moving to the cloud but 80 percent of them are not there yet,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, an IBM senior vice president in charge of its hybrid cloud offerings. \u201cWe can provide a much easier path to manage and make secure both private clouds and links to multiple public clouds.\u201dRed Hat, founded in 1993 and based in Raleigh, N.C., has built a profitable business, with $2.4 billion in revenue last year, around open-source software, mainly Linux. Open-source code is distributed free, and can be modified by far-flung programmers, under certain rules.Red Hat has expanded \u2014 and made money \u2014 by offering technical support, quality control, software tools and a forum for collaboration, charging subscription fees.Linux is the preferred operating system for cloud computing. \u201cFor most corporations, hybrid cloud is the only practical way to the cloud,\u201d said Paul Cormier, president for products and technologies at Red Hat.The link with IBM, Mr. Cormier said, will accelerate Red Hat\u2019s progress in the market for corporate cloud migrations.Red Hat will join IBM\u2019s cloud team, the companies said in a joint statement, but as a \u201cdistinct unit\u201d to preserve its independence and neutrality in open-source development.IBM\u2019s offer of $190 a share in cash is more than a 60 percent premium over Red Hat\u2019s closing price on Friday, $116.68 a share.The hefty price tag, said one person close to the deal, who asked not be to identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, is justified by Red Hat\u2019s growth and strong cash flow.IBM, he said, is paying about 30 times Red Hat\u2019s free cash flow, well below the average for recent software company acquisitions, and it will help lift IBM\u2019s growth and cash flow.The boards of both companies approved the deal, and the sale is expected to close in the second half of next year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Lazard advised IBM on the deal, and Guggenheim Partners and Morgan Stanley advised Red Hat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Team Owner, Paul Allen Liked to Do the Math on Winning", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 About 24 hours before kickoff in Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, Paul Allen, the owner of the Seattle Seahawks, emerged from a large van parked inside University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., and walked to the sideline at the 50-yard line.\u201cI\u2019m always doing that; it\u2019s just the way my mind works,\u201d he said. (The Seahawks went on to lose in the Super Bowl to the New England Patriots, 28-24.)\u201cYou can\u2019t use it all the time, just on important occasions,\u201d Allen said.It\u2019s unclear what his death means for the ownership of his teams. There are scenarios in which one or more of the stakes are sold, though a statement Tuesday from Vulcan Sports and Entertainment, the umbrella company for the teams, said, \u201cThere are no changes imminent for Vulcan, the teams, the research institutes or museums.\u201dThe N.F.L. owners are having a regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in New York, where Allen\u2019s absence will no doubt be noticed. Shahid Khan, the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, said Monday that Allen\u2019s biggest contribution to the league was not necessarily his devotion to football, but his many world-changing interests and innovations that have allowed the world \u201cto connect and understand one another in ways that were once unimaginable.\u201dIn some cases, those eclectic interests merged.Aware of the dangers of football, he looked for ways to reduce and treat concussions by developing different helmet designs to minimize impacts on the brain. His vision was far larger, though. He built the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, where researchers are trying to map the genetics of the brain and tackle the fundamental science of how the brain works.\u201cAll of these are decadal innovations,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cThey are not things that will be ready in five years, but if they make a difference in 10, 20 years from now, that\u2019s what you hope for.\u201dIn 2011, when the N.F.L. was in protracted labor negotiations with the players\u2019 union, Allen played a big role in getting the owners and players to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement. Allen also came to an owners meeting in Houston in 2016 to vote on whether to allow one or two teams to move to Los Angeles.Several influential owners favored letting the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers build a stadium together in Carson, south of Los Angeles. It was a practical, though bland, proposal.Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner, favored an alternate bid by the St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who hoped to build a more ambitious stadium in Inglewood, Calif., near the Los Angeles airport. Allen sided with Jones, helping turn the tables in Kroenke\u2019s favor (the Chargers will share the stadium, scheduled to open in 2020, while the Raiders are moving to Las Vegas in the 2020 season).\u201cHis voice was very powerful at that meeting,\u201d said Marc Ganis, an adviser to several league owners. \u201cWhat he said carried a lot of weight because he spoke so infrequently, and also because of his success and wealth.\u201dAfter Allen\u2019s death, there was an outpouring from players and coaches of his teams. Marshawn Lynch, who played with the Seahawks for five years and is now on the Raiders, has a reputation, like Allen, for selective engagement with the news media. But he spoke out on Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Comes After the Roomba?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been 16 years since the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner was introduced by iRobot.Partly inspired by a novel robotics approach known as \u201cfast, cheap and out-of-control,\u201d the humble Roomba was not much of a robot. It simply wandered around a room sucking up dust and debris. A second generation was able to autonomously make its way back to a recharging station.But unlike robots like Sony\u2019s dog, Aibo, it did something useful at a nonastronomical price. It was a hit for iRobot, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Since then, there have been waves of failed attempts to create more sophisticated home robotic products from companies in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe. There have been efforts to build humanoid robots, social companion robots, robots that cook, robots that do your dry cleaning, robots that fold your clothes and robots that change the kitty litter.But there still isn\u2019t a second successful home robot category beyond the lowly vacuum cleaner.Despite persistent optimism, roboticists and A.I. researchers have painfully learned that while computers can run mathematical circles around humans, things that humans do without thinking are the most difficult for machines. John McCarthy, an A.I. pioneer, would reach into his pocket and deftly extract a quarter as an example of the most challenging tasks for a robot.Many researchers have come to believe that the recent breakthroughs in machine learning will not be enough to build robots adept at moving and performing tasks in a home. That is likely to require several more technological breakthroughs.The continuing challenges in building a successful home robot have been underscored recently by the disappointments of several high-profile start-ups.Mayfield Robotics, which was developing Kuri, a home companion robot with backing from Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., a German electronics company, announced in July that it was \u201cpausing\u201d operations and returning pre-order deposits. Kuri\u2019s demise followed a similar fate earlier this year that befell Jibo, a heavily funded effort by Cynthia Breazeal, an M.I.T. professor, to build a social robot that had started a $3.5 million Indiegogo campaign in 2014.Pepper, introduced as a home robot by the French robot design firm Aldebaran Robotics and then acquired by SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, was initially priced at $2,000 with an additional monthly subscription. The robot is now being advertised on the firm\u2019s website as a commercial \u201chost\u201d or greeter for a flat fee of $25,000.The snail\u2019s pace of development in home robots stands in striking contrast to the rapid advance of artificial intelligence in successful products like Amazon\u2019s Echo or even the Siri technology of iPhones.\u201cNot a single human has been replaced by a humanoid robot,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the roboticist who started Google\u2019s self-driving car program.Japan and South Korea have been ahead of the United States in their enthusiasm for home robots, but companies there have had similarly disappointing results.\u201cAt one point I remember the president of South Korea saying that there would be robots in most Korea homes by 2012,\u201d said Tandy Trower, a software engineer who oversaw the original Microsoft Windows operating system and later established a robotics development effort at the company.He now leads his own home robot company, Hoaloha Robotics, which is focused on a mobile robot to permit older people to live independently at home. Mr. Trower said that while he remained optimistic that in the long run he would be able to develop a robot that acted as a partner or an assistant for aging people, he realized that a commercial product was not on the near horizon.Despite those repeated failures, many technologists remain optimistic that the home robot is just around the corner.At Stanford University, which pioneered the original robot arm and first mobile robot in the 1960s, the roboticist Kenneth Salisbury developed the prototype PR1 home robot a decade ago.The PR1 inspired Willow Garage, a start-up funded by Scott Hassan, one of Google\u2019s original programmers. Willow Garage produced another prototype home robot, the PR2, which led to a number of spinoffs, but no successful commercial home applications emerged from the research.Both the PR1 and PR2 were early explorations in performing common household tasks like getting a cup of coffee, loading and unloading the dishwasher, and going to the refrigerator and getting a beer. The robot prototypes performed these tasks, but only in highly controlled experiments.Now, Stanford roboticists are working on a next-generation robot that could potentially work in the home. Silvio Savarese, a Stanford computer scientist, is leading a team developing a robot called JackRabbot, intended for home or campus delivery as well as some tasks in the home. But getting around a house is still difficult, even in a ranch house without stairs, he said.Self-driving cars\u2019 engineers use the technology \u201csimultaneous localization and mapping,\u201d or SLAM, to navigate. It makes it possible to create a map in an unknown environment and place the car accurately. But in a home, with densely packed objects, including humans, that move frequently, SLAM is insufficient, Mr. Savarese said.So could a robot that helps tidy up the house be close?\u201cPicking things off the floor is with in reach if we can get the price of the arm down,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at Berkeley. His favorite for a new market might be what he calls a \u201cdecluttering robot,\u201d which would wander the house picking up after its occupants.\u201cDoing anything time critical is difficult,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201c But if you are willing to leave the house and come back six hours later \u2014 the house is clean.\u201dHis group is also experimenting with a robot that can make a bed \u2014 admittedly slowly, but he argues that it is not a task that has to be done at human speed.The Berkeley researchers are doing their experiments using a robot supplied by the Toyota Research Institute. The automaker is one of at least three large technology companies that have active home robot development projects in Silicon Valley.Many roboticists say they believe that the aging of people around the globe will be the catalyst for the arrival of more sophisticated home robots.\u201cThe demographic shifts of aging society will provide, in our view, a strong opportunity for a market for such a product to start, and that we also expect that what is good for aging society will also end up being helpful for everyone,\u201d said Gill Pratt, the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute.In addition to Toyota, Alphabet\u2019s Google X research laboratory and Amazon have active robotics research efforts that are reportedly aimed at home applications.Despite the new investments in research and development, veteran researchers are conscious that home robots have seemed imminent for decades.\u201cThe problem,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a leading Chinese artificial intelligence researcher who is now a venture investor, \u201cis that low cost plus high expectations plus no patience makes it difficult to make a great product.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the name of a robot being developed at Stanford. It is JackRabbot, not Jackrobbot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Battle With Amazon, Walmart Pushes Deeper Into Entertainment", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is going Hollywood.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has agreed to create short-form original series for Walmart\u2019s ad-supported streaming service, Vudu. Those are expected to debut early next year. It is the first of many studios that Walmart expects to work with in creating new content for Vudu, a spokesman for the retailer said Wednesday.Walmart is also investing in a joint venture with Eko, a New York start-up that focuses on \u201cinteractive storytelling,\u201d a video format that allows viewers to control the plot of commercials and television episodes.The investment with Eko totals $250 million, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the deal. It is thought to be the largest bet on the interactive entertainment niche, which has long tantalized producers as a potential gold mine but has never gained widespread adoption.\u201cWe are not trying to become a studio,\u201d said Scott McCall, a senior vice president for entertainment, toys and seasonal at Walmart. \u201cIt is our hope that we will work with studios to reimagine what new content looks like.\u201dWalmart\u2019s substantial investment is a validation for Eko, which was co-founded by the 37-year-old Yoni Bloch, who described himself in an interview in his New York office as \u201ca relatively famous singer in Israel.\u201d He has also been a judge on the Israeli version of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201dWalmart was introduced to Eko when the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, met Mr. Bloch while visiting Israel last year.The two companies started working together on an interactive presentation that Eko prepared for Walmart\u2019s shareholder meeting \u2014 the annual corporate pep rally in Bentonville attended by thousands of workers.Walmart sees interactive storytelling \u2014 essentially a video version of \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d books \u2014 as something that can be used in both entertainment and advertising.There could be a cooking show, for instance, that helps viewers buy the ingredients online as they watch. Or a love story in which viewers can choose what happens to the characters. In turn, each choice could help Walmart glean insight into the viewers\u2019 preferences and attitudes.\u201cThe idea is around leapfrogging what everyone else is doing,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.A cross between a video game and traditional television, interactive storytelling has been held back by technology hurdles and tricky funding. Making one great traditional ad or TV episode is expensive enough, much less one that branches off in different directions depending on what choices people make while viewing.Interactive content has also been hindered by a generational divide. Older consumers \u2014 and media executives \u2014 are accustomed to a passive viewing experience and have a hard time grasping this way of participating in storytelling. Younger viewers are the opposite. (Netflix already has a few interactive shows aimed at children.)Eko is far from alone in chasing the promise of interactive content, but it has a secret weapon: Nancy Tellem. Ms. Tellem, who is Eko\u2019s executive chairman (and also sits on the MGM board), gives Eko considerable credibility in Hollywood. She worked in senior jobs at CBS and Warner Bros. Television for roughly two decades before joining Microsoft in 2012 to create an Xbox-centered television business. Microsoft shut down her division in 2015.For Mr. Bloch, Walmart reminds him of youthful visits to the United States.\u201cWalmart was to me the symbol of America,\u201d he said. \u201cI just remember my mom said we have to go to Walmart because everything is big and cheap there.\u201dHe started his company in 2010 with his bandmates, many of whom had a background in computing.Eko has attracted investments from Silicon Valley firms like Sequoia Capital, as well as establishment backers like Warner Music and Intel. In addition to the $250 million investment in the joint venture, Walmart has invested an undisclosed amount in Eko directly.Many of the details about the joint venture are still being worked out \u2014 like where these shows or advertisements can be viewed. Walmart and Eko said they would share in any revenue.The first project to come from the MGM partnership, which was announced at a conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles, will be a \u201creimagining\u201d of the comedy \u201cMr. Mom,\u201d which will debut on Vudu early next year.Mr. McCall said Vudu would work with MGM on revitalizing other classic movies and creating entirely new content.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which title was Eko\u2019s first full-length interactive series. As another caption noted, it was \u201cThat Moment When,\u201d not \u201c#WarGames.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Can\u2019t Escape the Business of War", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany in the tech industry don\u2019t want to be part of the military-industrial complex. But defense work is already part of Silicon Valley\u2019s DNA.Ms. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the origins of Silicon Valley.It may not be a popular position, but Mr. Bezos\u2019s comments reveal an important truth: The Pentagon has been part of the Silicon Valley story all along. Defense contracts during and after World War II turned Silicon Valley from a somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet. The American tech economy rests on the foundations of the military-industrial complex. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment.The result is an enduring technological optimism. Early Silicon Valley didn\u2019t have a J. Robert Oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation. Instead, it had an ebullient regional booster, Fred Terman, an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn Stanford from a middling school with a good football team into an engineering powerhouse.Big defense certainly made its mark. The region\u2019s biggest employer from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War was Lockheed. Local start-ups of the time also benefited, and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds, not necessarily military ones. Take, for example, David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. An outspoken critic of government overreach, Packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things. \u201cI think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money,\u201d he once told HP executives. \u201cWhile this is an important result of a company\u2019s existence, we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being.\u201dThe next generation of Silicon Valley technologists took these sentiments further. They grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money; their first encounters with computers were often in government-funded university labs. Yet by the time they graduated from college in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of them wanted nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. So they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life. They stayed in academia, moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer-education centers and community message boards.Then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture, part cowboy. \u201cThe personal computer operator is the Electronic Man on Horseback riding into the (sinking) Western sun,\u201d declared a columnist in the newsletter InfoWorld in 1980. \u201cHe is the last of the rugged individualists, and the personal computer is his only effective weapon.\u201dWhether their employees realize it or not, today\u2019s tech giants all contain some defense-industry DNA. The result is the conflicted identity we now see in Silicon Valley. Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncomplicated Technology, and Why It\u2019s Always Worth Your Money", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you believe the marketing, you\u2019d think every new gadget will change your life \u2014 but many are confusing to use or doomed to obsolescence. Here\u2019s how to determine whether your purchase will stand the test of time.As my daughter said, it\u2019s \u201c3-D printing in real time.\u201d But the pen is fun to use and a great example of \u201cuncomplicated\u201d tech. There\u2019s no byzantine software to learn. In fact, you don\u2019t need a computer to use it, and you can get up-and-running quickly. In many ways, it\u2019s a model of how all consumer technology should be, and what sets the tech that stands the test of time from the gear that\u2019s forgotten in a year or two: It\u2019s uncomplicated. But Mr. Zeldman said that in the past 20 years, there has been a shift. The products that have been most successful, particularly digital products and services, \u201chaven\u2019t been the most advanced, sophisticated or beautiful, necessarily,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut they were the ones that understood what consumers wanted to do and enabled them to do it.\u201d This is what made Amazon, Google and Apple so powerful. This notion can also be used to discover why products fail. Take Microsoft\u2019s misstep in redesigning the Windows 8 operating system: The move was almost universally panned for removing the hallmark \u201cStart\u201d button users had come to rely on. The new \u201cMetro\u201d tiled interface was certainly sophisticated and attractive, reflected how the market was changing, and incorporated mobile-friendly design elements. But it misunderstood what consumers wanted \u2014 namely a consistent starting point. The key to determining whether some new piece of technology, whether it\u2019s a gadget, app or website, will work for you \u2014 and better yet, stand the test of time \u2014 is how uncomplicated it is, and how easy it is to do what the product is designed to do. Here are a few factors to help you evaluate before you sign up, or spend your money. For most things, you may only need a very simple product or app. Those who may want more sophistication will have to spend time finding a full-featured alternative. \u201cIf there\u2019s a learning curve,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cdoes it teach you a new way to think about that subject and make you better at what you do?\u201d If so, that product might be worth it. If you buy a high-end camera, you can learn how to shoot a vast array of creative photos. But if you\u2019re just shooting simple selfies, you might be wasting your money. \u201cIf I\u2019m downloading an app from Apple\u2019s app store, I read the reviews first. I study the screenshots there, since they\u2019re representative of the app,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m interested in downloading a photo app, but if the filters are ugly in the screenshot, I know it\u2019s not for me.\u201d It\u2019s also O.K. to stop using a cheap or inexpensive app after you\u2019ve downloaded it. \u201cOne of the great things about apps is that you can also try out a limited-feature version (only certain elements of the app are turned on), and see if it works for you before you decide to pay for the full product,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. It\u2019s difficult, but not impossible, to try out hardware like a camera or speaker. See if you can borrow a friend\u2019s device to try it out. Or try renting one. With a large item, like a TV, visit a friend who has bought the same (or similar) product and see how it works. As a teacher, I find this to be a valuable gauge of how much the company really cares. A stand-alone scanner I once bought had a manual that stopped midway through the instructions \u2014 not surprisingly, I rarely used that scanner. Conversely, a digital camera I once reviewed had a number of simple, well-illustrated tip sections built right into the camera menu, which were invaluable to a novice and even helpful for experienced shooters. Obviously, this is easier if you\u2019re not out a lot of money. \u201cIf an app isn\u2019t helping me,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cI just wipe it off my phone and don\u2019t give it another thought.\u201d The reviews might be good and it might be well regarded, but don\u2019t bother with it if it doesn\u2019t suit your needs. As for pricey gadgets, you\u2019ll want to do research beforehand. However, the same philosophy applies: After you\u2019ve done your research, if the product in question doesn\u2019t suit your needs or budget, walk away. Return it or, better yet, sell it. If you\u2019re looking for tech that\u2019s uncomplicated, you can\u2019t really make an assessment if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s available or what\u2019s changed. If you were looking for a high-end camera 10 years ago, the best viewfinders were through-the-lens viewfinders found on digital single-lens reflex cameras. At the time, electronic viewfinders were mediocre, grainy and inferior. Today\u2019s electronic viewfinders, though are just about as clear and sharp. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles B. Wang, Software Entrepreneur and New York Islanders Owner, Dies at 74", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles B. Wang, an entrepreneur and deal-maker who built a multibillion-dollar software business and became a majority owner of the New York Islanders, died on Sunday at his home in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He was 74.The cause was lung cancer, said John McEntee, a lawyer representing Mr. Wang and his family.Mr. Wang (pronounced Wong) was a contentious figure in the software industry. He was a Chinese immigrant who built a successful company. But he also became a symbol of lavish executive pay and was embroiled in an accounting scandal, though he was never formally charged.Mr. Wang, the chairman and chief executive, was fond of calling Computer Associates \u201cthe biggest software company nobody ever heard of.\u201dComputer Associates, founded in 1976, was an agglomeration of some 200 acquisitions, a testimony to Mr. Wang\u2019s deal-making fervor. He often looked for older companies with valuable rosters of customers and a business that seemed ripe for an overhaul. He would then fire executives and staff members while sharply cutting costs.The magazine called his management style \u201charsh but effective,\u201d delivering hefty profit margins. The workers who remained were treated well. The company\u2019s headquarters in Islandia, on Long Island, included a child-care center and other amenities. Fortune magazine included Computer Associates on its list of the best companies to work for in America.The corporate generosity started at the top, as Mr. Wang was one of the nation\u2019s highest-paid executives. In 1998, he received a $670 million stock grant.Criticism and scrutiny followed, eventually prompting a long-running federal investigation into the company\u2019s accounting practices.Mr. Wang stepped aside as chief executive in 2000, handing the job to his handpicked successor, Sanjay Kumar. In 2002, Mr. Kumar replaced Mr. Wang as chairman as well.In 2004, after a four-year investigation that focused on backdated contracts and whether they artificially inflated profits, Computer Associates reached an agreement with the Justice Department to avoid prosecution, which included paying $225 million in restitution to shareholders.But a year later, a 390-page report by the Computer Associates board, assisted by an outside law firm, found Mr. Wang culpable as well. \u201cNo significant decisions were made without his participation and approval,\u201d the report said.Mr. Wang dismissed the report as \u201cfallacious.\u201dBy then, Computer Associates had replaced its senior management team and most of its board members. The business had shrunk by 40 percent from 2000 to 2006.The company, which later changed its name to CA Technologies, would never be a highflier again. But new managers streamlined and stabilized the old business, and moved into new fields like software tools for internet-style computing. This year, Broadcom, a big chip maker, bought CA Technologies for nearly $19 billion.Charles B. Wang was born on Aug. 19, 1944, in Shanghai. When he was 8, his family moved to New York, where his father, a former judge in pre-revolutionary China, taught international law at St. John\u2019s University, and his mother, Mary, studied and worked as a librarian.Mr. Wang is survived by his mother; two brothers, Anthony and Francis; his wife, Nancy Li; and three children \u2014 Kimberly Dey, with his first wife, Ingrid S. Wang, and Jasmine and Cameron, with Ms. Li. He is also survived by three grandchildren.Mr. Wang graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and then Queens College, majoring in math and physics. After graduation, he answered a help-wanted ad for a computer programmer at Columbia University. Mr. Wang had never used a computer, but he talked his way into the job, taught himself to code and had a knack for it.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018After a series of programming and sales jobs, Mr. Wang and a few colleagues founded Computer Associates International.Mr. Wang\u2019s philanthropy included founding Smile Train, which provides cleft-palate surgeries free to children in developing countries. He also created a program to develop ice hockey in China.Local loyalty, more than a sports passion, seemed to have led to his participation in the National Hockey League. Mr. Wang\u2019s favorite sport was basketball, and he had attended only one pro hockey game when he was sought out in 2000 to become a major investor in the New York Islanders.While in control, he unsuccessfully sought to have a new arena built in Uniondale, N.Y., but eventually moved the team to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In the end, his wish came true \u2014 the Islanders are moving back to the island, to the newly built Belmont Park arena, expected to open in 2021. They will play at the Nassau Coliseum, their old home, for part of the next three seasons.As a nonexpert, Mr. Wang had some unconventional suggestions, like trying out sumo wrestlers for goalies. \u201cHe assumed nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler,\u201d Mike Milbury, a former general manager of the Islanders, told The New York Times.Still, his enthusiasm was not in doubt.

{"Headline": "Google Turns Over Identities of Bloggers on Benfica", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe information was turned over as part of a lawsuit filed by the team, the Lisbon-based Benfica, earlier this year in United States District Court in California as part of an effort to stop the bloggers.Benfica, the serial national champion, has been battling a tide of leaked information for much of the past year that has cast a negative shadow over it . The leaks have been drip-fed onto a specially created website since December, producing sensational headlines and leading to a crisis within a club that counts some of the country\u2019s most important politicians and business figures as members.However, Benfica was unable to stop the leaks through Portugal\u2019s legal system. So the club, a two-time European champion, turned in April to California\u2019s courts. It issued subpoenas to Google and a handful of other companies that own the platforms used by the bloggers.The efforts have paid off. \u201cWe only confirm that we made agreements with those digital platforms,\u201d said a spokesman for Benfica. He declined to provide further details of the information the team received.In a statement, Google said it complied with the legal process. \u201cGoogle gave notice to impacted users who then had an opportunity to challenge the legal process in a U.S. court,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the company.The owner of the popular Artista do Dia blog is among those whose user identity has very likely been passed on to Benfica by Google. He received an email from Google in September telling him he could try to quash Benfica\u2019s demand through a legal challenge.Faced with thousands of dollars of legal fees, the author, whose identity The New York Times has been confirmed, was only able to reply with an impassioned email, in which he outlined that he had not been responsible for the leak, and like many others, had written about a subject of enormous public interest.\u201cI thought Google and billions of users of Google services were protected by a company with principles and, above all, respect for users who trust their platforms,\u201d said the writer, a professional services worker with two children. \u201cI think it opens a very serious precedent that will only allow those with financial possibilities to remain anonymous.\u201dBenfica\u2019s status within Portugal is immense. The team counts at least half of the country\u2019s 10 million citizens as fans, the weight of which gives it a greater cultural and social significance than most ordinary sports teams. Even in good times, details of exploits inside its Estadio da Luz home dominate local media.The leaks, which began last year, have purported to show influence peddling schemes that targeted top soccer officials and, perhaps most worryingly for the club, efforts to influence the refereeing system. Benfica denies wrongdoing. It has separately been charged with illegally obtaining confidential information from a mole working inside the justice ministry.Albert Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said under current regulations Google had little option but to comply with Benfica\u2019s subpoena. Internet companies get hundreds of thousands of similar requests, said Gidari, who spent 20 years representing some of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies including Google. \u201cIt isn\u2019t scalable to know what\u2019s behind each case,\u201d he said.Google already goes \u201cone step beyond\u201d what it is required to do by giving notice of the subpoena to users, he added.Benfica\u2019s search for the bloggers and web users has dominated the headlines since The New York Times first reported on the issue earlier this month. Benfica fans have also tried to unmask the identity of those behind the blogs. In at least one case, the name and photograph of a man suspected of being one of the bloggers was widely circulated on the internet but turned out to be wrong.Fans of Benfica\u2019s rivals, Sporting Clube de Portugal and F.C. Porto, are behind most of the blogs the team is targeting for legal action. Benfica alleges the two other teams are part of a conspiracy to discredit it, a claim that is typical in soccer in Portugal, where club executives frequently launch allegations against one another. The leaks first appeared on a weekly television show on Porto\u2019s channel, before a website called O Mercado de Benfica appeared in December 2017.Porto\u2019s communications director Francisco Marques said he received the data anonymously from an individual purporting to be a fan of the club. Marques said he passed all the files he received to the police. He suspects the website publishing the leaked information is run by the same person.In its lawsuit in California, Benfica claimed the details published online were \u201ctrade secrets\u201d that buttressed its success in winning championships and cultivated an academy system that generated \u201cmore than any other club in the world\u201d in player sales this decade. The claim did not mention police raids on Benfica\u2019s offices or ongoing investigations into alleged results manipulation and corruption it faces.\u201cDespite commencing numerous actions, both civil and criminal, in Portugal, Benfica has thus far been unable to stem the tide of stolen information or identify the thieves. It is clear to Benfica that only with the cooperation of the hosting organizations will Benfica be able to stop the campaign to discredit it,\u201d its U.S. lawyers wrote.Gidari, the former privacy lawyer, said the suit seemed similar to others brought by other large organizations confronting the public disclosure of damaging information.He added that though in some cases there may be valid reasons behind subpoenas, they are often \u201cstrategic lawsuits brought to silence critics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon HQ2 Watch: Northern Virginia Checks the Most Boxes", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon won\u2019t say a word about where it plans to put its much-hyped second headquarters. Officials in the 20 cities and regions named as finalists say that they don\u2019t know anything \u2014 and that even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t share it publicly.But that hasn\u2019t stopped investors, economic officials and developers from trying to reverse engineer the HQ2 search, to understand what a company seen as embodying the future wants and needs, and what local governments should do to be part of that future.Many have gone a step further, suggesting that Crystal City, an older office area being revitalized just across the Potomac River from Washington, offers the best site. Its upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.\u201cThere are a lot of merits to a lot of these places, but at the end of the day, all of the signs are pointing to Crystal City,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it.\u201dAmazon says it will announce its decision by the end of the year. Other areas that are regularly named as strong contenders include Chicago, Atlanta and Austin, Tex. Washington and the Maryland suburbs are also finalists.The interest in the area rose a few weeks ago when Mr. Bezos headlined an event at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. More than 1,000 executives, ambassadors and politicians gathered in a ballroom and flocked around him, pressing in to take selfies and shake hands.When the formal program began, Mr. Bezos was soon asked the obvious: Where would he be opening HQ2? The crowd cheered and whistled at the question, posed with more than a hint that the headquarters should be right there in the region, then playfully booed as Mr. Bezos demurred.\u201cBe nice,\u201d Mr. Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, pleaded with a laugh.And while Washington and Maryland are reliably Democratic, Virginia is more of a swing state, giving Amazon potential champions from both parties.\u201cIf you had your headquarters in a city and were responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, you could be seen as a good corporate citizen,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has followed Amazon\u2019s urban development for more than two decades.The headquarters search centers on Amazon\u2019s seemingly insatiable appetite to hire enough of the talent it needs. To do so, the company says, it needs to be somewhere with a strong talent pipeline and the urban attributes, like public transportation and culture, that attract other employees to move.\u201cPeople want to be where there is vibrancy at the street level,\u201d said Jodie McLean, chief executive of Edens, a developer who has worked around the region and is involved with Washington\u2019s bid.The region is home to one of the most educated work forces in the country. Amazon already has a growing presence, with more than 2,500 employees in corporate and technical roles, like lobbyists in Washington and engineers at data centers in the Virginia suburbs serving government contracts.Crystal City is about as close to Washington as possible while still being in Virginia. It\u2019s one Metro stop away from National Airport, and just a few stops across the Potomac River from Washington.\u201cIt is a dense, up-and-coming, mixed-used area that has a lot of opportunity for more development,\u201d Ms. Liu said.Other locations in Northern Virginia fit many of Amazon\u2019s requirements. But they\u2019re more suburban, and being in the middle of Seattle has become a central part of Amazon\u2019s identity.One question that looms over Crystal City, and Northern Virginia more broadly, is whether it is hip enough for the employees Amazon wants to attract. Crystal City is a jumble of mostly outdated, low-slung offices built decades ago for defense contractors, and a smattering of retail outlets. That has left it with a high vacancy rate, around 20 percent, according to JLL, a commercial real estate brokerage.JBG Smith, a publicly traded investment trust, owns large swaths of Crystal City, and its chief executive, Matt Kelly, spoke before Mr. Bezos at the Economic Club, fueling yet another round of speculation among HQ2 watchers.\u201cEverybody is talking about Crystal City,\u201d said Stephen S. Fuller, a leading regional economist at George Mason University. \u201cThe fit is good.\u201dJBG Smith has big plans for Crystal City and has already signed Alamo Drafthouse, the movie theater chain, to anchor a new retail district. It\u2019s working with the local government to convert a highway that bisects the area into a more pleasant, tree-lined boulevard.\u201cSome of the dreaming that is going on is just waiting for an accelerant, and that\u2019s what I think Amazon would be,\u201d Dr. Fuller said.Among some in the region\u2019s real estate crowd, it has become almost a joke that Mr. Bezos should buy JBG Smith outright.\u201cIf you are an opportunist, it looks like this would be of interest,\u201d Dr. Fuller said. \u201cAnd clearly Amazon has been opportunistic in their whole history.\u201dAmazon may not have the patience and trust that Northern Virginia can be transformed, especially when Washington already is so rich, right across the Potomac.\u201cThe District has magnificent neighborhoods and magnificent urbanity,\u201d Professor Florida said.Like everyone who guesses where HQ2 may land, he added a big caveat. \u201cI\u2019m not in Jeff Bezos\u2019 mind,\u201d he said.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Tech Talent Shortage: Quantum Computing Researchers", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Savoie, founder and chief executive of a start-up called Zapata, offered jobs this year to three scientists who specialize in an increasingly important technology called quantum computing. They accepted.Several months later, the Cambridge, Mass., company was still waiting for the State Department to approve visas for the specialists. All three are foreigners, born in Europe and Asia.Whether the delays were the result of tougher immigration policy or just red tape, Mr. Savoie\u2019s predicament was typical of a growing concern among American businesses and universities: Unless policies and priorities change, they will have trouble attracting the talent needed to build quantum technology, which could make today\u2019s computers look like toys.It is a story that is being told repeatedly in the tech industry in the United States. As companies push into new technologies, they are finding it harder to identify qualified engineers and researchers. They are also facing tougher immigration rules for foreign-born tech experts and competing with tech centers like Montreal, London, Paris and Beijing.International competition is a particularly thorny issue in quantum computing because one of these machines \u2014 in theory \u2014 could crack the encryption that protects sensitive information inside governments and businesses around the world. If a quantum computer can be built, it will be exponentially more powerful than even today\u2019s supercomputers.Last month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy invited experts from government, industry and academia to Washington for a daylong policy meeting dedicated to quantum technologies. Several attendees, including Mr. Savoie, expressed concern that the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies could affect quantum research in academia and corporations.\u201cThe concern is: Are we still the destination for the best and the brightest in science and engineering and technology?\u201d said Roger Falcone, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the meeting in Washington.The labor pool in quantum computing is even smaller. By some accounts, fewer than a thousand people in the world can claim to be doing leading research in the field.For decades, quantum computing was purely experimental. When it was first proposed in the early 1980s, the goal was to build a system based on the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics. Over the past several years, scientists have shown that they can build these machines, if only on a small scale.With traditional computers, transistors store \u201cbits\u201d of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do.When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Scientists who build these systems specialize in the physics of those very small or cold things, which is nothing like the physics we experience from day to day.\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people who know how to do this,\u201d said Steven Girvin, a professor of physics at Yale University. \u201cThese machines are quasi-hand-built by Ph.D.s in physics.\u201dBecause these machines could eventually break today\u2019s encryption, some believe there are reasons to be careful as large numbers of foreigners move into the field and to find ways of building a larger pool of American-born talent that can handle sensitive breakthroughs.\u201cWe need to be cognizant\u201d of the potential for academic and industrial espionage, said Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe answer is not to shut down the flow of people from abroad, but to find ways of better protecting intellectual property.\u201dAs American tech giants like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft accelerate their quantum computing efforts, work is speeding up in China and Europe as well. The Chinese government is working on a $10 billion national lab for quantum research in Hefei, set to open in 2020, and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is building a lab of its own. In 2016, the European Union invested 1 billion euros \u2014 roughly $1.2 billion \u2014 in quantum computing.Could those efforts race past progress in the United States and possibly threaten national security? \u201cIf you are talking about a quantum computer in Russia or China or anywhere else, you are talking about a weaponized technology,\u201d said Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington.The good news is no one has been able to build a commercially viable quantum computer so far, so there is time to fix the talent problem. Lawmakers and government officials are exploring strategies to help ensure that the pool of available talent grows.Jacob Taylor, a veteran quantum researcher who oversees quantum strategy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, played down concerns that other countries could beat the United States to quantum computing. \u201cWe have been the leader in this world for a long time,\u201d he said.In artificial intelligence research, many worry that too much talent is moving from academia into industry, lured by high salaries, bonuses and stock options. In the quantum field, policymakers like Dr. Taylor hope to address this problem by funding projects at university and government labs.\u201cI see the country at a crossroads with quantum information systems,\u201d said Brian DeMarco, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois who specializes in quantum computing and has worked with government organizations on the technology. \u201cI can see things not working out, where the balance is not good, and it derails our ability to compete.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Gab, an Extremist-Friendly Site, Pittsburgh Shooting Suspect Aired His Hatred in Full", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers\u2019s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online.But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a \u201cfree speech\u201d alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers:There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert \u2014 or \u201cred pill,\u201d in the parlance of right-wing internet activists \u2014 a new generation to their cause.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business.\u201cThe challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,\u201d said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. \u201cIf an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren\u2019t going to think it\u2019s a good place for their baby photos.\u201dBut the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms \u2014 and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab.\u201cWe have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers and several payment processors,\u201d the statement read.In addition, GoDaddy, the domain name provider, told Gab it had 24 hours to move its domain name to another service, after finding content on the site that promoted violence.\u201cWhen a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,\u201d a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons.In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab\u2019s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers\u2019s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation.\u201cBecause he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,\u201d Mr. Torba wrote. \u201cThey would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.\u201dMr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab\u2019s core mission of promoting free speech.\u201cTwitter and other platforms police \u2018hate speech\u2019 as long as it isn\u2019t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis double standard does not exist on Gab.\u201dWhat did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers\u2019s hatred for Jews.The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab\u2019s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology.\u201cGab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,\u201d said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. \u201cGab\u2019s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.\u201dIn the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate.On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers\u2019s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement\u2019s long-term prospects by resorting to violence.\u201cThis guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,\u201d one member wrote.A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting.On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab\u2019s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because \u201cGab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.\u201dAsked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer.\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.\u2022 Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.\u2022 The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT.Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. \u201cThey\u2019re making more cars,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to say if they are making money on every one.\u201dFacebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache.Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman \u2014 and it could continue.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. \u201cThese developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry\u2019s challenges.
