{"Headline": "The Future of Electric Cars Is Brighter With Elon Musk in It", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "OpinionFederal regulators were right to rein in his reckless management, but the company and the global auto industry need him.Supported byMr. MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.His leadership matters well beyond Silicon Valley. Tesla, under Mr. Musk, has been the single most significant force driving the global automotive industry \u2014 and the consumers who purchase cars \u2014 to take the prospect of a fully electric vehicle future seriously. No other electric vehicle initiative \u2014 from Nissan\u2019s Leaf and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt and Bolt to the new wave of luxury electric cars being rolled out by German automakers and new companies funded by Chinese billionaires \u2014 has achieved the impact on the public\u2019s imagination, brand loyalty or sales success of Tesla. Those initiatives might not even have occurred without the prod of Tesla\u2019s example. Aside from his vision for electric vehicles, Tesla under Mr. Musk has accomplished a remarkable feat: the creation of a new automaker. In the modern era, nearly all new entrants have started in developing countries, at the low end; most new automakers founded in the United States and Europe have failed. Tesla\u2019s approach is not what most expected from a Silicon Valley disrupter. Unlike Apple\u2019s iPhone \u2014 \u201cdesigned by Apple in California, assembled in China\u201d \u2014 nearly all of Tesla\u2019s value chain from product conception through delivery to customers is carried out by the company itself. Tesla\u2019s travails in mastering high-volume production of a mass-market product, the Model 3, are well known, and it may never attain Toyota-like levels of efficiency. But if Tesla can persevere, it could achieve the elusive high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle that would be a tipping point for the future of the industry.Tesla under Mr. Musk has also established a template for what the \u201cmobility\u201d firms of the future must do. Chief among these is the ability to update vehicle functionality via over-the-air software updates; the addition of algorithm-driven features that offer partially autonomous operation along with the collection of data to improve those algorithms; connectivity with the consumer to provide services; and the ability for a customer to configure and purchase a vehicle online. Tesla under new leadership, or as a unit of a much larger company, might be able to maintain what Mr. Musk has achieved. But Tesla\u2019s survival thus far has been a tightrope act, and falling off is virtually guaranteed without Mr. Musk. He has proved uniquely and idiosyncratically able to sustain the loyalty and fervent belief of investors, customers and employees. While Tesla has benefited from public subsidies such as consumer tax credits, federal grants, and the sale of zero emission credits to other automakers, Mr. Musk\u2019s ability as a salesman is apparent in his success at raising private funds and sustaining high valuations. Even Tesla\u2019s luck in buying its factory in Fremont, Calif., at a bargain-basement price from Toyota is attributable to Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to charm Toyota\u2019s chief executive. Tesla owners also seem to identify closely with Mr. Musk. For the Model 3, they had to put down a $1,000 deposit, and most have been waiting months for their new cars. This willingness to commit to a purchase before the vehicle is even available for viewing has enormous value. It means Tesla spends almost no money on marketing, and it knows before building each vehicle who the customer will be and how he wants it configured. No other auto manufacturer enjoys this type of prerelease enthusiasm \u2014 and it is Mr. Musk who single-handedly sustains it. Were Tesla to become the electric car division of an existing automaker, even if its products stay strong, this pattern of advance demand commitments would be unlikely to continue.To be sure, Mr. Musk needs help as a manager. Steve Jobs eventually found Tim Cook; Mark Zuckerberg found Sheryl Sandberg. Mr. Musk has already found a strong managerial partner, Gwynne Shotwell, for SpaceX. He has pointed to his elevation of Jerome Guillen, a seasoned auto industry executive, to president of automotive as a similar move for Tesla. Mr. Guillen has not yet stepped forward in a prominent way as co-leader, but the S.E.C.\u2019s action, along with a much stronger board of directors, could nudge Mr. Musk toward expanding Mr. Guillen\u2019s influence. John Paul MacDuffie is a professor of management at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

In 2018, Google is expected to capture about 60 percent of global search advertising spending, according to the research firm eMarketer.On Thursday, Alphabet reported a net profit of $9.19 billion in the third quarter, up 37 percent from a year earlier. Quarterly revenue was $33.74 billion, an increase of 21 percent but slightly lower than analysts expected, pushing the company\u2019s stock price down about 5 percent in after-hours trading.Alphabet\u2019s profits, however, exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, reflecting a lower tax rate that it attributed to the impact of tax cuts passed in the United States last year. Alphabet\u2019s quarterly tax rate was 9 percent versus 16 percent a year earlier.The company appeared to be trying to demonstrate that those tax cuts are benefiting American workers. Google said 80 percent of its capital spending during the third quarter was used in the United States. Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September, an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.In a conference call with analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said it was still too early to determine the potential impact of new policies that the company was putting in place in Europe.The European Union fined Google $5.1 billion in July for abusing its market dominance in smartphone software.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Why Facebook Broke Its Revenue Growth", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe social network reported slowing revenue growth in its quarterly earnings yesterday \u2014 and said that would probably be the new normal.Facebook does not charge as much for advertisers to run ads on \u201cStories\u201d as it does in the News Feed, so shifting to ephemeral messaging may not be as lucrative, the company said. That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association.

At the time, companies including Delta, United Airlines, MetLife and several car-rental outlets dropped deals with the N.R.A.But FedEx had refused to do so. In February, the company said that while it opposed civilian ownership of assault rifles, it \u201cdoes not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.\u201dA single number could unsettle China\u2019s economy in the coming weeks.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019 Pits Teenage Rage Against Dark Magic", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is frequently chilling, but it\u2019s rarely much of an adventure. Netflix\u2019s new spin on the lore of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, starring Kiernan Shipka (\u201cMad Men\u201d) as our spooky heroine, gets off to a spellbinding start, but over 10 episodes becomes more toil and trouble than it\u2019s worth.When we meet Sabrina Spellman, she\u2019s carefully crossing days off her calendar, leading to the date where she\u2019s written \u201c16th birthday\u201d and, just underneath that, \u201cdark baptism.\u201d It\u2019s hard being a teenager these days. Or whatever days \u201cSabrina\u201d is set in: The show has a \u201950s retro aesthetic, from the cars to the crinoline, but modern sensibilities about feminism, gender expression and the costs of serving as Satan\u2019s handmaid.The Devil isn\u2019t just in the details here; he\u2019s everywhere, with his clomping hooves and goat head, wreaking gruesome havoc and dispatching his servants to torture and coerce Sabrina into falling in line. But Sabrina doesn\u2019t want to submit to baptism, and she doesn\u2019t want to sign her life over to the Dark Lord. She wants to stay in the ordinary world, alongside her doting boyfriend, Harvey (Ross Lynch), and her spunky besties, Roz (Jaz Sinclair) and Susie (Lachlan Watson). Once you enlist in Satan\u2019s service, you can\u2019t have silly sleepovers anymore.Sabrina is half witch, half \u201cmortal\u201d \u2014 her father was a powerful warlock and her mother a regular human, and since they died, Sabrina has been raised by her witch aunts (Lucy Davis and Miranda Otto) in a musty funeral home. They\u2019re insistent that she do right by the Spellman family name and give herself, body and soul, to the Church of Night.Like any teenage hero, Sabrina would rather do things her way. \u201cI want freedom and power,\u201d she pleads. Too bad, toots \u2014 it\u2019s a man\u2019s world out there, and shivering teenage virgins kneeling in their white slips while powerful older men anoint their foreheads with blood is just how things go.That ritual, with a vulnerable Sabrina quivering in fear while surrounded by eerie witch folk, is but one gorgeous tableau. As with many modern series, the show is often literally too dark to see what\u2019s happening. But in the rare moments of (again, actual) illumination, it\u2019s as rich as an oil painting, with Shipka practically glowing.The constant haze and unnatural color palette make \u201cSabrina\u201d a dead ringer for CW\u2019s murder-soaked spin on the Archie comics \u201cRiverdale,\u201d which is no surprise. The Sabrina character is part of the greater Archie universe, and the two shows share a creator, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. In all the ways that \u201cRiverdale\u201d turns Archie and the gang into \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d Junior, \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is more like \u201cTrue Blood\u201d For teenagers, with a parade of supernatural entities and an overpresent mythology that threatens to bleed the joy out of the storytelling.Like most Netflix originals, \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is the wrong number of episodes. It could have been a taut and thrilling shorter series, or a set-\u2019em-up, knock-\u2019em-down occult procedural like \u201cSupernatural.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s not quite either, and it burns through its most interesting parts while stalling out during its dullest.Sabrina triumphs over bullies and monsters and misogynists, with maggot-filled apples littering her path, but the series gets repetitive. After a while, determined women shouting Latin incantations while scowling at the camera starts to feel like Harry Potter runoff. The obstacles are too familiar and too pat, and no one is ever really a match for Sabrina\u2019s derring-do.When it\u2019s humming along, though, \u201cSabrina\u201d is a blast. It\u2019s a horror show, with demons galore and a threatening posse of young witches who dress alike and move in an undulating herd. It knows what \u201cThe Craft\u201d knew, which is that teenage girl rage is a powerful force.Advertisement"}

Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organization that combats hate speech. \u201cIn the past, they couldn\u2019t find audiences for their poison. Now, with a click or a post or a tweet, they can spread their ideas with a velocity we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dFacebook said it was investigating the anti-Semitic hashtags on Instagram after The New York Times flagged them. Sarah Pollack, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement that Instagram was seeing new posts related to the shooting on Saturday and that it was \u201cactively reviewing hashtags and content related to these events and removing content that violates our policies.\u201dYouTube said it has strict policies prohibiting content that promotes hatred or incites violence and added that it takes down videos that violate those rules.Social media companies have said that identifying and removing hate speech and disinformation \u2014 or even defining what constitutes such content \u2014 is difficult. Facebook said this year that only 38 percent of hate speech on its site was flagged by its internal systems. In contrast, its systems pinpointed and took down 96 percent of what it defined as adult nudity, and 99.5 percent of terrorist content.YouTube said users reported nearly 10 million videos from April to June for potentially violating its community guidelines. Just under one million of those videos were found to have broken the rules and were removed, according to the company\u2019s data. YouTube\u2019s automated detection tools also took down an additional 6.8 million videos in that period.But even as the companies throw money and resources at the problems, some of their employees said on Monday that they were rethinking whether the social media services could have a positive effect.At Twitter, for example, employees are increasingly concerned that the company is floundering in its treatment of toxic language and hate speech, said four current and former employees who asked for anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements.Twitter did not address questions about its employee concerns on Monday, but said it needed to be \u201cthoughtful and considered\u201d in its policies.\u201cProgress in this space is tough but we\u2019ve never been as committed and as focused in our efforts,\u201d Twitter said. \u201cServing public conversation and trying to make it healthier is our singular mission here.\u201dInstagram, which was created as a site for people to share curated photos of their food, adorable pets and cute children, has largely avoided scrutiny over disinformation and hate content \u2014 especially when compared with its parent, Facebook. But social media researchers said that the site had over the last year become more of a hotbed for hateful posts and videos meant to provoke discord.That was evident after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, with the mushrooming of new anti-Semitic content on the site. On Sunday, one new video added to Instagram claimed that the state of Israel was created by the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish family. Underneath the video, the hashtags read #conspiracy and #jewworldorder.By late Monday, it had been viewed more than 1,640 times and shared to other social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Gadget Is a Video-Chat Screen With a Camera That Follows You", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2004, Facebook has said it wants to bring the world closer together. To accomplish that goal, the company has relied mostly on the web and smartphone apps.But software is no longer enough. On Monday, Facebook introduced a pair of video-calling devices \u2014 Portal and Portal Plus \u2014 to help expand its reach into people\u2019s living rooms.Portal, which has a 10-inch screen, will sell for $199, while the other model, with a 15-inch display that can be rotated, will be priced at $349. Facebook plans to offer the gadgets on a stand-alone website in time for the holidays, and has a major marketing campaign in the works.The devices are Facebook\u2019s first major foray into designing, building and selling consumer hardware from scratch. If the Portals are successful, the company could encourage more people to use its social network regularly to keep in touch with friends and family, as well as for apps like Spotify and Pandora.To address privacy concerns with Portal and Portal Plus, Facebook said the products include an electronic kill switch for the front-facing camera, as well as a cover for the lens. In addition, video calls are encrypted, and the camera\u2019s A.I. technology runs on the device itself, not on Facebook\u2019s servers, the company said.The company said the utility of the devices, which work on a household Wi-Fi connection, would convince people of their importance in a home. The devices are built atop Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, and the communication software is hooked into a user\u2019s web of Facebook connections. Once Portal is connected to a Messenger account, people can video chat with anyone in their network across devices, be it on Portal, a tablet, a smartphone or a desktop computer.Instead of building its own virtual assistant three years after Alexa\u2019s debut, Facebook worked with Amazon. Like other Amazon-powered products, Portal can be controlled by speaking the word \u201cAlexa\u201d before a question or a request, like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d or \u201cSet a timer for 10 minutes.\u201dJonathan Collins, a research director for ABI Research, said it was wise for Facebook to collaborate with Amazon. While creating a digital assistant has helped Apple, Google and Amazon make their products look more attractive, there was no clear benefit for Facebook to make one of its own, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an obvious link to what they do for people at present,\u201d which is to deepen people\u2019s relationships, Mr. Collins said.Facebook had worked on hardware previously, though its involvement with Portal goes much deeper and further. In 2013, the company and the manufacturer HTC produced the HTC First, a smartphone that ran on a new Facebook-based operating system. The phone flopped.The company also sells virtual-reality goggles, which it got into when the start-up Oculus was already building those products. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014.Rafa Camargo, Facebook\u2019s vice president who oversees Portal, said that when his team said it wanted to work on a smart home product with a large screen, his peers reacted in disbelief \u2014 especially since Amazon and Apple were focused on speakers and not video.\u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\u2019re nuts. The whole thing is just about smart speakers and just voice,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Camargo, who joined Facebook about two years ago.But he said that voice was just one feature of the product and that Facebook could offer customers a different type of experience.\u201cWe come from focusing on people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Hawkins Is Finally Ready to Explain His Brain Research", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 In the global race to build artificial intelligence, it was a missed opportunity.Jeff Hawkins, a Silicon Valley veteran who spent the last decade exploring the mysteries of the human brain, arranged a meeting with DeepMind, the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab.Scientists at DeepMind, which is owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, want to build machines that can do anything the brain can do. Mr. Hawkins runs a little company with one goal: figure out how the brain works and then reverse engineer it.The meeting, set for April at DeepMind\u2019s offices in London, never happened. DeepMind employs hundreds of A.I. researchers along with a team of seasoned neuroscientists. But when Mr. Hawkins chatted with Demis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind, before his visit, they agreed that almost no one at the London lab would understand his work.Mr. Hawkins says that before the world can build artificial intelligence, it must explain human intelligence so it can create machines that genuinely work like the brain. \u201cYou do not have to emulate the entire brain,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you do have to understand how the brain works and emulate the important parts.\u201dAt his company, called Numenta, that is what he hopes to do. Mr. Hawkins, 61, began his career as an engineer, created two classic mobile computer companies, Palm and Handspring, and taught himself neuroscience along the way.Now, after more than a decade of quiet work at Numenta, he thinks he and a handful of researchers working with him are well on their way to cracking the problem.On Monday, at a conference in the Netherlands, he is expected to unveil their latest research, which he says explains the inner workings of cortical columns, a basic building block of brain function.How a larger community of researchers react to Mr. Hawkins\u2019s work is hard to predict: Will they decide his research is worth exploring? Or will they write him off as too unorthodox in his methods and much too sure of himself?Mr. Hawkins has been following his own, all-encompassing idea for how the brain works. It is a step beyond the projects of most neuroscientists, like understanding the brain of a fruit fly or exploring the particulars of human sight.His theory starts with cortical columns. Cortical columns are a crucial part of the neocortex, the part of the brain that handles sight, hearing, language and reason. Neuroscientists don\u2019t agree on how the neocortex works.Mr. Hawkins says cortical columns handle every task in the same way, a sort of computer algorithm that is repeated over and over again. It is a logical approach to the brain for a man who spent decades building new kinds of computing devices.All he has to do is figure out the algorithm.A number of neuroscientists like the idea, and some are pursuing similar ideas. They also praise Mr. Hawkins for his willingness to think so broadly. Being a maverick is not easily done in academia and the world of traditional research. But it\u2019s a little easier when you can fund your own work, as Mr. Hawkins has.Still, some wonder if his self-funded operation, isolated from the rigors of academic interaction, is a quixotic adventure. They have been researching the brain one little piece at a time for a good reason: Piecing how it all works together is a monumental, hard-to-fathom task.\u201cIt is clear we need a better understanding of intelligence,\u201d said Tomaso Poggio, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who introduced Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Hassabis. \u201cBut Jeff is doing this the hard way.\u201d\u201cThe brain is by far the most complex piece of highly excitable matter in the known universe by any measure,\u201d said Christof Koch, the chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science. \u201cWe don\u2019t even understand the brain of a worm.\u201dIn 1979, with an article in Scientific American, Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize winner for his DNA research, called for an all-encompassing theory of the brain, something that could explain this \u201cprofoundly mysterious\u201d organ.Mr. Hawkins graduated from Cornell in 1979 with a degree in electrical engineering. Over the next several years, he worked at Intel, the computer chip giant, and Grid Systems, an early laptop company. But after reading that magazine article, he decided the brain would be his life\u2019s work.He proposed a neuroscience lab inside Intel. After the idea was rejected, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. His doctoral thesis proposal was rejected, too. He was, suffice to say, an outlier.In 1992, Mr. Hawkins founded Palm Computing. A decade and a half before the iPhone, he had created a hand-held computer for the masses. When he hired the company\u2019s chief executive, Donna Dubinsky, he warned that whenever possible, he would drop his work with Palm and return to neuroscience. \u201cThat was always there, simmering in the background,\u201d Ms. Dubinsky said.Around the time of the second sale, Mr. Hawkins built his own neuroscience lab. But it was short-lived. He could not get a lab full of academics focused on his neocortical theory. So, along with Ms. Dubinsky and an A.I. researcher named Dileep George, he founded Numenta.The company spent years trying to build and sell software, but eventually, after Mr. George left, it settled into a single project. Funded mostly by Mr. Hawkins \u2014 he won\u2019t say how much he has spent on it \u2014 the company\u2019s sole purpose has been explaining the neocortex and then reverse engineering it.Inside Numenta, Mr. Hawkins sits in a small office. Five other neuroscientists, mostly self-taught, work in a single room outside his door.Mr. Hawkins said a moment of clarity came about two and a half years ago, while he was sitting in his office, staring at a coffee cup.He touched the cup and dragged his finger across the rim. Then he leapt to his feet and ran through the door.As Mr. Hawkins looked at that cup, he decided that cortical columns did not just capture sensations. They captured the location of those sensations. They captured the world in three dimensions rather than two. Everything was seen in relation to what was around it.If cortical columns handle sight and touch in this way, Mr. Hawkins thought, they handle hearing, language and even math in similar ways. He\u2019s been working on proving that ever since.\u201cWhen the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThat is how it understands everything.\u201dThe source of tension between Mr. Hawkins and other brain and A.I. researchers is not that they necessarily think he is wrong. It\u2019s that they simply don\u2019t know because what he has been trying to do has been so different. And so wildly ambitious.For the science to advance, what Mr. Hawkins has been working on can\u2019t stay in a silo. His ideas could benefit from extensive experimentation with other neuroscientists, said Nelson Spruston, a senior director at the Janelia Research Campus, a research lab in Virginia that focuses on neuroscience. \u201cA continuous cycle of testing and revising biologically inspired models of neural computation is the key to developing insightful theories of the brain,\u201d he said.Translation: Mr. Hawkins will have to open his work to rigorous scrutiny and find a way to interact with researchers who most likely have never looked at the brain the way he does.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Is Teaching Children How to Act Online. Is It the Best Role Model? ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant is positioning itself in schools as a trusted authority on digital citizenship at a moment when the company\u2019s data-handling practices are under growing scrutiny.Google is on a mission to teach children how to be safe online. That is the message behind \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d a so-called digital-citizenship education program that the technology giant developed for schools.Among other things, these critics argue, the company\u2019s lessons give children the mistaken impression that the main threat they face online is from malicious hackers and bullies, glossing over the privacy concerns that arise when tech giants like Google itself collect users\u2019 personal information and track their actions online.As an analysis of Google\u2019s curriculum published in Emerging Library & Information Perspectives, a graduate student journal at Western University in Ontario, put it, \u201c\u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 generally presents Google as impartial and trustworthy, which is especially problematic given that the target audience is impressionable youth.\u201dJim Accomando, the president of the National P.T.A., said that the organization \u201cdoes not endorse any commercial product or service,\u201d although companies that give money to the group may receive \u201cpromotional consideration.\u201d\u201cGoogle is a great example of a partner that aligns with our goals, and they have deep tech knowledge that they bring to the table,\u201d he said.The cartoon game, Interland, offers an animated world \u201cpresented by Google.\u201d In it, children navigate spammers and hackers in \u201cReality River\u201d and consider who in their social network can see what they post online on \u201cMindful Mountain.\u201dThe game, which comes with a lesson plan and classroom activities, is meant to teach children \u201cthe fundamentals of digital citizenship and safety so they can explore the online world with confidence,\u201d according to Google\u2019s site description. Once students learn skills like how to create strong passwords and not share information with strangers, the program encourages them to be \u201cfearless\u201d online explorers.Kerry Gallagher, an assistant principal at St. John\u2019s Preparatory School in Danvers, Mass., said Google\u2019s program helped students learn concrete ways to be safer and kinder online.\u201cRather than being a bystander, they feel as though they have the skills to intervene\u201d when they observe other children being mean online, Ms. Gallagher said. She added that younger students also gained a \u201cbetter sense for who they should share things with and who they shouldn\u2019t, depending on what that content is.\u201dGoogle\u2019s name appears on every screen of Interland and the program\u2019s certificates, which also incorporate Google\u2019s colors. The curriculum features cartoon robots that resemble the company\u2019s Android robot icon. To some observers, the game is essentially a big ad for Google.David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit advocacy group, likened the program to asking Budweiser to talk to parents and children about underage drinking.\u201cThere is an increasing awareness of the fact that all these supposedly free platforms are not free and that all of us are being tracked and our information is really the commodity we\u2019re paying,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cThis seems like the wrong time to be pushing resources that tell kids to be brave and fearless on the internet without telling them to be cautious and without giving them the information they really need.\u201d\u201cWe are helping them become more knowledgeable about what the digital landscape is like,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said of his students, \u201cso they can make choices about what they use and what they don\u2019t use.\u201dMs. Yi of Google said the company was aware that multiple efforts were needed to help children learn to navigate the digital world. In addition to \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve also built products like Family Link, which lets parents supervise their kids\u2019 Google accounts; have hosted online safety school assemblies for years; and will continue to develop new tools and resources for kids, parents and educators.\u201dAmerican corporate giants are no strangers to the country\u2019s schools.\u201cThe best solution would be for this kind of training to be undertaken by an organization less invested in how consumers conceive of privacy on the internet,\u201d the authors of the journal article wrote. \u201cAt the very least, \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 should have significantly less Google branding.\u201d But even teachers like Mr. Hodgson, who uses Google tools with his students, are leery of the company\u2019s presence in schools.\u201cMaybe it has some good for the public if you use it in certain ways,\u201d he said of the \u201cBe Internet Awesome\u201d program.

{"Headline": "New Pixel Phones and Other Gadgets Keep Google in the Hardware Hunt", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough sales of its devices have been slow, the search giant unveiled the Pixel 3, a smart speaker with a built-in screen and a tablet that doubles as a PC. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For much of the last decade, Apple and Samsung have dominated sales of smartphones. So why would anyone bother trying to sell a new phone?The gadgets are Google\u2019s third wave since it started making consumer devices in 2016. The internet company has pushed these products as a way to showcase its prowess in areas like artificial intelligence and image processing.\u201cThere\u2019s some skepticism about how committed Google is,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Creative Strategies, a consumer electronics research firm. \u201cThey are still nowhere near where they need to be to make a dent in the industry.\u201dGoogle has said that hardware businesses rarely become overnight successes and that it remains focused on the long term. The company said it put more stock in indicators like high customer satisfaction in its effort to build a loyal base. Google doesn\u2019t break out revenue or profit for its hardware business.While the handset market is no longer growing as much as it did five years ago, the company wants Pixel to be a blockbuster and to set the bar for devices running Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system, said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware.\u201cIt is our objective to sell as many Pixel phones as we can,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re investing accordingly to be able to do that.\u201dHere\u2019s a closer look at Google\u2019s newest devices.Similar to the latest iPhones and Samsung phones, the new Pixel 3 phones, which will become available on Oct. 18, have glass bodies to support wireless power charging. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field to create voltage that powers the phone.Yet the screens are smaller than those of Pixel\u2019s competitors: The $799 model has a 5.5-inch screen, while the $899 model, the Pixel 3 XL, has a 6.3-inch screen. For comparison, Apple\u2019s new iPhone screens range from 5.8 to 6.5 inches diagonally, and the Samsung Galaxy screens measure 5.8 to 6.4 inches.The new Pixels also have a feature to make it easier to take good photos. The tool, Top Shot, captures a series of images when someone takes a photo; Google uses algorithms to recommend the best photo among the shots. Computers analyze millions of images to extrapolate the characteristics of a good photo, like smiles and clear faces. The analysis of the photos is done on the Pixel 3, not in Google\u2019s cloud; users will see a small chip icon marking the recommended photo. People can use the Home Hub\u2019s screen to watch videos and control smart home devices like security cameras. Notably, the Home Hub, unlike Amazon\u2019s smart screen products, lacks a camera for videoconferencing. Google said it had made that decision partly because of privacy concerns inside the home, especially bedrooms.The company\u2019s third new product, the Pixel Slate, is a convertible laptop, like a tablet with a removable keyboard similar to Microsoft\u2019s Surface. It runs Google\u2019s ChromeOS operating system and works with a digital stylus for drawing and writing. The device, which the company said would become available later this year, starts at $599.Mr. Queiroz said Google is just at the beginning of its hardware ambitions. \"Manufacturing and hardware are things that you build up over time, so we\u2019re very proud of where we are after three years compared to people who have been doing it for 10 years or longer,\" he said.Advertisement"}

Good news, Apple loyalists: You won\u2019t have to burn $1,000 on your next iPhone. That\u2019s because for about $750, you can have the iPhone XR, which is just as fast and nearly as capable as its more expensive counterparts.For everyone else, the XR is perfectly adequate and has few downsides. Its 6.1-inch screen, which is based on LCD, an older display technology, looks ever so slightly inferior to the OLED screens on the XS phones \u2014 but you would need to be a movie buff to notice the difference.The XR\u2019s single-lens camera is also less capable than the dual-lens cameras on the XS models. Yet the XR can still produce very satisfying photos of people using portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. After I tested an XR for four days, here are the highlights.Apple developed a new kind of LCD to improve color accuracy and squeeze the XR\u2019s screen into the corners of the phone. The result is what Apple calls a Liquid Retina display, which looks better \u2014 brighter and more vibrant \u2014 than past iPhone LCD screens.I confess that I struggled to see a difference between the Liquid Retina screen and the OLED on an iPhone XS. The distinction is most evident in blacks: If you look at a photo taken in the dark, you will notice that the blacks on the XR\u2019s screen have a faint blue glow, which is coming from the backlight used to illuminate the screen, while the blacks on the XS look darker and more realistic because the OLED technology turns off individual pixels to make them black.These downsides were trivial. The vast majority of your time on a phone will probably be spent looking at amateur photos taken by friends and family anyway, so it\u2019s worth saving $250 to have this slightly less vibrant screen.If you are debating between an XS and XR, your buying decision will probably come down to the camera. The XR\u2019s single-lens camera takes excellent, clear photos with lifelike colors, but because it lacks a second lens, it is less capable at taking those DSLR-like portrait mode shots, which are a lot of fun.To do portrait mode with the XR\u2019s single lens, Apple used machine learning, which involves computers analyzing images to recognize people in the photo and properly sharpen them while blurring the background. Apple decided to limit its machine-assisted image processing on the device specifically to human subjects. In contrast, the second lens on the XS camera helped the device do portrait shots of a wider variety of subjects, like dogs and objects. In addition to the help of machine learning, the two lenses worked together to create a depth-of-field effect that kept the main subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.When you attempt to take a portrait photo of a nonhuman, the XR camera will display the message \u201cNo person detected.\u201d This was the biggest downer to me as a dog owner and foodie (and what ultimately drove me to buy an XS). Apple said that for the XR\u2019s portrait mode, the company wanted to focus on getting photos of people to look just right.That said, people who are less dog crazy and more interested in shooting photos of, well, people probably won\u2019t mind this limitation on the XR. In my tests, the XR was excellent at taking portrait photos of my partner, properly sharpening details of her head, including her hair strands, while blurring the background.Let\u2019s speed through what else you need to know about the XR: Apple said the XR had the longest battery life among the new iPhones. It gets 16 hours of video playback, compared with 15 hours on the XS Max. In my tests, I didn\u2019t notice a meaningful difference. Both iPhones had long enough battery life to get me through the day.In speed tests measuring a single computing core with a benchmarking app, the XR was just as fast as the XS, 49 percent faster than Google\u2019s Pixel 3 and 45 percent faster than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9.The body of the XR is about half a millimeter thicker than the XS partly because the cheaper phone had to make room for the backlighting used to illuminate its LCD screen. In addition, the XR\u2019s 6.1-inch screen is a bit bigger than the XS with a 5.8-inch screen. As a result, it felt bulkier in the pocket than the XS. (Of course, the XS Max with a 6.5-inch screen felt the bulkiest.)The XR lacks 3D Touch, the iPhone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. Instead, placing your finger over a button, like the camera shortcut on the lock screen, and holding it down results in haptic feedback. This is a negligible omission: I forgot that 3D Touch even existed because I rarely use it.The XR comes in six colors: white, black, blue, yellow, coral and red. The XS phones come in three: gold, white and black. As is often the case for new gadgets, good things come to those who wait. If you resisted splurging on the XS to wait for the XR, you will be rewarded with a great phone \u2014 and some extra cash lying around. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Google Pixel 3 Review: Phone\u2019s Smarts Shine Through Its A.I.-Driven Camera", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixHardware innovations? Nope. Instead, Google is emphasizing software improvements \u2014 particularly for images \u2014 with its newest Pixel smartphones.Apple and Samsung typically show off glitzy hardware innovations \u2014 dual-lens cameras; bigger screens \u2014 to mesmerize millions into buying their new smartphones. Google has taken a different approach: It wants to sell people on better software.\u201cThe phone is powered by A.I. so that we let Pixel do really useful, delightful things,\u201d said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware. \u201cThe phone doesn\u2019t get in the way. Things just happen for you.\u201dThe Pixel 3, which will be available on Thursday, is a modest piece of hardware otherwise. It comes in two screen sizes \u2014 5.5 inches and 6.3 inches \u2014 that are slightly smaller than phones from Apple and Samsung. The smaller Pixel costs $799; the larger one is $899.After testing the Pixel 3 for four days, I\u2019m convinced that Google did the right thing by emphasizing its software. The Pixel 3 is a superior Android phone to Samsung\u2019s top-rated Galaxy devices thanks largely to Google\u2019s clever camera and intuitive interface. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the new Pixel has the all-around best camera \u2014 I prefer the iPhone camera\u2019s more lifelike colors. Still, the Pixel 3\u2019s software smarts offer some advantages, like the ability to take superior photos with the bokeh effect, which puts the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.Here\u2019s what I found about the Pixel 3\u2019s most important features.Let\u2019s say you take a photo of a group of people and one person blinks. Using Google\u2019s new photo-optimization tool, Top Shot, there\u2019s a chance you can salvage that photo by choosing a better shot with that person\u2019s eyes open.To use Top Shot, you turn on a feature called Motion Photos, which are essentially three-second videos capturing the moments just before and after you take a shot. When you snap a picture, Google\u2019s camera software can analyze those before-and-after moments for a better image to recommend.Google\u2019s theory is that Top Shot will change the way people take photos: Instead of snapping several shots of the same subject and manually picking the best one, users could instead shoot a single motion photo and then let Google suggest the best image.For me, Top Shot didn\u2019t profoundly improve my photos or change my habits. For example, in a park, I still took a half dozen photos of my dogs until they both smiled at the camera. But when I reviewed my favorite photo, Google recommended two different shots as a potential Top Shot \u2014 and I did pick the one where the dogs\u2019 faces looked clear. It\u2019s impressive that Google is capable of detecting the qualities of a good photo, but I found the process of reviewing and selecting the recommended shots to be time consuming. It was quicker to use the old technique of snapping a bunch of photos and manually swiping through them to decide which you like most.In other words: For now, I don\u2019t consider this a must-have feature.A better reason to consider the Pixel 3 is its impressive ability to take so-called portrait mode photos, those DSLR-like images with a gently blurred background and sharpened foreground. This effect is useful for producing artistic-looking photos of people, food and objects. Portrait mode is the Pixel 3\u2019s strength: Compared with both Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones and Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, which use dual-lens cameras to take portrait mode photos, the single-lens Pixel 3 camera was more reliable at sharpening the intended subject.Here\u2019s an example: When I had dim sum for lunch and used the Pixel 3\u2019s portrait mode to snap a photo of five soup dumplings inside a basket, the camera appropriately sharpened the five dumplings while blurring out my partner in the background. When I took a portrait mode photo with the iPhone XS, the camera blurred out one of the five dumplings. I eventually got the iPhone camera to sharpen all five dumplings with a few more tries, but the Pixel 3 did it in one attempt.Having this smart camera \u2014 which has the potential to become even smarter through software updates \u2014 is a compelling reason to consider the Pixel 3. Google said it planned to add more camera features in those updates, like Night Sight, which helps people take photos in the dark without using a flash.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do with machine learning to produce image quality in photography and video, it really surpasses the need for us to do more,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said.Beware: Using this feature comes with some risk.The screening tool works by tapping a button when you want to screen a call. An automated message will ask the caller to state his or her name and purpose for calling. From there, the user can receive a transcription of the caller\u2019s response and decide whether to take the call. The tool works well: I screened a call from my partner, and Google did a perfect job at immediately transcribing her response (\u201cMy purpose is to eat dumplings, so leave me alone\u201d).It remains to be seen how effective the screening tool will be when Pixel customers use it en masse. I still think the safer \u2014 although imperfect \u2014 solution is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers, like those that are nearly identical to yours.But I don\u2019t recommend messing with the robocallers. The bots will always win.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Fears of the Supply Chain in China", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHello, everyone. I\u2019m Paul Mozur, a reporter based in Shanghai, and I have covered technology in Asia for eight years. Though lately the big story has been internet companies, hardware and the supply chain remains close to my heart. Maybe that\u2019s why the tech news bombshell a little over a week ago has been so fascinating to me.For years, China and the United States have squabbled over the supply chain, which sits mostly in China but is under the charge of companies from dozens of countries.The fact that the two sides share the same fears shows how difficult it can be to ensure security in a world in which the design, production and assembly of electronics occur across multiple countries.The American block on Huawei isn\u2019t completely effective against hypothetical supply chain hacks. That\u2019s because European and Japanese telecom equipment brands also have a good chunk of their supply chains in China. On the other hand, China\u2019s control of a huge portion of the supply chain doesn\u2019t ensure its security, because high-end design and production often happens elsewhere.Neither side is happy with this. Both China and the United States will probably continue to winnow their mutual tech reliance. It won\u2019t be easy. They are working against 40 years of economic integration and a tremendously complex web of big and small companies.A different approach would be to identify the key things that need to be protected. In a discussion I had the other day with Samm Sacks, a tech policy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, she put forward the idea of having a \u201csmall yard and a high fence.\u201dThe point is to identify key products that cannot be compromised and come up with solutions to protect them. Obviously, companies should always do their best to ensure security. But that doesn\u2019t have to lead to ripping apart the global supply chain.For example, regular Americans shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about buying Huawei phones. Senators and admirals, on the other hand, should probably stick with something more closely guarded. That could involve building small, secure supply chains closer to home or special audits of phones used by people who could be high-profile targets. Even if it\u2019s a bit expensive.Either way, it\u2019s worth remembering that even if a brand of electronics is from one country, what\u2019s inside it could come from six others. Country of origin also doesn\u2019t ensure security. It makes me glad I\u2019m a journalist and not in charge of The New York Times\u2019s cyber defenses.And now on to the other news of the week:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "That New Apple Watch EKG Feature? There Are More Downs Than Ups", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareThe heart monitor should not be considered a medical device and reflects wider problems with health screens. For a more measured response, it\u2019s worth looking at potential downsides, and it turns out there are a few.The upside potential is twofold. First, doctors could monitor \u2014 at a distance \u2014 how patients with known heart problems are functioning outside the office. Second, the device could diagnose heart problems in people who don\u2019t know they have them, picking up abnormal heart rhythms earlier than would otherwise be possible.If that\u2019s the case, the major potential for the device \u2014 which will arrive later this year \u2014 is to pick up arrhythmias in otherwise healthy people. That\u2019s still a big selling point. Picking up abnormal function earlier could theoretically lead to improvements in health, such as reductions in strokes.But just because something seems like a good idea doesn\u2019t mean it is. No screening test is perfect. In the simplest sense, whenever we consider the results of medical tests, they can be \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201dIn general, we would like people who are sick to have a positive screening result, and people who are well to have a negative result. Unfortunately, people who are sick sometimes have a negative result. Those are false negatives. People who are well sometimes have a positive result. Those are false positives.Both of these outcomes are worrisome. A false negative might leave someone who needs medical help with a mistaken sense of assurance. Given that relatively few people have serious, undiagnosed arrhythmias with no symptoms (if people did, we would be screening for this more often), this isn\u2019t the major concern. False positives are, because they cost us time and money, as well as cause emotional distress.The study wasn\u2019t peer reviewed, so we don\u2019t know for sure, but this was also a population for whom atrial fibrillation might be more common than in those who might use the watches. People who buy the latest Apple watch will most likely be younger, healthier, wealthier and more plugged into the health care system \u2014 and less likely to remain undiagnosed.This is one of the major problems with such a device. The people most in need of it, those who might benefit from tests and distance monitoring, are the least likely to get it. If we truly believed this was a medical test beneficial to the general population, insurance should pay for it. No one is suggesting that should happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Used to Know Exactly What People Wanted \u2014 Then It Made a Watch", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyApple opened a routine product-launch event last month with a gag. An establishing aerial shot of Apple\u2019s new circular headquarters set up a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it\u2019s an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple\u2019s depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 and it\u2019s not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation.The subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them,\u201d he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, \u201cthey would have said, \u2018Faster horses.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era.The company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn\u2019t succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They\u2019re for Instagram or Facebook; they\u2019re for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple\u2019s competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple\u2019s core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history\u2019s most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers.The Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch \u2014 with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting \u2014 was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself.Four years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn\u2019t yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process \u2014 and still in charge \u2014 of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It\u2019s a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious.During the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d \u2014 attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It\u2019s the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you\u2019re snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up \u2014 that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn\u2019t have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for.Over the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what\u2019s going on with, and inside, its wearers\u2019 bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device\u2019s body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won\u2019t be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer\u2019s heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance.For now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that \u2014 it\u2019s a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple\u2019s relative commitment to privacy \u2014 at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording.As Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple\u2019s stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple\u2019s devices and software.This is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple\u2019s latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry.There may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can\u2019t remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device \u2014 or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple News\u2019s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.One morning in late August, Apple News\u2019s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company\u2019s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\u201cWe put so much care and thought into our curation,\u201d said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.\u201dThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.Their work has complicated the debate about whether Silicon Valley giants are media or technology companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter have long insisted they are tech entities and not arbiters of the truth. The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and others have bet heavily on artificial intelligence to help them sort through false news and fact-based information. Yet Apple has unabashedly gone the other direction with its human-led approach, showing that a more media-like sensibility may be able to coexist within a technology company.Apple\u2019s strategy is risky. While the company has long used people to curate its App Store, the news is far more contentious. The famously secretive company has also provided little transparency on who is picking the stories for Apple News and how those people avoid bias.For the first time recently \u2014 and after extensive negotiations on the terms of the interviews \u2014 Apple agreed to let a Times reporter in on how it operates Apple News.There are ambitious plans for the product. Apple lets publishers run ads in its app and it helps some sign up new subscribers, taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Soon, the company aims to bundle access to dozens of magazines in its app for a flat monthly fee, sort of like Netflix for news, according to people familiar with the plans, who declined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Apple also hopes to package access to a few daily-news publications, like The Times, The Post and The Wall Street Journal, into the app, the people said.Apple\u2019s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. \u201cThere is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,\u201d Ms. Kern said.But there are early signs that Apple is not the industry\u2019s savior. Many publishers have made little on ads in Apple News, and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of subscriptions it helps sell does not help. Having experienced Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s disruption of their industry, many publications are wary of Apple, according to conversations with executives from nine news organizations, many of whom declined to comment on the record for fear of upsetting the trillion-dollar corporation. Some were optimistic that Apple could be a better partner than other tech giants, but were leery of making the company the portal to their readers.\u201cWhat Apple giveth, Apple can taketh away,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Journal, Bloomberg and other publications. Once readers are trained to get their news from Apple, he said, news organizations will realize: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of Apple.\u201dFor decades, newspapers had one of industry\u2019s most direct relationships with customers: Broadsheets and tabloids reported the news, printed it and delivered it to your door.Then the internet arrived, and Google and Facebook became the middlemen between publishers and their readers, while leveraging that position to dominate digital advertising and decimate newspapers\u2019 advertising business model.The rise of Google and Facebook in news was partly driven by algorithms that provided enormous scale, enabling them to surface millions of articles from thousands of sources to their billions of users. The algorithms were largely designed to keep users engaged and clicking, meaning they tended to promote posts that drew clicks and shares, which often meant the sensational. That elevated fringe and partisan sites that produced intentionally misleading, highly partisan or downright false content.(A Google spokeswoman said the company aimed to avoid misinformation by screening publishers before letting them into Google News. She added that Google this year began helping news organizations sell subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company helps publishers reach more readers, earn ad revenue and sell subscriptions. She said Facebook\u2019s algorithm recently decreased the visibility of pages that share clickbait.)Into that environment came Apple. In late 2015, the iPhone maker released a free news app to match users with publications they liked. People selected their interests and favorite publications, and the app returned a feed of relevant stories.The announcement attracted little fanfare. Three months later, Apple announced an unusual new feature: humans would pick the app\u2019s top stories, not algorithms.Apple said it remained convinced of the benefits of people.\u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s chief of apps and Ms. Kern\u2019s boss, said about Apple News. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to let it be a total crazy land.\u201dTo create its newsroom, Apple needed journalists. Starting in 2015, it poached editors from The Times, The Journal, CNN and Bleacher Report, among other publications. To lead them all, an Apple recruiter found Ms. Kern, a rising star in the New York magazine world.\u201cYou don\u2019t generally have the whole package, but she did,\u201d Adam Moss, New York Magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said of Ms. Kern\u2019s news judgment, story ideas and work ethic.Last year, Mr. Moss said, Ms. Kern came into his office with the news that Apple had approached her about a job.\u201cI said to her, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Moss. \u201cWith the literary skills and the artistic skills Lauren had, to go into a company that was really dominated by engineers was a recipe for enormous frustration.\u201dMs. Kern said it was an opportunity to help journalism from the other side. Going to tech also came with a raise; she would not say how much. She moved from Brooklyn to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes, where she bought a car for the first time in 13 years, a golden retriever named Leo for her son, and a spacious house with chicken coops in the back. (She plans to leave the coops empty.)In interviews, Ms. Kern was lighthearted but matter of fact. Friends and former colleagues described her as fiercely dedicated to two things: her son and her job.\u201cShe has an executive\u2019s brain. Most places I work, journalists are such poor managers,\u201d said Noreen Malone, a former colleague at New York Magazine. \u201cIt was always clear Lauren was going to run something.\u201dNow Ms. Kern leads roughly 30 former journalists in Sydney, London, New York and Silicon Valley. They spend their days consuming news across the internet, fielding 100 to 200 pitches a day from publishers, and debating which stories get the top spots.Ultimately, they select five stories to lead the app, with the top two also displayed in a prominent window to the left of the iPhone home screen. They also curate a magazine-style section of feature stories. The lineup typically shifts five or more times a day, depending on the news. A single editor in London typically chooses the first mix of stories for the East Coast\u2019s morning commute before editors in New York and then Cupertino step in.Ms. Kern said she and her team did not run the story because they didn\u2019t trust it. Why? It\u2019s not a formula that can be baked into an algorithm, she said.\u201cI mean, you read a story and it doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test,\u201d she said.Ms. Kern criticized the argument that algorithms are the sole way to avoid prejudice because bias can be baked into the algorithm\u2019s code, such as whether it labels news organizations liberal or conservative. She argued that humans \u2014 with all their biases \u2014 are the only way to avoid bias.\u201cWe\u2019re so much more subtly following the news cycle and what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only legitimate way to do it at this point.\u201dApple executives said they are convinced that Apple News is not only a cure for the ills of how people consume news in the internet era, but also a lifeline for journalism \u2014 and democracy.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tim said we have a responsibility to help the news industry,\u201d said Mr. Rosner, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to democracy.\u201dIn actual newsrooms, there is skepticism that a tech giant will rescue the industry.Daniel Hallac, chief product officer for New York Magazine, said traffic from Apple News has doubled since December to now account for nearly 12 percent of visits to the magazine\u2019s website. Traffic from Facebook has dropped about a third, to 8 percent of visits, while Google\u2019s share has increased slightly to nearly half of the site\u2019s traffic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Apple News,\u201d he said.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees its services push, said publishers can run their own ads alongside their stories in Apple News and keep all of the revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d he said. He noted most major publishers take advantage of that feature. Apple also places ads for publishers for a 30 percent cut.But news publishers said selling ads for Apple News is complicated, and that advertisers\u2019 interest was limited because of the lack of customer data. Slate also attributed its issues to minuscule revenue from the ads Apple placed. Apple recently made it easier for publishers to place their own ads, but Mr. Cue conceded Apple is not terribly good \u2014 or interested \u2014 in advertising.Another potential issue is that Apple News mostly helps a small coterie of publishers. In July, Florida\u2019s largest newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times, received 79 percent of its outside web traffic from Google and 20 percent from Facebook, said Conan Gallaty, the paper\u2019s digital chief. Apple accounted for 1 percent, he said.\u201cOf the major three \u2014 Facebook, Google and Apple \u2014 Apple probably kept the furthest distance in engaging with regional and local publishers,\u201d he said.Mr. Cue said Apple is most interested in helping publishers sell subscriptions. Apple News now enables people to subscribe at the tap of a finger, leveraging many iPhone owners\u2019 preloaded credit cards.But there is concern here, too. Apple nabs 30 percent of subscription revenues the first year and 15 percent each subsequent year. In contrast, Google takes a 5 percent cut; Facebook takes nothing. Apple also owns the customer relationship, unlike Google or Facebook, refusing to pass along even subscribers\u2019 email addresses.Given those terms, some news executives said Apple News could cannibalize future subscribers, leaving news organizations with less revenue and less data per customer.Mr. Cue said Apple primarily delivers customers who wouldn\u2019t have subscribed otherwise and that its revenue share was \u201ca relatively small cut,\u201d in part to offset its costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge moneymaking business,\u201d he said.In April, Apple bought Texture, an app that lets readers pay $10 a month for access to about 200 magazines. It now plans to incorporate the service into Apple News, drastically expanding its reach, according to people familiar with its plans.Given Apple\u2019s ambitions and growing team of former journalists, will it ever start producing the news and not just aggregating it?\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future plans, but that\u2019s certainly not what we set out to do,\u201d said Mr. Rosner.So there\u2019s a chance?\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft\u2019s monopoly back in the bottle.It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry\u2019s largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There\u2019s just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.The industry\u2019s new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets \u2014 these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting \u201csmart.\u201d Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend \u2014 known by the marketing catchphrase \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung.Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet.\u201cI can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,\u201d he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. \u201cIn our government-can\u2019t-do-anything-ever society, I don\u2019t see any reining in of the corporate trends,\u201d he said.At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a \u201csmart\u201d fan using Amazon\u2019s chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan\u2019s control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code \u2014 in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code.And that\u2019s it. The fan\u2019s digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in.This system illustrates Mr. Schneier\u2019s larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet.Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don\u2019t connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do.The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don\u2019t often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple\u2019s brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors.The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry.Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason techies don\u2019t like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn\u2019t a terrible idea.Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast. Why not go slowly into the uncertain future?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google to Charge Phone Makers for Android Apps in Europe", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Google has always made its Android mobile operating system available free as a way of getting its search engine, web browser and other applications on as many devices as possible to collect data about users and to sell advertising.But on Tuesday, in response to a European antitrust ruling this year, the company said it would for the first time begin charging handset manufacturers to install Gmail, Google Maps and other popular applications for Android in the European Union.The new arrangement is the latest sign that global technology companies are adjusting their business practices in Europe to account for stiffer regulations there.By obligating handset makers to load the free apps along with the Android operating system, regulators said, Google had boxed out competitors. With the company now required to separate its services in Europe, handset manufacturers like Samsung and Huawei will now have more flexibility there to choose what applications they want to pre-install on phones.Google said it would sell a license for a package including its Google Play app store, Gmail, YouTube and Maps. Another license will be available for companies that want to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser, allowing handset makers to team up with rival services. The company did not say how much it would charge for the licenses.The European Commission had allowed Google to come up with its own ways for complying with the decision, putting pressure on regulators to ensure that the company met its obligations. Google already faces accusations that is has not complied with an earlier antitrust ruling over its unfair favoring of its own search results.The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.Android is the world\u2019s most widely used mobile operating system, powering more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. Google said that more than 24,000 different kinds of devices run the software. Using Android has allowed companies like Samsung to compete against Apple\u2019s iPhone without having to make their own software.In providing Android free to any device maker to use and modify, Google helped make the software available everywhere \u2014 in phones, tablets, cars and refrigerators. But the company tied the use of the popular Play store, where customers can download more than one million apps made by outside developers, to requirements that device makers feature other, ad-driven services like Google\u2019s search engine and web browser.Some handset makers argued to European regulators that Google\u2019s terms made it impossible for them to create devices less dependent on the search giant\u2019s applications. Those companies will now have more freedom to offer alternate services without facing consequences from Google.\u201cAndroid phone makers wishing to distribute Google apps may now also build noncompatible, or forked, smartphones and tablets\u201d in Europe, Google said in a statement. \u201cThey will also be able to license Google Play separately from Search and Chrome, with full freedom to install rival apps as before.\u201dGoogle declined to say what the financial impact of the changes would be, and it said the license fees were needed to make up for any lost ad revenue. But the company could make money from handset makers that choose to use its applications, and it will collect the licensing fees and the advertising revenue when its services are used.Google also plans to offer financial incentives to companies that continue featuring its search engine and browser, potentially giving the company an advantage over rivals.Samsung and Huawei, two of the largest makers of Android phones sold in Europe, had no immediate comment.The Android changes may not be permanent. Google is appealing the European Commission\u2019s decision, a process that could drag on for years. If the company prevails, it could revert to bundling its free services.Europe has become the world\u2019s toughest watchdog over the global technology industry. Once seen as overly aggressive, policies in the region are now influencing other countries to take a tougher approach. In the United States, where the tech industry has enjoyed little regulation, members of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are speaking more favorably of stricter oversight of online platforms like Facebook and Google.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Altria to Stop Selling Some E-Cigarette Brands That Appeal to Youths", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under pressure to curb vaping among young people, the tobacco giant Altria announced on Thursday that it would discontinue most of its flavored e-cigarettes and stop selling some brands altogether.The company also said, for the first time, that it would support federal legislation to raise the age to 21 for the purchase of any tobacco and vaping product.In a letter to the F.D.A., Howard A. Willard III, chairman and chief executive of Altria Group, said he was alarmed at the epidemic levels of youth e-cigarette use, although he stopped short of saying that his company\u2019s products contributed to it.\u201cAlthough we do not believe we have a current issue with youth access to or use of our pod-based products, we do not want to risk contributing to the issue,\u201d Mr. Willard wrote.He also said that e-cigarettes remain an important alternative for adults who want to stop smoking.\u201cThe current situation with youth use of e-vapor products, left unchecked, has the potential to undermine that opportunity,\u201d Mr. Willard said.\u201cI think Altria will be happy to try to look like the good guy and let Juul take the heat,\u201d said Desmond Jenson, a senior staff lawyer with the Public Health Law Center, based in Minnesota. \u201cJuul selling well is actually to Altria\u2019s benefit.\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that shows that e-cigarette use leads to combustible cigarette use among youth, and this year combustible use by high school students is up for the first time in 20 years,\u201d he added. \u201cSo if Juul is getting kids hooked and they end up switching to Marlboro, Altria wins.\u201dAltria sells two types of vaping products through its Nu Mark subsidiary: the MarkTen and Green Smoke brand, which resemble traditional cigarettes, and the MarkTen Elite and Apex by MarkTen, which are larger and use an e-liquid pod inserted into a cartridge.In its earnings call Tuesday, Altria said that 20 percent of its MarkTen and Green Smoke products feature flavors other than menthol, tobacco and mint. It plans to stop selling these flavors, which include Mardi Gras, Apple Cider and Strawberry Brulee. The company will continue to sell MarkTen and Green Smoke in menthol, tobacco and mint.Altria has not given up completely on new flavors. In a note on the company\u2019s website, Mr. Willard said he believes that flavors do help adults switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, and that the company would introduce new ones with F.D.A. permission.\u201cWe believe that pod-based products significantly contribute to the rise in youth use of e-vapor products,\u201d Mr. Willard conceded in his letter to the F.D.A.The flavor-based pods are not a significant part of the company\u2019s e-cigarette portfolio at this point. The MarkTen Elite is sold in about 25,000 stores. The Apex is sold online in 10 states.In a recent interview, the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said that while e-cigarettes may be a preferable alternative to combustible tobacco cigarettes, they are not risk free.\u201cAny time you inhale vape products, there is every reason to believe there are risks associated with it,\u201d he said.Dr. Gottlieb also noted that he was revisiting the use of menthol in certain products, which has been of particular concern in African-American communities targeted by makers of menthol cigarettes like Newport and Kools in years past. \u201cIt was a mistake for the agency to back away on menthol,\u201d he said.The F.D.A. is also moving on other fronts that threaten the tobacco industry. In response to a legal ruling, the agency said last month it would speed up release of new, graphic package warnings ordered years ago by Congress. It is also proposing to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, rendering them nonaddictive.Among Altria\u2019s other concerns is F.D.A. approval of IQOS, the penlike electronic device developed by Philip Morris International, which the company says heats tobacco sticks but does not burn them. Although Philip Morris has applied for approval, Altria would distribute the device in the United States.A federal advisory committee in January recommended that the F.D.A. reject a bid to allow the product to be sold as safer than traditional cigarettes. The agency has not yet made a final decision on whether the product can be sold as a reduced harm product, or at all.Altria has also recently stepped up its political donations. On Sept. 19, the tobacco company made its largest contribution of the year, $150,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a so-called Super Pac aimed at electing Republicans to the House of Representatives, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political spending. Last year, Altria gave the organization a total of $82,930.F.D.A. spokesman Michael Felberbaum said that the agency appreciated any voluntary steps that companies were taking to address youth access and appeal of e-cigarettes, and would be taking additional action shortly.Becky Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, was not impressed by the tobacco company\u2019s move.\u201cAltria\u2019s announcement makes them look good, but it will have little practical impact given their very small share of the pod e-cigarette market,\u201d Ms. Wexler said. \u201cIt is not a substitute for mandatory F.D.A. rules that apply to all e-cigarette manufacturers, including a ban on flavors that attract kids and enforcement of the requirement for F.D.A. review before new products go on the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday saying they were concerned that thousands of apps may \u201cimproperly track children and collect their personal information.\u201dThe senators also asked the agency to examine how app stores like Google Play vet the apps they categorize as child-friendly and ensure the apps comply with the privacy law.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that many companies are violating that law,\u201d Mr. Markey said in a phone interview, \u201cand that we need to put a spotlight on it and ensure that that type of activity is stopped cold.\u201dThe Times also found programs in Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store that were labeled appropriate for children but, once downloaded, sent personal data without verifiable parental consent. Apps on the Apple platform sent less data over all.Last month, the New Mexico attorney general sued the maker of Fun Kid Racing, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies. The suit accused the companies of violating the children\u2019s privacy law. It also argued that Google misled parents by allowing the apps to remain in the children\u2019s section of its store and failed to act swiftly when researchers contacted the company with concerns that thousands of apps might be improperly tracking children.A Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said its family program \u201crequires developers\u201d to comply with the federal children\u2019s privacy law and that the company would \u201ctake action\u201d if an app was found to violate its policies.An Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, said developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children\u2019s apps.In their letter, Mr. Markey and Mr. Blumenthal asked the Federal Trade Commission to determine the extent to which app developers and their advertising partners were complying with the children\u2019s privacy law. They called on regulators to examine the kinds of personal details that apps collect from children and share with advertising companies, as well as how app developers make sure their products adhere to the law.The senators also asked the agency to scrutinize how advertising firms with policies prohibiting children\u2019s apps from using their services make sure app developers comply.This week, The Times retested one of the apps from the earlier article, Masha and the Bear, and found that the Android version continued to send precise location information and other data to tracking companies. The iOS version also still sent a tracking ID number to an advertising company, although it did not send location data.Google and Apple did not respond to specific questions about that app. In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was working on \u201csolving this problem in order to avoid committing this violation in the future.\u201dAaron Krolik contributed research.Advertisement"}

Like Apple\u2019s iPhone released last year, the new iPad has much smaller borders around its screen, eliminating space for a home button. Instead, owners will unlock the device just by looking at it, and control it with a series of swipes on the screen.The change allowed Apple to make its larger iPad Pro about the size of a standard piece of paper, with 25 percent less volume than the last model, while retaining its 12.9-inch screen and increasing its speed and storage capacity. Apple also introduced a new iPad keyboard, a new stylus that charges wirelessly and connects magnetically to the iPad, and new iPad apps like Adobe Photoshop.Apple executives repeatedly compared the iPad Pro with laptops and stressed that it could be a primary computer \u2014 an idea Apple is trying to push after years of sluggish iPad sales. The company promotes smartphones as something different from traditional computers, although they have become the primary personal computing device for most people.Positioning the iPad Pro as a primary computer means Apple has also priced it like one, with the device costing more than many laptops. The old iPad Pro models cost between $650 and $1,280; the new models range from $800 to $1,900.The new iPad also eliminates the headphone jack; a converter will cost $9. (And you can\u2019t use the headphone-jack converter from your iPhone because the new iPads switched to a USB-C port from Apple\u2019s Lightning port.)Apple additionally updated one of its best-selling laptops, the MacBook Air, the ultraslim computer that the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs pulled out of a manila envelope at a product introduction a decade ago. Apple made the MacBook Air faster, smaller and louder, and gave it a much sharper screen. It also increased its starting price to $1,200 from $1,000.Apple made its Mac mini computer faster and more powerful, too, while increasing its starting price to $800 from $500. The company said it had developed a new aluminum alloy from shavings of recycled aluminum that it is using to encase the new MacBook Air and Mac mini, significantly reducing their carbon footprint.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

{"Headline": "#MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men. Nearly Half of Their Replacements Are Women.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementWho Was Ousted and Who Stepped InProducer and co-founder, the Weinstein CompanyInterimCo-presidents of Lantern EntertainmentTelevision hostPermanentHost, \u201cAmanpour & Company\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like this before,\u201d said Joan Williams, a law professor who studies gender at the University of California, Hastings. \u201cWomen have always been seen as risky, because they might do something like have a baby. But men are now being seen as more risky hires.\u201dBut the analysis shows that the #MeToo movement shook, and is still shaking, power structures in society\u2019s most visible sectors. The Times gathered cases of prominent people who lost their main jobs, significant leadership positions or major contracts, and whose ousters were publicly covered in news reports.Forty-three percent of their replacements were women. Of those, one-third are in news media, one-quarter in government, and one-fifth in entertainment and the arts. For example, Robin Wright replaced Kevin Spacey as lead actor on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Emily Nemens replaced Lorin Stein as editor of \u201cThe Paris Review,\u201d and Tina Smith replaced Al Franken as a senator from Minnesota.People Replacing Men Accused of Sexual MisconductWomen are starting to gain power in organizations that have been jolted by harassment, with potentially far-reaching effects.\u201cI find it so interesting the number of people who come up to me and say, \u2018Thank you for stepping in when someone needed to step in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what women do a lot of the time, right?\u201dThat has been true in Congress, said Ms. Smith, a Democrat. In a highly polarized Senate, women tend to be unusually collegial across party lines, she said, and the 23 female senators meet for dinner monthly.U.S. senator for MinnesotaResigned after accusations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. He apologized but denied many of the allegations.Interim\u201cI believe you\u2019re successful and you get things done if you have relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ground for accomplishing something, certainly in the legislative world.\u201dOne example: She and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, discovered that they both worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in high school. The bond they built from shared experience helped them when they co-sponsored mental health legislation that was included in the opioid crisis response bill passed last month.In news media and entertainment, many women who ascended to jobs vacated by men have changed the tone and substance of what they offer audiences \u2014 and in some cases, the fallout from #MeToo has shaped their decisions.Head of Amazon StudiosResigned after a Hollywood producer accused him of making unwanted sexual advances.InterimPermanentSince Tanzina Vega took over from John Hockenberry as host of \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d the public radio program, she has done many episodes about gender, including on masculinity, women\u2019s anger and the intersection of gender and race \u2014 topics that she had been covering for years but that she said were now part of the national conversation.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily because I\u2019m a woman, but it\u2019s just that as a woman, as a Latina, I know when the conversation hasn\u2019t been about women, and I\u2019m deeply sensitive to that,\u201d said Ms. Vega, who was previously a reporter at CNN and The New York Times.Host of WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201dAfter he left \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d nine women accused Mr. Hockenberry of sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances. He apologized, describing his behavior as \u201crude, aggressive and impolite.\u201dInterimPermanentFriday hostWomen\u2019s personal experiences, including as mothers, can make workplaces more welcoming to other women. That\u2019s the hope of Christine Tsai, who is chief executive of the tech investment firm 500 Startups, where she replaced Dave McClure in early 2017 after an internal investigation into his behavior toward women in the tech community.\u201cI\u2019ve erred on the side as C.E.O. of being more open about it, like if one of my kids has an appointment, so hopefully it creates an environment where people don\u2019t feel like they have to hide that they have obligations to family,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, a guy can be sensitive to those things, but I think it helps having that empathy of what it\u2019s like for moms.\u201dThe women who have risen, however, can only make so much change \u2014 they are still operating in a male-dominated system. More than 10 percent of the ousted men have tried to make a comeback, or voiced a desire to, and many never lost financial power.When people accused of harassment return to power without making amends \u2014 or never lose it, at least financially \u2014 it limits the post-Weinstein movement\u2019s potential to change how power is exercised in American society.\u201cWhere\u2019s the self-reflection and accountability?\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps if we saw some evidence of that, then we can have a more robust conversation about the road to redemption.\u201dIn the meantime, these women say, there are more than enough qualified women ready to take their places in power.\u201cA bunch of us who took over these jobs got promoted because we were really good at these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Vega, the radio host. \u201cWe have the skills, we have the experience, we have the work ethic and we have the smarts to do it, and it\u2019s time for us to do this job.\u201dThe 98 Men Who Were ReplacedOf the men who lost their jobs, 51 have been replaced by at least one woman in an interim or permanent capacity.

{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: It May Be Business (Almost) as Usual With Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.In recent days, a cadre of conservative House Republicans allied with Trump has been privately exchanging articles from right-wing outlets that fuel suspicion of Khashoggi, highlighting his association with the Muslim Brotherhood in his youth and raising conspiratorial questions about his work decades ago as an embedded reporter covering Osama bin Laden, according to four G.O.P. officials involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.So expect much existing business with the Saudis to continue \u2014 albeit more quietly.Eddie Lampert\u201cI\u2019ve taken a huge personal hit,\u201d Mr. Lampert told me this week in a wide-ranging interview, his first since the bankruptcy filing. \u201cNot just in money, but time. There\u2019s been an enormous opportunity cost.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Lampert absolved himself, telling Mr. Stewart: \u201cI\u2019ve never worked harder or stretched further beyond my limits.\u201dHow Hwee Young/EPA-EFE/REXWages are stagnant. Investment in splashy infrastructure projects has dropped sharply. China\u2019s stock market is firmly in the red \u2014 it has fallen by 30 percent since a peak in January \u2014 making it one of the world\u2019s worst performing. The currency has weakened and is hovering near a 10-year low against the American dollar. Companies are complaining that they cannot get money from lenders, and a handful are defaulting on their loans.Beijing officials blamed \u201can extremely complicated and severe international situation.\u201d This is the first growth report since the country\u2019s trade war with the U.S. began to escalate in July. A round of tariffs introduced by the Trump administration in late September could make the next report even worse.Just when things were looking up, stocks slid again yesterday. The S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent, leaving the index down nearly 5 percent so far this month. Tech firms led the drop: The Nasdaq fell more than 2 percent.Growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment \u2014 low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates \u2014 is becoming tougher to navigate.What\u2019s next is unclear. We are in the middle of earnings season, and a spate of positive results could invigorate the markets: Mr. Phillips notes that Apple\u2019s quarterly report could be particularly important, given its manufacturing and sales presence in China.This year\u2019s midterms have seen a huge increase in small donations, particularly to Democrats. But America\u2019s chief executives still give almost three times as much to Republicans as to Democrats.\u2022 C.E.O.s who clashed with the Trump administration, including Hock Tan of Broadcom and Randall Stephenson of AT&T, still donated entirely to Republican causes.\u2022 Top Silicon Valley executives, like Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Reed Hastings of Netflix, tended to give to Democrats.\u2022 The most generous C.E.O. donor was Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who donated equally to Democrats and Republicans.The robot Sophia at a news conference last week.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wireless Charging Is Here. So What Is It Good For?", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixThe technology, also known as magnetic induction, is a relatively new feature for powering iPhones and popular Android phones. Most people don\u2019t use it, but here are a few benefits.Besides getting bigger, smartphones keep getting \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 glassier. From front to back, the bodies of many of the newest smartphones are composed of glass.The trend is not part of a broad conspiracy to make you shatter your phone so that you buy a new one. Instead, glass lets energy pass through the phone so that it can be charged wirelessly. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, creating voltage that powers the phone without your plugging a wire into it.That may be because wireless charging isn\u2019t truly wireless. People typically need accessories from companies like Samsung, Mophie and Anker \u2014 which generally look like mats and stands that you can set your phone on \u2014 to wirelessly power up. And while you don\u2019t have to plug a cable into the phone, the accessories themselves have to be hooked up to a power outlet.There\u2019s a trade-off, too: Wireless charging is less efficient at transferring energy than a wire, and is thus slower at refilling a battery. (Mophie said that generally, when both types of chargers were on the same wattage, wireless was about 15 percent slower.) So what\u2019s the point?Charlie Quong, vice president of product development for Mophie, said placing wireless chargers in areas where people spent a lot of time \u2014 like their bedroom, car and office \u2014 could enable them to top off their phones more frequently by removing the hassle of plugging in.The products help people \u201cget charged throughout their day without having to deliberately park their phone down,\u201d Mr. Quong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really convenient.\u201dAs a longtime skeptic of wireless chargers, I was eager to find a useful application for the technology. So I scattered the chargers around the focal points of my daily routine: on my nightstand, in my car, in my briefcase, on my office desk and on a living room table.In the end, I would consider keeping a wireless charger only in the bedroom or in a briefcase. Here\u2019s what I found.Two types of wireless chargers can be placed on a bedside table: pads and stands. In this case, the charging stand was beneficial. It elevated my phone at an angle to turn the phone into an alarm clock \u2014 with a quick poke at the screen, I could glance at the time, disable an alarm or look at a calendar alert. At night when the lights were off, setting the phone on the dock was easier than fumbling around for a wire to plug in. And the slower charging didn\u2019t matter, because I was asleep.The pad was less useful. With the phone lying flat, I had to remove it from the charger whenever I wanted to check it. A wireless charging pad or stand can also be placed on an office desk. The idea is to quickly set your phone down on the charger whenever you return to the table.Wireless charging isn\u2019t beneficial in an office environment, assuming you care about speed and productivity.If you want your device to stay charged between meetings, the slower speed is inconvenient. In my test, the Anker stand took about 10 minutes longer to replenish 25 percent of battery than a wired charger.The other downside in the office is that you can\u2019t easily use the phone to write a message without removing it from the charger. With a cord, you can do all your important tasks while staying plugged in.A wireless battery pack was great for date night. During dinner with my partner, it was nice to skip carrying a cord. We set the battery down on the table and took turns recharging our devices.You could place a charging pad on a TV stand or end table for guests to replenish their phones when they come over. It\u2019s not only convenient and hospitable, but it also looks less tacky than dangling cords all over your common areas.Mr. Quong said the mount was conceived as an all-in-one solution, eliminating the need to buy two separate accessories for mounting and charging a phone. But given the high price of $70 for the Mophie mount, I recommend going piecemeal. Plus, a wire was still involved anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Gab, an Extremist-Friendly Site, Pittsburgh Shooting Suspect Aired His Hatred in Full", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers\u2019s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online.But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a \u201cfree speech\u201d alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers:There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert \u2014 or \u201cred pill,\u201d in the parlance of right-wing internet activists \u2014 a new generation to their cause.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business.\u201cThe challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,\u201d said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. \u201cIf an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren\u2019t going to think it\u2019s a good place for their baby photos.\u201dBut the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms \u2014 and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab.\u201cWe have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers and several payment processors,\u201d the statement read.In addition, GoDaddy, the domain name provider, told Gab it had 24 hours to move its domain name to another service, after finding content on the site that promoted violence.\u201cWhen a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,\u201d a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons.In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab\u2019s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers\u2019s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation.\u201cBecause he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,\u201d Mr. Torba wrote. \u201cThey would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.\u201dMr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab\u2019s core mission of promoting free speech.\u201cTwitter and other platforms police \u2018hate speech\u2019 as long as it isn\u2019t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis double standard does not exist on Gab.\u201dWhat did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers\u2019s hatred for Jews.The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab\u2019s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology.\u201cGab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,\u201d said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. \u201cGab\u2019s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.\u201dIn the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate.On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers\u2019s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement\u2019s long-term prospects by resorting to violence.\u201cThis guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,\u201d one member wrote.A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting.On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab\u2019s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because \u201cGab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.\u201dAsked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer.\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
