{"Headline": "What You Need to Do Because of Flaws in Computer Chips", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the world\u2019s largest tech companies have been working on fixes for these problems. But the researchers who discovered the flaws said one of them, Spectre, is not completely fixable. \u201cIt is a fundamental flaw in the way processors have been built over the last decades,\u201d said Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered these flaws.Here is a guide to what you need to know and what you should do.Both are issues with the way computer chips are designed.Meltdown affects most processors made by Intel, the company that supplies the chips for a majority of PCs and more than 90 percent of computer servers.Spectre is far more difficult for hackers to exploit. But it is even more pervasive, affecting Intel chips, microprocessors from the longtime Intel rival AMD and the many chips that use designs from the British company ARM. Your smartphone most likely contains an ARM chip.Both flaws provide hackers with a way of stealing data, including passwords and other sensitive information. If hackers manage to get software running on one of these chips, they can grab data from other software running on the same machine.This is a particular issue on cloud computing services.Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, these are services where any business or individual can rent access to computing power over the internet. On a cloud service, each server is typically shared by many different customers. By exploiting the Meltdown flaw, a hacker can just load some software onto a cloud service and then grab data from anyone else who has loaded software onto the same server.Phones and PCs are more difficult targets. Before they can exploit the chip flaws, hackers must find a way of getting their software onto your device. They could fool you into downloading an app from a smartphone app store. Or they could trick you into visiting a website that moves code onto your machine.The onus is now on consumers and businesses to install the fix on their machines.Keep your software up-to-date. That includes your operating system and apps like your web browser and antivirus software. Microsoft, Mozilla and Google have already released patches for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome to help address the problem.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs, and they carry malware.\u201dYour operating system and apps typically have a button you can click to check for software updates. For example, in Google\u2019s Chrome browser on a computer, you can click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and click Update Google Chrome. To update Windows, click the Start button and click through these buttons: Settings, Update & security, Windows Update and Check for updates. To update the Mac system, open the App Store app and check the Updates tab for the latest software.Amazon, Google and Microsoft said that they had already patched most of the of servers that underpin their cloud computing services, and that largely addresses the problem. But Amazon and Google also said customers might need to make additional changes.To share computing power with customers, cloud services offer \u201cvirtual machines.\u201d These are computers that exist only in digital form. Customers use these virtual machines to run their own software. After Amazon, Google and Microsoft update their machines, customers may have to update the operating systems running on their own virtual machines to guard against some exploits.No. The researchers who discovered Meltdown said that patching systems would slow them down by as much as 30 percent in certain situations. That could be a problem for big cloud systems.Independent software developers also ran tests on a patched version of Linux, the open-source operating system that now drives more than 30 percent of the world\u2019s servers, and saw similar slowdowns.\u201cThere are many cases where the performance impact is zero,\u201d said Andres Frome, a software developer who has tested the new code. \u201cBut if you are running something like a payment system, where a lot of small changes are made to data, it looks like there will be a significant performance impact.\u201dConsumers are less likely to be affected, and Mr. Kocher said slowdowns could dissipate over time as companies refined their patches.According to the researchers who discovered these flaws, including security experts at Google, the memory chip maker Rambus and various academic institutions, Spectre can\u2019t be completely fixed. But patches can solve the problems in some situations. Intel and Microsoft and others said the same.No, according to the researchers. But Spectre is much more difficult than Meltdown for hackers to exploit.Similar to Meltdown, Spectre can steal information from one application and share it with another. For example, an app you download from the web could steal information like passwords from other software on a computer.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert that said the only solution to the threats posed by Meltdown and Spectre would be a full replacement of the chips. But that does not seem feasible, given how many machines are involved. \u201cSpectre is going to be with us a lot longer,\u201d Mr. Kocher said.An Intel vice president, Donald Parker, is adamant that the company\u2019s chips will not need to be replaced. He said that with software patches and \u201cfirmware updates\u201d \u2014 a way of updating code on the chip itself \u2014 Intel and other companies could \u201cmitigate the issues.\u201dNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Hackers: Sophisticated, Frustrated and a Rising Global Threat", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Between breaking into the email accounts of United States government officials, political dissidents and international human rights organizations, Iranian hackers liked to joke about their slow internet service, poor pay and lack of skilled colleagues.In conversations obtained by security researchers, the hackers groused like any other start-up employees, often frustrated by their lack of progress and inability to carry out more grandiose schemes.But the work being discussed had global ramifications, and painted a picture of how Iranian hackers have matured over the last decade from defacing websites with crude photos and slogans. Now, they appear to be an organized work force, starting systematic cyberespionage campaigns aimed at promoting Iran\u2019s interests around the world and on curbing dissent within the Islamic Republic.\u201cThrough their carelessness, we were able to get a real picture of who these individuals are and what their goals are,\u201d said Mr. Anderson, who has been researching Iranian hackers for more than five years.The hackers appeared to be testing malicious software on themselves or accidentally clicked on malware they were developing. Either way, they exposed activity on their own computers, inadvertently giving researchers a glimpse into their lives through chat logs, emails and the targeting of their victims.One six-month chat log between two Iranian hackers gave particular insight into how they ran their day-to-day operation. By tracing where and how web domains were registered, as well as other data found online, Mr. Anderson concluded that the aliases \u201cmb_1986\u201d and \u201cArYaIeIrAN\u201d represented two Iranian men whose real names were Mojtaba Borhani and Behrouz Keshvari.Neither replied to a request for comment sent to email addresses referred to in their chat logs.Over time, the two become more sophisticated, developing malware as they moved between Iranian hacking groups. Recently, the men have been tied to a group known as \u201cCharming Kitten\u201d by security companies. The group is believed to be responsible for a range of attacks, including targeting aviation companies in the United States.The chat logs showed two men frustrated with the pace of their work.\u201cWe need someone for Mac in Tehran,\u201d Mr. Keshvari wrote on June 15, 2014, bringing up a topic the two men had discussed nearly a month earlier. The best hackers, he complained, were making \u201cgood money\u201d elsewhere, and were not tempted by the idea of moving to Tehran to work in a cramped office for roughly $780 a month. There should be some other benefit, Mr. Keshvari joked, at one point suggesting they offer to send prospective hires on vacation to Turkey and Thailand.Mr. Keshvari appeared focused on bringing in prospective new hires, but he was often stymied by Mr. Borhani. On May 30, 2014, he complained that Mr. Borhani had scared off prospective new hires.\u201cListen, if during the interview you ask them about working with SCADA, I will kill you,\u201d Mr. Keshvari wrote, referring to the operating system used to control industrial facilities, such as power plants or oil and gas refineries.Mr. Keshvari responded that he \u201cdoes not do the interview in this way.\u201d And after several profanities were exchanged, the two agreed to meet with a new recruit.\u201cWe need them \u2026 send them here,\u201d Mr. Borhani wrote. He repeatedly pressed for programmers with expertise in Mac operating systems.Their focus on hiring people with an expertise in Apple products, specifically the Mac operating system, was unsurprising, Mr. Anderson said, given that many of Iran\u2019s dissidents and human rights workers had transitioned to Apple products in the hopes that they would prove more secure than Microsoft\u2019s Windows software.\u201cImagine them like start-ups who are contracted to the government,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThey are chasing demographics that the government has an interest in targeting.\u201dThe two men often discussed names and shared phone numbers of people they were working with, and one individual appeared to warrant deference. A figure named only as \u201cHajji,\u201d a title widely used in the Muslim world to denote someone who carries out the hajj, a sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, appeared to frequently visit the men and make final decisions on whom they could hire to help with various projects.\u201cIt seems likely that Hajji is an Iranian government handler,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Iran\u2019s government, he added, is careful to not directly tie itself to hackers involved in offensive operations. Iran\u2019s government also probably operates a separate cyberwarfare department, though the people it employs there appear more skilled and better at covering their tracks, he said.In the year since President Trump took office, Iran has focused its efforts on infiltrating the computers of anyone associated with the president, Mr. Anderson said.\u201cThey are clearly trying to gain any insight they can as to what this administration is going to do vis-\u00e0-vis Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very persistent, but we don\u2019t know their level of success.\u201dThere are few who know Iranian hackers persistence better than Thamar E. Gindin, an Iran specialist from Shalem College of Liberal Arts in Israel.In May 2015, Ms. Gindin was the \u201cpatient zero\u201d in an attack by Iranian hackers, who infiltrated her computer through a malicious email and used it to try to gain access to other academics studying Iran, according to a report published by the Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky.With the help of ClearSky, the hackers were booted from her system. But in the two years since, they have tried almost monthly to get back in through a number of ploys playing to her personal interests \u2014 including posing as reporters from the BBC who hoped to interview her, and sharing a file on \u201cunique chocolates\u201d after she wrote a post on Facebook promoting her cousin\u2019s chocolate business.Among the groups targeting her are Charming Kitten, the group Mr. Borhani and Mr. Keshvari had been linked to.\u201cI feel like we are playing a game. I have to admit, I kind of like them,\u201d Ms. Gindin said. \u201cThey are persistent and stubborn, but they aren\u2019t very smart all the time. It\u2019s really like a game.\u201cAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Is a Bitcoin Believer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday and happy new year!\u2022 Bitcoin\u2019s value jumped as Peter Thiel\u2019s venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency.\u2022 Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial\u2019s purchase of MoneyGram.\u2022 The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time.\u2022 Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year.\u2022 The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail.From Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

Their primary attack method, researchers said, was through a series of decoy Android apps designed to look like widely used private, secure messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal.Once downloaded, the apps allowed spies to steal nearly everything off their victims\u2019 phones, including text messages with one-time passcodes for accessing email and other services, as well as contact lists, call logs, browsing history, audio recordings and photos. The apps also let the spies take photos using the phone\u2019s front or back camera, and turned the device into a silent microphone to capture audio. The apps were not designed to target Apple iPhone users.\u201cOne of the main takeaways from this investigation is that actors, like Dark Caracal, are shifting away from a pure desktop capability for espionage to now relying heavily on mobile tools to gather their intelligence,\u201d said Michael Flossman, a security analyst at Lookout, referring to the name that he and other researchers coined for the Lebanese spies they said were most likely responsible for the espionage.GDGS is Lebanon\u2019s main internal intelligence agency, and its director, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, a career army general, has a rising profile and a broadening portfolio. The agency oversees residency permits for foreigners, from diplomats and tens of thousands of Southeast Asian domestic workers to more than a million Syrian refugees. The agency\u2019s expertise and clout has traditionally been seen as stemming from its human intelligence, not from high-tech espionage techniques.Speaking ahead of the report\u2019s publication, General Ibrahim told Reuters: \u201cGeneral Security does not have these type of capabilities. We wish we had these capabilities.\u201d GDGS did not return a call for comment on Thursday.Together, researchers tracked the spying to command and control servers operated by the attackers. The researchers looked at who had registered the servers and when, as well as the dates of some of the stolen content. They deduced that the campaign had been going on for as long as six years.The attackers were targeting journalists and activists, as well as government officials, military personnel, financial institutions, defense contractors and others in 21 countries. Those countries included the United States, China, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and inside Lebanon.The researchers traced the attacks to a building in Beirut that houses Lebanon\u2019s GDGS, using Wi-Fi networks and so-called internet protocol addresses assigned to attackers\u2019 machines. While researchers said they could not be sure whether the attacks were the work of the GDGS or rogue employees, many of the attacks appeared tied to an email address \u2014 op13@mail.com \u2014 that had been linked to various online personas, including \u201cNancy Razzouk\u201d and \u201cRami Jabbour.\u201d All of the physical addresses listed with registrations made by that email account were clustered around the GDGS building in Beirut, according to the user\u2019s wireless activity.Emails sent to that email address were not returned.As part of their work, researchers found evidence that Lebanese spies were directing victims to install the spy apps through WhatsApp messages that began innocuously with a \u201cHow are you?\u201d Those then linked to the spy apps with additional messages like \u201cYou can download from here to communicate further.\u201dIn other cases, the spies found their targets on Facebook, inviting them to Facebook groups, where they posted links to their decoy apps, which they often referred to by names like \u201cWhatsApp plus.\u201d The spies also directed victims to fake login sites for social media services like Twitter and Facebook to steal their credentials, hijack their accounts and push out trick messages to more people.Researchers also found evidence that Lebanese officials had previously used FinFisher, a product manufactured by the British company Gamma International, which sells surveillance tools that let customers turn computers and phones into listening devices to monitor a target\u2019s messages, calls and whereabouts. Increasingly, researchers discovered that the spies had built their own custom mobile spy tools that were less sophisticated than FinFisher but as effective in getting the intelligence they were after.Researchers also uncovered evidence that Lebanese officials deployed several variants of malware to victims\u2019 desktop machines; the malware was designed to work across several operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple\u2019s Mac and Linux. That malware could steal screenshots of victims\u2019 computer screens, use the victim\u2019s webcam to spy on their physical whereabouts, record sound, grab photos and any Skype activity, file listings and files, and even iPhone backups.In the hours after researchers published their report on Thursday, the servers conducting the spying went dark.Anne Barnard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Warn of Hits From Tax Cuts. Don\u2019t Be Fooled.", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt will sound like bad news.Over the next few weeks, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, household names including Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson, are likely to warn that their financial results will be severely dented, if not altogether wiped out, by huge tax bills that they have to pay to the Internal Revenue Service.Don\u2019t be fooled.The big one-time losses are a prelude to even bigger profits \u2014 a paradox caused by the tax cuts that recently zoomed through Congress and that largely benefit corporations.A couple of provisions in the tax package are prompting many companies \u2014 those based in the United States as well as some foreign corporations with big American presences \u2014 to pay the taxman while anticipating huge savings for decades to come.Until now, companies generally didn\u2019t have to pay federal income taxes on such earnings, at least not immediately, as long as those profits stayed overseas. But if the companies brought the money back to the United States, they would face a 35 percent tax rate (minus whatever they had already paid tax collectors in other countries).American companies currently attribute about $2.8 trillion to their overseas units. The new law requires them to bring the money back to the United States \u2014 or to \u201crepatriate\u201d it \u2014 but at reduced tax rates as low as 8 percent.The phenomenon is likely to be on display in the next few weeks, as companies report financial results that look surprisingly weak because of the tax law.Why? Because the repatriation provision is part of a package likely to deliver vastly larger long-term savings for the world\u2019s biggest multinationals. Mr. Zion estimates the benefit from the repatriation tax break alone could be worth $500 billion to companies compared with the old law \u2014 more than double what they\u2019re paying upfront.And so profit warnings that normally would leave investors shuddering are instead being taken in stride.Apple might eventually fork over about $33 billion to the I.R.S. when those earnings come back to America, Mr. Zion said. But, in yet another oddity caused by the tax package, the company might actually record a one-time benefit to its profits.That\u2019s because, over the years, Apple has set aside money, at least in accounting terms, to cover the potential taxes it might owe on its offshore earnings. But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.Going forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.Under the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)The new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.It is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.In Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.Credit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.Several companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain. They included the German automakers BMW and Daimler, which both said the law would provide a temporary benefit of more than $1 billion.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Targets for Elon Musk Would Put His Pay in Orbit", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTesla\u2019s board of directors is driving executive pay into electric dreamland. The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Airborne Opulence to the Upper Upper Upper Class", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "featureFor a private-jet broker, success is all about knowing who\u2019s who in the world\u2019s 0.0001 percent.Supported byThe plane\u2019s opulence \u2014 its seats embroidered with what the reality-TV star claimed was the Trump family crest \u2014 and its billionaire pedigree recalled a venerable tradition of elite mobility, whereby warrior-aristocrats would commission costly ships not just for splendid seafaring and maritime conflict but for exchange among themselves, as gifts befitting their shared station. These practices endured for millenniums, from Pharaonic barges and Chinese imperial dragon boats to medieval Viking galleys (as, in the 10th century, when King Harald Fairhair of Norway presented to King Aethelstan of the West Saxons and the Mercians a purple-sailed vessel with a bow of gold) and British royal yachts, which Queen Victoria lent liberally to friends like the Empress of Austria.The early custodians of the American experiment, with egalitarian ideals and no real use for fancy boats, moved from here to there with relative humility. In 1787, when Thomas Jefferson set out from Paris for a three-month, 1,200-mile visit to American interests in Mediterranean seaports, he took no servants and paid personally to refresh the carriage horses. It was only with the arrival of the train that Americans developed a taste for class-differentiated transit. Perhaps the first private celebrity rail car was built by P.T. Barnum as a touring parlor for the \u201cSwedish nightingale,\u201d Jenny Lind, and soon these were de rigueur among robber barons like Leland Stanford, George Gould and Charles Schwab. William H. Vanderbilt, during the decade-long tenure he enjoyed as the richest man in America, ordered what The Chicago Daily Tribune identified in 1882 as \u201cthe most expensive private vehicle in the world.\u201d The Vanderbilt featured a \u201cgrand saloon\u201d with lavish exterior panels of train depots and suspension bridges rendered in oil, but its owner emphasized not the trappings but the performance: \u201cMr. Vanderbilt has inherited his father\u2019s fondness for fast traveling, and, in a lesser degree, the old Commodore\u2019s partiality for what is known in railroad-parlance as \u2018going special\u2019 \u2014 which is traveling with a special engine, on special time and without regard to the trains and traffic of the road.\u201dYet even after these industrial and financial titans had begun to avail themselves of such perquisites, our heads of state maintained lingering reservations about priority treatment. In late 1863, the government appropriated funds to outfit President Lincoln with a custom rail coach. Later accounts would inflate the car\u2019s extravagance, but according to the assistant master car builder in Alexandria, Va., \u201cAnyone who knew the habits of Mr. Lincoln would scout the idea of his designing an armored car of such luxurious appointments for his own use in going to the front.\u201d The Great Emancipator rode in it but once, when the somber whistle-stop tour of the \u201cLincoln Special\u201d returned his earthly remains to Springfield. It was not until 1942, after aides persuaded President Roosevelt that safety concerns necessitated a special-purpose vehicle, that American commanders in chief took their passage in executive style, in a V.I.P.-retrofitted version of the Pullman Company\u2019s Ferdinand Magellan. In January 1943, the train delivered Roosevelt under cover of night to Miami. He was taken in three legs across the Atlantic on a Boeing 314, the Dixie Clipper, to meet Churchill and De Gaulle in Casablanca. It was the first time a sitting U.S. president had flown.Varsano, who says he has sold or helped to sell almost 300 aircraft over the course of his career, is a large, fit, exceptionally good looking and effortlessly agreeable self-made man of 61. He has an imposing head crowned with slicked-back pewter hair, piercing eyes of an Aegean blue, an imperial nose and the resplendent smile of a beloved crooner on a Caesars Palace pension. He wears suits made by the Ghanaian-British Savile Row designer Ozwald Boateng over worn Italian loafers, and carries a weathered gray Louis Vuitton briefcase with a heavy metal clasp. His business card is milled from galvanized metal. By his estimate, the total value of sales he has brokered exceeds $4 billion.Although Varsano shares the migratory patterns of his clients, and it is not unusual for him to fly from London to New York or Dubai for lunch, he thinks his most effective work is done in a stationary environment. His groundbreaking storefront concept rested on a simple premise, which might be called, in contrast to the \u201cfoot traffic\u201d that animates most retail, Bentley traffic. The scene: A jaded \u201cprincipal,\u201d as the industry refers to owners or potential owners, seated languidly in the rear of a Mulsanne, catches the apparition of a full-scale airplane fuselage glowing in a plate-glass window, removes his Cartier sunglasses and petitions his driver to loop back around. On arrival, these principals are typically received at a back door, asked for a business card and then stalled by reception just long enough \u2014 usually no more than 90 seconds \u2014 for Varsano to locate the V.I.P. in his proprietary worldwide database of owners, then press a button that splashes the store\u2019s enormous display wall with an image of the visitor\u2019s current plane.There aren\u2019t many places on Earth with a large enough community of transient billionaires to support such immoderately high-end retail, but central London is one of them. After much thought about his new location, Varsano decided that the best chance of catching his customers on their brief earthbound dalliances was from a space on Park Lane, which runs along Hyde Park\u2019s eastern perimeter. Varsano declined to divulge the rent, but comparable real estate listings suggest a price of about three-quarters of a million dollars a year. The store\u2019s interior has been furnished as a gallery of sumptuous surfaces: panels of midnight blue velvet offset with enormous beveled mirrors; columns and floors in a storm-cloud-patterned marble; rectilinear sconces of a translucent black-veined marble; timbering of dark lacquered walnut and mahogany; side tables set with purple succulents in glimmering copper spheres and moon-white orchids. To the rear is a clubroom, supervised by a large photograph of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin on an aircraft\u2019s staircase \u2014 Varsano sold Sinatra a Learjet in the early 1980s, though his honor obligated him to tell me it wasn\u2019t the one in the picture \u2014 and Varsano\u2019s personal office, swathed in gray crocodile skin, where he sits, behind an armored door, at a desk once owned by Margaret Thatcher.\u201cGood usage of a private aircraft is about 400 hours a year,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did the math, and my calculation is that even 200 hours of use of a corporate jet adds 33 days to an executive\u2019s year. Now, you bring two or three other execs with him \u2014 do the math, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a free C.E.O.! When the automobile companies came to appear in front of Congress and they got such a hard time for arriving on their corporate jets, they shouldn\u2019t have been so wimpish! They should have said, \u2018Yeah, we came in on a private jet, we have a million employees and we\u2019ve got to fly back tonight at midnight to be in the office at 7 a.m. to save this company.\u2019\u2009\u201dHe picked up an infrared mouse and asked one of the two friends \u2014 a luminously preserved businessman who asked not to be named \u2014 to begin by telling him how much he\u2019d be willing to spend, in theory, on a replacement of his seven-year-old plane.\u201cLet\u2019s say 60 million,\u201d the businessman said. Varsano entered a price setting on the enormous screen\u2019s left sidebar. This number, it should be noted, represented only the price of the aircraft itself. For the larger planes, buyers often spend the same amount of money on personal customization as they do on the initial purchase.\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest trip you do regularly?\u201d\u201cLondon to Los Angeles.\u201d Varsano set the range to 4,700 nautical miles.\u201cHow old a plane would you feel comfortable with?\u201d\u201cNew.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say two years,\u201d Varsano proposed. The businessman looked away from the screen and at Varsano. \u201cO.K., one year.\u201d Varsano clicked the corresponding setting.\u201cHow many passengers?\u201d\u201cFourteen.\u201dVarsano finalized the search, and the screen tiled itself into brochure-quality images of aircraft exteriors. \u201cThere are 13 suitable planes potentially on the market for you.\u201d By \u201con the market,\u201d he meant planes that were either actually advertised somewhere or were technically off-market but, as with anything, available at the right price. Varsano scanned over the images. \u201cShould we include an A.C.J. or a B.B.J., or not one of those big ones?\u201d About 20 years ago, in an attempt to capture a share of what was then an increasingly profitable private market, Boeing and Airbus developed imprints of their companies \u2014 Boeing Business Jets, or B.B.J., and Airbus Corporate Jets, or A.C.J. \u2014 that sell commercial airliners with V.I.P. configurations. These \u201cbizliners\u201d are much larger than a typical private jet, with space for multiple bedrooms and showers or thrones, and use more gas; they can cost from $90 million to $500 million, and as much as $13,000 an hour to run. Individuals, Varsano told me in Geneva, often avoid them because of what the industry calls \u201cramp presence\u201d: The size and bulbousness of a B.B.J. or an A.C.J. invite class resentment, and, worse, might remind onlookers of the easyJet they flew in on. A Gulfstream is regarded as a more prudent and tasteful choice. The G650, Gulfstream\u2019s flagship product, is currently the skyfaring object of greatest desire, and it is no exaggeration to call the $70 million aircraft the world\u2019s single greatest status commodity. Desire for them is so ardent in part because of their physical elegance \u2014 they have a phocine aspect, with a silkily sloping underbelly and large, widely spaced elliptical portholes, with an interior like a conch shell \u2014 and in part because they cut a more discreet profile.\u201cThen we\u2019ll compare three possibilities: a bizliner, a Gulfstream G650 and a Global 6000\u201d \u2014 the last of these a roughly comparable model from the Canadian firm Bombardier. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the ranges,\u201d Varsano proposed, and the screen lit up with a world map, centered on London and overlaid with \u201cmaximum range perimeters\u201d in red, blue and yellow, scrolling across the continents in chromatic sine waves. The ranges swept down from Los Angeles almost to S\u00e3o Paulo before coming back up to the east, to comfortably include Dubai, and then ultimately sweeping in a band between Beijing and Tokyo. The businessman nodded.\u201cNow let\u2019s look at the differences in cross-section.\u201d Three overlapping fuselage outlines appeared on the screen, again in red, blue and yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s a 100 percent scale,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cGet up and stand there.\u201d The businessman measured himself against the images and did not find the dimensions wanting.\u201cO.K., sell me the B.B.J.,\u201d the businessman said, in a failed attempt to seem idly flirtatious.Varsano clicked again. \u201cHere\u2019s the market data, all the B.B.J.s for sale around the world according to our database.\u201d The video wall exhibited a branded, proprietary table with the relevant real-time statistics \u2014 date of manufacture, delivery date, passenger allowance, range, expected price \u2014 for around 20 planes. The top line featured an aircraft that had only a thousand hours on it, which represented either about two and a half years of private use or perhaps a month and a half of commercial deployment. It was located in an Asian country for more than $70 million and had been on the market for almost a year. Varsano scrolled through images, drawn from his firm\u2019s database, of the actual interiors of the available planes, while subtly discouraging the businessman from his instinct to purchase one brand-new. This was in part because delivery of new planes can take a very long time and in part because there is no rational reason for anyone to purchase a new plane, and on some level the idea violates Varsano\u2019s respect for his product\u2019s engineering and durability.\u201cSo, Steve,\u201d the businessman asked, with the merest hint of vulnerability, \u201cwhat would you buy?\u201d\u201cWhat about the Gulfstream?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019d get to L.A. an hour faster, but you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy with the kids and the nannies and the animals.\u201d The businessman, who had both grown children and still-nannied children, said nothing.\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d Varsano continued, \u201cyou have to fly on one of these yourself \u2014 and that means chartering one and taking the whole family to L.A., not just taking an empty one to Milan alone. You won\u2019t have the real experience that way.\u201d\u201cWell, I love the idea of a B.B.J., but I don\u2019t like the noise, the cabin volume.\u201d He paused again. The pretense that this was simply a fun half-drunken near-midnight exercise had been openly abandoned. \u201cThis is coming up. I have to do it sooner rather than later.\u201dVarsano wears special French cuffs with round cutouts to display a saucer-size watch; he glanced down and saw that it was nearly midnight. He stood up and asked us to take our places on the dimly moonlit sidewalk outside. We watched as he ceremonially lifted the shades for the first time, revealing the pristine fuselage bathed in pools of aquamarine and royal blue. Tufts of cumulus, floodlit from below, had been painted on the ceiling above the plane. After just a few moments, Varsano closed the shades again, and the incandescent celestial blue disappeared once more into the reflected red and white flashes of terrestrial traffic.More than one person told me that Varsano probably knew more billionaires personally than anyone alive. He admitted he had never quite gotten used to his current circumstances. Though he had been dealing jets on and off for almost 30 years, for a long time, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really part of this world. I just worked in it.\u201d Varsano was born in Manhattan but raised on the far side of the George Washington Bridge, in the working-class suburbs near Teterboro Airport. Teterboro now hosts the largest share of American private-jet traffic, but back then it was just another local airstrip. He was brought up by a single mother \u2014 his father left his family when Varsano was 5 \u2014 who always worked at least two jobs, as a waitress and in beauty salons, where Varsano swept the floor. When he was 14, a friend\u2019s older brother took him up in a four-seater Cessna. He would work for a month as a dishwasher to be able to afford an hour of flying lessons and got his pilot\u2019s license when he was 17. He went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a prestigious flight academy in Daytona Beach that he calls \u201cthe Harvard of the sky.\u201d It was his first exposure to extreme international wealth, especially the variety that accrued to despots and their associates. \u201cIt was full of kids like the son of Idi Amin, who drove Ferraris around Daytona and would then go back to the military in their country. It was a real who\u2019s who.\u201dHe first worked as an intern at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater airport, then moved to Washington in 1978 for an entry-level job as an aviation lobbyist. The association had a plane he could fly whenever he liked, as long as he paid for gas, but he was making only $13,000 a year. It was the age of disco, and his roommate ran the Apple Tree, \u201cthe hottest club in D.C. It was the place to go, a special elite place.\u201d He worked as a doorman to make gas money for the plane. One day a guy came into the Apple Tree with a Learjet on his tie pin. \u201cThese were the days people used to wear tie pins,\u201d Varsano explained to me. \u201cWhen people used to wear ties.\u201d Varsano went up to him and discovered he worked for a jet brokerage. \u201cI said, Screw this, I want a job there.\u201d The man got him an interview.\u201cI put on the best polyester suit I could find, and I go in there, and everybody\u2019s sitting around in T-shirts and jeans. They told me they never meet their customers. They do it all on the phone. I say, \u2018How do you sell a $5 million plane on the phone?\u2019 But that was just the way the business was done.\u201d They allowed him to work on a commission-only basis. At night he put in shifts as a waiter in McLean, Va., and by day he tried to sell planes. \u201cAt 4 p.m. I\u2019m talking to a guy about a $4 million Learjet, and at 6 p.m. I\u2019m getting yelled at to refill some guy\u2019s coffee. It was a humbling experience, and it kept me grounded. Seven or eight months later, I sold a Westwind II to one of the richest guys in Venezuela.\u201d (He claims that as they neared Miami during the delivery, the Venezuelan\u2019s associates pulled a gun and tried to kidnap him to Caracas, but he managed to escape.)After Varsano sold a plane to the corporate raider Nelson Peltz in the mid-\u201980s, he went to work for him in the world of private equity, where he developed a halfhearted fondness for the Gekko manner. Varsano coordinated Peltz\u2019s purchase and overhaul of High Winds, DeWitt Wallace\u2019s estate in Bedford, N.Y.; Peltz infuriated the local community by flying his helicopter to Manhattan almost daily. (A representative for Peltz disputed Varsano\u2019s account of their relationship but declined to provide specifics.) When Varsano and a subsequent boss acquired some fast-food companies in the early 2000s, he found himself in charge of the developing-market expansion of the Long John Silver\u2019s brand. Each time he visited the offices of Russian oligarchs or Middle Eastern royals, he found they invariably displayed a model of their private planes. They loved the opportunity to talk about them with someone as knowledgeable as Varsano, and he realized that he had stumbled into an enormous opportunity. Fifteen years ago, 85 percent of the private planes in the world were in the United States, but he could see that was changing. The deals he does today bear out this shift. He outlined one example: \u201cRussian owner, Panamanian shell company, Swiss-registered airplane, selling to a Chinese corporation, with the inspection in Switzerland, lawyers in Germany and the U.K. and the escrow agent in the U.S.\u201dVarsano knows his relevant client base down to nearly the last person, and his aim is to maintain up-to-date records on every single one of the six or seven thousand jets that are large enough for the Jet Business to follow. Roughly a quarter of its business is with first-time buyers, but those leads tend to be so dicey that Varsano\u2019s staff dedicates most of its time and energy to plane-owning people and organizations. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a fast-food restaurant,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cit\u2019s easier to get the guy who comes in three times a month to come in four times a month than it is to get a new customer. So we try to check in with all the current owners at least every quarter.\u201dA research staff works on a trading floor behind convexities of smoked glass, at cockpit-like desks of kid-glove Bentley leather with three screens apiece. They begin with an industry-standard subscription database, but its information \u2014 serial number, registration information, sales history, whatever is known of the ownership and any publicly listed current prices \u2014 is almost always incomplete or unreliable, as the most sensitive data is concealed underneath layers of shell companies incorporated in places like Delaware, Panama or the British Virgin Islands. Beyond ferreting out the basic question of ownership, Varsano\u2019s researchers try to gather as much market information as they can. They\u2019ll see that a given plane is going out of warranty in a year or two, or is about to hit the end of a corporate depreciation schedule, or is due for the sort of routine but expensive engine check that regulators require, or they\u2019ll know a new model is due from the factory soon, and they\u2019ll ask if the owner has given any thought to a sale. Varsano is known to represent serious buyers, so if they call and say they\u2019ve got a customer in the market for a G650 or a Falcon 900LX, his researchers are confident they\u2019ll get legitimate (if exaggerated) bid-ask spreads.After a long afternoon with one of his researchers, I mentioned to Varsano that his constant emphasis on the utility of jets was at times hard to square with the tenor of a market that seems to rely so much on appurtenance and churn. Airplanes are so rigorously regulated in their maintenance that there\u2019s practically no difference, outside cockpit avionics and maintenance fees, between a 20-year-old Gulfstream GV and a freshly delivered G650 except that new-plane smell and about $50 million.Varsano had a prepared answer \u2014 about range and cabin pressure and what it\u2019s worth to a chief executive of a $10 billion company to land at his or her destination refreshed and ready to go \u2014 but on some level he\u2019s well aware that his business relies on covetousness and increasingly customized definitions of need. One of the peculiarities of inequality, as psychologists and social scientists have somewhat belatedly come to understand, is that it has a kind of fractal nature. The relationship of the middle class to the rich is replicated in the relationship between the merely rich and the extremely wealthy. Varsano\u2019s target class is so small that these dynamics, here between the extremely wealthy and the unimaginably so, are crystallized on the level of the individual. The owner of a $25 million plane feels morally judicious \u2014 even humble \u2014 insofar as he doesn\u2019t own a $70 million plane, while at the same time he admires that of his neighbor and hopes for an upgrade. The three or four hundred owners of the $70 million plane come to see it in short order not as a luxury but as a business and lifestyle requirement, and are in turn frustrated that the wireless signal isn\u2019t strong enough and that there just aren\u2019t enough landing slots in Hong Kong or hangar spaces for parking in Mumbai.One summer day, my phone rang from an unknown number, and Robbins\u2019s deep but sweetly croaking voice boomed on the line. A few years ago Robbins mentioned to his friend Steve Wynn that it was time for him to buy a plane, and Wynn told him that he was crazy to talk to anyone but Varsano \u2014 that he would never even think of buying a plane from anybody but Varsano. Varsano helped Robbins buy a Bombardier Global Express previously owned by Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival cruises and the owner of the Miami Heat, who had recently decided to upgrade to a Gulfstream G650. Varsano literally had to walk across hot coals to close the deal. Robbins loved the plane. It felt like his second home \u2014 or, to be more precise, his seventh.Robbins told me he was flying to Vancouver that afternoon and said that I was welcome to fly with him in about 10 days\u2019 time from Vancouver to Las Vegas, with a stopover in Spokane to drop off his wife. His schedule, he explained, probably wouldn\u2019t coalesce until a few days before he set off \u2014 \u201cPart of the value of having a private jet,\u201d he explained in a subsequent voice memo, \u201cis that you don\u2019t have to make decisions until the last minute\u201d \u2014 and he ultimately decided on a Friday that he\u2019d be leaving for Vegas the following Tuesday morning. My overbooked flight to Seattle arrived late, but fortunately my overbooked connecting flight to Vancouver was also late. One of Robbins\u2019s assistants texted me the night before to ask if I had any dietary restrictions and to say that the plane was set to depart at 11:30 the next morning, so I should be at the Shell Aerocentre at Abbotsford, some 40 miles east of Vancouver, no later than 11:20.When I arrived at the private terminal, I was supposed to look for a tail number that included, as many registrations do, the owner\u2019s initials. That task was made considerably easier by the fact that the plane \u2014 the size of a building and bone-white against the wildfire-smoked sky \u2014 was emblazoned with a modestly stylized \u201cTR\u201d monogram. It was also the only aircraft there, just sitting on the apron slightly askance, the way you might hurriedly park at midnight in an otherwise empty lot. The underbelly of the aircraft was painted a soft navy, with curved racing stripes of silver and gold. Robbins showed up with his wife and her parents, proceeded through a gate in the chain-link fence and strolled slowly to the plane\u2019s stairs. The pink-necktied captain came to relieve me of my bag, stuck a green Post-it on it upon which someone had scrawled \u201cVegas\u201d and asked if it would be acceptable to place it in the rear cargo bay. He did that himself. Two maintenance men loaded the rest of the luggage from the tarmac into the hold, saving the garment bags and the golf clubs for last.With five minutes before takeoff, the captain came to usher me to the plane, where I was met by Robbins\u2019s aeronautic major-domo, Ariane, a tall, well-seasoned flight attendant in a gray business-suit uniform. The interior smelled faintly of eucalyptus. She took me to Robbins, who was sitting in what Varsano had told me was the V.I.P. chair, on the starboard side facing forward toward the galley and the pilots. After briefly introducing me to his wife, Robbins suggested we retire to the rear of the aircraft to introduce ourselves.At 6-foot-7, Robbins could not begin to stand fully upright in any non-bizliner plane, but the Global came close, and he had to reduce himself by only a head to make his way past the couch and the sideboard to the rear of the cabin. About a minute with Robbins is enough to convince anyone that his size is actually a practical matter of spatio-energetic prerequisite: Any smaller vessel would simply disintegrate at the slightest vent of his life force. This energy is indivisible into units of small talk, and if Robbins ever allows for a moment of conversational entropy \u2014 by looking away from your eyes for a split second \u2014 it\u2019s only out of politeness, to afford you the opportunity to regather your own wan, windblown vitality. He wore all black, a black exercise V-neck over black shorts, with a black baseball cap and black-and-red Nikes, in what could only have been a genuine if futile attempt to dim the charge of his fluorescence.Both the couch in the main cabin and the conference-room area in the rear had been opened out into their bed configurations, with fleecy comforters and pillowcases monogrammed with the plane\u2019s registration number. The beds and corridor were littered with multicolored balloons and confetti and conical party hats, and above the entrance to the rear of the cabin was affixed a sign that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The family had celebrated the birthdays that weekend of both his wife and one of his assistants, Mary, whom he called his \u201cright arm,\u201d though as an adult human of regular size she seemed relatively petite in comparison to his actual right arm. While Robbins had been with his wife\u2019s family, Ariane had found the most well-stocked party store in northern Vancouver and had decorated the plane as a surprise. This effort had not gone unnoticed. \u201cYou went to north Vancouver to find a party store? You\u2019re so incredibly dedicated.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cShe makes it feel like home.\u201d\u201cAriane,\u201d Robbins continued, \u201cis like family for us. She treats this place like it\u2019s a home \u2014 and it is a home away from home. You\u2019ve got all your stuff on it, all your family on it.\u201d He\u2019d been chartering planes since he was 31 or 32, and he was now 57. He had been an owner for only three years, but the difference had come to seem like one of the great disjunctures of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a different quality of life, for sure. I can go from the West Coast to China nonstop, East Coast to Australia with one stop. I have a resort in Fiji, and obviously going there before was a difficult situation, but now it\u2019s easy. You can do everything on your own terms, on your own timeline, which is wonderful.\u201d The beds were out and made because the beds were always out and made in case somebody decided to sleep.Ariane came back and offered us a selection of newspapers and some scones. \u201cThe captain says the flight to Spokane will be 37 minutes and should be pretty smooth.\u201d He told me about his admiration of Varsano, then moved on to talk of Crispr, the Human Genome Project and machine learning, and Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 always stopping to make sure that I was there with him, that I was interested, that if I had something to contribute I should feel welcome, that we were \u201ctossing the ball back and forth\u201d \u2014 and how he wanted to make sure that there was enough investment in new biotechnologies that the rejuvenatory stem-cell therapy for which he\u2019d paid a Panamanian clinic many tens of thousands of dollars would soon be cheap enough that everybody could benefit. He pointed at me as an example of someone who could benefit. Then he abruptly stood up and said that he wanted to spend a little time up front with his wife, but that we could resume such an interesting conversation on the leg to Vegas.As he moved to the front, he invited me to help myself to the breakfast buffet \u2014 hash browns, scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, a vast array of fruit \u2014 that Ariane had set up on the sideboard. I looked at the panel behind the chair that Robbins vacated and saw that we had only 17 more minutes to arrival. I hadn\u2019t even noticed we\u2019d taken off. We stopped in Spokane, dropped off his wife, went through private Customs and Border Protection and resumed our way to Vegas. Robbins invited me to the front and asked if I\u2019d made sure my family would have a secure financial future.It was only the soft bing-bong chime that indicated our initial descent over the rumpled and barren landscape of southern Nevada that even remotely recalled the experience of commercial flight. Otherwise, the experience felt nothing at all like being on an airliner. In fact, it didn\u2019t quite feel like flying at all. It was more like sitting in a comfortable leather armchair in a pleasingly cool and well-appointed room that at some point incidentally rose above the clouds and stayed there for a little while. Many of the people I spoke to in Geneva talked about private aviation as a variety of peak experience \u2014 and such an inarticulable experience was, after all, why Varsano told me that I could never understand private aviation without an experiential component \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was if anything the opposite of a peak experience, distinguished not by anything explicitly euphoric or divine but by its total coruscating absence of everything that makes contemporary commercial air travel a pricking trial of alienation and diminishment.Shortly after 8, Varsano pressed some buttons in an app on his phone to raise the shades, and the showroom\u2019s gray-and-blue interior flooded with rare London sun, mottled with umber from a hurricane bound for Ireland. Varsano\u2019s visitors tended in the past to show up whenever and however they felt like it, so Varsano was anxious that initial business would be slow. The storefront\u2019s start-up costs had been extremely high. He occasionally mentioned to people that for the capital he sank into the store, he could have his own plane.His first appointment came via text from a member of a minor, impoverished branch of the aristocracy of a Southern European country, a useful person for whom Varsano had some pity. Some websites identified him as a count, and his Instagram account featured grainy, oversaturated selfies with Ivanka Trump and Silvio Berlusconi. The count was with an American friend and wanted to broker an introduction; if the meeting resulted in the sale, Varsano would kick him a finder\u2019s fee. He was a member of an entire echelon that had been surprised to find that what they possessed was no longer real wealth, and they weren\u2019t sure how to accommodate an economy that had changed so rapidly beneath their ancient lineages. \u201cThese people,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cthey don\u2019t even know how to make a living \u2014 all they know is they know people, they have incredible family connections, and that\u2019s how they survive. He\u2019s a professional introducer.\u201dOver the next three days of renewed operation, Varsano had at least three serious visitors a day, and nobody stayed for less than an hour. They were all men, though he did plan to bring a female billionaire friend to see it after a late dinner nearby. There was one guy who\u2019d run a large private-equity firm and then went on to oversee the national fleet of a Persian Gulf country, which was interested in selling at least two G650s in the next year; he had come in an entourage of four and said, almost apologetically, that he\u2019d been hearing such impressive things about Varsano\u2019s store for so long, and that he regretted his visit was so belated. There was another guy from a Central European management company who\u2019d recently gotten a good deal on a very large commercial airliner in a V.I.P. configuration; he wanted Varsano to go in on a deal to gut-renovate the interior over the course of a year and then put it back on the market at a substantial markup. Varsano said the aircraft was likely to sell to a head of state, probably in Africa. Or, Varsano clarified, it would sell to the rich friend of a head of state, and then when they took the test run somehow the head of state would happen to be aboard for the ride. That was usually how it worked.At the end of a long day, he came and sat next to me on the trading floor. Almost all of his employees had gone home for the evening, and the room glowed its serene empyreal blue and white against the rush-hour traffic outside. \u201cPeople think that all of this is just for the rich guys, but it\u2019s really for corporate middle management to run their businesses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat accounts for 70 percent of all flights.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time he had mentioned the statistic in defense of plane ownership. It\u2019s the other 30 percent, though, that make his business possible.The only unkind thing I ever heard Varsano say about \u201cthe rich guys\u201d had to do with the propensity, especially marked among the younger buyers, to back out of a deal that 10 people had spent months putting together just because they decided at the very last minute that they liked the cut of some other plane\u2019s jib. It was clear, though, that like many professionals who rely for their livelihood on capricious billionaire patronage, he felt some ambivalent mixture of scorn and admiration in equal measure. When populists fail to seethe at a tax bill favorable to the owners of jets, it\u2019s not simply because they should like to think that when at last they own their own jets they\u2019ll enjoy the same privileges; it\u2019s also because each side wants to protect its own billionaires and the crumbs they provide. After all, the seven billion of us are increasingly living on the largess of the 7,000 of them. Varsano was constantly being put into situations where despite his near-unparalleled expertise in aviation he was treated as an elevated TaskRabbit, called in on contract to kick the tires and hang the Picasso. These were constant blows to his hard-won professional esteem.Still, he had great faith in the resources of the extremely wealthy. \u201cThere are 230,000\u201d \u2014 he said \u201cthousand\u201d with an astonished emphasis \u2014 \u201cpeople in the world with a net worth, excluding their primary residence, of $30 million or more. In the luxury industry you call them ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. When you ask the bank to finance an aircraft, their rule of thumb is that your net worth has to be at least five times greater than the price of the plane. That means even if you\u2019re at the bottom of that list, there are at least 230,000 people who might buy a $6 million airplane \u2014 though maybe they\u2019d stop at $4 million, because then you need a million bucks a year to fly it.\u201d No matter how hard his work or positive his outlook, Varsano knew he didn\u2019t stand a chance of paying the rent on his storefront selling $4 million planes. There\u2019s a strong downward pressure on commissions, which regardless of the purchase price of the aircraft usually top out at $1 million \u2014 a take of 1.4 percent on a $70 million plane. That world is just so vanishingly small, and there\u2019s so much information on the market, and the principals are so powerful, that somewhere there\u2019s invariably a small-time broker with a desk and a cellphone ready to elbow in for a fee that Varsano would consider an insult to his professional acumen. \u201cThere\u2019s always some guy out there willing to do a deal for $25,000,\u201d he complained.And yet Varsano persisted in the belief that his new showroom \u2014 and the increased regard that Trump had brought to private aviation \u2014 might put him closer to the means of his clients. We sat in his decision-making boardroom at twilight, watching the people and the cars hurry by. Every once in a while, a pedestrian stopped in astonishment to take a picture, or a car would all of a sudden slow and swerve into the bus lane so whoever was inside could gawk.\u201cI\u2019ll buy one some day,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cYou know, you work in a shoe shop, you should have nice shoes.\u201d He looked down at his own shoes, expensive but heavily scuffed with signs of extended wear.\u201cDo I need one?\u201d He glanced out the window and then once more considered his shoes. \u201cI should have one. I\u2019ll get one.\u201dVarsano was born into a generation that understood the airplane for its totemic significance as a technological miracle within mortal reach. The memories of his youth he holds dearest are those that involve getting a rickety aircraft the size of a minibus lost in storm clouds over the Bahamas, the compass slipping slowly, and even now that both airplanes and the economy have been so thoroughly transformed, there was nothing he didn\u2019t know about these machines, and almost nothing he didn\u2019t love. But the brief minute in which they passed through his hands between an oligarch and an executive was the closest he was likely to come to calling one his own, at least in the class he sold \u2014 the class that mattered. The sarcophagal fuselage in his window was not, in the end, just an unusually elaborate showpiece. It might only be a diorama, but it\u2019s the plane he can afford, a mock-up designed to his own last wish.Photographs for Jet Set: Gulfstream G650: Adrian Pingstone. Bombardier Global: Alamy.

{"Headline": "\u2018Fake News\u2019: Wide Reach but Little Impact, Study Suggests", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindFake news evolved from seedy internet sideshow to serious electoral threat so quickly that behavioral scientists had little time to answer basic questions about it, like who was reading what, how much real news they also consumed and whether targeted fact-checking efforts ever hit a target.Sure, surveys abound, asking people what they remember reading. But these are only as precise as the respondents\u2019 shifty recollections and subject to a malleable definition of \u201cfake.\u201d The term \u201cfake news\u201d itself has evolved into an all-purpose smear, used by politicians and the president to deride journalism they don\u2019t like.The reach of fake news was wide indeed, the study found, yet also shallow. One in four Americans saw at least one false story, but even the most eager fake-news readers \u2014 deeply conservative supporters of President Trump \u2014 consumed far more of the real kind, from newspaper and network websites and other digital sources.While the research can\u2019t settle the question of whether misinformation was pivotal in the 2016 election, the findings give the public and researchers the first solid guide to asking how its influence may have played out. That question will become increasingly important as online giants like Facebook and Google turn to shielding their users from influence by Russian operatives and other online malefactors.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the effect of fake news and a lot of numbers thrown around out of context, which get people exercised,\u201d said Duncan Watts, a research scientist at Microsoft who has argued that misinformation had a negligible effect on the election results. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about this paper is that it focuses on the actual consumers themselves.\u201dIn the new study, a trio of political scientists \u2014 Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College (a regular contributor to The Times\u2019s Upshot), Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter \u2014 analyzed web traffic data gathered from a representative sample of 2,525 Americans who consented to have their online activity monitored anonymously by the survey and analytic firm YouGov.The data included website visits made in the weeks before and after the 2016 election, and a measure of political partisanship based on overall browsing habits. (The vast majority of participants favored Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.)The online behavior of the participants was expected in some ways, but surprising in others. Consumption broke down along partisan lines: the most conservative 10 percent of the sample accounted for about 65 percent of visits to fake news sites.Pro-Trump users were about three times more likely to visit fake news sites supporting their candidate than Clinton partisans were to visit bogus sites promoting her.Still, false stories were a small fraction of the participants\u2019 overall news diet, regardless of political preference: just 1 percent among Clinton supporters, and 6 percent among those pulling for Mr. Trump. Even conservative partisans viewed just five fake news articles, on average, over more than five weeks.There was no way to determine from the data how much, or whether, people believed what they saw on these sites. But many of these were patently absurd, like one accusing Mrs. Clinton of a \u201cSudden Move of $1.8 Billion to Qatar Central Bank,\u201d or a piece headlined \u201cVideo Showing Bill Clinton With a 13-Year-Old Plunges Race Into Chaos.\u201d\u201cFor all the hype about fake news, it\u2019s important to recognize that it reached only a subset of Americans, and most of the ones it was reaching already were intense partisans,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said.\u201cThey were also voracious consumers of hard news,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are people intensely engaged in politics who follow it closely.\u201dGiven the ratio of truth to fiction, Dr. Watts said, fake news paled in influence beside mainstream news coverage, particularly stories about Mrs. Clinton and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Coverage of that topic appeared repeatedly and prominently in venues like The New York Times and the Washington Post.The new study does not rule out the possibility that fake news affected the elections, said David Rand, an associate professor of psychology, economics and management at Yale University.Americans over age 60 were much more likely to visit a fake news site than younger people, the new study found. Perhaps confusingly, moderately left-leaning people viewed more pro-Trump fake news than they did pro-Clinton fake news.One interpretation of that finding, Dr. Rand said, may be that older, less educated voters who switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 were particularly susceptible to fake news.\u201cYou can see where this might have had an impact in some of those close swing states, like Wisconsin,\u201d Dr. Rand said. \u201cBut this of course is a matter of conjecture, reasoning backward from the findings.\u201dThe study found that Facebook was by far the platform through which people most often navigated to a fake news site. Last year, in response to criticism, the company began flagging stories on its site that third-party fact-checkers found to make false claims with a red label saying \u201cdisputed.\u201dMost people in the new study encountered at least some of these labels, but \u201cwe saw no instances of people reading a fake news article and a fact-check of that specific article,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said. \u201cThe fact-checking websites have a targeting problem.\u201dIn December, Facebook announced a change to its monitoring approach. Instead of labeling false stories, Facebook will surface the fact-checks along with the fake story in the user\u2019s news feed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM May Finally Stop Shrinking. But Is It a Turnaround?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five and a half years, nearly the entire tenure of its chief executive, Virginia M. Rometty, IBM has reported a steady erosion of revenue.Selling off its chip manufacturing and smaller data-center computer businesses contributed to the decline. So, too, did the fact that new businesses like cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence had not yet grown big enough to make up for the downturn in IBM\u2019s traditional hardware and software products.But IBM\u2019s half-decade losing streak will most likely end on Thursday, analysts predict, when the company reports its quarterly performance.The crossover to growth would be a long-awaited bright spot for Ms. Rometty and IBM, a challenged giant that has been overshadowed in recent years by the younger technology giants on the West Coast.Even if IBM delivers a revenue gain, however, the bigger question facing the company remains: Has Ms. Rometty turned it around?Skeptics abound. IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company\u2019s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cIs a turnaround afoot? I don\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company\u2019s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers.The new businesses \u2014 \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d IBM calls them \u2014 now account for 45 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations \u2014 and gained converts.The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM\u2019s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM\u2019s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year.IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward.Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google.The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis \u2014 all delivered via the cloud and available \u00e0 la carte.IBM\u2019s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter.\u201cWe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.\u201dCompanies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure.AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant\u2019s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM \u2014 a longtime technology supplier to AT&T \u2014 was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T\u2019s president of business operations.The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.\u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201dThat was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.\u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201dThe start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Many others aren\u2019t.The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling.

What do I need to do?As on the stock market, losses can be used to offset capital gains, subject to certain rules, and losses that are not used to offset gains can be deducted \u2014 up to $3,000 \u2014 from other kinds of income. Unused losses can be carried over to future years.I bought a computer (or another product or service) using Bitcoin. Are there tax implications?The short answer: Yes.Likewise, if you suffer a loss, that should also be reported on your tax return.I\u2019ve successfully \u2018mined\u2019 Bitcoins. Now what?I was paid in Bitcoin. Are there any special tax consequences?Receiving wages from an employer in a virtual currency is like being paid in dollars: It is taxable to the employee, must be reported by the employer on a Form W-2 and is subject to federal income tax withholding, according to Wolters Kluwer.Independent contractors paid in digital currency must also treat that as gross income and pay self-employment taxes.What if I paid someone else in Bitcoin for their services?Can I reduce my tax bill by donating my cryptocoins?Will I receive any tax forms from my exchange? Do I have to track my own transactions?Generally speaking, brokers and exchanges are not yet required to report cryptocurrency transactions to the I.R.S., as they do when you sell a stock at a profit or loss (and you receive a 1099-B or a 1099-DIV for a mutual fund).Does the new tax bill change any of this?The I.R.S. didn\u2019t say this strategy could be used with virtual currencies, but some tax experts argued that it was a reasonable \u2014 albeit debatable \u2014 interpretation since the coins were considered property. Now that the tax legislation limits the use of 1031 exchanges to real estate, they no longer apply, accountants said.So \u2026 should I finally buy Bitcoin?Whatever you decide, never gamble more than what you can afford to lose \u2014 and you\u2019ll need to report it.Advertisement"}

Few of those companies have made it out onto the stock market successfully.And Wall Street investors must also be convinced that Dropbox can continue to attract customers, even as tech giants like Google and Microsoft have freely offered their own online data storage services.Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures, said a Dropbox I.P.O. would be seen as a harbinger for start-ups. \u201cWill unicorns realize they have to grow up and grow out of their Peter Pan mentality?\u201d he asked, adding that a public offering for Dropbox would also help set the scene for whether other unicorns \u201creignite and grow, or do they fade away?\u201dDropbox filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission, affording the company time to make its preparations away from the glare of potential investors. It has hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to help underwrite the initial offering, said the people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Dropbox plans to hire more banks as advisers, they said.The company is aiming to begin trading on a stock market in the spring, one of these people added, cautioning that the timing of an I.P.O. is fluid and may change. The timing will partly depend on the receptiveness of investors who may have been burned by market debuts that later soured.Over all, 2017 proved to be relatively robust for initial offerings, with 160 companies raising $35.6 billion in the United States, up significantly from 2016, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm. But bankers and analysts said many of the biggest potential market debutantes would likely sit on the sidelines for another year, having already raised enormous sums in the private markets.Founded over a decade ago by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dropbox was one of the first companies to popularize file storage via the web.\u201cWhat Drew and the team have accomplished is something that we are proud of in the tech community and should be proud of as a country,\u201d said Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, which has not invested in Dropbox.Since then, Mr. Houston and his management team have focused on containing costs while building out features like collaboration services and shared document creation.One big question that hangs over a potential I.P.O. is what sort of valuation Dropbox would command as a public company. Its closest point of comparison is Box, another Silicon Valley online data storage provider, but one that focuses more on big corporate clients like General Electric and Procter & Gamble. (Dropbox has taken aim at smaller companies, but has argued in the past that it spends less to acquire new customers.)Dropbox is likely to argue that its bigger user base and greater reliance on word of mouth to gain consumers should mean that it is valued higher than Box.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated which companies may file plans for public offerings confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any company can make such a filing, not just companies that generate less than $1 billion a year in revenue.Nellie Bowles contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa, We\u2019re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors.The challenge isn\u2019t finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom.A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions.Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 \u201cskills\u201d \u2014 third-party apps that tap into Alexa\u2019s voice controls to accomplish tasks \u2014 it makes available.But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, \u201cpeople are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that there is something that\u2019s going to drive people to use these.\u201dThere is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon.Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services \u2014 like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals.With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes.Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant.For now, consumers\u2019 satisfaction with their smart speakers \u2014 and by extension, the onboard assistants \u2014 is helped in part by the fact they didn\u2019t pay a lot to get them into their homes.Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he\u2019s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that.\u201cThere\u2019s only certain things I use it for, but I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my taxes with it.\u201dPaul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances.\u201cThe more interesting functionality is yet to come,\u201d Mr. Erickson said. \u201cPart of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we\u2019re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.\u201dCompetitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software.Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories \u2014 although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language.Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 \u2014 or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units.There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren\u2019t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad\u2019s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money.

For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete.

But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}

Uncle Sam will get a one-time $38 billion tax payment. The company promises to add 20,000 jobs to its U.S. work force, a 24 percent increase, and build a new campus. Another $5 billion will go toward a fund for advanced manufacturing in America.C\u2019mon. What\u2019s with the long face?But it was not the moral and fiscal apocalypse its critics claimed. And its central achievement \u2014 a dramatic cut in corporate rates to 21 percent from 35 percent \u2014 was an economic no-brainer that many Democrats, including President Obama, had supported (albeit less steeply) just a few years ago.Assume that just half of that money comes home to the United States. It\u2019s still the equivalent of Canada\u2019s entire gross domestic product. Not too shabby, especially considering all the hyperbolic predictions of economic doom that went with Trump\u2019s election.It\u2019s worth thinking carefully about why Trump\u2019s critics have been so wrong about the economy, and of the damage their hubris does to the anti-Trump case.More recently, Democrats have convinced themselves that Trump is merely the beneficiary of Obama\u2019s economic legacy. But how can the critics who previously assured us that Trump\u2019s election would cause certain calamity now explain that he\u2019s nothing but a lucky bystander to forces beyond his control? Had the economy tumbled over the past year his critics would surely have blamed him. It\u2019s ill grace to deny him all credit when it\u2019s doing so well.Also true is that Americans will generally give credit for a good economy to whichever president presides over it. Yet one gets a distinct sense that Trump\u2019s relentless critics would rather bury the Apple news or look for the cloud within the silver lining. This is not a good look. If making confident but lousy predictions is one form of political malpractice, wanting things to fail is another.The same goes for the looming government shutdown, which may have begun by the time you read this column. Democrats are placing a large bet that it\u2019s a political showdown they can win. But what they are mainly doing is wrecking their chances of retaking the House or Senate by appearing to put the interests of DACA\u2019s immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d ahead of the rest of America.How that helps Dreamers, Democrats, Americans or anyone other than the president and maybe California Senator Kamala Harris is anyone\u2019s guess.Donald Trump is a profoundly defective person who nearly every morning does grave political self-harm with no assistance from his opponents. But he is also president, and normal Americans \u2014 that is, those who hold the outcome of the next election in their hands \u2014 do not want him to fail. They want statesmanship, not schadenfreude.Wouldn\u2019t it be smart of all of Trump\u2019s opponents to show they are superior to him in the former? And wouldn\u2019t a good way of doing that be to abjure the latter, even if it sometimes means giving him some credit?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While You Were Sleeping", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump poses a huge dilemma for commentators: to ignore his daily outrages is to normalize his behavior, but to constantly write about them is to stop learning. Like others, I struggle to get this balance right, which is why I pause today to point out some incredible technological changes happening while Trump has kept us focused on him \u2014 changes that will pose as big an adaptation challenge to American workers as transitioning from farms to factories once did.Two and half years ago I was researching a book that included a section on IBM\u2019s cognitive computer, \u201cWatson,\u201d which had perfected the use of artificial intelligence enough to defeat the two all-time \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champions. After my IBM hosts had shown me Watson at its Yorktown Heights, N.Y., lab, they took me through a room where a small group of IBM scientists were experimenting with something futuristic called \u201cquantum computing.\u201d They left me thinking this was Star Wars stuff \u2014 a galaxy and many years far away.Last week I visited the same lab, where my hosts showed me the world\u2019s first quantum computer that can handle 50 quantum bits, or qubits, which it unveiled in November. They still may need a decade to make this computer powerful enough and reliable enough for groundbreaking industrial applications, but clearly quantum computing has gone from science fiction to nonfiction faster than most anyone expected.Who cares? Well, if you think it\u2019s scary what we can now do with artificial intelligence produced by classical binary digital electronic computers built with transistors \u2014 like make cars that can drive themselves and software that can write news stories or produce humanlike speech \u2014 remember this: These \u201cold\u201d computers still don\u2019t have enough memory or processing power to solve what IBM calls \u201chistorically intractable problems.\u201d Quantum computers, paired with classical computers via the cloud, have the potential to do that in minutes or seconds.For instance, \u201cwhile today\u2019s supercomputers can simulate \u2026 simple molecules,\u201d notes MIT Technology Review, \u201cthey quickly become overwhelmed.\u201d So chemical modelers \u2014 who attempt to come up with new compounds for things like better batteries and lifesaving drugs \u2014 \u201care forced to approximate how an unknown molecule might behave, then test it in the real world to see if it works as expected. The promise of quantum computing is to vastly simplify that process by exactly predicting the structure of a new molecule, and how it will interact with other compounds.\u201dQuantum computers process information, using the capabilities of quantum physics, differently from traditional computers. \u201cWhereas normal computers store information as either a 1 or a 0, quantum computers exploit two phenomena \u2014 entanglement and superposition \u2014 to process information,\u201d explains MIT Technology Review. The result is computers that may one day \u201coperate 100,000 times faster than they do today,\u201d adds Wired magazine.Classical computers don\u2019t solve \u201cbig versions of this problem very well at all,\u201d she said, like trying to crack sophisticated encrypted codes, where you need to try a massive number of variables, or modeling molecules where you need to account for an exponential number of interactions. Quantum computers, with their exponential processing power, will be able to crack most encryption without breaking a sweat.It\u2019s just another reason China, the N.S.A., IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Google are now all racing \u2014 full of sweat \u2014 to build usable quantum systems.\u201cIf I try to map a caffeine molecule problem on a normal computer, that computer would have to be one-tenth the volume of this planet in size,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, head of research at IBM. \u201cA quantum computer just three or four times the size of those we\u2019ve built today should be able to solve that problem.\u201dBut, again, look at where we are today thanks to artificial intelligence from digital computers \u2014 and the amount of middle-skill and even high-skill work they\u2019re supplanting \u2014 and then factor in how all of this could be supercharged in a decade by quantum computing.This will be a challenge for developed countries, but even more so for countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, China and India \u2014 where huge numbers of youths are already unemployed because they lack the education for even this middle-skill work THAT\u2019S now being automated.It\u2019s why IBM\u2019s C.E.O., Ginni Rometty, remarked to me in an interview: \u201cEvery job will require some technology, and therefore we\u2019ll need to revamp education. The K-12 curriculum is obvious, but it\u2019s the adult retraining \u2014 lifelong learning systems \u2014 that will be even more important.\u201dArtificial intelligence \u201cis the opportunity of our time, and skills are the issue of our time. Some jobs will be displaced, but 100 percent of jobs will be augmented by A.I.,\u201d added Rometty. Technology companies \u201care inventing these technologies, so we have the responsibility to help people adapt to it \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just giving them tablets or P.C.s, but lifelong learning systems.\u201dTo back that up, said Rometty, IBM designed Pathways in Technology (P-Tech) schools, partnering with close to 100 public high schools and community colleges to create a six-year program that serves large numbers of low-income students. P-Tech schools offer calculus and physics alongside workplace skills \u2014 problem solving, writing and job interviewing. These skills are reinforced through mentorships and internships with IBM and more than 300 other companies. Kids graduate in six years or less with both a high school diploma and an associate junior college degree.\u201cThe graduation rates are four times the average, and those getting jobs are at two times the median salary,\u201d said Rometty, \u201cand many are going on to four-year colleges.\u201dEach time work gets outsourced or tasks get handed off to a machine, \u201cwe must reach up and learn a new skill or in some ways expand our capabilities as humans in order to fully realize our collaborative potential,\u201d McGowan said.Therefore, education needs to shift \u201cfrom education as a content transfer to learning as a continuous process where the focused outcome is the ability to learn and adapt with agency as opposed to the transactional action of acquiring a set skill,\u201d said McGowan. \u201cInstructors/teachers move from guiding and accessing that transfer process to providing social and emotional support to the individual as they move into the role of driving their own continuous learning.\u201dAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to distract from the \u201cTrump Reality Show,\u201d but I just thought I\u2019d mention that Star Wars technology is coming not only to a theater near you, but to a job near you. We need to be discussing and adapting to its implications as much as we do Trump\u2019s tweets.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital.\u2022 JPMorgan has (and hasn\u2019t) clarified its succession plans.\u2022 What should we expect in tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech?Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees.But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.1) What is it?The venture will be an independent company that \u201cis free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won\u2019t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm.

{"Headline": "Big Bets on A.I. Open a New Frontier for Chip Start-Ups, Too", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, tech industry financiers showed little interest in start-up companies that made computer chips.How on earth could a start-up compete with a goliath like Intel, which made the chips that ran more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers? Even in the areas where Intel didn\u2019t dominate, like smartphones and gaming devices, there were companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that could squash an upstart.But then came the tech industry\u2019s latest big thing \u2014 artificial intelligence. A.I., it turned out, works better with new kinds of computer chips. Suddenly, venture capitalists forgot all those forbidding roadblocks to success for a young chip company.Today, at least 45 start-ups are working on chips that can power tasks like speech and self-driving cars, and at least five of them have raised more than $100 million from investors. Venture capitalists invested more than $1.5 billion in chip start-ups last year, nearly doubling the investments made two years ago, according to the research firm CB Insights.The explosion is akin to the sudden proliferation of PC and hard-drive makers in the 1980s. While these are small companies, and not all will survive, they have the power to fuel a period of rapid technological change.It is doubtful that any of the companies fantasize about challenging Intel head-on with their own chip factories, which can take billions of dollars to build. (The start-ups contract with other companies to make their chips.) But in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things, these start-ups are racing toward one of two goals: Find a profitable niche or get acquired. Fast.\u201cMachine learning and A.I. has reopened questions around how to build computers,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the global infrastructure at Google for several years and is now a partner at Sequoia, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Sequoia has invested in Graphcore, a British start-up that recently joined the $100 million club.After that, a second Silicon Valley start-up, Cerebras, grabbed five Nervana engineers as it, too, designed a chip just for A.I.By early 2018, according to a report by Forbes, Cerebras had raised more than $100 million in funding. So had four other firms: Graphcore; another Silicon Valley outfit, Wave Computing; and two Beijing companies, Horizon Robotics and Cambricon, which is backed by the Chinese government.Raising money in 2015 and early 2016 was a nightmare, said Mike Henry, chief executive at the A.I. chip start-up Mythic. But \u201cwith the big, aquisition-hungry tech companies all barreling toward semiconductors,\u201d that has changed, he said.China has shown a particular interest in developing new A.I. chips. A third Beijing chip start-up, DeePhi, has raised $40 million, and the country\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has explicitly called for the production of Chinese chips that challenge Nvidia\u2019s.Because it\u2019s a new market \u2014 and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power \u2014 many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start-ups have a chance against entrenched giants.The first big change will most likely come in the data center, where companies like Graphcore and Cerebras, which has been quiet about its plans, hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of A.I. Among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality.Researchers at places like Microsoft and Google, which has built its own chip just for A.I., \u201ctrain\u201d neural networks by extreme trial and error, testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end. They often sit at their laptops, staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data. Chip designers want to streamline this process, packing all that trial and error into a few minutes.Today, Nvidia\u2019s G.P.U.s can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks, but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient, said Scott Gray, who was an engineer at Nervana before joining OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.So in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks, start-ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them.Graphcore, for example, is building chips that include more built-in memory so that they don\u2019t need to send as much data back and forth. Others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster.\u201cThis is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system,\u201d Mr. Coughran, of Sequoia, said.But this is only part of the change. Once neural networks are trained for a task, additional gear has to execute that task. At Toyota, autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as a way of identifying pedestrians, signs and other objects on the road. After training a neural network in the data center, the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car.A number of chip makers \u2014 including start-ups like Mythic, DeePhi and Horizon Robotics \u2014 are tackling this problem as well, pushing A.I. chips into devices ranging from phones to cars.It is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work. Designing and building a chip takes about 24 months, which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won\u2019t arrive until this year. And the chip start-ups will face competition from Nvidia, Intel, Google and other industry giants.But everyone is starting from about the same place: the beginning of a new market.Advertisement"}

Mr. Steinberg\u2019s theme is most definitely family friendly, and very clever to boot.Much to the relief of my copy editors, it turns out that Mr. Steinberg\u2019s theme has nothing to do with cursing, despite the FOUR LETTER WORDS revealer that he has stretched across the center of his grid.This is the kind of early week theme I really enjoy, because even though the solve is relatively easy, that \u201cAha!\u201d moment is still there. How long did it take you to catch on to the fact that the words Mr. Steinberg included in his theme set were made up of only four letters?As an example, at 18A, \u201cIts root was once used in root beer\u201d is SASSAFRAS, which contains only the letters S, A, F and R.Got that? Now you find the rest of them. If you are on the sensitive side, trying covering your ears while you solve.11A: We\u2019ve seen this before, right? Are the newer solvers out there starting to get used to seeing subtle wordplay like this? \u201cCab alternative\u201d could be any kind of public transportation, but it\u2019s not in this puzzle: \u201cCab\u201d is short for \u201cCabernet,\u201d and the shortened alternative to that is ZIN, for Zinfandel.17A: I\u2019m a fan of Korean food, so in my book, kimchi is fairly ubiquitous, but you can find it in KTOWN, which is short for \u201cKoreatown\u201d neighborhoods.3D: I had LOGO instead of ICON for \u201cBlue \u2018W\u2019 for Microsoft Word, e.g.\u201d until I successfully entered ROCHE for the clue at 14A, \u201cPharmaceutical giant that makes Valium.\u201d Make of that what you will.47D: At first, I didn\u2019t think I knew the answer to \u201cVideo game inspired by pentominoes,\u201d but think about it: five-sided dominoes?

Er, I mean \u201cfour letter words.\u201d But seriously, how many times do you get to start a piece of writing with cuss words? My favorite of the theme entries I discovered was SENSELESSNESS, but as you can imagine, there aren\u2019t exactly a ton of 14-letter words that use just four letters. So that one ended up on the chopping block.Next came the challenge of building the grid. I\u2019d normally stop at four theme entries plus the 15-letter reveal, but I decided to go big and use six. I must say I\u2019m pleased with how the fill turned out. Not a lot of room for bonus material, but with OTTO I and OMOO as the only fill on my \u201cthis entry is %$^*\u201d list, I\u2019d say the extra theme entries were worth the price. I also tried to capitalize on the little flexibility I had by sticking in some fresh short entries (K-TOWN, ZUMBA, BAD PR, SLEAZE).Hope you enjoy!Thanks for not getting me fired, Mr. Steinberg.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Brace for Europe\u2019s New Data Privacy Rules", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs.Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information.And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center \u2014 a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served.With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley\u2019s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.\u201cEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,\u201d said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. \u201cG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.\u201dEuropean officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.\u201cThere has not been any pushback from American companies,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cIf anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.\u201dOfficials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google\u2019s director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. \u201cWhen G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation\u2019s mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services \u2014 from Gmail to its Cloud storage services \u2014 to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone\u2019s data.\u201cFor a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,\u201d Mr. Golan said.Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.The new privacy center would give Facebook a \u201cvery good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules.\u201cWe embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,\u201d Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. \u201cWe began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company.\u201dHow the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online.\u201cWhere the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see real changes across the board.\u201dMs. Jourov\u00e1 said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens.\u201cThere will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Indianapolis Cool Enough for Amazon? It Just Might Be", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAmong Amazon\u2019s 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three.And then there\u2019s Indianapolis.In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon\u2019s initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn\u2019t find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist.The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls \u201ctech talent.\u201d Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities.And then there\u2019s what might be called the \u201ccool\u201d factor \u2014 which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking.Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com\u2019s Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201dBut if Mr. Stutz\u2019s experience is any indication, the oddsmakers may have to recalculate Indianapolis\u2019s chances. Since moving to the city 16 months ago, Mr. Stutz said, he has been \u201camazed.\u201d\u201cIndianapolis has done what may be the best urban redevelopment I\u2019ve seen in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here is aligned with making Indianapolis a successful place for technology companies. The people are tremendous, very friendly, polite, with a strong work ethic.\u201dWith over 1,700 Salesforce employees there, Indianapolis is now home to the company\u2019s second-largest office outside its San Francisco headquarters. In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that \u201cwe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Mr. Stutz said.Salesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. \u201cThis is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,\u201d he said.One area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon\u2019s top priorities, according to its proposal: \u201cA stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure.\u201dIndianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state.Both officials \u201cwere very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,\u201d said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis\u2019s Amazon proposal. \u201cThat made it so much easier for us.\u201dNeither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon.In opening the competition, Amazon also said that \u201ca strong university system is required.\u201d Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it\u2019s the geographic center of \u201ca surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,\u201d said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater).These include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation\u2019s No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years.Many university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, \u201cattracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,\u201d Dr. McCoy said. \u201cOver 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay.\u201dWith a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo.It\u2019s probably best known as a sports mecca, with the N.B.A. Pacers, W.N.B.A. Fever and N.F.L. Colts. It\u2019s the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it\u2019s home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race.Mr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. \u201cAustin was never a cool place,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn\u2019t quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities.\u201dThe airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris.Indianapolis\u2019s central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there.While Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon\u2019s Seattle employees value).For all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge.Unlike Amazon\u2019s home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana\u2019s governor before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s vice president.A strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation.Mr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said.Indianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn\u2019t count it out.Maureen Krauss, the chamber\u2019s chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis\u2019s proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight.\u201cWe finished it two days early,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that\u2019s the kind of proposal we tried to deliver.\u201dShe and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. \u201cWe hunkered down and started on Phase 2,\u201d Mr. Huber said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Sells A.I. for Building A.I. (Novices Welcome)", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has been using artificial intelligence to build other artificially intelligent systems for the last several months.Now the company plans to sell this kind of \u201cautomated machine learning\u201d technology to other businesses across the globe. On Wednesday, Google introduced a cloud-computing service that it bills as a way to build a so-called computer vision system that suits your particular needs \u2014 even if you have little or no experience with the concepts that drive it.If you are a radiologist, for example, you can use CT scans to automatically train a computer algorithm that identifies signs of lung cancer. If you run a real estate website, you can build an algorithm that distinguishes between living rooms and kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.At least that is the pitch. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a Ph.D. in machine learning,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing group. \u201cBut you can still build a highly accurate machine learning model.\u201dGoogle uses the technique while building systems that can recognize faces, products, landmarks and other objects in photos. In some cases, these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers.The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms.At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston\u2019s DataRobot and Silicon Valley\u2019s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future.\u201cThey aim to automate data science in general,\u201d said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore.The question is whether these new services will work as advertised and how rapidly they will evolve in the years to come.Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others already offer cloud-computing services that let businesses add existing machine learning algorithms to their own products. A company can take a Microsoft computer vision algorithm, for example, and slip it into a new smartphone app.But with its new service, Google goes a step further, providing an automated way for businesses to build new algorithms. Businesses can upload their own images, provide a list of objects pictured in these images and train their own computer vision systems, tackling tasks that aren\u2019t necessarily handled by existing technology, according to Google.Initially, Google will open this service only to a small group of businesses. A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price.Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google\u2019s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I.\u201cIt is really powerful technology,\u201d said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies.But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. \u201cThese services are only as good as their parts,\u201d said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. \u201cAnd humans still supply some of the parts.\u201dGoogle says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement. In a matter of minutes, it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer\u2019s images. Given more time, it can build a model from scratch, specifically for the problem at hand.If you are a zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist inside the Google cloud group, all you have to do is supply the right images. \u201cYou upload jaguars and giraffes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you are done.\u201dAll that remains is determining how well it works.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Individual Mandate Now Gone, G.O.P. Targets the One for Employers", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Having wiped out the requirement for people to have health insurance, Republicans in Congress are taking aim at a new target: the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that employers offer coverage to employees.And many employers are cheering the effort.While large companies have long offered health benefits, many have chafed at the detailed requirements under the health law, including its reporting rules, which they see as onerous and expensive. Now that relief has been extended to individuals, some companies believe they should be next in line.The individual mandate and the employer mandate are \u201cinextricably entwined,\u201d said James A. Klein, the president of the American Benefits Council, an influential lobby for large companies like Dow Chemical, Microsoft and BP, the oil and gas producer.\u201cIt is inequitable to leave the employer mandate in place when its purpose \u2014 to support the individual mandate \u2014 no longer exists,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cWe are urging Congress to repeal the employer mandate.\u201dOpposition to the employer mandate could increase as more employers are fined for not offering coverage or for not meeting federal standards for adequate, affordable coverage. Since October, the Internal Revenue Service has notified thousands of businesses that they owe money because they failed to offer coverage in 2015, when the mandate took effect.Representatives Devin Nunes of California and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, both Republicans, recently introduced a bill, supported by party leaders, to suspend the mandate, canceling any penalties that would be imposed for any year from 2015 to 2018.\u201cThe employer mandate is a job-killer, a wage-killer and a business-killer,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.But Tom Leibfried, a health care lobbyist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called the proposals to repeal or weaken the employer mandate \u201ca very bad idea.\u201d\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was built on a framework of shared responsibility,\u201d Mr. Leibfried said. \u201cIf you get rid of the employer mandate, you will see people lose coverage from their employers.\u201dSuch a move could also increase costs for the federal government. Even though Congress has eliminated the penalties for people who go without insurance, millions of consumers are still eligible for financial aid in the form of tax credits to help them pay insurance premiums. These subsidies increase with the rapidly rising cost of insurance. If fewer people receive coverage from employers, more will qualify for subsidized coverage in the public marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThe employer mandate holds down the cost of premium tax credits for the federal government,\u201d said Catherine E. Livingston, a tax lawyer at the law firm Jones Day who was the health care counsel at the I.R.S. from 2010 to 2013. \u201cAny employee who receives an offer of affordable coverage from an employer is not eligible for the tax credit. And the employer mandate provides a strong incentive for employers to offer affordable coverage.\u201dBut it has also limited companies\u2019 options in providing health benefits, they say.\u201cMost large employers like Hallmark provide employer coverage today,\u201d said Tresia Franklin, the company\u2019s director of employee relations. \u201cEmployers want flexibility to offer the health benefits that make the most sense for their employees.\u201dEmployers with 50 or more full-time employees must provide information to the I.R.S. on what insurance, if any, they offer to each of their employees. They may also be required to report the value of coverage.The I.R.S. has used such information to help enforce other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate.In addition, larger employers may be subject to tax penalties if they do not offer \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d to employees who work at least 30 hours a week, on average. The penalty is $2,260 a year multiplied by the number of full-time employees in excess of 30.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that employers will pay $12 billion in penalties this year and a total of more than $200 billion in the coming decade.Alden J. Bianchi, an employee benefits lawyer in Boston, said he had two or three dozen letters on his desk from the I.R.S. demanding payment of penalties by employers who had supposedly failed to offer coverage to employees.In some cases, he said, the government is seeking \u201csubstantial penalties in the millions of dollars.\u201dThe House passed legislation last year to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, including the penalty used to enforce the employer mandate.The mandate \u201cinterferes with market-driven compensation arrangements, encourages employers to cut hours and employees, and stifles new job creation,\u201d said a report on the bill by Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee.Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act say it has not harmed employment, hours of work or wages. And they note that millions of jobs have been created since the law was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.Members of both parties are trying to get rid of another part of the Affordable Care Act, which imposes a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage \u2014 the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d opposed by labor unions and employers.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said it was possible that lawmakers could delay the tax as part of a bipartisan deal on government spending that they are trying to negotiate.\u201cEven Democrats who put that awful tax in place believe it needs to be delayed,\u201d Mr. Brady said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World\u2019s Computers", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201cWhat actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,\u201d said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability \u201chas existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.\u201d It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of A.W.S. and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers \u2014 and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers\u2019 data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability \u2014 at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel\u2019s business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.\u201cIntel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIntel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.\u201dThe researchers who discovered the flaws notified various affected companies. And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.For now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel\u2019s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is \u201cgoing to live with us for decades,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.\u201cWhereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve really screwed up,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThere\u2019s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.\u201dThe Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.The researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.The second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.\u201cThis will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It\u2019s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.\u201dFollow Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @nicoleperlothAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Sales Lifted by Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has spent years adjusting its business to reflect a shift from traditional software sales to cloud computing services delivered over the internet.It is a bet that continues to pay off for the company \u2014 as was evident in its quarterly earnings released Wednesday.The portion of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business that involves selling to companies \u2014 called commercial cloud \u2014 grew 56 percent, to $5.3 billion, in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31. Like many legacy software companies that cater to the huge corporate computing market, Microsoft was caught off guard by the emergence of cloud computing in the form of online storage and computing services offered by the internet retailer Amazon.Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue last quarter rose to $28.92 billion, up 12 percent from the same period a year earlier, as everything from its Office applications business and Xbox gaming console \u2014 both buoyed by cloud computing services \u2014 showed growth.The company reported a net loss, including the tax charge, of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, down from net income of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Without the tax charge though, Microsoft said it earned 96 cents a share.Microsoft\u2019s shares dropped about 1 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results, though both revenue and the adjusted earnings figure were significantly better than Wall Street forecasts.One of the company\u2019s oldest businesses, Office, saw its commercial revenue grow 10 percent in the quarter. Even the number of consumers who subscribe to a cloud version of the application suite, called Office 365, rose to 29.2 million from 24.9 million during the same period a year earlier.The company\u2019s gaming revenue jumped 8 percent, primarily as a result of hardware sales resulting from the introduction of a new console, Xbox One X.Microsoft and other big tech companies like Intel and Apple have been struggling over the past several months to mitigate a critical security flaw \u2014 known as \u201cSpectre\u201d \u2014 which exists at the chip level and has no simple patch.Microsoft has attempted to mitigate the flaw without dinging performance, but security experts like Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered the flaw last year, say Microsoft\u2019s solutions still do not sufficiently address all the ways it could be used by an attacker.In a phone interview, Microsoft chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said Microsoft has not yet seen a financial impact from the recent critical security flaws.Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}

But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age.

My mission was to create television for other women, for other female storytellers that are actresses, other directors and other writers. I think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds.\u201dSince then, Ms. Witherspoon has transformed herself from an actress increasingly frustrated with the roles she was being offered into a producer with a slate of projects that puts her in the company of series creators like Dick Wolf, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.Apple\u2019s top TV executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, said in a statement that Ms. Witherspoon had \u201can extraordinary knack for being a step ahead of the zeitgeist.\u201dThe rise of Hello Sunshine \u2014 with projects centered on strong, complicated women \u2014 syncs up perfectly with the #timesup movement, which counts Ms. Witherspoon as a major player, and gives evidence that the risk-averse Hollywood establishment may have learned something from the blockbuster success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d last year.\u201cPeople are desperate for this kind of storytelling about the female heroes that have always been in the shadows and now are coming into the light,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Ms. Witherspoon, 41, does not have the track record of super producers like Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, who have created hit shows for more than a decade, but she has already put a lot of distance between herself and the pack of actors who run production boutiques as a hobby.Ms. Rhimes, the hitmaker behind \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d who recently signed an deal with Netflix, called Ms. Witherspoon a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d producer.\u201cReese has been very smart about what she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cShe has leveraged her power in a very smart way to get big projects done. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201dCasey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO, said he was impressed by her willingness to get into the minutiae.\u201cReese is a movie star, she has a movie star\u2019s presence, she\u2019s a great actress \u2014 that all goes without saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat surprises people is I can call Reese on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 and have those conversations, saying, \u2018How do we get this deal closed?\u2019 \u2014 and she\u2019ll go off and get it closed.\u201dOne of her recent producing coups was to add Meryl Streep to the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d cast. Along with her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star (and fellow executive producer) Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon lobbied Ms. Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, to come aboard. She said yes in an email to Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman on the day \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was nominated for six Golden Globes. (The show went on to win four.)\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I got that email,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cI called Nicole, and I just started to cry.\u201dThat catharsis was a long time in coming, said Ms. Witherspoon, who had seen a number of her projects wilt. She grew weary of hearing that the industry had reached its quota of female-driven movies for the year. At the same time, she was starring in mostly forgettable movies \u2014 \u201cHow Do You Know\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Knot\u201d \u2014 and her box-office stock was dropping.She took control of her career by making a deeper commitment to producing. An avid reader who often posts photos of her favorites on Instagram, she started optioning book after book, partly motivated by a conversation she had with her husband, Jim Toth, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.\u201cI talked to my husband around that time, when the movies weren\u2019t working for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Are these movies you want to be making?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting for the scripts to come in.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who sits around and waits for the phone to ring. You read more books than anybody I know, so why don\u2019t you start making them into your own material?\u2019\u201cAnd I thought about my mom, who said, \u2018If you want something done, do it yourself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Witherspoon continued. \u201cYou can sit there and complain about it, or you can do something about it. Instead of having people make calls for me, I called every studio head myself: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Reese!\u2019 I\u2019ve known everybody for 27 years. They knew me when I was 14 years old, all of them. I\u2019ve made movies at pretty much every studio. It\u2019s still the same 200 people who are working in our business.\u201dMs. Witherspoon\u2019s previous production company, Pacific Standard, had hits with the 2014 movies \u201cWild\u201d (based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed and starring Ms. Witherspoon) and \u201cGone Girl.\u201d It came to an end in 2016 when Ms. Witherspoon split from her longtime producing partner, Bruna Papandrea.Ms. Witherspoon sought outside investment when she was ready to start Hello Sunshine, striking a deal with Otter Media, a company owned by the Chernin Group and AT&T, which bought a 30 percent stake in her new production house.In addition to the three Apple projects and \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Hello Sunshine has two potential series in the running at ABC and NBC. Several film projects are also in the works. Among them, Fox 2000 has picked up \u201cSomething in the Water,\u201d based on a thriller by Catherine Steadman about newlyweds whose Bora Bora honeymoon goes awry, and Sony\u2019s TriStar Pictures has given the green light to \u201cA White Lie,\u201d based on a 2016 novel \u201cThe Gilded Years,\u201d by Karin Tanabe, about the first black woman to attend Vassar College, in the 1890s.Hello Sunshine, which recently named Sarah Harden, formerly of Otter Media, as its chief executive, also has plans to create short bursts of digital-friendly content. At the moment, though, Ms. Witherspoon is making her name in the producer ranks because of her work in the hypercompetitive streaming market.Her planned Apple series with Ms. Aniston \u2014 the \u201cFriends\u201d star\u2019s return to a lead role in a television series \u2014 was inspired by \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a book by the CNN media reporter Brian Stelter on the so-called morning TV wars. For that one, Apple has pledged to make two 10-episode seasons, without so much as a script written. Two people familiar with the project said Apple would pay $12 million to $15 million an episode. (By comparison, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the costliest shows ever made, has a budget of $15 million an episode for its final season.)Unlike the stereotypical Hollywood producer or celebrity, Ms. Witherspoon is a deep reader \u2014 which has impressed the women who are working with her on Hello Sunshine\u2019s other Apple projects.Colleen McGuinness, a former \u201c30 Rock\u201d writer who is the show runner for the planned series based on a short-story collection by Curtis Sittenfeld, was surprised that Ms. Witherspoon had read the book before their first meeting. When Ms. McGuinness mentioned this, she said, she \u201cgot a look\u201d from Ms. Witherspoon.\u201cWe laughed about it, and I said, \u2018Yeah, most people don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Ms. McGuinness said.During a meeting about the project starring Ms. Spencer, the writer-producer Nichelle Tramble pointed out a book in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s office \u2014 \u201cThe Alice Network,\u201d a novel by Kate Quinn set in the 1940s. That led to a discussion of the lack of female leads in historical dramas.\u201cThat she was such an intense, true and avid reader was very exciting and a little bit shocking,\u201d Ms. Tramble said.Ms. Witherspoon marvels at how the business is changing. A few years ago, she said, prospects were dim for actresses over age 40. She hopes she can help change that in her new role.\u201cYou get older and the phone does stop ringing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, because the people who are writing the stories aren\u2019t 40-year-old women. You write what you know. Well, there were no 40-year-old female screenwriters, and now women of color are writing screenplays and getting them made at big studios.\u201cI\u2019m as incredulous as everybody else,\u201d she continued. \u201cI never thought this would happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Antivirus Software Can Be Turned Into a Tool for Spying", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been a secret, long known to intelligence agencies but rarely to consumers, that security software can be a powerful spy tool.Security software runs closest to the bare metal of a computer, with privileged access to nearly every program, application, web browser, email and file. There\u2019s good reason for this: Security products are intended to evaluate everything that touches your machine in search of anything malicious, or even vaguely suspicious.By downloading security software, consumers also run the risk that an untrustworthy antivirus maker \u2014 or hacker or spy with a foothold in its systems \u2014 could abuse that deep access to track customers\u2019 every digital movement.\u201cIn the battle against malicious code, antivirus products are a staple,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, chief research officer at Digita Security, a security company. \u201cIronically, though, these products share many characteristics with the advanced cyberespionage collection implants they seek to detect.\u201d\u201cI wanted to know if this was a feasible attack mechanism,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into the complex accusations. But from a technical point of view, if an antivirus maker wanted to, was coerced to, or was hacked or somehow subverted, could it create a signature to flag classified documents?\u201dThat question has taken on renewed importance over the last three months in the wake of United States officials\u2019 accusations that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software was used for Russian intelligence gathering, an accusation that Kaspersky has rigorously denied.Last month, Kaspersky Lab sued the Trump administration after a Department of Homeland Security directive banning its software from federal computer networks. Kaspersky claimed in an open letter that \u201cD.H.S. has harmed Kaspersky Lab\u2019s reputation and its commercial operations without any evidence of wrongdoing by the company.\u201dFor years, intelligence agencies suspected that Kaspersky Lab\u2019s security products provided a back door for Russian intelligence. A draft of a top-secret report leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, described a top-secret, N.S.A. effort in 2008 that concluded that Kaspersky\u2019s software collected sensitive information off customers\u2019 machines.The documents showed Kaspersky was not the N.S.A.\u2019s only target. Future targets included nearly two dozen other foreign antivirus makers, including Checkpoint in Israel and Avast in the Czech Republic.At the N.S.A., analysts were barred from using Kaspersky antivirus software because of the risk it would give the Kremlin broad access to their machines and data. But excluding N.S.A. headquarters at Fort Meade, Kaspersky still managed to secure contracts with nearly two dozen American government agencies over the last few years.Last September, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal agencies to cease using Kaspersky products because of the threat that Kaspersky\u2019s products could \u201cprovide access to files.\u201dKaspersky Lab initially denied any knowledge or involvement with the document theft. But the company has since acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on Mr. Pho\u2019s computer and removing it, though the company said it had immediately destroyed the documents once it realized they were classified.Kaspersky continues to deny that it knew about the scanning for classified United States programs or allowed its antivirus products to be used by Russian intelligence. Eugene Kaspersky, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said he would allow the United States government to inspect his company\u2019s source code to allay distrust of its antivirus and cybersecurity products.Mr. Wardle found that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software is incredibly complex. Unlike traditional antivirus software, which uses digital \u201csignatures\u201d to look for malicious code and patterns of activity, Kaspersky\u2019s signatures are easily updated, can be automatically pushed out to certain clients, and contain code that can be tweaked to do things like automatically scanning for and siphoning off classified documents.In short, Mr. Wardle found, \u201cantivirus could be the ultimate cyberespionage spying tool.\u201dMr. Wardle said it was relatively easy to use a vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Windows software to manipulate the Kaspersky software. Because officials routinely classify top secret documents with the marking \u201cTS/SCI,\u201d which stands for \u201cTop Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,\u201d Mr. Wardle added a rule to Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus program to flag any documents that contained the \u201cTS/SCI\u201d marker.He then edited a document on his computer containing text from the Winnie the Pooh children\u2019s book series to include the marking \u201cTS/SCI\u201d and waited to see whether Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus product would catch it.Sure enough, as soon as the Winnie the Pooh text was saved to his machine, Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software flagged and quarantined the document. When he added the same TS/SCI marker to another document containing the text \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\u201d it, too, was flagged and quarantined by Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus program.\u201cNot a whole lot of surprise that this worked,\u201d Mr. Wardle said, \u201cbut still neat to confirm that an antivirus product can be trivially, yet surreptitiously, used to detect classified documents.\u201dThe next question was: What happens to these files once they are flagged? Mr. Wardle stopped short of hacking into Kaspersky\u2019s cloud servers, where suspicious files are routinely uploaded.However, he noted that antivirus customers, including Kaspersky\u2019s, agreed by default to allow security vendors to send anything from their machine back to vendors\u2019 servers for further investigation.There are legitimate reasons for this: By uploading these items to Kaspersky\u2019s cloud, security analysts can evaluate whether they pose a threat, and update their signatures as a result.Kaspersky Lab said Mr. Wardle\u2019s research did not reflect how the company\u2019s software works.\u201cIt is impossible for Kaspersky Lab to deliver a specific signature or update to only one user in a secret, targeted way because all signatures are always openly available to all our users; and updates are digitally signed, further making it impossible to fake an update,\u201d the company said in a statement.The company added that it applied the same security standards and maintained the same levels of access as other security vendors, and reiterated that it was willing to make its source code, threat detection rules and software updates available for audit by independent experts.\u201cAnd no one would ever know,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect cybercrime.\u201dFollow Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @nicoleperlrothAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Amazon and Friends Handle Health Care? There\u2019s Reason for Doubt", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while the three companies bring successful management, technological expertise and substantial capital to the venture, many health industry experts expressed doubts about whether their results would match their ambition.Here are a few reasons that experts suggest we temper expectations.Over the years, faced with rising costs, employers have banded together to try novel approaches to health insurance benefits. Some have pioneered strategies like working directly with health systems or have achieved significant savings compared with competitors. But none have made a major dent in overall health care spending.\u201cThey contribute in the small wins,\u201d said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut those tend to be swamped by growth in health care, which is so high. They\u2019re not silver bullets.\u201dHealth care is very local, and companies have traditionally had a hard time preventing hospitals and doctors from raising prices or delivering mediocre care, because they don\u2019t have enough leverage to force health care providers to do things differently.\u201cThe part that is the most difficult is trying to influence the underlying system,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employer groups. \u201cAny single company, even broad coalitions, have a hard time.\u201dTechnology giants have attempted health care innovation before. Google and Microsoft started health ventures in recent years to a lot of fanfare, with little success.The three companies don\u2019t have much direct experience in providing health insurance or services. Chase has invested in the industry, and Berkshire Hathaway has owned insurance companies, but none have worked extensively in health benefits or in managing doctors, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies.\u201cJust because you know an industry is underperforming and you have a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean you have a successful strategy,\u201d said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, in an email. Ms. Dafny said she was excited to see such serious players take on this problem, but noted there were numerous examples of outsiders trying, and failing, to succeed in the health care system.Most disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That\u2019s the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don\u2019t usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper.Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called \u201clow-value services\u201d \u2014 health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options.But reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good value. Highly compensated employees, like those at Chase or at Amazon headquarters, may be particularly attracted to cutting-edge cancer treatments or the latest prescription drugs, he noted. A health plan that cut out such services might hurt the ability to recruit and retain workers needed to succeed in other parts of the business.\u201cIf there was pure inefficiency, I think it would be a lot easier to make progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that all of this stuff has some small benefit.\u201dThere are some ways that a smart company might seek to wring real inefficiencies out of health care. It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost.The three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services company, based in New York, with highly compensated employees. Berkshire Hathaway is a consortium of companies, spread throughout the country, in a variety of industries. And Amazon is a technology company with a hub of highly paid workers in Seattle, and with lower-wage workers spread in warehouses around the country. Will they all want or need the same sort of health plan?In general, companies with a lot of highly paid workers tend to offer generous benefits. Health insurance is not taxed in the same way as other forms of compensation, so an investment banker may prefer a health plan that covers everything instead of one with a big deductible that she has to pay out of her post-tax salary. A lower-wage worker in an Amazon warehouse, by contrast, may want a skimpier health plan and more wages.But savings on health care would accrue directly to the companies\u2019 bottom lines, allowing them to hire more workers or increase their profits relative to their competitors. That means selling such services to their competitors would need to be profitable enough to make up for giving competitors that business edge.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to transform the economy unless they then share all of those ideas and best practices with their competitors,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist who teaches corporate strategy at the Kellogg School at Northwestern. \u201cThat would not be good for long-term shareholder value for their firms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What about our allies?\u201d O.K., maybe Rex isn\u2019t doing such a terrific job, we\u2019ll see about Rex.Anyway, I know you all have your climate plans and corporate social responsibility B.S., but none of you believes a word of it. The difference between us is that you keep quiet so that you\u2019ll look good at Davos, but I don\u2019t. I say all the stuff you\u2019re too afraid to say. I say the truth, and people love me.I also say that Haiti is a, well, not such a nice place. Let\u2019s have another show of hands if you plan to move your wife and kids to Haiti anytime soon. I didn\u2019t think so. Wonderful, hard-working people, by the way, the Haitians. Many of them work at my properties in Florida as groundskeepers, maids, that kind of stuff. Ask them, they love me too.So what am I doing here? I read the papers \u2014 believe me, I read, I\u2019m, like, the best reader, you know I went to Wharton? \u2014 and I know this is all supposed to be about how you\u2019re all Davos Men and I\u2019m Mr. America First, and it\u2019s, you know, never the twain shall meet.Whatever. We\u2019re businessmen. We think the same way. You want to turn a profit and beat the competition. You don\u2019t want to get crushed. And you\u2019ll do what you need to do and say what you need to say to win.That\u2019s the way the world is, folks. You think China doesn\u2019t know this? You think Russia \u2014 and you know this Russia story, collusion, there was no collusion, none \u2014 doesn\u2019t know? Why do you think they keep winning? China is getting bigger, stronger, while Europe just gets smaller and weaker. Angela Merkel, sorry, but she\u2019s a total joke. Lets in a million Muslims, illegals, terrorists probably, in one year, and the German people don\u2019t like it at all. Remember, a year ago, how it was like, \u201cMerkel is the real leader of the free world\u201d? Now she barely leads her own government.She should have built a wall. Not smart!You have got to be kidding me. Have any of you here had your trade secrets stolen by China? Any of you think the Chinese play fair? You like human rights in China, pollution in China? Do some of you want to live in a world run by Xi? Because, be my guest.But if you don\u2019t, then things have to change. It can\u2019t be, we\u2019ll play by all the rules, like a bunch of little girls, and China gets to cheat, and pretend that that\u2019s O.K. Because, believe me, cheaters always win. Nobody knows this better than me.So that has got to stop. That\u2019s my message to you people. Do you want America first or China first? I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s your choice. But if it\u2019s America first you want, then you\u2019re going to stop playing us for suckers.We aren\u2019t going to pay your bills while you take our jobs. We aren\u2019t going to fight your battles if you aren\u2019t going to buy our products. We aren\u2019t going to let you get rich off of us, if we can\u2019t get richer off of you. We\u2019re stronger than you and we\u2019re going to stay that way. We can leave the surrender stuff to our European friends. Got it?You want America to be nice, we can be very nice, I\u2019m very nice, isn\u2019t that right, Klaus? But, we\u2019re not stupid, believe me.Enjoy your snow day, people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple\u2019s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple\u2019s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.\u201cThis is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn\u2019t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple\u2019s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.Patricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Elite? At Davos? That\u2019s News to Mnuchin", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Friday, one of his top economic advisers suggested that so-called Davos Men are closer to Average Joes.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was the global elite,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the administration official who will lead the delegation to Davos, said during an event sponsored by the Economic Club of Washington at the Ritz-Carlton hotel.Mr. Mnuchin went on to explain that the World Economic Forum was no more elitist than the Group of 20 gathering of finance ministers or meetings such as the annual Milken Institute conference, which brings together financiers and executives for discussions about the global economy.\u201cIf you look at the list, there\u2019s an awful lot of world leaders, there\u2019s an awful lot of finance chairs, there\u2019s an awful lot of business people,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThis is an important economic agenda.\u201dMr. Trump will be the first president since Bill Clinton to attend. As a candidate, he lashed out at his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for being a patron of \u201cglobalists\u201d and elite bankers. In 2014, Stephen K. Bannon, who went on to be Mr. Trump\u2019s chief political strategist, said that working-class men and women were tired of being dictated to by \u201cthe party of Davos.\u201dSome supporters of Mr. Trump have cast him as a populist \u201cparty crasher\u201d at Davos, while others think the journey is unwarranted and unwise. Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, told CNN that he was not pleased by the decision.\u201cI was disappointed that he\u2019s going to Davos because I think it\u2019s a lot of self-important people who have a totally different view of the world than he does,\u201d Mr. Moore said.Mr. Mnuchin, who has never attended the forum himself, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that the gathering was a good place to talk about the administration\u2019s \u201c\u2018American first\u2019 economic strategy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hangout for globalists,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel Faces Scrutiny as Questions Swirl Over Chip Security", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Intel faces an even bigger test: two serious security issues with its chips that could have implications for nearly everyone touched by computing. And so far \u2014 in something of a repeat of the 1994 incident \u2014 Intel has failed to quiet critics, putting it in an awkward position this week as its chief executive prepares to take the stage at one of the world\u2019s biggest tech trade shows.\u201cIt is a very big deal, because it\u2019s an area people haven\u2019t looked at before,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \u201cEverybody is going to start now.\u201dIntel was privately informed of the issues by security researchers in June. The company, which has rejected doing a chip recall or other costly remedies, said it has quietly marshaled a coalition of software, hardware and cloud services to develop and deploy programming tweaks that are designed to close most of the security gaps. Intel and its partners said the fixes should be largely in place this week.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten much more mature in our ability to respond,\u201d said Steven L. Smith, an Intel vice president who was closely involved in the Pentium crisis and is now overseeing its handling of the new security issues.Adding to Intel\u2019s image challenges is that Mr. Krzanich sold about $39 million in Intel shares in late November, after the company learned of the chip security problems. A company spokesman said the sale had been unrelated to the security issues and followed a prearranged annual trading plan. Mr. Krzanich, who reduced his holdings by about 50 percent, \u201ccontinues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines,\u201d Intel said.Meltdown and Spectre were identified by a team at Google, with their work augmented by researchers from other organizations. Meltdown affects only Intel chips. Spectre also affects chip designs from companies such Advanced Micro Devices and ARM Holdings, whose technology is used in most smartphones.Intel, largely by virtue of its success, has the most at stake. While the Pentium chip underpinned most PCs running Microsoft operating systems in 1994, Intel processors are now also used in all Apple Macintosh systems and more than 95 percent of the chips used by cloud services and data centers run by corporations. Its technological reach means that both Meltdown and Spectre could affect just about anyone who uses the internet.\u201cWe created a microprocessor monoculture,\u201d said Bryan Cantrill, chief technology officer at Joyent, a cloud service owned by Samsung. \u201cThere are dangers associated with that.\u201dIntel\u2019s situation is complicated by history and semantics. The Pentium problem was caused by a design error. But Meltdown and Spectre attacks exploit a common speed-boosting technique in chips called speculative execution that Intel\u2019s Mr. Smith insisted is working as it should. That approach to chip design emerged before researchers developed new ways to spy on such internal operations, using what they call \u201cside-channel\u201d analysis, Mr. Smith said.As a result, the security issues that were discovered were not flaws or bugs, he said. The features that hackers could exploit are a bit like a door or window in a house, which burglars can exploit but that builders would not consider leaving out.That hasn\u2019t stopped an uproar from security researchers and tech industry executives. One widely distributed barb came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, who posted a testy message last week advising Intel to \u201ctake a long hard look\u201d at its chips \u201cand actually admit that they have issues instead of writing P.R. blurbs that say that everything works as designed.\u201dMajor users of Intel chips \u2014 including Apple and the cloud computing arms of Google and Amazon \u2014 have said they deployed security fixes recommended by Intel and so far they have not reported the sharp performance slowdowns of the sort some experts projected.Many security professionals said they accepted the argument. \u201cThis is not a simple \u2018we found a bug, here\u2019s a patch and we are done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schneier said.Whether Intel\u2019s actions to address Meltdown and Spectre will be enough for the company to sidestep a sizable financial hit is unclear. At least one lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against Intel, and some industry executives expect more litigation to come. At a minimum, Intel engineers working on future microprocessors now face the additional labor of trying to make them less susceptible to the new kinds of attacks.Using the software fixes, \u201cwe already have the security improvement that we are seeking to get,\u201d Mr. Smith said. But making internal changes to the chips could handle those changes more efficiently, he said.Advertisement"}
