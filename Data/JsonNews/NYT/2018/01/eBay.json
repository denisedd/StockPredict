It was 8 a.m., and Mr. Huck had already eaten lunch.Mr. Huck, 34, owns Command Entertainment Group, a company that connects brands (over 100 annually, he said, including the consumer-goods giant Unilever) to celebrities and \u201cinfluencers.\u201d His business has gotten a significant boost from his close friendship with Kim Kardashian West, who has 106 million Instagram followers, though she is not a client.\u201cHe\u2019s always been there at times when I\u2019ve needed him,\u201d Mrs. Kardashian West said in a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s the definition of loyal. I feel like you need to surround yourself with people who make you laugh and keep your spirit alive as you grow and evolve.\u201dAlso, \u201che\u2019s someone that will drop anything and everything to really talk you through something,\u201d Mrs. Kardashian West said.As it happened, Mr. Huck had just picked something up: a leather briefcase. Wearing Saint Laurent jeans and a black T-shirt, he was walking the five minutes from his apartment in the West Village of Manhattan to the Soho House, where most mornings he does a few hours of emails or meetings before heading to his office a few blocks away.\u201cIt\u2019s the most gratifying feeling, to see it all come together,\u201d he said.If Mr. Huck is awake, he is working, phone in hand \u2014 even when vacationing in Greece or in the Middle East with Mrs. Kardashian West. \u201cHe could be on a camel in Egypt reciting a paragraph from the contract,\u201d said Carla Laur, a commercial endorsement agent at Creative Artists Agency who has worked on dozens of deals with Command Entertainment Group.Mr. Huck suggested his dedication arises from mistrusting his good fortune. \u201cI still have moments where I feel like someone is going to pull the rug from under me and be like, \u2018You actually have to go to law school,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt sometimes all feels like a dream.\u201dThe seeds of success were sown during a snowstorm in 2005, when he was taking a break from studying political science at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Canada, and flipping through the pages of US Weekly. The high-profile publicist Lizzie Grubman had been spotted making out with the singer John Mayer at the New York City hot spot Marquee.\u201cI went home, spent 24 hours on Google researching everything about P.R. and found Lizzie\u2019s number,\u201d Mr. Huck said.Two days later he was in Manhattan for the first time.Wearing a shiny khaki suit and square-toed Diesel shoes, Mr. Huck, positive he looked \u201cso New York,\u201d was given two minutes with Ms. Grubman\u2019s chief financial officer.\u201cI was bumbling all over the place,\u201d Mr. Huck said. \u201cI left the office and I remember doing a Myspace upload in the elevator.\u201dOne hour later, Mr. Cheban, then Ms. Grubman\u2019s partner, called him to come back in. He had a job \u2014 well, an unpaid internship.Mr. Huck abandoned his college apartment and everything in it, packed a duffel bag and stayed on friends\u2019 couches for two years. He worked putting together invitation lists and securing red-carpet press. Sean Combs\u2019s White Party in the Hamptons was one of his first big projects.When Mr. Cheban left Ms. Grubman\u2019s company to return to his own agency, Command PR, which he had started in 1999, he took Mr. Huck with him.The two quickly went from giving brands suggestions of whom they should work with to negotiating the entire deal. They also met and befriended Kim Kardashian, who was then running a successful eBay closet along with the Dash boutique chain she founded with her sisters.While they were at dinner with Kim and Kourtney Kardashian in Los Angeles, Kim said they were planning to do a reality show about their life and their families on the E! network.\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it, but Kim always had conviction,\u201d Mr. Huck said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most brilliant marketers I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d Moreover, \u201cIf I ever need advice, she\u2019s the person I call and it\u2019s straight up, tell it like it is. She\u2019s a pragmatist.\u201dStill, Mr. Huck feels elevated by the experience, and excited for the future.\u201cI want to continue to grow and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You a Sneaker Head?", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionWhat is the last pair of sneakers you bought and what did you buy them for?Sneaker Con, a gathering of shoe fanatics founded in 2009, brought 500 vendors and over 19,000 people to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York late last year. The heart and soul of the event is the trading pit, an area in the back of the 840,000-square-foot center where a crowd of mostly teenage boys was talking and holding up their sneakers, looking for buyers. The experience was overwhelming, confusing (where are their parents?) and educational. Here\u2019s what the sneaker experts had to say for themselves.On spotting real from fake kicks, an authentication expert, Antonio Linares, says:Ultimately it always comes down to craftsmanship, detail and the material used. The counterfeit industry is going to get as close as possible to the original materials, but they cut corners and use inferior products. Stitching is usually a big thing to check across the board, whether it is a hoodie or a pair of shoes.Now it\u2019s a lot of hype. Kanye West drops something and all the kids are running, and a month or two months later, the price just drops. We don\u2019t buy into the hype stuff. We buy stuff that held its value over time. We have sneaker patents. We have one-of-a-kind Yeezy samples. We specialize in prototype, samples, vintage, rare samples.A co-founder of Sneaker Con, Yu Ming Wu, talks about the most he would pay for a shoe:About 4,500 pairs. I\u2019ve got a storage facility. I\u2019ve been collecting since maybe 1996. So it\u2019s been a long time to accumulate a lot of shoes.And 16-year-old Benjamin Kapelushnik, a.k.a. Benjamin Kickz, explains how he started a business reselling sneakers to athletes and celebrities:I started as a hobby when I was 13. And my parents just didn\u2019t want to support it at first. So I just had to resell sneakers to make money to buy myself more sneakers.\u2014 Do you consider yourself a sneaker head? If so, when did you start collecting sneakers and why? How many shoes do have in your collection? What is your favorite sneaker that you own? Do you have any rare sneakers or are there any you would like to get your hands on?\u2014 Why do you buy sneakers? For being active? As a fashion statement? As an investment? Or to resell? What are you looking for when you buy a new shoe? If you had the money, what is the most you would be willing to spend on a pair of sneakers and why?\u2014 What tips from the article do you find the most helpful? What advice for choosing sneakers, caring for them and spotting fakes would you give to other sneaker heads, or those who are looking to start a collection?\u2014 What kicks are you most looking forward to buying in 2018 and why?\u2014 If you are not a sneaker head, what do you think of this hobby?

{"Headline": "Sneaker Heads, Astrology and New Year\u2019s Resolutions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationThis week we enjoyed reading diverse opinions on whether astrology is real, if the extreme cold weather is enjoyable or miserable, how to go about reinventing oneself and what 2018 will bring._________I am a sneaker head in the Bay Area. The sneaker community in San Francisco is the same throughout other places. As the new Jordan\u2019s come to release, a lot of people will be wearing it and if it\u2019s an \u201cOG Colorway\u201d pair, it is very anticipated. It will be the same as for collaboration pairs, such as Yeezy\u2019s. Talking about myself, I\u2019ve owned 10 pairs or more sneakers. I don\u2019t really stay with one brand, I wear from Vans to the hyped Jordan\u2019s. The most I spent for a pair of kicks is around $300. And those sneakers were the Jordan 3lab5s. But now, I have layed low in buying sneakers. I\u2019ve been buying strictly only Jordan 1 pairs, because they\u2019re lightweight and comfortable. I will still buy Jordan pairs but only if they look good to me, not following the hype.I do consider myself as a sneaker head because I have been collecting sneakers since my 8th grade and have collected a little over 60 pairs. I would say that my favorite sneaker would be the Jordan 1. I think the most I\u2019ve paid for a pair of shoe was $600. I personally don\u2019t consider myself a hypebeast because I don\u2019t buy items for the hype or resale value. I buy the things I personally like, but I do constantly buy shoes every two weeks. What I found helpful is that you should really examine the shoe or clothing piece by the sticking or by the coloring. The sneakers that I mostly look into are the Jordan 1s and the yeezy boost 350.Before reading this article I knew about the rapidly growing hype around the sneaker community or even just shoes in general. I share the same hobby that Benjamin Kapelushnik has and I also share the same dream. Ever since getting involved with sneakers I have always wanted to start collecting or even start up a small resell business with my friends. Seeing the community grow over the past couple of years is amazing, and being a sneakerhead is fun, it\u2019s just like being passionate towards your favorite sports team. I currently have 6 shoes in my collection and I am looking to obtain more. Some people may find 6 shoes an absurd amount for one person, but to me it\u2019s the same as collecting pokemon, baseball, or football cards. Being a part of such a new and expanding community of sneaker fanatics and collectors is great, and I only see the hype around sneakers increasing.Was I a sneakerhead? I remember coming home from school and looking at all the sneaker websites like Kicks On Fire, Sneaker News, Kixify, ane Sole Collector. Sneakers was what I Loved, shoes simply amused me. Kicks fit in perfectly with my lifestyle at the time. I was playing basketball twenty four seven. It seems like my life was a repeating cycle of school, basketball, and sneakers. I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead walking on the court without some fly sneakers on my feet. I loved nikes, especially the lebrons. I was always looking at social media and ebay to see if I could get my hands on the Lebron Ten Lava Edition. At the time lebron tens were selling for about two-hundred dollars and that did not phase me one bit, they were the most beautiful thing I had even seen. The summer of 2016 I was able to go to a House of Hoops, a special edition footlocker store for exclusive shoes and I walked out with those beloved lebrons. I have them to this day with the box and receipt they came with. The craziest thing is how I totally outgrew the sneakerhead phase and I quit basketball. Now I love to shop at goodwill and find that killer garment and put on that pair of vans that feel just right.I have lost my interest in shoes so I am not a sneaker head. I used to be one of the people who would wait in line ready for them to take my money just so I can attend school on Monday with my new Jordans. I have around 15-20 pairs of shoes yet only use around 12 of them. I see the hype in wanting the most recent shoes to come out to be fly because they are expensive and there are a limited pair the put in stock. I have a pair of low top Concord 11\u2019s that I bought for $150 and can now sale them for more than that, and the better the condition they are in the more expensive they can be sold for. If you can pay all your bills and buy expensive shoes you want go ahead, but people like myself have realized that at the end of the day they\u2019re just shoes and at the end of the day it is the value you give them.Then, there were those who didn\u2019t get the sneaker mania at all.Never before reading and engaging in this article have I heard the shoe frenzy term, sneaker head. Maybe it\u2019s because I have never really been involved in the world of shoes, but I did learn that sneaker heads are extremely passionate about their shoes. It amazed me how some of these collectors have a mass total of four thousand and five hundred pair of shoes. That is incredible! Through all of this amazement however, I just don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind this hobby. Personally, I have three different pairs of shoes. Basic tennis shoes for school, black shoes for work and sandals for the beach. Yeah, shoes are great and all, but more than three or even five pairs is just excessive. Heck, there are some folks who can barely afford one pair of old boots, and here we come with our large storage facility filled with unused, overly expensive and wasteful rubber! I may share the passion with these sneaker heads that some shoes are just simply awesome, but I have absolutely no desire to be passionate about a hobby that is based off the wasting of valuable resources.I love shoes but I do not consider myself a sneaker head. I have about 15 pairs of shoes but none cost me over 80$. Shoes are beautiful and help us express who we are. But I don\u2019t agree with people who spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a single pair. In my opinion that money could be used to help non profits or others in need. There is no need to spend all your check on something you will keep boxed up in a storage room. Why wait in line for a pair of shoes our generation labeled as \u201cdope\u201d instead of looking for what\u2019s you really like and at a more affordable price? You can express your identity in many ways without having to overboard._________I\u2019ve never experienced cold like this before. Until I moved up north this past summer \u2014 I\u2019d never been in temperatures below 20 degrees fahrenheit and hadn\u2019t planned on it \u2014 but this? Experiencing negative temperatures has been a huge blow. I know how to deal with the heat \u2014 I grew up in Texas and spent time in New Mexico and Louisiana and other sweltering southern states. I can handle heat exhaustion. Vomiting from the heat, worrying about dehydration, getting lectured for melting my shoes on the pavement \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with it. But now? My first blizzard? I\u2019m completely out of my element. I\u2019d never shoveled snow before. I\u2019d never actually seen a snowblower. I\u2019d never even owned a down coat. It\u2019s overwhelming and has impacted my day to day life more than I could have even imagined. I try to be grateful for these new experiences, but honestly? I\u2019m just too cold to appreciate them.The cold weather is way too much even for me. As a kid I used to love when it snowed and going outside to build a snowman and sled. As of today I am officially over winter and am in desperate need of summer. I honestly think the weather has affected everyone negatively in one way or another. Whether it be having to shovel 14 inches off their driveway, or having to wake up an extra 30 mins earlier because they have to drive slower to work / school due to how bad the roads are. I also think this weather affects students a lot. With summer being very far away and the cold freezing us every morning on the way to school, we\u2019re losing any and all effort of trying to work hard. We are cold and all we want to do is go and warm up with a heavy comfy blanket, not sit down and work on the ice cold kitchen table finishing our math homework.Personally, I\u2019ve loved the recent cold weather we\u2019ve been having. I\u2019ve always loved to walk outside and feel a cool refreshing breeze against my face. I am so grateful to have missed a few days of school and have an extended break. I really needed more time off for obvious reasons. This recent weather has surprised me because normally we have mild weather here in Wilmington. I have not been through any extreme weather to this point luckily, the worst I\u2019ve experienced has been a category 2 hurricane.Since Christmas it seems like all of America has been trapped in a harsh cold front especially in places like New England where cities and towns were bombarded with two feet of snow and countless days near or below zero degrees not to mention the windchill that sends cold wintery air deep into your core making it almost unbearable to do anything outside your home. However, we have seen worse so I guess in some way it\u2019s better to be really cold and snowy across America rather than to have to fight hurricane after hurricane such as this summer when it seemed as though there was never a time without a major hurricane ravaging some area of the country or during the fall when California saw one of the most massive, destructive, and deadly wildfires in history. So we can all at least be thankful that all we have to deal with is frigid temperatures and snow instead of walls of flames that march their way across cities and towns or hurricanes strong enough to rip homes from their foundations._________I do not believe in Astrology. In fact, I think the whole concept of Astrology is nonsense. In my opinion, to think that the current location of Saturn or any other star dictating whether if I pass or fail a test is mindboggling for me. I understand that Astrology has recently become a \u201ctrendy\u201d thing to have fun with, but to fully buy into the concept is a betrayal to the scientists and astronomers that have dedicated time, resources, and effort to explain our universe logically. First off, Astrology is not a science. Astrology is not based on evidence, the conclusions aren\u2019t testable, and can\u2019t be proven wrong. These qualities are the main foundations of what science is and Astrology fails to meet any of these qualities. Secondly, scientists have put Astrology to the test multiple times in the past and have found Astrology to be inconsistent. A French study in the 60s which aimed to find if people\u2019s careers correlated with the placement of celestial bodies resulted in no correlation. However, despite the debunking of Astrology as a significant amount of Americans believe that Astrology is a type of science. It is concerning that Americans believe in an ancient practice that has no ground or base in science in terms of evidence and testability. To conclude, I think that Astrology can be practiced as a fun activity for family and friend gatherings but not applied to science that is based in realityIt\u2019s appalling to see a concept as ridiculous as astrology actually making its mark on today\u2019s society. In a world where our scientific capabilities are vastly expanding, the last thing that we should be doing is resorting to untestable and unreliable methods for explanation and prediction. I fully understand that astrology might be a fun activity to mess around with, but attempting to apply it in the real world is just plain stupid. As a species, we have evolved past looking at relations between stars for answers to completely unrelated problems. Astrology has proven to be inconsistent in various scientific tests, and it seems that the best defense people have for it is a coincidence here and there. If people want answers they should be looking to a science \u2014 a real science \u2014 that can give them real answers. My hope is that astrology only continues to gain popularity as an activity for fooling around, and people won\u2019t truly put faith in a completely defenseless practice.Not only do I believe in astrology, I do find it to be the tool through which we can understand ourselves and the universe in which we live. In fact, you might as well could have asked me if I believed in gravity or in earth being round. For me it\u2019s a hard fact.I started by questioning Astrology many years ago, and had a very skeptic approach. But I would then find things that were not coincidence, that were very specific about me. And is fine when is one or maybe two things. But astrology has taught me that I am more than a combination of circumstances, that the future is not written in stars but is written in you, but within the choices taken in the present and that the reaction, not the event, to what happens in one\u2019s life, is what matter the most. Is not about finding out when you will get a boyfriend or a new car. Is more about if and why you are ready for it.It is not so much a religion as it is a system. Unfortunately, most people exposure to astrology is a section in a newspaper that is referring to a whole group of the population and they believe this is all there is to it. To say that someone is from one sign or the other is obviously simplistic. Is like saying someone is from a country or another. There are dozens of other factors astrology considers. If you haven\u2019t gotten your Birth Chart done by a credited astrologer, I doubt you ever know what the big deal is about it, and why it has not gone anywhere in the over 10,000 years of history on its back.While growing up, I remember looking at the newspaper and seeing a section for horoscopes. It always interested me and I wanted to learn more. I\u2019ve always been into learning more about my personality, taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and looking at my natal chart. The natal chart uses when you were born, what time you were born, and where you were born to show you each house or planet you fall into. It\u2019s more in depth than just finding the zodiac sign of the month your birthday is.I believe in astrology. It helps us better learn about ourselves and the universe we live in. Through analyzing my chart, I was able to understand myself and how I am. The astrology chart was pretty close to what I got on the Myers-Briggs personality test too. Most people base their belief of astrology on the horoscopes people put into their blogs, but that isn\u2019t individualized for them. That\u2019s more of a general belief and that\u2019s not what you should go by. If you take the time to do a natal chart and read your results, you will find that it\u2019s pretty accurate and you may discover some things you didn\u2019t really know about yourself, but it\u2019s true.I will say, astrology and the future it tells you is not set in stone. You can change the future. The choices you make shape who you are and what will happen in your lifetime.Yes, I do believe in astrology. The horoscopes that tell you you\u2019re going to win a million dollars may not be right and sometimes the placement of the planets won\u2019t determine whether or not you find your soul mate, however I do believe that astrology has actual meaning. The universe is a vast and unpredictable place, humans have barely scraped the surface of what is the universe is made of, what it looks like, what it\u2019s function is, etc. There is no literal knowledge of what the universe is fully capable of because we have not witnessed or tested it all. So, astrology, the study of the planets, the dependence on their patterns, makes sense to me. The planets are a wonderful and almost magical force. The giants in the sky are centers of their own universes of life. They are important and I think incorporating them into your life is valuable to being humble and being knowledgeable about your spiritual and mindful self. The idea that these beasts can tell us why we are sad and why the day is going bad is so nice for humans to hear that we cling to it. It is in our nature to look for why things happen or what causes things. So, if someone believes that the position of mercury explains why they can\u2019t communicate properly then that\u2019s that. The human race, with all its complexity and differences, is the same at the core with needing to find something comforting to understand. So, astrology works perfectly to explain the inexplicable universe.Astrology helps us pinpoint our personality traits and characteristics, but reading your horoscope can provide you with attracting information when life seems to be at a stand-still. By explaining why certain things happen, horoscopes can help you cope with the most subjective affairs that are going on in your life. Whether you are experiencing great times and fortune, or you are going through dark, and tough times, your horoscope can provide solace when you don\u2019t know where to turn. Life is about decisions, and keeping up with your astrological identity and horoscope can help you fix your mind to what you should do when you make decisions. Some say that just having a short read every once in awhile can help you benefit from the energy the cosmos are pushing towards you, but I believe that horoscopes can be a waste of money and time. In fact, nobody can totally rely on horoscopes to solve his or her problems. Rather, consider them as fortune cookies which give momentary pleasure but cannot sustain you forever._________The picture illustrates the role social media has in one\u2019s life. Below each person is the set number of followers that they have which defines each as more \u201cpopular\u201d than the other. The image provides the audience with information on how social media is used and how impactful it can be when being used to appeal to an audience. As depicted, social media is a place that is welcoming of all ethnicities, genders, etc. Everyone has the right to equal use and popularity of social media \u2014 which represents that the use of social media and being a part of sites demonstrates unity for all those a part of the program. Social media relates to society because it shows how each person has the ability to break away from everyday life and be anyone they want to be on social media. Social media can be beneficial in communicating with long distant family and friends, or even sharing a fascinating picture! The image comments on current day society by revealing that people utilize social media to potentially make insecurities more hidden (due to the lack of background knowledge given to a \u201cfollower\u201d on social media), or release any stress. Having this interpretation of the image allows for the conclusion that social media can be used positively in society, or its power can be over used resulting in an over obsession with the site.To me this picture says that social media is everywhere. It controls us. We are always worried about what is new on it, who has texted us, snap chatted us. We look up to people who we do not even know, to people who we want to look like, to act like, to people who we aspire to be. We are glued to our phones, constantly seeing the people we wish we could be like, but that is not healthy. The almost impossible standards that we are exposed to almost every time we open our phone. Worrying about how many followers or friends we have. We are addicted to our phones and social media. The real question is though, why are we addicted?In my opinion, this picture represents the huge impact that social media has on our daily lives. Each of these social media stars has millions of followers, many looking up to them. However, what this picture does not show, many celebrities who attained their fame in a different way, have massive followings as well. One of these celebrities is none other than our president, Donald Trump. As said by Kashana Cauley, Trump has used Twitter to \u201cpromote a tax bill that would disembowel the middle class and to attack prominent black people.\u201d She says, however, that these tweets have made her feel more patriotic, by voicing what she believes is right for our country. Even though many argue that this is unpatriotic because it goes against our president, but in reality, this is patriotism. Patriotism is believing in one\u2019s country and being proud of the nation. Kashana Cauley is proud of the people in America standing up for their rights, such as the football playing kneeling for the national anthem. If Americans supported everything Trump says, all of his bigotry and ignorance, simply because he is our president, this would be nationalism. Nationalism is the toxic idea that one\u2019s nation is better than other countries, and blindly supporting one\u2019s country, even if their nation is wrong. I believe Kashana Cauley is patriotic, because she is striving to improve our country instead of conforming to the misogynistic and racist views ingrained in the American political system.This picture illustrates the standard at which people need to stand at to be famous or well known is receiving many likes and followers. Every social media user is different and is able to stand out in their own way, but this picture only makes well known users stand out. Not everyone has thousands of likes and followers, and for those that do have special attention. This shows that for the people that have the largest amount of likes and followers having a higher ranking. This is redundant because everyone was born equal and it is not fair to be placed in a position where you are lower than someone.This image sums up a perfect explanation on how social media is changing people\u2019s lives. One\u2019s popularity is determined by the amount of followers we have or the number of likes we get on our recent picture. Everyone of us have been impacted by social media and for some, it has changed our lives. We are addicted to our smartphones, laptops and tablet screens. However, it is up to us to determine whether we use social media in a negative way or if we positively affect the social media world._________Gifs are the perfect way to express how you feel when you can\u2019t find the words to do so. People do say \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d for a reason. If you want to passive-agressively show someone you are upset with them, send a gif. If you want to show your appreciation for someone but are too awkward to put it into words, send a gif. Gifs are used all over the world because they can express universal feelings in ways that words can\u2019t always do. Happiness, love, sadness, and anger are all emotions popularly represented by gifs in many different countries. This is because despite being universal feelings, they are much easier to express through facial expressions or actions. But, it\u2019s 2018, hardly any communication is face-to-face anymore, gifs bring the element of expression that cannot be expressed through text.I use emoji when I am shocked, excited, or sad about something. By using emojis, it helps the person who is reading it understand how you feel about the situation. By using emoji it expresses if I am kind, mean, or judgmental. It expresses this because it shows what I feel about the topic being talked about.Gifs are a new culture to the social media world. They are the perfect way to express how you feel, what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re doing. By using gifs and emojis we can show exactly how we feel without misleading the other through words. Our words often get interpreted or altered in ways we didn\u2019t even mean them to sound. Therefore, gifs are a great way to show how we feel!_________I have reinvented myself multiple times, but my biggest was just a few months ago. When hanging out with my friends I used to be shy and always afraid to voice my opinion. One day I asked myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, why are you so reserved.\u201d I had no answer so after that day I have been outgoing and im never afraid to say what\u2019s on my mind. I have had so much more fun with my friends than I ever have before. Even though I might be a little hesitant to talk in front of the class, I imagine one day that will change. But, until then i will make the most of it. I think that someone can control if they change or not out of high school. It is all about where you end up.Knowledge is used to move forward. As people learn more, life is made easier. Tasks such as washing laundry and cooking food continue to change with the creation of new inventions and developments. Not only does the way tasks change, but people do too. People never stop reinventing themselves. From the day someone is born, the process of reinvention never ceases to reoccur. Moving up to a high school, with different expectations than past schooling meant that I especially had to change to meet higher expectations. Reinventing myself included, trying harder in specific subject areas in order to fulfill class requirements that were more difficult than before. Energy in certain subject areas needed to be re-focused and adjusted. To overcome obstacles, I had to reinvent my approach to school, which meant that I had to reinvent myself.Change is inevitable. For some, this realization is unfortunate and rather scary; while for others it is exciting and makes them eager to experience these changes in their lives. Personally, I do not believe that we can control how much we will change over time. Most personal change is a result of experience, most of which is unexpected or uncontrollable. For instance, experiencing a tragic event like a death in your family is completely out of your control, but it will in fact change who you are as a person. It may make you more angry, bitter, or it may even reshape the way you look at life and express yourself to others. On the other hand, there are change-causing things that we can control, like who we decide to be friends with, where you work, what you choose to do in your free time. But change will always remain inevitable, something that will not always be completely in our control.Part one: I believe that I was given an opportunity to reinvent myself, but I did not take it. When I was going into my 8th grade year, I was leaving my school of about 40 people in the whole grade, a school that I had been at since Kindergarten, for a school with about 40 people in just one class. Although I knew a handful of people, there were many that I was yet to be acquainted with. I felt that this was a chance to reinvent myself, being that hardly anyone would know me. I thought this for a little while, and then decided that I would rather be who I felt I had always been. Looking back, I do not believe that there has really been a time when I have \u201creinvented\u201d myself, per se, but I have gradually changed over time. I believe that change within people is inevitable, either it being a sudden change, or a gradual one. I have seen some of my friends reinvent themselves though, and sometimes I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. Much like Navlakha in the article, I don\u2019t want to lose them. I am a sophomore in high school right now, and I feel like I will definitely change when I leave for college and continue that change throughout my freshman year. I think this because leaving home and going to college is one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. As Navlakha did, I hope to also change in the way I feel about certain subjects in academics in college.In her article on reinventing oneself in college, Meera Navlakah argues that change is inevitable in our lives when we place ourselves in new environments. I agree with Meera that new experiences alter our personalities. For example, many of my friends in middle school who attended private school instead of Danvers High have grown differently in the past couple years than the rest of us have. While our attitudes have remained the same, many of them have a more privileged life than public school students. At private schools, they are required to dress much more formally, often enduring more rigorous principles at their respective schools. In turn, they have developed a first class attitude compared to us. While the difference in wealth may affect students attitudes, I have remained good friends with these preparatory students. The core of their personality remains beneath the surface. People do not really change that much. Deep down, people are who they have always been. New environments seem to change people on the surface. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks however. While I expect my friends and I will change over the course of our lives, the core of our personalities will remain the same._________I do make New Year\u2019s resolutions each year, but it\u2019s actually hard for me to keep.Many people perceive New Years resolutions to be ways to make other people like you, but I think they are about making you like yourself. To me, New Years resolutions are about making yourself the best you can be, whether it be in health, or in mindset. In the past I have not stuck to my resolutions, but this year I made a goal that I can achieve. My resolution is to drink more water. It will help me be a stronger athlete, which is something I myself strive to be. Hydrating is not all about sports, however. Hydrating also helps your body function better and keeps you healthy. I downloaded an app that keeps track of your fluid intake so I don\u2019t have an excuse to fall short. It is important to hold yourself accountable to your New Years resolutions, and not just tell your peers how well you\u2019re doing. Remember, the reason why you\u2019re doing this should be for you, not for them.In years past I had always made some sort of resolution. I would do something like I want to lose weight or I want to be kinder to others. But this year I found that I\u2019ve bettered myself, I\u2019m happy with myself and I\u2019ve done all the important things I needed to do. Sure, I realize it\u2019s important to keep going, to keep working out, to keep being kind; but I don\u2019t think that requires a new resolution.I tend to make New Year\u2019s resolutions. Most of the time I don\u2019t keep them. This year I have a lot of good and healthy ones that I want to keep. For example i want to eat healthier, and spend less time on my phone and video games. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be.Personally I try to make \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d but I typically forget about them and move on. I do however, make sure that I try to improve myself in one way or another throughout the new year. Whether it\u2019s improving my grades, volunteering more, or simply just making sure I stay healthy and take care of myself. In general I believe that new year\u2019s resolutions are a bit clich\u00e9. Most people make them after they have had a rough previous year, and hope that the next year improves, but, usually it doesn\u2019t. Usually we create a mindset that we are going to improve ourselves and our lives by making these resolutions but the average person doesn\u2019t actually try to keep up with them. We simply state what we want to do to improve ourselves for the next year and made mediocre steps to complete that goal. I do believe that some people really can and will complete their new year\u2019s goal, and I applaud those people because usually I, myself, cannot complete the many goals that I have set for myself at the beginning of the year. I only have one goal this year and it\u2019s to take care of myself, to make sure that I am healthy mentally as well as physically. The steps that I am willing to take in order to complete this goal is to, eat healthier, drink more water, (try to) procrastinate less and to make time to hangout with loved ones such as friends and family. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be._________I think 2018 will be a year full of disagreement and conflict in our government and country. I feel like Trump will continue to lead our country in a direction that won\u2019t benefit us. I also believe that we will go into further debt.2017 was a year to remember. There were a lot of events that have raised questions and caused tensions to rise. With trump being elected there has become a great division within the country. He has also started rising conflicts with other nations most notably North Korea. Now that it is 2018, I believe things can get better. Now that we went through an entire year with the way things have ran, people will wake up and begin to take a stand in what they believe. Both parties of congress will start to work together to some extent because the president is somewhat against his own party. I think we will start to see a lot more states that are usually red will start to tip blue or at least not be as red. The House will become split after the midterms. I believe many of the social issues such as taking a knee and the me too movement will only continue. I do believe however if the movement continues we will have more and more people become against it because it is starting to take the form of a witch hunt. Countries will try to find better ways to crackdown on terrorist. As for the Korea missile crises, I believe that it is very likely that Russia will try to step in and force the situation. That is if Putin wins his next election which I think he could lose. If he does win it will be a close one. In the world of sports, I believe the Saints will win the Super Bowl, Arkansas the college mens baseball championship, and the Boston Celtics the 2018 NBA Finals.Our world in general will not change in 2018. The idea of 2018 being a new year is just a label. Even though the new year seems like the epitome of all things change, nothing ever does. I predict there will be just as much if not more conflict. As for U.S. politics, I believe Donald Trump will further his border wall agenda and attacks against other countries. I believe the economy will continue to improve as it has, and stocks will continue to rise. Fashion will continue to be increasingly edgy and our culture will continue to be rivaled by racism, bigotry, and societal conformity. As for my family and loved ones I hope they have a happy, safe year and I wish for academic and athletic success for myself.I predict that 2018 will be no better than 2017. There have been so many countless global, national, and local disasters in 2017, that they cannot be recovered by 2018 or possibly even 2019. In fact, such disasters will continue to pile on to the existing ones and eventually there will be more than we can bare and shortly after, there will be nuclear war and an extinction the human race. I am only predicting extreme circumstance because after what 2017 left us with, going to extreme measures is the only way we can prepare for what 2018 holds for us. I mean think about it. We put a racist businessman who has no logical knowledge on how to be a leader in charge of our nation. How can I not predict that there will be a nuclear war? But that is only my political predictions for 2018. As for economic predictions, I can honestly say I don\u2019t know. Finally, the future for the realms of culture, arts, fashion, and style is looking bright. Despite all of the political and economic dilemmas that will go on, I feel like culture, arts, etc. will truly flourish because I\u2019ve noticed in 2017, that people began to embrace their love for different cultures and arts and I think it will continue like that in 2018. But, in the end, the bad overshadows the good and despite such improvements in the arts and culture, the political issues will rise higher. But, these are only my predictions. Maybe, that won\u2019t happen. Maybe everything will lighten up in 2018. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.2017 was a year overcome by an overwhelming blanket of controversy and violence. However, it is possible that some of this could be resolved in 2018, especially with the formation of improved policies around the world to hinder gun violence, drug abuse, and terrorism. Furthermore, the people of the United States have been hiding under their desks in fear of a nuclear attack or getting hacked. I predict that in 2018, the Russia investigation on the hacking in the 2016 election that had plagued the nation for the past year will be progressed upon, and the United States will become a more secure nation as a whole. Along with the booming economy, this development could bring America to a state of enhanced greatness and prosperity. Although there is still a lingering issue with \u201cRocket Man\u201d in North Korea, hopefully there will be a continuation of the six-party talks or some form of bilateral treaty with the aggressive nation that will leave countless countries feeling much more secure. Outside of politics, there will most likely be major changes in the world of entertainment. With widespread debate over national anthem protests in leagues such as the NFL, there will most likely be a shift in viewership of this sport, to other leagues such as the NBA or the NHL. This was mildly evident during this football season, but more viewers will most likely return to watch the upcoming playoffs, and the New England Patriots winning another championship.2017 has been a very eventful year. Our country has experienced many catastrophes that range from political to economic. Politically, our country has elected a man who is hated by most. There has been a large variety of national disasters along with global and local ones. I predict that 2018 will not be much different than 2017 regarding these issues. For example, I believe that since the minimum wage increase, small businesses are going to be greatly effected. In order pay their employees, small businesses will have to increase their prices so that they will still be bringing the same amount of money into their business. Additionally, social media shows how people nowadays especially children will believe anything they see. This will negatively affect the minds of our youth as it has already done in some situations in 2017. 2017 was a year of unpredictability. We could not predict the various terrorist attacks, along with the hurricanes and the forest fires. I believe the 2018 will also be a year of unpredictability. There is no way of knowing what will come next. Positively, fashion and trends will continue to increase and change. Maybe there will be a fashion breakthrough. We will just have to wait and see. The world is constantly changing around us and there is no way of knowing what will follow next, like a story book. I guess we\u2019ll just have to keep turning those story book pages in order to see what will happen next, positive or negative._________You are what you wear. We can express a lot about our personality through our sense of style. Imagine a world where everyone wore the same thing, bought the same items and wore the same accessories. Fortunately, you can create and express your style in any way you wish through your feelings, thoughts and interest. Clothes say a lot about a person. Have fun with it!Personally, I think the way you dress has a huge impact on who you are and who you strive to be. But, your outfit does not always accurately define who you are. Some days I dress a little more edgy, some days I dress a little more preppy, but overall I dress how I am feeling that day.It\u2019s easy to forgot who are (and who you want to be) when you\u2019re going through school and ushered through life, but personal style helps me feel grounded. Sorting through vintage and thrift shops for hours on free weekends can almost seem tedious, but finding the right piece \u2014 an old military coat or patterned silk blouse \u2014 or even the very, VERY wrong piece \u2014 a pair of leather pants with cowhide patches or tasmanian devil underwear \u2014 helps me rediscover a little part of myself I sometimes feel is lost. Lots of color and accessories, jewelry and patterns \u2014 they all help remind me that I\u2019m me and I\u2019m alive and there\u2019s nothing greater than that. Cutting my hair in a split-second decision makes me feel in control and makes any other quick choice a lot easier to handle. Leather jackets and bright pink combat boots help me feel whole and are a celebration of life and of love and are, more than anything, a reminder that I am stronger than I may seem, and certainly stronger than I feel.Each day when I come into class, at least one classmate says \u201cooh she\u2019s got a different look today!\u201d I love changing up the clothes I wear and keeping my peers on their toes guessing what I\u2019ll wear next. There\u2019s really no way to describe my style. I take inspiration from all types of styles, grungy, preppy, chic, couture and more. I usually shy away from regular clothes you find at a mall and always find my key unique pieces at thrift stores. To get the real feel of vintage clothing, I even shop around in my grandmas closet! I would say my style reveals my personality, it shows I\u2019m always open to new things and I\u2019m unpredictable. I really only started to dress the way I do now about two years ago. What stopped me from really expressing myself in my outfits before was my fear for what others may think of me. I\u2019m glad I learned to let that go and just be me.If someone who is my moms age were to look at my overall style of clothing, they would probably say \u201cthat\u2019s something I would have worn when I was a kid\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say I dress in parachute pants and backwards caps, but I would say I dress differently from the modern t-shirts and jeans trends. I think my clothing choices say that I\u2019m unpredictable, I tend to wear things that are completely different from what I\u2019ve worn the day before. Although I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m the most original person on the planet, I know it\u2019s not true. The clothes I wear may be different, I might not wear any makeup at all and my hair may be shorter than the normal girl\u2019s hair, but I still take inspiration from those I\u2019d love to be one day. The types of girls who can wear absolutely anything on the market and constantly look amazing are the girls I\u2019d love to become. It takes time to fully understand who you are, personal style is a huge part of that. I would say I\u2019m experimenting with my style any way I can, even though I could completely change my mind tomorrow. It\u2019s a journey I\u2019m glad to take._________The most interesting city in the United States, in my opinion, is Detroit, Michigan. In my lifetime, I have never witnessed a more disappointing city, with less impressive attractions. First off, the sports teams in Detroit are an overall disaster. The Detroit Tigers, Detroit\u2019s astounding MLB franchise, finished last in their division, behind even the 67-95 Chicago White Sox. Additionally, the Tigers have won only four championship titles in the history of the MLB, and the last time they won was in 1984. Furthermore, the Detroit Lions, Detroit\u2019s incredible NFL team, has not appeared in the playoffs for 26 years. Along with this outstanding drought, the Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl Championship game. For some odd reason, I am amused by Detroit\u2019s lack of success in sports. This is not an insult, but I am waiting for the day where I look up at the television and see the sports teams of Detroit dominating everything. Other than its sports teams, Detroit is also plagued by abandoned houses and failing properties. Mobile homes and trailer parks are widely popular in this city, and this reflects some famous people from this city, such as Eminem, who often speaks of the poor conditions in this city. Despite its many downsides, Detroit does have rich history in music, and it has many museums and such that are fascinating and fun to explore. I find Detroit interesting because it is so abstract and different from every other city in this country.When I was about 8 years old, I moved from Maine to Pennsylvania. This was a HUGE change. Although, my all-time favorite place to go is Puerto Rico. I absolutely love Puerto Rico. When my dad asked me to go on this trip with me, I was hesitant at first. I am so glad that I went, though. I associate my favorite place, Puerto Rico, with the beach and sunshine because at that point in my life, I was very sad and I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone or do anything. When I dream about going somewhere, I dream of going to Australia because it is so different than the United States. It is on the opposite side of the world! I believe that everyone should be able to go to the place that makes them smile.I have grown up in a relatively small city in the south and lived there my entire life so far. I traveled to Washington D.C. when I was 12 years old, and ever since I knew that I wanted to live out my adult life there. Unlike Ms. Gerwig, I don\u2019t associate a person/people with the city, in fact, I\u2019ve always seen it as a symbol of my independence and freedom from the people in my small town. The reason I love D.C. is the rich culture in the city. Coming from a family of Italian immigrants, I have always been curious about other countries. My dream is to live in a nice apartment in D.C. and work at one of the foreign embassies. There isn\u2019t much diversity in my hometown as D.C., which is why I hope to move there eventually.Much like Ms. Gerwig, I have grown up in a small, suburban town. I too love New York, with its constant energy and amazing collection of people. However, not just New York is enticing to me. Of all of the places I\u2019ve been lucky enough to travel to, cities have always been my favorite part. I\u2019ve always loved going into Boston, even though it\u2019s just a short distance from my hometown. Philadelphia, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Prague, Dublin, and Barcelona have been where some of my favorite memories were made. Wherever I go, cities all seem to have an electricity from being filled with all different kinds of people. In a city, it seems that there is always something to do, always something happening, always new and interesting people who are different from each other. No matter where I end up in life, I want to be in the heart of this energy and life. I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s one city in particular that I know I\u2019ll be drawn to, but as long as I\u2019m in the midst of this excitement I think I will be very happy.The city that most captures my imagination is Boston, my home state\u2019s capital. I might want to live there one day when I am in my 20s. Boston has a special place in my heart for its millennial spirit and innovation. Boston is not too crowded, but when there are small concerts or protest rallies, the people of Boston come together to enjoy life. Friends stroll along the city sidewalks, laughing, while strangers politely greet each other. I love the tall buildings that soar above the city, surrounded by beautiful bodies of water like the Charles River. People can walk and bike in the welcoming atmosphere of Boston. What I love most about Boston is its culture and diversity. There are so many museums to explore and admire. My favorite painting is \u201cthe Dos Mujeres\u201d by Frida Kahlo in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. At night time, the city hums with jazz music by the park and chattering by the movie theater. I like visiting Boston, but one day, I would love to be a part of the city._________What caused the sudden outbreak of popularity for this simple game? Having the application myself, I have an inside opinion on why and how it has risen in popularity. Competition. The simple game brings upon a rather Americanized view on competition and the connotations that go along with winning and losing. Just the word \u2018loser\u2019 has extreme negative connotations as it implies that someone is less than others when a majority of people would rather be in the position of power that goes along with winning. Although this game is based off of facts that many people just simply would not know, it brings out the competitive and rather neanderthal ways of many people. Playing just one game of HQ, you would be able to discover many things about the human psyche and how detrimental a lose or a simple wrong answer can be to someone.Just yesterday morning, I got in my cousin\u2019s car at school and he told us about this addicting game, HQ. I had heard of it before, but I was nervous to download it. When my brother and I got home, we both downloaded the game and were waiting for the new game to start at 9. The prize for this game was $2000. As soon as the clock hit 9, we both joined.I think the appeal of the games lies in the fact that it is challenging and there is a chance for a cash prize. Trivia has always been popular, I remember when everyone was hyped over Trivia Crack. HQ is challenging, engaging, and just a fun experience overall. The hosts make (cringey) jokes which creates a bond with the players. Everyone loves Scott, the questions vary, and as it mentions in the article, the \u201cDarwinian aspect\u201d of the game, watching thousands of people get eliminated, boosts your ego for the time being and makes you feel superior. It\u2019s a very highly addicting game and I understand why after playing it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Love of Malt Shop Novels", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChildren\u2019s BooksIn seventh-grade English class we were required to keep lists of the books we read for pleasure, with brief reviews \u2014 an adjective or two \u2014 then post them on a wall by the door. I was a bookworm, and eager to please. I quickly notched \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d (\u201cgreat\u201d), \u201cJane Eyre\u201d (\u201cso good\u201d), and \u201cWild December,\u201d a fictionalized account of the Bront\u00ebs (\u201creally interesting\u201d).Then I paused. I was about to add my favorite of the bunch: \u201cA Date for Diane,\u201d by Betty Cavanna. Could I admit publicly that I adored it? I could not. \u201cDumb!\u201d I wrote. My first literary lie.The book and its sequels, \u201cDiane\u2019s New Love\u201d and \u201cToujours Diane,\u201d were known, I would later learn, as malt shop novels. Written from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, they tracked a teenage protagonist as she navigated the obstacle course of first love. (And if part of a series, second love.)The authors had their specialties. Cavanna tended to write about not-quite-pretty girls with artistic ambitions or interests like aviation or competitive skiing. Anne Emery sometimes worked that same earnest side of the street, notably in her four-novel account of Dinny Gordon, a budding classicist. Lenora Mattingly Weber was known for a 14-book cycle about a close-knit Irish Catholic family, the Malones, with a focus on its youngest member, Beany.Occasionally, the books tackled substantive matters: economic inequality, alcoholism, racism and anti-Semitism. More often \u2014 and here I\u2019m thinking of Rosamund du Jardin \u2014 the protagonists had to cope only with what they viewed as an unreasonable number of freckles and an unreasonable curfew.\u201cThese novels captured the culture of a particular time in postwar America,\u201d said Richard Robinson, the chief executive of Scholastic, whose book clubs had titles from the Cavanna, du Jardin and Emery oeuvres. \u201cThey projected an optimistic view of life, of how you fit in, how you got along with your peers and related to boys.\u201dSiblings may have hogged the bathroom or the telephone, parents may have refused to negotiate when it came to allowances, dates on school nights and a new dress for the prom, but families in these books were enviably high-functioning.I became an 11-year-old whiz on the topic of chiffon scarves, peplums, pancake makeup and the dating rituals of bobby-sox wearers (granted, a strange preoccupation in the late 1960s). They went to double features and sock hops, then climbed into somebody\u2019s jalopy to meet the gang for a milk shake at Joe\u2019s Grill or McKnight\u2019s Drugstore. I was transfixed and I was insatiable. While my mother toured J. L. Hudson, a Detroit department store, I skittered over to a rack of paperbacks, most with a pastel image of a girl in a skirt on the cover and a square of plaid on the spine.It\u2019s true that the titles ran together. There was \u201cFifteen,\u201d by the inimitable Beverly Cleary; \u201cGoing on Sixteen,\u201d by Cavanna; \u201cSweet Sixteen,\u201d by Emery; and \u201cPractically Seventeen,\u201d by Rosamond du Jardin.It is also true that the plots were formulaic, and that the authors, while concerned with their characters\u2019 moral development, weren\u2019t much for psychological complexity.But as a bespectacled preadolescent with early onset acne, I found these books an endless source of reassurance and hope. You could be plain and scholarly, like Dinny Gordon, and still have boys eager to go out with you. You could be self-doubting like Jane Purdy, the protagonist of \u201cFifteen,\u201d and, nevertheless, end up wearing the ID bracelet of cute green-eyed Stan.My recall of plot details (Stan worked for a dog food delivery service; on an early date with Jane they went to a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco) is encyclopedic. My recall of character names (Beany Malone\u2019s siblings were Johnny, Mary Fred and Elizabeth) is embarrassing. I wish I could remember \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d with similar clarity.I was 21 when my parents sold the family house, and I tossed Beany and Dinny, Tobey and Midge. Years later, feeling slightly wistful, I began to regret my decision. But the books, long out of print, were going for $100 or more.I recently found a kindred spirit in Joy Canfield, a psychologist and academic publisher. In the late 1990s, she began searching for the Beany Malone series, and was poleaxed by the high prices. It occurred to her that perhaps she wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted to revisit the Ragged Robin drive-in.Playing on that hunch, Canfield began contacting the authors\u2019 families and executors for permission to re-issue the novels with the original cover art.She founded Image Cascade in 1999, republishing 14 paperback titles that first year. By 2009 there were 160. With sales of several thousand copies a year, Canfield, 56, hopes to continue expanding the roster. \u201cI love these books, I absolutely love them,\u201d she said.Her buyers? \u201cThere is definitely a group of moms and grandmas who are buying the books for their daughters and granddaughters,\u201d Canfield said, \u201cbut the majority of our customers are middle-aged women who read the books in their youth and are buying copies so they can reread them.\u201dThey include Jennifer Travis, who read \u201cFifteen\u201d and \u201cSister of the Bride\u201d as a teenager. A few years ago, after a hunt in a used-book store yielded a copy of \u201cSenior Year,\u201d one of five novels about the sisters Jean and Sally Burnaby by Emery, she ordered the rest of the series from Image Cascade.\u201cCurrent teen fiction is far more complicated and nuanced,\u201d said Travis, 50, who lives in Pittsfield, Mass., and is the managing editor of a publishing company. \u201cThese books are like fairy tales.

{"Headline": "Postcard People", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "Like postcards, no two members of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City are quite the same.Supported byMarilyn Stern held out a black-and-white postcard of a baby panda from 1948.\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that it says, \u2018Most valuable captive animal,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Stern, one of a few dozen postcard collectors who had gathered on a recent Sunday at the Watson Hotel in Midtown.\u201cI have a category that almost no one collects, which is superlatives\u2014 \u2018the biggest,\u2019 \u2018the smallest,\u2019 \u2018the newest,\u2019 \u2018the oldest,\u2019 \u2018the most expensive,\u2019 \u2018the most beautiful,\u2019 et cetera,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a photographer and graphic artist. She admired the panda, which looked out from a crib.\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute?\u201dAnd postcards.The world may have largely abandoned postcard writing, but deltiology \u2014 or postcard collecting \u2014 persists.Like the members themselves, no two postcard collections are alike. A founder of the club, Joe Nardone, collected postcards of Main Street in different towns and cities around the United States. Current members specialize in postcards of Eskimos; Broadway theaters; kilts; old Baku, Azerbaijan. The list goes on.Deltiologists like to say, \u201cIf it exists, it\u2019s on a postcard,\u201d and indeed, it seems that each of the collectors in the club, like subjects in a Werner Herzog film, has been tasked with tending over a small corner of the universe.\u201cA lot of the things don\u2019t exist anymore, so they\u2019re an important historical record,\u201d said Rod Kennedy, the president of the club. \u201cWe are sort of the custodians.\u201d\u201cThere are people who only collect World War I submarines,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI met another guy who collected harps and orchestras playing harps. He traveled hundreds of miles, looking for these harps. Maybe once every two years he got lucky.\u201dAs a group, Mr. Kennedy said, the club\u2019s current members have rescued at least a few million postcards \u2014 from junk stores, flea markets, estate sales and basements \u2014 many thousands of which have been donated to museums.That Sunday, some of them had gathered in a conference room tucked at the back of the Watson Hotel for their monthly meeting. Folding tables had been set up and were covered in shoeboxes, each filled with postcards, all sorted by topic.\u201cClocks,\u201d \u201cCoat of Arms,\u201d read the labels on one box. \u201cDisney,\u201d \u201cErotica,\u201d \u201cEthnic Customs,\u201d \u201cExaggeration/Fantasy,\u201d \u201cFairs and Expos,\u201d \u201cFamilies,\u201d \u201cFire Fighting,\u201d \u201cFlags.\u201dThe postcards, which had been priced in pencil and slipped into plastic sleeves, ranged from less than $1 to more than $100.George Gibbs, a dealer, had brought a selection of the 20,000 to 30,000 cards he takes to the club\u2019s biannual shows. He pulled out some \u201creal photo postcards\u201d \u2014 these were actual photos printed on card stock, not lithographic or offset prints, the kind of postcard that could easily fetch $100, said Mr. Gibbs.At one time, postcards were also printed by governments and political groups, who used them to spread propaganda and push social agendas. He pulled out a postcard, warning that it was graphic. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a soldier with World War I injuries,\u201d he said, turning over the card to reveal a man whose face been severely disfigured; his flesh had been crudely sewn together in folds around the eyes and teeth. \u201cIt was likely printed in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would make series of cards to illustrate the horrors of war, so it would never be repeated.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little world in here,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201c You can go down the rabbit hole.\u201dAcross the room, another dealer, Ira Rubin, showed a collector a stack of Halloween cards. \u201cHalloween is very, very rare,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the most popular of all the holidays, so it is the most sought-after.\u201d While the panda card cost less than $5, a vintage linen Halloween card could go for $20 or more.Hy Mariampolski, a dealer whose wares covered several tables, said the messages written on cards were amusing but often of little interest to collectors. Postcards were the text messages and emails of their day; they were how people invited one another to dinner and to tea, and said, \u201cThank you for a lovely time.\u201d Like emails and texts, they changed how people wrote, but on the whole, they were pretty boring.\u201cHave not much time so will write later, thank you for the postcard, it was a dandy,\u201d read the message on a card featuring a pair of women\u2019s shoes, from 1909.There were exceptions. Mr. Mariampolski pulled out a postcard of a comely French nurse in aquarelle, which, according to the sender\u2019s message, had been plucked \u201cfrom the coat of a dead Austrian.\u201dMr. Mariampolski added: \u201cI started as a collector, but like all kinds of junkies, you eventually have to become a dealer to support your habit.\u201d He said he found postcards in various places. There were flea markets abroad \u2014 \u201cOne of the best is in Buenos Aires,\u201d he said\u2014 an annual antique fair in Brimfield, Massachusetts. And some were found close to home. \u201cI live out here in the Hamptons. It\u2019s one of those places: \u2018God\u2019s waiting room,\u2019 as they say. There are all kinds of articles and collections that come up when people pass away.\u201dThe postcard era began around 1900, when the printing of commercial postcards took off around the United States and Europe, and peaked in the first decades of the century. The golden era is thought to have ended around World War I, when the supply of German postcards, considered by many to be the best in the world, was cut off.Major shifts followed: White border postcards were introduced, to save expensive ink; linen postcards and photochrome color postcards, or \u201cchromes,\u201d came along around the 1940s.In other words, Instagram before the Internet.But postcards weren\u2019t documentary in the strict sense of the term. Before photochrome cards, artists created color postcards from black and white photographs and often embellished them with details like clouds or trees that weren\u2019t there, Mr. Kennedy said. They could take a single photograph and make two postcards from it \u2014 say, \u201cLondon by Day\u201d and \u201cLondon by Night.\u201dThey could also create what are known as \u201cexaggerations.\u201d Exaggeration cards at the hotel that day featured, for example, giant apples rolling through an otherwise realistic scene, and an enormous fish rising from the water and tipping a fisherman\u2019s boat (\u201cA fight with a mad pickrel,\u201d read the handwritten caption, from 1911).While collectors browsed in the conference room, a few women came in carrying thick, brown photo albums, which eventually formed a leaning tower in one corner. Sandra Gottlin was dropping off the last of her father Kurt Gorwitz\u2019s collection, which she had donated to the club. \u201cHe was a Holocaust refugee from Austria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe collected 22,000 cards. He loved Austria. He loved Canada. He loved National Parks.\u201dShe went on, her eyes filling with tears: \u201cHe used to sit on the floor. He would put them in the albums and on some of them he would write where they were from.\u201d She opened an album with a sticky, ripping sound, and revealed a page of postcards of museum dioramas of Native American life.You don\u2019t have to talk to a postcard collector long before the conversation turns existential. Postcard collecting, even if it was given a burst of life by the Internet and the rise of online marketplaces such as eBay, is not exactly a youthful pursuit.\u201cCan we have silence please?\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, standing in the center of the room at the Watson and calling the group to order for the meeting. He shuffled some papers and cleared his throat. \u201cIt was a quiet year, and we continued to do well.\u201d Then he read the names of members who had died.Those present murmured in sympathy. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy. \u201cWe need to get new members. We need to get younger members.\u201dUnless there is a new generation of postcard collectors, club members say, there will be no one to save postcards from the recycling plant.\u201cPostcards are like a time machine into the past,\u201d said Ms. Stern, the collector of superlatives. \u201cWhether it\u2019s fashion, technology or race relations, you can go visit it in the past.\u201dShe added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bobby Darin Who? Jonathan Groff Gets It Now", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen he was first asked if he\u2019d want to play Bobby Darin in an upcoming production in the long-running \u201cLyrics & Lyricists\u201d series at the 92nd Street Y, Jonathan Groff wasn\u2019t sure how to respond.But the morning after Ted Chapin, the new \u201cLyrics & Lyricists\u201d producer, mentioned Darin\u2019s name to him over a post-theater dinner, Mr. Groff was hooked.If Darin\u2019s singing could seem slicker and less distinctive than that of his more celebrated contemporaries, his range was indeed expansive, encompassing rock (\u201cSplish Splash\u201d), lush and jazzy pop (\u201cDream Lover,\u201d \u201cBeyond The Sea\u201d) and show tunes and songbook staples (\u201cMack the Knife,\u201d most famously).He also ventured into film acting, founded a record label and music publishing company, and, as his political awareness grew, crafted \u201cSimple Song of Freedom,\u201d a pacifist anthem for the Vietnam era.\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary trajectory for a guy who was told he\u2019d be dead by the age of 15,\u201d said Mr. Timbers.\u201cAs with so many great performers,\u201d said Mr. Einhorn, \u201cthere was clearly something about being in the room with him, this great kinetic energy. That\u2019s often where you discovered what he could really bring to the music.\u201dWhile in Australia in 2016, Mr. Chapin caught the jukebox outing \u201cDream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical\u201d and began to think that Darin\u2019s work might an attractive subject for the \u201cLyrics\u201d series. \u201cThere was so much about his story I didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said.Though \u201cLyrics\u201d shows have focused more on writers known for their work in theater \u2014 the new season will include tributes to Irving Berlin, Frank Loesser and Lynn Ahrens \u2014 Mr. Chapin said he thought, \u201cWell, Bobby Darin did write his own songs, so there is that aspect to it.\u201dAfter getting the blessing of the \u201cDream Lover\u201d producers (who hold worldwide rights to Darin\u2019s story, via his estate), Mr. Chapin assembled his team and hunkered down. Getting rights to the songs Darin had written, of which there are 160 titles, proved tougher than expected: \u201cI could get my hands on only 25 of them. One piece I actually bought on eBay for $35.\u201dLike previous installments of the \u201cLyrics\u201d series, \u201cThe Bobby Darin Story\u201d will not be a book musical. (Nor are the creators banking on a fuller production.) But there will be something of a narrative line, written by Mr. Chapin, as well as other performers joining Mr. Groff to tell the story of Darin\u2019s roller coaster life, which included a \u201cmidlife meltdown,\u201d in Mr. Chapin\u2019s words, precipitated by the late-in-life discovery that the woman he thought was his older sister was actually his mother.\u201cThere aren\u2019t characters speaking dialogue, having conversations on stage,\u201d Mr. Timbers said. \u201cIt will show emotion through music, and narration. That section toward the end of Darin\u2019s life, this sort of downward spiral, could have been tricky in musical theater, where it can become less exhilarating when you don\u2019t have a protagonist making choices, taking positive action. But Ted has been able to focus on the coolest, juiciest stuff about Bobby Darin.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s this quote that basically says that after all the things Bobby Darin did, in the end, he felt most powerful and most alive and most himself performing in a nightclub setting,\u201d Mr. Groff said.Mr. Timbers added: \u201cHe lived a gritty, driven life. He hurt people along the way and people hurt him.\u201cIt would be easy to do a hagiography, a scrubbed-clean look at the meteoric rise of a pop sensation who bottoms out in midcareer and then has a resurgence. But I think this will be more ornery and strange and idiosyncratic. As befits Bobby Darin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watch Brands Confront a Risky Business: The Secondhand Market", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWatches\u201cThe crown was not original, the dial was not original, the case was not original and the glass was not even glass but a piece of Plexi glued to it,\u201d Mr. B\u00fcsser recalled. \u201cBuying a pre-owned or vintage timepiece is extremely risky business. Most brands have turned their backs on the market and left it in the hands of a lot of individuals who are not to be trusted. It\u2019s time to reclaim it.\u201dCome summer, the brand will do just that, when its website begins selling pre-owned MB&F timepieces offered mostly by customers. Mr. B\u00fcsser emphasized that the models will be limited editions no longer available at retail \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want my retailers to think I\u2019m competing with them.\u201dAs innocuous as his announcement may sound, it\u2019s sure to prompt some soul-searching among watch executives this week at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva. Unlike car manufacturers, which maintain networks of \u201ccertified pre-owned\u201d dealers, watchmakers have long neglected the secondhand market, fearing both its strategic and logistical challenges.Spurred by growing competition from a new, more trusted breed of online retailer, however, the Swiss houses have reached an inflection point in their relationship with used timepieces: regulate their distribution and sale or lose out to third-party dealers.He cited the example of someone buying a 20-year-old watch by Vacheron Constantin or Patek Philippe \u201cfrom the internet.\u201d\u201cThe brands don\u2019t stand behind it because it hasn\u2019t gone through their workshops, but they can\u2019t be happy about it,\u201d Mr. Bacs said. \u201cEvery watch that doesn\u2019t satisfy the owner doesn\u2019t reflect well on their brand.\u201dMore important, industry experts say that every time a consumer sells or trades a fine watch \u2014 a phenomenon that happens with increasing regularity as a result of the information and price transparency now available online \u2014 the wearer\u2019s next watch purchase is more likely to benefit the dealer that facilitated the transaction rather than the brand that manufactured the timepiece.\u201cIf you can create a certified secondary market then it\u2019s going to change a lot of the dynamic in the gray market,\u201d said Edouard Meylan, chief executive of the boutique Swiss brand H. Moser & Cie, which plans to start selling certified pre-owned models on its website this year. \u201cOur responsibility is to ensure the long-term value of the products we sell.\u201d\u201cThe secondhand market will be the next move,\u201d he said, even as he acknowledged that the interest in pre-owned timepieces is still largely an American phenomenon. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent sure we will do it. But I cannot tell you when.\u201dThe lack of urgency owes something to the fact that the secondhand market appears to be working reasonably well without the brands\u2019 explicit involvement. Thanks to the proliferation of trustworthy websites specializing in pre-owned merchandise \u2014 including \u201cnever worn\u201d models that come directly from brands\u2019 overstock \u2014 people already have outlets to buy and sell used timepieces.Equipped with sophisticated pricing algorithms and teams of in-house watchmakers, these e-tailers say it is only a matter of time before brands recognize the sites as allies in the pre-owned watch business.With the help of Andrew Block, a former Tourneau executive who was named president of TrueFacet in June, Mr. Kamdar is working hard to convince Swiss brands that the secondary market will not cannibalize new watch sales. Instead, he said, it will grow their brands\u2019 perceived value, especially among recycling-obsessed millennials.\u201cThe European brands don\u2019t completely get the U.S. consumer,\u201d Mr. Kamdar said. \u201cThey have been dependent on offline retail, and offline retail is shutting down at a great pace. The younger generation who has money \u2014 they\u2019re not looking to shop the same way their grandparents did. They\u2019re looking to buy pre-owned, not new.\u201dAlthough the trial was a success, Mr. English said, it was just a test as the obstacles to a permanent secondhand business are considerable. \u201cEveryone is walking on eggshells because they don\u2019t want to upset their retail chain,\u201d he said.An even thornier issue, especially for brands guilty of overproducing inventory, is resolving their watches\u2019 poor performance in secondary channels.As Mr. Bacs said, \u201cThe absolute bitter truth is that some watches are selling above retail and some are selling at a fraction of retail \u2014 maybe 20 percent of the retail price \u2014 after five years. No manufacturer wants to tell that to its owner.\u201cThe fact that for 20 years we have all talked about it and nobody has yet found a solution means it\u2019s tricky,\u201d he said of the secondary market. \u201cIf a brand gets it right in today\u2019s market, meaning they don\u2019t lose money, they have revolutionized the landscape.\u201dAdvertisement"}
