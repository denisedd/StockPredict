{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Bumpy Day: From Wage Increase to Store Closings", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, waded into the bumpy waters of partisan politics on Thursday, announcing that it will use some of its savings under the new tax bill to provide wage increases, bonuses and expanded benefits to its hourly workers.The giant retailer, which faces stiff competition for qualified workers in a tight labor market and pressure from unions to increase wages, said it would raise its minimum starting wage to $11 an hour, from $9. It will also expand maternity and family leave benefits, and give bonuses of up to $1,000 to eligible employees.By tying its pay increases to the tax break it expects to receive, as other large companies have done in recent weeks, Walmart provided support for claims by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress that the new tax law will benefit not just the wealthy but also working-class Americans.\u201cThis law is helping improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a tweet on Thursday, citing Walmart\u2019s actions.But within hours, Walmart had undercut its triumphal message when news leaked that it was closing 63 of its Sam\u2019s Club stores. Sam\u2019s Club, a retail chain offering memberships, was soon trending on Twitter, and labor groups and Senate Democrats seized on the news to question Walmart\u2019s motives and criticize the tax bill as failing to protect low-wage workers.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which hopes to represent Walmart\u2019s nonunionized work force, called the wage increase a \u201cpublic relations stunt\u201d meant to distract from the closings.With more than one million hourly workers in the United States, Walmart is a bellwether for compensation in low-wage industry. By citing the new tax plan as an impetus for better wages and benefits, the retailer was bound to become a lightning rod in a fiercely ideological debate.\u201cThey snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cWalmart made a smart move in increasing wages and investing in human capital. Where they screwed up was politicizing it.\u201dSince President Trump signed the tax law last month, a number of large companies \u2014 including AT&T, Southwest Airlines and Wells Fargo \u2014 have said they were using the savings to help their employees. On Thursday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced that it would give a $2,000 bonus to 60,000 hourly and salaried employees.\u201cIt is only proper that our employees share in the savings generated by tax reform,\u201d Sergio Marchionne, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Walmart, which is the country\u2019s single largest corporate taxpayer, said in a statement Thursday that it was still determining how much it would save as a result of the new law.Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit research group, said it was difficult to forecast precisely how much Walmart would save. But based on the company\u2019s average annual United States earnings over the past five years, he said, savings from the cut in the corporate tax rate alone could be roughly $2.2 billion a year, or 40 percent. He said the figure could be higher or lower depending on tax breaks the company might be losing, or new advantages in the treatment of capital investments and other provisions.Walmart said the wage increases and bonuses would cost the company roughly $700 million.\u201cTax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a statement.Still, many economists are skeptical that the tax cut will have a meaningful impact on wages. In an economic research memo released on Thursday, Goldman Sachs wrote that \u201cwe expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on\u201d average hourly earnings.Goldman predicted that, to the extent that the tax bill would drive up pay, it would do so over time, partly by stimulating the economy and forcing employers to pay more as they competed for workers.Walmart started the day with a celebratory message, with its early-morning announcement about wage and benefit enhancements. Even some critics were impressed with some of Walmart\u2019s changes \u2014 particularly in expanding maternity and parental leave.Full-time hourly employees will receive 10 weeks of maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Those workers previously received up to eight weeks of maternity leave at half-pay, and were not entitled to parental leave.The expanded leave benefits are particularly significant, putting shelf-stockers and cashiers on the same footing as many white-collar, college-educated workers across corporate America.Our Walmart, a labor group, said in a statement that action on wage increases and maternity leave was a \u201csubstantial step, but still falls short of what all Walmart employees need to be able to provide for our families.\u201d Target, a competitor, raised its starting wage to $11 an hour last fall.In addition to competing for workers, Walmart is trying to improve customer service in its roughly 4,700 stores around the United States, some of which have been criticized for being untidy in the past.Analysts said the higher wages could also help Walmart burnish its public image as it battled Amazon for online sales.\u201cAmazon has been viewed as a good citizen,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. \u201cWalmart has been viewed as a bad citizen who is getting better.\u201dBy Thursday afternoon, though, Walmart was dealing with a backlash over the closing of about 10 percent of its Sam\u2019s Club stores. The retailer said it had planned to inform its thousands of employees first and then announce it. But customers showed up at stores only to find them closed and began posting the news on social media.There were also reports that workers showed up for work and were informed that their stores were closed.Walmart said it was planning to close about 50 Sam\u2019s Club stores across the country and retrofit about a dozen others into e-commerce fulfillment centers. It was unclear how many workers will lose their jobs, because the company said it was trying to find the displaced employees jobs at other Sam\u2019s Club stores.\u201cThere is no easy way to communicate to a group of people that their facility is closing,\u201d John Furner, president and chief executive of Sam\u2019s Club, said in an interview on Thursday evening.Store closings have become a regular occurrence as the retail industry adjusts to shifts in consumer behavior and more people shop online. But because the closings were occurring on the day of the tax cut announcement, they became fodder for critics.\u201cThey should have been taking a victory lap tonight,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor, \u201cand instead they are back on their heels.\u201dNoam Scheiber and Patricia Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Need to Do Because of Flaws in Computer Chips", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the world\u2019s largest tech companies have been working on fixes for these problems. But the researchers who discovered the flaws said one of them, Spectre, is not completely fixable. \u201cIt is a fundamental flaw in the way processors have been built over the last decades,\u201d said Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered these flaws.Here is a guide to what you need to know and what you should do.Both are issues with the way computer chips are designed.Meltdown affects most processors made by Intel, the company that supplies the chips for a majority of PCs and more than 90 percent of computer servers.Spectre is far more difficult for hackers to exploit. But it is even more pervasive, affecting Intel chips, microprocessors from the longtime Intel rival AMD and the many chips that use designs from the British company ARM. Your smartphone most likely contains an ARM chip.Both flaws provide hackers with a way of stealing data, including passwords and other sensitive information. If hackers manage to get software running on one of these chips, they can grab data from other software running on the same machine.This is a particular issue on cloud computing services.Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, these are services where any business or individual can rent access to computing power over the internet. On a cloud service, each server is typically shared by many different customers. By exploiting the Meltdown flaw, a hacker can just load some software onto a cloud service and then grab data from anyone else who has loaded software onto the same server.Phones and PCs are more difficult targets. Before they can exploit the chip flaws, hackers must find a way of getting their software onto your device. They could fool you into downloading an app from a smartphone app store. Or they could trick you into visiting a website that moves code onto your machine.The onus is now on consumers and businesses to install the fix on their machines.Keep your software up-to-date. That includes your operating system and apps like your web browser and antivirus software. Microsoft, Mozilla and Google have already released patches for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome to help address the problem.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs, and they carry malware.\u201dYour operating system and apps typically have a button you can click to check for software updates. For example, in Google\u2019s Chrome browser on a computer, you can click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and click Update Google Chrome. To update Windows, click the Start button and click through these buttons: Settings, Update & security, Windows Update and Check for updates. To update the Mac system, open the App Store app and check the Updates tab for the latest software.Amazon, Google and Microsoft said that they had already patched most of the of servers that underpin their cloud computing services, and that largely addresses the problem. But Amazon and Google also said customers might need to make additional changes.To share computing power with customers, cloud services offer \u201cvirtual machines.\u201d These are computers that exist only in digital form. Customers use these virtual machines to run their own software. After Amazon, Google and Microsoft update their machines, customers may have to update the operating systems running on their own virtual machines to guard against some exploits.No. The researchers who discovered Meltdown said that patching systems would slow them down by as much as 30 percent in certain situations. That could be a problem for big cloud systems.Independent software developers also ran tests on a patched version of Linux, the open-source operating system that now drives more than 30 percent of the world\u2019s servers, and saw similar slowdowns.\u201cThere are many cases where the performance impact is zero,\u201d said Andres Frome, a software developer who has tested the new code. \u201cBut if you are running something like a payment system, where a lot of small changes are made to data, it looks like there will be a significant performance impact.\u201dConsumers are less likely to be affected, and Mr. Kocher said slowdowns could dissipate over time as companies refined their patches.According to the researchers who discovered these flaws, including security experts at Google, the memory chip maker Rambus and various academic institutions, Spectre can\u2019t be completely fixed. But patches can solve the problems in some situations. Intel and Microsoft and others said the same.No, according to the researchers. But Spectre is much more difficult than Meltdown for hackers to exploit.Similar to Meltdown, Spectre can steal information from one application and share it with another. For example, an app you download from the web could steal information like passwords from other software on a computer.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert that said the only solution to the threats posed by Meltdown and Spectre would be a full replacement of the chips. But that does not seem feasible, given how many machines are involved. \u201cSpectre is going to be with us a lot longer,\u201d Mr. Kocher said.An Intel vice president, Donald Parker, is adamant that the company\u2019s chips will not need to be replaced. He said that with software patches and \u201cfirmware updates\u201d \u2014 a way of updating code on the chip itself \u2014 Intel and other companies could \u201cmitigate the issues.\u201dNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Crown Prince and the New Saudi Economy", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s goal of replacing a corrupt feudal state in Saudi Arabia with a Western-orientated market economy is doomed to be elusive unless he stops acting like a despot and rules like a reformer.But his outreach to the private sector, on which his plan depends, has been stymied by a lack of capacity and institutional experience, and, increasingly, his hubris. His oppressive conduct is alienating the very sources he should be trying to attract.To revive investor confidence, Prince Mohammed should consider several safeguards. He should replace the family checks and balances he swept away with a due process and rule of law, which applies to royals and commoners alike. The corruption commission he unveiled on the eve of his purge should be a regulator, upholding international standards of corporate governance, not his personal star chamber skewing the rules for his cronies.Investors and neighbors crave predictability, stability and the confidence that comes with a sound regulatory system. All three are what made Dubai. Properly carried out, such a system would please bankers who might welcome the chance to retrieve debts or land from princes that act like robber barons.Prince Mohammed needs institutional heft. He cannot haul the kingdom out of its oil dependency and create a diverse economy alone. His teams of foreign management consultants lack a bureaucracy and a local base. Rather than alienate family elders with decades of experience raising international finance, he should harness their expertise.For now Prince Mohammed is offering more personal liberty and relief from the scowls of the religious police as compensation for the introduction of taxes. But as Abdullah, the previous king, recognized, more taxation \u2014 whether direct or indirect \u2014 will stoke demands for broader representation.Greater accountability should be welcome. It might also ensure that the sums the prince accrued from the purge go into the country\u2019s purse, not his personal account. And it would make for a more viable kingdom.Nicolas Pelham, a Middle East affairs correspondent for The Economist, is the author of \u201cHoly Lands: Reviving Pluralism in the Middle East.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As a vision of Islamic totalitarianism, it is blood-chilling. But it is also a masterly piece of writing.What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?I was rather fascinated to read in Tom Holland\u2019s book about Baiae, the Roman resort on the Gulf of Naples which was the Roman equivalent of the Hamptons or Malibu, complete with that combination of sexual libertinism and dietary epicureanism which I associate with certain members of today\u2019s American elite.What\u2019s the best book on economics? And the best work of economic history?The best book I\u2019ve read recently on economics was probably Ian Kumekawa\u2019s \u201cThe First Serious Optimist: A. C. Pigou and the Birth of Welfare Economics.\u201d Amongst recent economic history books I would have to pick Chris Miller\u2019s very insightful \u201cThe Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the USSR,\u201d which shows why the Russians could not achieve in the 1980s what the Chinese did achieve, namely (partial) escape from the pathologies of the planned economy. Of course, economists and economic historians these days are discouraged from writing books. Most of what I consume in these fields comes in the form of working papers and journal articles.What books do you think best captures your own political principles?I suppose it would have to be Edmund Burke\u2019s \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France.\u201d I wish I could force-feed \u2014 or perhaps force-read \u2014 it to every progressive who is convinced that her latest untested and hare-brained policy initiative will magically eliminate inequality, discrimination, climate change and all the rest, without any unintended consequences for individual liberty.Very similar, so books frequently cross the bedroom from one nightstand to the other. A good example was Hayek\u2019s \u201cThe Constitution of Liberty,\u201d her favorite work of political philosophy, which she urged me to read. I recently gave her Tom Holland\u2019s \u201cDynasty,\u201d the sequel to \u201cRubicon,\u201d and of course his \u201cIn the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire,\u201d which I am waiting my turn to read after her.Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America?I shared the widespread enthusiasm for J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d last year, but the must-read book for Trump\u2019s election and presidency remains Charles Murray\u2019s astonishingly prescient \u201cComing Apart.\u201d I wish the contemptible \u201cstudents\u201d who disrupted his lecture at Middlebury College earlier this year \u2014 not one of whom I\u2019ll bet had ever read a word of his \u2014 would read \u201cComing Apart\u201d and then look in the mirror and realize: \u201cOh God, I\u2019m a member of that loathsome coastal cognitive elite that is completely out of touch with middle America.\u201dWhich historians and biographers do you most admire?Amongst those currently writing, Simon Schama stands out as the Dickens of modern historiography: bewilderingly erudite and prolific, passionate in his enthusiasms and armed with the complete contents of the thesaurus. We agree to disagree about politics. I have also hugely admired Anne Applebaum for her trilogy on the Gulag, the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe (\u201cIron Curtain\u201d) and, most recently, the Ukrainian famine (\u201cRed Famine\u201d). Walter Isaacson has established himself as the great American biographer of our time. \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u201d is his best book, I think. Whereas the earlier books were pure journalism, he is now showing academic scholars how to write accessibly about subtle and even recondite subject matter. I read quite a number of biographies while researching \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d My favorite was probably Michael Ignatieff\u2019s on Isaiah Berlin, which led me into the vast, delightful rabbit warren of Berlin\u2019s correspondence.And which novelists do you especially enjoy reading?Everyone has at least one vice. Mine is reading (and re-reading) 19th-century novels. It\u2019s hard to pick just a couple of favorites but I unreservedly adore Wilkie Collins (e.g., \u201cThe Moonstone\u201d) and Theodor Fontane (\u201cDer Stechlin\u201d).Which genres do you avoid?Historical fiction, especially of recent vintage. The brain simply cannot compartmentalize. I noticed while writing \u201cThe Pity of War\u201d that I was subconsciously drawing on Pat Barker\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost Road\u201d novels as if they were the real thing. Since then I\u2019ve abstained completely. In any case, I would much rather read an authentic contemporary diary than a work of historical fiction. A good example is the diary of Ivan Maisky, the long-serving Soviet ambassador in London. Gabriel Gorodetsky\u2019s edition \u2014 abridged and unabridged \u2014 is a work for the ages.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?I\u2019ve tried electronic but I can\u2019t read on a screen for pleasure. It has to be the paper-and-ink book, preferably a robust paperback. From an early age, I\u2019ve liked to have five books on the go at a time \u2014 that was the maximum number one could borrow from the Ayr Public Library. As for when I read, always at night. In the morning, there are too many distractions.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?I own books by a number of people who have insulted me in print, but I don\u2019t think it is all that surprising that I do research before taking vengeance.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I read a lot and quite systematically. Once I had identified an author I liked, I read everything by that person the library possessed. I vividly recall devouring the complete works of Arthur Conan Doyle and P. G. Wodehouse in this way. I have tried (and continue to try) as a father to impart my love of reading to my children, so the books I loved as a boy \u2014 Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d for example, or Stevenson\u2019s \u201cTreasure Island\u201d \u2014 are books I have reread multiple times. The greatest works of literature benefit from being read aloud. A wonderful example are the \u201cJust William\u201d stories by Richmal Crompton, which deserve to be much better known in the United States. She was the Dorothy Parker of provincial England.If you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be? And the prime minister?I agree with you that it would be wonderful if both Mr. Trump and Mrs. May read one book. I don\u2019t much mind which one it is.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson and John Buchan. I\u2019d call it The Last Burns Supper.The first book I ever abandoned was Captain Marryat\u2019s \u201cThe Children of the New Forest,\u201d which came highly recommended but bored me rigid. I also struggled with \u201cSwallows and Amazons.\u201d At the time, I felt quite guilty about these sins of omission. As I grew older, however, I became more cavalier and now treat books with the contempt they mostly deserve. To give an example of a book I found overrated, Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d was both conceptually unsound and tediously executed.Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?I would discourage anyone from wasting their energies on what would be a very dull narrative.What do you plan to read next?The new biography of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. by Richard Aldous.

{"Headline": "From Naples to Tokyo, New Books in Translation", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistCesare Annunziata doesn\u2019t like people very much, doesn\u2019t get along with his two children, cheated on his wife before she died, has lots of regrets \u2014 and seems determined to gather a few more. \u201cI\u2019m old,\u201d he says (a little too frequently), \u201cand I do what I like.\u201d Uh oh, here comes another one of those colorful curmudgeons who drop pearls of senior wisdom on their way to a new lease on life. Cesare certainly fits the stereotype, but he\u2019s funny, interesting and grumpy enough to stay on the winning side of the formula. He lives alone in an apartment in Naples, and along with two equally elderly neighbors \u2014 a mad cat lady and a deaf, anxious octogenarian \u201cwho listens even if he can\u2019t hear\u201d \u2014 is drawn into the life of a new tenant who they suspect is being abused by her husband.Amid their mostly useless plotting and scheming to save her, Cesare takes stock of his own existence (denying, of course, that he would ever do such a thing) \u2014 and stumbles toward a kind of peace with his family, his friends and his dubious life choices. \u201cIf I were to land on the planet another 10 times, I\u2019d still travel the same journey and crash into the same rocks along the way,\u201d he insists. \u201cMost of us are like ants: We follow a trail that has already been laid for us.\u201dStreet battles, kidnapping, torture, fascists, communists, rocky marriages and class tensions \u2014 and most of it seen through the eyes of two 8-year-old children living in Ankara, in the summer before the 1980 coup in Turkey. Going by the author\u2019s dedication, to her two nephews \u201cwho lived through the July 16, 2016, coup attempt at the same age I lived through the September 12, 1980, coup,\u201d Temelkuran is drawing on her own experiences in constructing this political bricolage.Her guides are Ali, a \u201cweakly boy\u201d from the poorer side of town, and Ayse, the daughter of a troubled middle-class couple. Despite their class differences, the families are on the same side politically \u2014 the left \u2014 and the children become friends after Ali\u2019s mother takes a cleaning job at Ayse\u2019s house. As the political unrest escalates, the children do their own plotting, first to release butterflies inside the Turkish Parliament, then to save the swans of Swan Park, which are apparently being subjected to \u201can Avian Deflighting Technique.\u201d \u201cUntil the swans are saved,\u201d the children pledge to each other, \u201cand the butterflies get into Parliament ... Even if we get really tired, even if we get sleepy \u2026 we will resist \u2026 I swear it! O.K., we\u2019re done.\u201dIt\u2019s a perilous undertaking to tell such a complicated story through the imagined magical thinking of childhood, and aside from some bright flashes of ingenuous insight, the telling offers more confusion than clarity.This gentle story about people brought together by places is like a good meditation: quiet, surprising and deeply satisfying. Taro, 30-something, divorced and mourning his father\u2019s death, lives alone in Tokyo, his unremarkable life a lot like the lives of those around him \u2014 his co-workers at the public relations firm, his sister whom he hasn\u2019t seen in three years and his neighbors in the View Palace Saeki III apartment block. The building is soon to be demolished, and one by one the residents are moving out, all except for Nishi, an illustrator and comic-strip artist, who recently moved in.Taro finds out why after catching her trying to climb over a wall near his apartment: Nishi has fallen in love with the house next door, a house she first discovered in high school when a friend showed her a book of photographs, called \u201cSpring Garden,\u201d about a famous couple who lived there. Shibasaki writes lovingly about her characters. \u201cThe sky-blue house\u201d becomes one of them, standing still in its emptiness, then coming back to life when a new family moves in, as if \u201ctime, which had stopped while the house was empty, was now moving again.\u201dPeople come and go, buildings are put up and pulled down, tenants move in and out, all connected in a kind of dance that\u2019s impossible to put into words, except somehow Shibasaki does it.The story of Happy Liu, a Chinese peasant who moves to the city and becomes a trash picker, cut close to the bone for Jia, for whom this was not an easy book to write. \u201cHad it not been for my having earned a place in college in 1972 as one of the \u2018worker, peasant, soldier\u2019 cohort,\u201d he writes in a lengthy author\u2019s note, \u201cI was sure I\u2019d be a farmer now, and a middle-aged trash picker too.\u201d What\u2019s more, the character of Happy Liu was inspired by a real-life person, a schoolmate from the same village as Jia.Despite the fictional Happy\u2019s setbacks \u2014 like selling a kidney so he could afford a house for a future wife who went off and married someone else \u2014 he lives up to his name, pedaling his three-wheeler through life with optimism and good cheer. \u201cI was born with upturned lips, so I\u2019m happy by nature,\u201d he explains. The death of his best friend, Wufu, bookends the novel, which opens as Happy is being apprehended trying to smuggle Wufu\u2019s corpse back to their home village of Freshwind, then turns back to recount the pair\u2019s assorted quixotic adventures on the streets of Xi\u2019an.The writing, in Harman\u2019s translation, is a delight \u2014 rich and lively \u2014 but while Happy\u2019s story is easy to read, it\u2019s hard to finish. \u201cLife as a trash picker was boring,\u201d he observes at one point, and toward the end of \u201cHappy Dreams,\u201d reading about it gets a bit boring, too.Alison McCulloch is a New Zealand journalist and writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Is a Bitcoin Believer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday and happy new year!\u2022 Bitcoin\u2019s value jumped as Peter Thiel\u2019s venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency.\u2022 Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial\u2019s purchase of MoneyGram.\u2022 The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time.\u2022 Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year.\u2022 The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail.From Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Celebrating Newark, One Supper at a Time", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 The Brick City Supper Club began with a simple idea. Explore Newark. Meet people. Break bread.It was 2010 and Frank Martinez, a Midwestern transplant, was tired of eating alone. He found a taqueria in the Ironbound neighborhood and invited fellow workers from the city\u2019s Department of Economic and Housing Development to join him. Six people showed up. Mr. Martinez christened the gathering with a nod to the city\u2019s industrial history and the old-fashioned supper clubs surrounding his grandparents\u2019 dairy farm in Wisconsin.On a cold Monday in January, more than 50 people gathered at a restaurant called Eleven Clinton to ring in the first supper of the new year. They were young and old, new to Newark, and born-and-raised. They work as lawyers, municipal employees, accountants, graphic artists and at least one elevator saleswoman. Most live here, others commute in for jobs and stick around for dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to meet new faces and soak up the vibe and energy in the city,\u201d said Isaiah Little, 29, a Newark native and supper club regular who organizes Newark First Fridays, an art and cultural event downtown. \u201cI\u2019ve developed partnerships here and definitely friendships. It sounds cheesy, but you really get to know people.\u201dThe Supper Club has outlasted Mr. Martinez, who moved to San Francisco in 2015. He remains somewhat amazed by what he began, but not that it\u2019s still going strong.\u201cThere\u2019s just something great about gathering for food with people you know and people you don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.Rob Thomas, one of the earliest members of the club, now serves as its chairman and cheerful chief nudge on Twitter:\u201cHalf off steaks at the Ainsworth. You should be here.\u201d\u201cDo your taxes and then come to supper club. You gotta eat, right?\u201d\u201cHappy Friday. THIS JUST IN \u2014 we\u2019ve got supper club on Monday.\u201dMr. Thomas, 32, is chief of energy and environment for the city. He spends his days thinking about how to make the city more sustainable \u2014 building its communal infrastructure though shared meals seems like a natural extension.\u201cNewark deserves this type of positive network where folks come out and support their community,\u201d he said.Melvin Sykes, a member who was born in Newark and now works in real estate, agrees.\u201cI thought it was a great idea because all people hear is negativity about Newark,\u201d Mr. Sykes, 50, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to give back. A lot of places have one foot in the grave, one foot on a banana peel. We support not only the restaurants, but the employees, who are making tips. It helps the local economy.\u201dMr. Thomas and the club\u2019s executive committee choose the dinners, which are held twice a month, with economics in mind. Supper is always on Monday because it is typically the slowest night for many restaurants. The club works to move around the city, rotating old stalwarts with new venues that need to build word-of-mouth buzz.Kai Campbell opened Burger Walla on Halsey Street in 2014. Supper Club has visited the burger restaurant with an Indian twist a few times since, business that is always much appreciated.\u201cThey are intentionally trying to support the city,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cIt means a lot to folks. It meant a lot to us. There is community in Newark. There are people here in the neighborhood, willing to travel for good food. It\u2019s like field of dreams. If you build it, they will come.\u201dMr. Thomas guesses the club has eaten at 75 restaurants over the years, but keeping count is not the point. Everyone has their favorites. For Olya Arakhouskaya, a field engineer at New Jersey Transit, it was McWhorter BBQ.\u201cThose ribs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo good.\u201dMs. Arakhouskaya, 31, discovered the club last summer after moving to Newark three years ago from Belarus. Like many members, she consciously circulates between tables to find new faces.\u201cI always meet one or two new people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me, being an immigrant, being new to the city. Here, I feel like part of a community. And they care about all aspects of life in Newark.\u201dBridges have sometimes been built beyond supper. They have eaten in one another\u2019s homes, joined an investment club run by one member, become neighbors who borrow sugar and meet for brunch and birthdays. Tamar Lerer and Peter Chen, both lawyers, invited some members to their wedding.The couple\u2019s first introduction to the Brick City Supper Club was at El Merengue in December 2014, just after they had moved to Newark.They were nervous, then welcomed and then amazed by that welcome.\u201cA lot of them have been here a long time,\u201d Ms. Lerer said of club members. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to reach out for new people with these open arms and open hearts, but they do. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dShe has since returned the favor, spreading the gospel of the Supper Club and creating a spreadsheet of restaurants so she is ready when office mates complain that there is nowhere to eat in Newark. She and Mr. Chen are at nearly every supper.\u201cTo us, Newark is the city,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Supper Club is a big part of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside Uber\u2019s $100,000 Payment to a Hacker, and the Fallout", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 \u201cHello Joe,\u201d read the November 2016 email from someone identifying himself as \u201cJohn Doughs.\u201d \u201cI have found a major vulnerability in Uber.\u201dThe email appeared to be no different from other messages that Joe Sullivan, Uber\u2019s chief security officer, and his team routinely received through the company\u2019s \u201cbug bounty\u201d program, which pays hackers for reporting holes in the ride-hailing service\u2019s systems, according to current and former Uber security employees.The hacking is now the subject of at least four lawsuits, with attorneys general in five states investigating whether Uber broke laws on data-breach notifications. In addition, the United States attorney for Northern California has begun a criminal investigation into the matter.Most of all, the hacking and Uber\u2019s response have fueled a debate about whether companies that have crusaded to lock up their systems can scrupulously work with hackers without putting themselves on the wrong side of the law.Yet since the fallout from Uber\u2019s disclosure, Silicon Valley companies have taken a harder look at their bounty programs. At least three have put their programs under review, according to two consultants who have confidential relationships with those companies, which they declined to name. Others said criminal prosecutions for not reporting John Doughs would deter ethical hackers who would otherwise come forward, causing even more security breaches.\u201cAnything that causes organizations to take a step backwards and not welcome contributions from the security community will have a negative impact on all of us,\u201d said Alex Rice, a co-founder of HackerOne, a security company whose business is to work with customers, including Uber, to manage interactions with and payments to hackers.This account of Uber\u2019s hacking and the company\u2019s response was based on more than a dozen interviews with people who dealt with the incident, many of whom declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of their exchanges. Many are current or former members of Uber\u2019s security team, who defended their actions as a prime example of how executives should respond to security problems. The New York Times also obtained more than two dozen internal Uber emails and documents related to the incident.In a statement, Mr. Sullivan disputed the notion that the 2016 episode was a breach and said Uber had treated it as an authorized vulnerability disclosure.\u201cI was surprised and disappointed when those who wanted to portray Uber in a negative light quickly suggested this was a cover-up,\u201d he said, adding that he was proud its engineers had been able to fix the issue before it could be abused. He declined to discuss disclosure because of the active state investigations.Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said, \u201cWe stand by our decision to very publicly disclose the 2016 data breach \u2014 not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do.\u201dThrough a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.Uber started its bounty program in March 2016, challenging hackers to find bugs that could specifically lead to the exposure of sensitive user data. The higher risk the bug was, the more Uber would pay. In Uber\u2019s calculus, the payouts were better than learning about a vulnerability only after attackers had abused it.By the time Mr. Sullivan got John Doughs email, Uber had paid rewards to hundreds of hackers. Mr. Sullivan forwarded the John Doughs note to his team for vetting and, if all checked out, patching and payment.Uber\u2019s security team used nicknames for hackers, particularly the colorful, anonymous ones who engaged with the company. John Doughs was called \u201cPreacher\u201d for his admonitions that Uber should be better at security.\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to be finding this vulnerability in such way,\u201d the hacker wrote in an email to Rob Fletcher, Uber\u2019s product security engineering manager. \u201cEspecially coming from a company like Uber.\u201dOther emails obtained by The Times show Mr. Fletcher treated the incident as a bounty and encouraged Preacher to provide proof of the vulnerability, including sending a few lines of data from the database he had breached.According to the emails obtained by The Times, Uber soon discovered that some of its employees had left certain computer code known as keys on a programming site called Github. Those keys had allowed Preacher to gain access to Uber\u2019s Amazon web servers, where it stored source code as well as 57 million customer and driver accounts, including driver\u2019s license numbers for some 600,000 Uber drivers. It was a major oversight. To fix it, Uber had to inform everyone at the company that it was temporarily shutting down access to Github.Emails between the hacker and Mr. Fletcher continued. In some, Mr. Fletcher thanked the hacker for helping the company fix the oversight. In two emails, Preacher\u2019s motivations appeared to veer closer toward blackmail. In one, he demanded \u201chigh compensation\u201d for his findings. After Mr. Fletcher said the company\u2019s maximum bounty was $10,000, Preacher said he and his team would only accept \u201csix digits.\u201dMr. Fletcher said he would need to seek authorization for a $100,000 payment, and would need Preacher\u2019s reassurances that he would delete the data he had downloaded. Mr. Fletcher also pushed the hacker to take payment through HackerOne, which requires bounty recipients to disclose their real identities for tax requirements.Mr. Fletcher drew further details about the hacker out through emails, including tidbits about his identity, his internet hosting provider, the location of his computer and proof that he deleted his copy of Uber\u2019s downloaded data by looking at a virtual copy of his system provided by his host.According to the emails, Uber at one point extended Preacher an all-expenses paid trip to San Francisco, where the company is based. Uber asked the hacker to discuss his security techniques and offered to introduce him to companies that might be interested in his skills. Preacher declined.By then, Uber\u2019s executives had decided what to do. Mr. Kalanick signed off on the $100,000 payment, so long as the hacker signed an agreement to destroy any data exposed in his discovery, according to the emails.Preacher\u2019s trail of digital bread crumbs eventually led to a 20-year-old whose first name was Brandon and who was living in a Florida trailer park with his family, according to the emails. In one email, Uber offered to send someone to meet Brandon at a local coffee shop. Brandon declined to leave his home and suggested that the employee meet him there. It was there that Brandon signed agreements assuring Uber that he had deleted the data he had downloaded.The Times was unable to learn Brandon\u2019s full name. An email to the John Doughs account bounced back.Uber\u2019s security team was soon celebrating its response to what could have been a major security breach. Mr. Sullivan and his colleagues were praised in year-end performance reviews, including by Mr. Kalanick, according to current and former employees.What is now at issue is whether Uber executives broke the law with the $100,000 payment and should have quickly notified customers or officials of the discovery. The issue is not legally clear cut.Laws concerning bug bounties are ambiguous. The Justice Department weighed into bug disclosure programs for the first time in July and largely left it to organizations to decide what access they will authorize for hackers and what they can do with the data. In Uber\u2019s case, its bounty guidelines authorized and encouraged hackers to look for vulnerabilities that exposed its most sensitive user data.Breach disclosure laws also differ state to state. The state laws most relevant to Uber\u2019s case require disclosure if names are exposed in combination with driver\u2019s license numbers in a \u201cbreach of security.\u201dBrandon received two payments of $50,000 each from Uber on Dec. 8, 2016, according to the emails. Uber continued trading emails with Brandon during 2017, until the conversation dwindled.Last fall, when two outside law firms for Uber learned about the payment to the hacker, they advised the company that the incident should have been disclosed, according to an Uber employee familiar with the matter. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Clark, the lawyer who directly oversaw the bounty payment, were fired for not seeking outside counsel on the issue of whether to disclose, this person said.That prompted a call to Mr. Sullivan while he was preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to two people familiar with the matter. He was fired, effective immediately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andreas Gursky Is Taking Photos of Things That Do Not Exist", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "The German photographer\u2019s latest work includes images of digitally created scenes and spaces. Are these the works he will be remembered by?Supported byLONDON \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her three predecessors sit in an orderly row; between them, these four figures have led Germany since 1974. Pictured through a window and from behind, they gaze at a huge abstract painting on the wall in front of them.Mr. Gursky set the record for a single photograph at auction in 2011 when one of his supersize images, \u201cRhine II,\u201d sold for $4.3 million. The Hayward exhibition includes this and other famous Gursky views from the 1990s: a sprawling Paris apartment building, a 99-cent store, swarms of traders on stock exchange floors. Striking in their scale and resolution, they show humankind dwarfed by nature, industry, finance and the consumer society.In recent years, Mr. Gursky has set out to test the boundaries of photography by composing works almost entirely in the studio, digitally creating spaces and scenes that never existed. The question is whether these are works that he will be remembered by.In an interview at the Hayward before the opening, Mr. Gursky sat between two of his giant new compositions, both of them inspired by pictures he took with his smartphone. Placid and measured in his words, he wore a navy sweater and a string bracelet not normally seen on the wrist of a 63-year-old man. Speaking in English and occasionally reverting to German, with a translator on hand, he engaged in a wide-ranging conversation about art and success \u2014 and his passion for techno music.Mr. Gursky began by explaining his recent output. \u201cI\u2019m just interested in making images,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, you have to reinvent yourself.\u201d He pointed out that he made no more than eight images a year, and that they took time to produce.Those \u201ccompletely constructed\u201d works of recent years were among Mr. Gursky\u2019s best, Mr. Rugoff said, because he was establishing a dialogue with abstract art and composing pictures the way a painter would.From the very birth of the discipline, Mr. Rugoff said, \u201cpeople were doing darkroom tricks and making things appear in photography that weren\u2019t there.\u201d\u201cThis medium, which we, for official purposes like passports and school IDs, trust to be an accurate picture of the world, has always been something that can be lent to fiction as well as to fact,\u201d he explained. \u201cAndreas is not a journalist doing reportage.\u201dOther specialists expressed a preference for Mr. Gursky\u2019s earlier work.Quentin Bajac, the chief curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 where Mr. Gursky\u2019s retrospective in 2001 gave the photographer a major career boost \u2014 said his signature pieces of the \u201990s came \u201cat a perfect moment,\u201d just as globalization was gathering pace. Mr. Gursky represented the spread of multinationals and the explosion of financial markets, as they were striking \u201cthe right balance between something that is neither critical nor apologetic,\u201d Mr. Bajac said. That \u201cabsence of narrative\u201d mirrored the contemporary mood.Mr. Gursky\u2019s work also embodied the shift from analog to digital, from \u201ctaking images\u201d to \u201cmaking images,\u201d said Mr. Bajac \u2014 initially doing both but now doing more of the latter.A switch to digital photography in the early \u201990s allowed Mr. Gursky to take large-format photographs and to manipulate the images in digital postproduction \u2014 by \u201cpumping up the color sometimes or combining several different images in order to get this really even perspective, where you can see everything and details that aren\u2019t available from just one perspective are suddenly made available to you,\u201d Mr. Rugoff explained.The giant formats found a ready market. Photography had historically been black-and-white and small, and printed in large editions. Mr. Gursky blew it up, made full use of color and set out to \u201cdocument the key themes that dominate our lives today, then produce these works in limited editions of between four and six,\u201d said Francis Outred, the chairman and head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s, one of the Hayward show\u2019s sponsors. He created \u201ca capsule of value\u201d akin to a painting, Mr. Outred said.Mr. Gursky also outpriced his peers by pointing his lens, early on, at major world exchanges such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1990 and the Chicago Board of Trade in 1997. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an Andy Warhol, you want a Marilyn, and if you\u2019re looking for a Gursky, you want a stock exchange,\u201d Mr. Outred said, adding that one London hedge fund had collected four or five of them to decorate its trading floor.At the turn of the millennium, Mr. Gursky started digitally recomposing photographs to give them a look similar to abstract paintings. In his record-setting river view \u201cRhine II\u201d (1999), for instance, the perfectly straight lines of green and gray recall abstract paintings by Barnett Newman or Kenneth Noland. Mr. Gursky edited out a power station that spoiled the composition.Mr. Gursky meanwhile continued to capture images around the theme of labor and capital. \u201cAmazon\u201d (2016) shows one of the online retailer\u2019s Arizona warehouses, stocked with books and boxes, and plastered with motivational slogans that read: \u201cWork hard,\u201d \u201cHave fun\u201d and \u201cMake history.\u201dMr. Gursky said visiting the warehouse was tough because of the working conditions, but insisted that his images were not \u201caccusing\u201d or a \u201cpolitical statement.\u201d\u201cOur world is also seduced by Amazon, because it\u2019s so practical and so quick, and you want something and the next day you have it. This is also the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI show our contemporary world the way it is.\u201dAsked if his fame and fortune caused him discomfort, Mr. Gursky laughed. Money had, of course, changed his life, he said, because he could afford to travel wherever he wanted.He said he planned to use his wealth to set up a public foundation on the premises of his studio in D\u00fcsseldorf, which he would endow and where all of the prints reserved for his private collection would be viewed in the future. Will it open soon?\u201cNo, I\u2019m still a bit too young,\u201d he said with a smile. He had thought about the foundation for a long time, he said, and was happy to have reached a decision: \u201cIt\u2019s strange for a living artist to talk about what\u2019s going on after he has died.\u201dFor now, Mr. Gursky leads the life of a much younger man. He plays sports \u2014 tennis, jogging and cycling \u2014 and has been a fan of techno for the past 20 years, describing it as music for all generations. He is close friends with the D.J. Sven V\u00e4th and other techno performers. \u201cMy son complains that I\u2019m hearing the same music as him,\u201d said Mr. Gursky, referring to the youngest of his two children, who are in their 20s. \u201cMaybe he has a problem with this, but not me!\u201dAfter the Hayward exhibition, Mr. Gursky said he planned to stop teaching at the D\u00fcsseldorf academy, take a two-year sabbatical to travel the world, and spend more time in Ibiza, Spain, where his friends live and where he\u2019ll be able to hear a lot of techno.A painter\u2019s work is usually fairly recognizable, Mr. Kittelmann explained. \u201cIn photography, it\u2019s much, much harder.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising that a photographer found a special handwriting in photography, that there is no misunderstanding,\u201d Mr. Kittelmann added. \u201cA Gursky is a Gursky.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough \u2013 all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\u201d said Holly Sullivan, Amazon Public Policy. \u201cThrough this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\u201dThe list of finalists leans toward cities in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast. Many of the finalists have been considered shoo-ins from the moment Amazon announced the search, largely because of the attributes Amazon said it was seeking for its new home \u2014 including a metropolitan area with a population more than one million and the ability to attract and keep strong technical talent.Other observations\u2022 This:\u2022 Also, this:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTim Cook said in a statement:\u201cWe have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.\u201dThe tax flyaroundMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is continuing his efforts to rein in the agency.Here\u2019s what he did:\u2022 The consumer bureau is funded directly by the Federal Reserve. Each quarter the watchdog requests money for its operations from the central bank.\u2022 On Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney requested $0 for the current quarter.\u2022 Mr. Mulvaney said the bureau is sitting on a $177.1 million reserve fund. He plans to use that to cover the bureau\u2019s projected quarterly expenses of $145 million.While the move is largely symbolic, it follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney that spotlight the Trump administration\u2019s desire to shift the consumer bureau\u2019s trajectory.Ignore all the one-time charges related to the new tax law that banks announced this week, the industry, long-term, should be among the biggest winners.But how much of the windfall will end in the pockets of employees and customers?Yet despite this largess, \u201cthe industry stands to retain more than 75 percents of the savings\u201d from the tax law, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In fact, the total cost of the wage increases and bonuses \u201cwill amount to just 1.75 percent of the banking industry\u2019s noninterest expenses in 2018.\u201dThe NumbersShares of Morgan Stanley gained 1.5 percent in early trading and are up 29 percent over the past year.Yes, stock\u2019s are down a bit Thursday, but that doesn\u2019t obscure the fact that major equity indexes are off to their best start in years.Investors have piled into stocks to start 2018. It took the Dow industrials just eight trading sessions to go from 25,000 to 26,000, the fastest move between millennial markers on record.So far this month, the S. & P. 500 has risen about 4.8 percent this month. To put that into context, the last time the index climbed 5 percent in January was 2013 and the last 6 percent gain for the month was in 1997. In both years, equities went on the finish the year up more than 30 percent, according to Instinet\u2019s Frank Cappelleri.So what could derail the stock market\u2019s rally? A government shutdown?

{"Headline": "Amid the Plunder of Forests, a Ray of Hope", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrange as it may sound, we have arrived at a moment of hope for the world\u2019s forests. It is, admittedly, hope of a jaded variety: After decades of hand-wringing about rampant destruction of forests almost everywhere, investigators have recently demonstrated in extraordinary detail that much of this logging is blatantly illegal.And surprisingly, people actually seem to be doing something about it. In November, the European Court of Justice put Poland under threat of a 100,000-euro-per-day fine for illegal logging in the continent\u2019s oldest forest, and early this month Poland\u2019s prime minister fired the environment minister who authorized the logging.Corrupt government agents and the black market happily provided transport documents to draw a veil of fictitious legality over whatever came floating down the river from the Amazon forest. Or as one exporter shipping timber on the Yacu Kallpa put it to an undercover investigator from the nonprofit Global Witness, \u201cThis tree miraculously becomes legal timber, just because of a piece of paper.\u201d Exporters could point to that piece of paper and claim to be merely \u201cbuyers in good faith.\u201dThat make-believe mind-set sufficed until Peru\u2019s customs service and its forest watchdog agency, together with investigators from the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency, tried to connect export shipments back to their reported harvest sites and found that almost none of the timber came from anyplace legal.Acting on that information, United States federal agents met the Yacu Kallpa at the dock in Houston in September 2015 and seized 71 shipping containers of timber worth more than $1 million. Investigators would later determine that 92 percent of the timber on that shipment was illegal. The Yacu Kallpa then simply turned around and tried to do it again.\u201cPeople are doing these things because they know they can,\u201d said Laura Furones, leader of the Peru campaign at Global Witness. \u201cThe level of impunity is astonishing.\u201dIndeed, on that next and final Yacu Kallpa shipment, 96 percent of the timber was illegal, according to investigators in Peru, putting the Iquitos-to-Houston connection out of business. That was also the basis for the trade representative\u2019s barring of the Peruvian exporter La Oroza. Federal prosecutors in this country and Peru are now conducting criminal investigations against more than 100 people in the Yacu Kallpa case, including American importers that also relied on the \u201cbuyer in good faith\u201d fiction.So where\u2019s the hope? This may sound na\u00efve, but making the illegality so blatantly obvious ought to drive the timber industry to clean up its own act. Failing that, technology will start to do the job for them. One way to bring the worldwide epidemic of stolen forests under control, according to Alexander von Bismarck, executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency, would be to require timber concession holders to register their trees in a public database. Every logging truck would then have to report by cellphone, before leaving the forest, which trees it is carrying. The ambition is traceability, right through to the finished product in the consumer\u2019s local big box store or lumberyard. It sounds cumbersome, Mr. von Bismarck admits, except when the alternative is a trade made up of more than 90 percent stolen goods.In fact, such a system already exists in Romania. A simple app called Forest Inspector, released through the Ministry of Environment there, enables users to type in the license plate number of any logging truck on the road and get an immediate answer: This shipment is legal, meaning the cargo is registered with a national database of approved harvest sites. Or it\u2019s illegal, meaning the police can stop it and confiscate both the cargo and the truck.In the first 10 days after release of the app in 2016, 30,000 people filed reports on logging trucks. Overnight, the number of trucks applying for permits and registering their loads increased by 50 percent. It wasn\u2019t because loggers suddenly started cutting more trees, Mr. von Bismarck said, but because \u201cthey felt they were really being watched.\u201dThat feeling will soon intensify, because of recent developments in Earth-orbiting satellites. Early last year, for instance, the high-tech aerospace company Planet completed a constellation of 149 bread-loaf-size satellites, which can now scan every point on Earth several times a week to monitor short-term changes in forest cover.In Romania, for instance, some logging outfits soon figured out a way to beat the Forest Inspector system, by sending shipping containers into the forest. \u201cThey load the raw logs directly into the container and off they go to China, so no one can see on the road that it is a logging truck,\u201d said Micu Bogdan, a consultant to the Romanian Ministry of Environment.In response, the ministry began to continually scan the entire country with three satellites and superimposed all new logging cuts on a map of legal cuts. A new cut would typically takes weeks to complete, Mr. Bogdan said, and we could \u201cspot an illegal cut in two days.\u201d Mr. von Bismarck and Mr. Bogdan are negotiating agreements to introduce a similar system in Peru.Even if the means are at hand to protect forests, political will remains a question. In Romania a change in government led to a suspension in satellite monitoring, and in Peru government leaders did not back up their own investigators in the Yacu Kallpa case. Instead, the president at the time, Ollanta Humala, ousted one of the leaders of the investigation.Peruvian officials also intervened to secure release of the stolen timber in the Yacu Kallpa\u2019s final shipment after Mexican authorities impounded it in January 2016. And this past week, the government approved new road building in pristine regions of the Amazon, potentially endangering three national parks and also several reserves belonging to indigenous people living in voluntary isolation from the outside world.In this country, the Trump administration does not appear naturally inclined to pursue criminal charges against traffickers in stolen timber. The American timber industry has, however, made it clear that it would welcome such a prosecution. A study by an association of domestic timber producers estimated that competition from illegal imported timber was costing them $1 billion a year \u2014 and that was in 2004.Consumers might also welcome rescue from the lingering suspicion that every time they buy a wood product, from a picture frame to a house, they are unwittingly subsidizing illegal logging. It can happen to any of us.Ask Donald Trump. According to Mr. von Bismarck, doors manufactured a few years ago with mahogany stolen from a Unesco World Heritage Site in Honduras ended up in Mar-a-Lago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richemont, Doubling Down on Online Luxury, May Buy Yoox Net-a-Porter", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont built a conglomerate offering the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers the highest-quality product, often in the most luxurious of settings. Clients walking into a Cartier flagship or a Piaget boutique \u2014 both Richemont brands \u2014 could expect radiant smiles and soft furnishings, as well as impeccable service for as long as was necessary before they made their purchase.Increasingly, though, well-heeled clients don\u2019t want that type of service. Cash-rich, time-starved customers want their shopping to be quick, quiet and easy, done in a matter of seconds from their smartphone.Richemont, which also owns upscale brands like IWC, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels, knows that times are changing. The Swiss luxury group announced on Monday that it was doubling down on its investments in high-end internet retail, making an offer of 2.8 billion euros, or about $3.4 billion, for the online fashion retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter.The surprise bid was a significant about-face in Richemont\u2019s strategy and an acknowledgment that wealthy consumers are increasingly comfortable buying an expensive watch or pen with a click rather than a trip to an upscale store. The process of buying luxury goods, which traditionally took place over many hours in lavish shops or department stores, is rapidly transforming.Richemont, which was already restructuring how it sold its watch and jewelry brands, clearly hopes to capitalize on that growth. It said it had offered to pay \u20ac38 a share to buy the Yoox Net-a-Porter stock that it did not already own, a 25.6 percent premium to the company\u2019s closing price of \u20ac30.26 on Friday.Yoox and Net-a-Porter merged in an all-share deal three years ago. At the time, Richemont was Net-a-Porter\u2019s controlling shareholder, and still holds about 25 percent of the combined company.Recent years were rocky for Richemont. Exports of Swiss watches slumped, a crackdown on corruption in China stanched demand for luxury goods in an increasingly important market, and global economic growth was sluggish.That appears to be changing, though. The group has posted strong sales growth in recent quarters, highlighting a recovery in demand for top-end Swiss mechanical watches. The broader mix of products and prices offered by its brands, in particular to younger customers, who tend to browse and buy online, has also bolstered results.Yoox Net-a-Porter owns and operates the internet retailers Net-a-Porter, Mr Porter, the Outnet and Yoox, and operates e-commerce sites for over 30 luxury brands, including Stella McCartney, Dolce & Gabbana and Chlo\u00e9.Federico Marchetti, the Yoox Net-a-Porter chief executive, has agreed to sell his shares and any he would acquire through the exercise of options in the offer. He owned about 3.9 percent of the company\u2019s total share capital.Richemont said Yoox Net-a-Porter would continue to operate as a separate business, \u201censuring it remains a neutral and highly attractive platform for third-party luxury brands.\u201d Yoox Net-a-Porter\u2019s headquarters would remain in Italy.The Richemont deal nevertheless caught some analysts by surprise on Monday. Luca Solca, the head of luxury goods analysis at the French bank BNP Paribas, called it a \u201cpuzzling development,\u201d years after Richemont had divested most of its stake in Net-a-Porter.Sherri Malek, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said there was a strong possibility of a rival bid for Yoox Net-a-Porter, given its sales growth and market position. She added that, with the large number of players entering the market and high level of competition, there could be further such deals in the sector.\u201cAs Amazon continues to dominate the internet retail industry and focuses its efforts on penetrating the fashion category, we think this has the potential to incentivize smaller competitors to consolidate,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors.The Yoox Net-a-Porter deal is subject to regulatory approval and to shareholders agreeing to sell more than 90 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares in the offer.Goldman Sachs and the law firms Bonelli Erede Pappalardo and Slaughter and May were advising Richemont.Advertisement"}

Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects.

Dick laid down themes for decades of science fiction (and non-science fiction). As technology perfects virtual experiences, what does \u201creal\u201d mean? Is an original necessarily more authentic than its simulacrum?But this license and talent, plus the lavish scale of production, add up to little that feels freshly imagined or newly provocative.The alt-worlds in \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d \u2014 each episode has a different writer and director \u2014 range from the quasi-present to millenniums hence. But mostly, they play with familiar ideas in conventional high-tech settings: They\u2019re futures that seem oddly dated.The season opener, \u201cReal Life,\u201d written by the executive producer Ronald D.

{"Headline": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Team Up to Try to Disrupt Health Care", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Three corporate behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation\u2019s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.It was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees\u2019 existing health coverage \u2014 whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses.But Tuesday\u2019s announcement landed like a thunderclap \u2014 sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market.That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.The companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon\u2019s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans \u2014 from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics.\u201cIt could be big,\u201d Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. \u201cThose are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.\u201dBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies \u2014 which, combined, employ more than one million people \u2014 might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans.\u201cThis is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,\u201d said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. \u201cThe idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.\u201dEven the three companies don\u2019t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company.Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency \u2014 whatever it might turn out to be.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in the statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dOver the past several months, the three had met formally \u2014 along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan\u2019s board \u2014 to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s thinking.The three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set.Mr. Buffett\u2019s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country\u2019s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged \u2014 he is 87 \u2014 the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said.The companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company wouldn\u2019t replace existing health insurers or hospitals.Planning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis\u2019s mergers and acquisitions strategy; Mr. Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.One potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities.\u201cEach of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,\u201d said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn\u2019t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.\u201dThe e-commerce giant\u2019s actions \u2013 some big, like buying Whole Foods Markets; some smaller, like Amazon meal kits \u2013 have led to stock sell-offs for a wide range of businesses.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards.\u201cI think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,\u201d he said.Amazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.Nationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs \u2014 they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments.Suzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, \u201cit\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said.She added, \u201cThere are so many opportunities to do this better.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Katie Thomas from Chicago and Reed Abelson from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "TV Content Wars: Too Many Characters Chasing Not Enough Action", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC.That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle \u2014 and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2014 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Murdoch\u2019s Bid for Full Control of Sky Is Dealt a Blow by U.K. Regulator", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Murdoch has made multiple attempts to acquire the part of Sky not already under his control, only to find himself thwarted by a phone-hacking scandal and the British authorities.The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said that Mr. Murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, would have too much control over Britain\u2019s media landscape if the deal for Sky were to go through. For that reason, it described the proposed $16.3 billion transaction as \u201cnot in the public interest.\u201dThe deal\u2019s fate is now in the hands of Britain\u2019s culture minister, Matt Hancock, who must rule by May 1 on whether to let the Murdoch deal proceed.For Mr. Murdoch, 86, the deal for complete control of Sky was part legacy-building, part competitive defense.Since starting the satellite broadcaster in 1989, he has become all too familiar with the regulatory issues affecting media markets across Europe. His latest attempt to acquire all of Sky was part of a push to burnish his company\u2019s global reach.The acquisition would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network, and broadcast rights for lucrative content like Premier League soccer matches in England and other European leagues\u2019 games.In moving to buy the rest of Sky, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company was also seeking to add muscle to compete against digital rivals like Amazon, Apple and Netflix.Full control of Sky would give 21st Century Fox not only a vast satellite network but also Now TV, the satellite broadcaster\u2019s online streaming service. Now TV is a minnow compared with behemoths like Netflix, which added more subscribers last year than Sky had over all. But Now TV and its sister services in Germany and Spain would provide a foundation from which to expand.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said that, in his view, the Fox-Sky bid was \u201cnot fully dead yet, but it will die a death at some point in the weeks ahead.\u201d As to whether Disney \u2014 after the expected approval in the United States of its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would try to buy the coveted 61 percent stake in Sky, he added, \u201cDisney very well may proceed with it, but in that case you could see other bidders for Sky.\u201dDisney\u2019s aspirations for Sky, Mr. Wieser said, could affect the role that James Murdoch \u2014 the younger of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s two sons and 21st Century Fox\u2019s chief executive \u2014 ultimately takes in an expanded Disney. \u201cOne could speculate that they won\u2019t announce any role for him until after any Sky deal,\u201d he said.Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, saw Disney\u2019s potential involvement as creating a more favorable scenario for a Sky deal to pass regulatory scrutiny.\u201cIf anything, it would seem that the U.K. regulators would encourage Disney to control Sky, as it increases the plurality of voices in the U.K. market,\u201d he said.Much has changed since Mr. Murdoch made his latest bid for Sky \u2014 in particular, his decision to sell most of 21st Century Fox to Disney in a move widely seen as an admission that traditional Hollywood companies had to grow significantly to compete in a shifting entertainment landscape.The announcement on Tuesday further complicates the path ahead for Mr. Murdoch.The Competition and Markets Authority expressed concern that allowing the takeover of Sky to proceed would give him too much control over the British media and, as a result, would give the Murdoch family \u201ctoo much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.\u201dThe regulator further noted that Murdoch-controlled outlets were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain\u2019s population. That is a substantially larger share than all but two organizations, one of which is the state broadcaster, the BBC.Notably, the competition authority said the sexual harassment allegations at Fox News were \u201cserious\u201d but did \u201cnot call into question\u201d 21st Century Fox\u2019s commitment to British broadcasting standards.The provisional decision was praised by longtime ideological foes of Mr. Murdoch, including Tom Watson, the deputy leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party. Mr. Watson called the announcement \u201ca victory for the thousands of people who joined the campaign and forced the government and the regulator to stand up to the Murdochs for once, instead of simply waving this bid through.\u201dClaire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, told the BBC that the decision did not mean that the proposed transaction was dead, given that the regulator had not blocked it on broadcast-standards grounds and had cited the single issue of media plurality. \u201cHad it blocked on both grounds, the transaction would have been stone dead,\u201d Ms. Enders said.She cited an increase in Sky\u2019s share price on Tuesday \u2014 it was up about 3.2 percent by day\u2019s end \u2014 as noteworthy.\u201cYou can see a market enthusiasm for a conclusion in which the original transaction is actually moving in the right direction, although far from being concluded,\u201d Ms. Enders said.Emily Steel contributed reporting from New York, and Stephen Castle from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s a Present \u2014 if You Qualify", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI Was MisinformedThis is definitely going to sound insensitive, but I have been thinking that life would be easier if the homeless had ID stickers with their stories: \u201cOff Meds\u201d; \u201cOpioids\u201d; \u201cNo Health Insurance\u201d; \u201cCollege Kid Using Kittens to Hustle You.\u201d Not easier for them. Easier for the casual do-gooder in a hurry.I feel especially mistrustful of the kitten users. Once the kittens have gone through the cute stage, I suspect they\u2019re going to be dumped. And even if not, those kittens have already suffered a roller coaster of elation and disappointment.On the other hand, that young panhandler with the kitten may have been tossed out of her home because of familial intolerance, perhaps a discordant sexual identity, although in Greenwich Village it\u2019s hard to think what that would be. She grabbed what she treasured most, her nose ring and her kitten, and after weeks of unsuccessful job hunting finds herself on the street. That kitten is all she has to love her. And considering the depth of cat love, that is not much.You see how confusing it is. One wants to do something, but there are so many bereft people in the street it\u2019s difficult to know who to help and what to do. This may be why, when I read about feminine hygiene gift bags, I liked the idea so much. Tampons, I learned, are a relatively expensive item, which are often in short supply at shelters. So you pack a large handbag with tampons, add baby-wipes, toothpaste, underwear, socks, tissues \u2014 anything that might help someone clean herself up and maintain a bit of dignity.I go on Amazon to stock up. In addition to the basics I find a few luxury items: chocolates, scented soap, cologne \u2014 a spray of something lovely might transport someone, I think, even if just for a few moments. As Amazon offers items in bulk I have enough for two bags. I find the bags at Goodwill. One is a soft gray quilted tote; one is a patterned French knockoff. I put $10 in each bag so the freshened-up lady can get a cup of coffee and a muffin. While I wait for the items to arrive, I case my Union Square neighborhood. I spot the perfect recipient, a woman sitting on the street on Park Avenue South at the corner of 17th Street. She is in her late 20s or early 30s, with a backpack and a cardboard sign.\u201cBetter homeless than a victim of domestic abuse,\u201d the sign reads.As soon as my items arrive I rush back to 17th Street. The perfect recipient is gone; the person now sitting on the sidewalk with a sign is a young man. I move on through the neighborhood. This makes me realize a few things: There are far more homeless men than women in the street. When it is winter and someone is huddled under layers of protective covering, it is not easy to tell who is male and who is female. I see only one homeless person I am certain is a woman, who appears to be deranged. After an hour and a half, I have given away nothing.\u201cThe problem is, I want to give the bag to someone who will use it,\u201d I explain to my friend Herb over dinner. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give it to someone who is so far gone she\u2019ll put the Tampax in her ear. I don\u2019t want to get up the next morning and see the underwear scattered all over 14th Street.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t work that way,\u201d Herb says. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. You have to hand it to somebody and not look back.\u201d\u201cThat might be O.K. if I had dozens of bags,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I just have two. I\u2019m not being unrealistic here. I just want to give it to somebody who will take it into Starbucks and be able to clean up; then she\u2019ll look better and feel better and get a minimum wage job and within a year she\u2019ll be a vice president. Or maybe she\u2019ll be one of those people who writes a play about being homeless a few years later.\u201dI widen my search to Grand Central. The few women I see seem to be in no shape to care for themselves. One is wearing a blue bunny costume and is seated next to a stack of garbage bags filled with clothing and magazines. Another, an older woman in layers of clothing, comes at me yelling. I back off, frightened and thinking she isn\u2019t the sort of homeless person who I want to give my bag to anyway, and am ashamed of both feelings.A friend I\u2019ve told about the gift bags has told me that the women I\u2019m searching for go to shelters in freezing weather, that the ones who remain in the street have serious mental problems like dementia and schizophrenia. I think she may be right. On my third day of fruitless searching, when I see a young woman sitting on the sidewalk with two cats on leashes, asking for money, I stop. She may be a hustler, but if sitting on the sidewalk in December is the best way she\u2019s got to make a buck, it\u2019s a pretty bleak hustle. And she\u2019s age appropriate and I\u2019m tired. I give her a bag, wish her luck and leave town for a few days, glad to be taking a break from the gift bag project.I return just in time for a cold snap.The morning temperature is 9 degrees, it\u2019s unlikely anyone will be in the street, but I grab the gray quilted bag anyway and take the train to my Upper East Side appointment. There are no homeless people on the train or the street. Then, returning downtown, just past the gate of the 67th Street subway station, I spot someone. He or she is wearing a dark parka and a black face mask and holding a coffee cup with a few bills, and is asking for change. I think the voice is female but with the face covered I\u2019m not sure. I walk up to the person, trying to figure out a polite way to ask. There\u2019s nothing to do but blurt it out.\u201cAre you a lady?\u201d I ask.\u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m homeless.\u201dI give her the soft gray shoulder bag.\u201cFor me?\u201d she says, stunned, but as far as I can tell from someone whose face is almost completely hidden, happy stunned.\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.I put out my hand and we shake.\u201cGood luck,\u201d I say.Then I walk away. I\u2019ll tell you the truth, it will be fine with me even if she doesn\u2019t write a play.##Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning to Fool Our Algorithmic Spies", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn a series of studies published in 2012, two psychologists, Ara Norenzayan and Will Gervais, set out to test a simple question: When people think about God, do they feel or act as if they are being monitored? Subjects of varying religiosity were primed to think about God, then asked to complete self-evaluations based on statements like \u201cI am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me\u201d and \u201cNo matter whom I\u2019m talking to, I\u2019m always a good listener.\u201d Results, researchers said, were consistent with what they call the \u201csupernatural-monitoring hypothesis\u201d \u2014 that is, that \u201cthinking of God triggers the same social cognitive processes that are activated by real-time social surveillance.\u201d A sense that you\u2019re being seen \u2014 whether by a fellow human or by a supreme consciousness from which no thought can be withheld \u2014 does seem to change how you see yourself as well as how you behave.Since 2012, online platforms have moved to the center of hundreds of millions more lives, popularizing their particular brands of social surveillance. Services like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are inextricably tied to the experience of being monitored by others, which, if it doesn\u2019t always produce \u201cprosocial\u201d behavior in the broad psychological sense, seems to have encouraged behaviors useful to the platforms themselves \u2014 activity and growth. These businesses serve many different purposes, but the one thing they have in common is that they have figured out new ways to monetize the powerful twin sensations of seeing and being seen by others.But alongside this exhilarating, debilitating, empowering and terrifying human spectacle, these sites have also fostered \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a new but not entirely unfamiliar feeling, that of being watched from above. There is little about the ruthless, marketlike social-media experience that primes you to think about any sort of god. But there are, I\u2019ve noticed, persistent and ever-more-obvious experiences that remind you of another kind of higher power: the automated systems on which these platforms run.Services that used to depend on asking me questions \u2014 What do you like? Whom do you want to follow? \u2014 have started making more assumptions based on my behavior. I\u2019m reminded that my actions are being recorded and factored into my experience when I am greeted on Twitter by a series of recommendations derived, apparently, from things I\u2019ve liked, looked at or reposted. I\u2019m implicitly prompted to think about algorithmic surveillance when, the day after I wasted a few minutes scrolling through a cycling publication\u2019s account, my Instagram app floods my Explore tab with photos of mountain bikes. Weeks after tapping an unfamiliar name on Facebook and scrolling through the recent posts \u2014 a postmarriage surname change, a new profile photo \u2014 this person, a former acquaintance I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, is given the same feed placement as current close friends.These experiences manifest beyond social networks as well. Searches for holiday gifts haunt web browsing, as Amazon \u201cretargeting\u201d ads place the products I looked at, briefly \u2014 a thermos, headphones, binoculars \u2014 next to, above and in the middle of news articles. They find their way back over the walls too, placing reminders of my recorded behavior in my Instagram feed \u2014 ads that say, \u201cWe\u2019d like you to buy running gear,\u201d not quite so loudly as they say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got eyes everywhere.\u201dOf course, this is the deal we have entered into with such services: our data for their products. That this surveillance is happening is obvious, even if the ways we\u2019re reminded of it can still be jarring. Spotify, the music-streaming service, recently began an ad campaign that mined and cheekily broadcast actual individual listening habits: \u201cDear person who played \u2018Sorry\u2019 42 times on Valentine\u2019s Day: What did you do?\u201d; \u201cTo the person in NoLIta who started listening to holiday music way back in June: You really jingle all the way, huh?\u201d The company was boldly showing off its intimate knowledge of current users in an effort to gain new ones \u2014 a harmlessly creepy example of a strategy that could easily backfire.For example, I thought better of searching for a friend with whom I had lost touch, knowing that his posts would then climb the ladder of my Facebook feed, turning a flash of guilt into a persistent reminder of my failure. For work, I sometimes need to watch videos made by a range of toxic, hateful or just unappealing vloggers, and I found that I\u2019d avoid watching them on my phone, waiting instead until I could get to my laptop, where I could more quickly and totally log out, go incognito and avoid filling my future YouTube recommendations with bile. During the holidays, I shopped in anonymous tabs, assuming that gifts could be revealed during an idle Instagram scroll on the couch.As with performing on social media for friends, family or co-workers \u2014 posting your best pictures, documenting your most exciting activities or professionally marketing yourself \u2014 these individually tiny elisions weren\u2019t entirely honest. But unlike these social displays, they were first and foremost intentionally deceptive, and they were rooted in antagonism.Believers in an omniscient God tend to assume that nothing can truly be hidden, including doubt. Pascal\u2019s Wager, for example, which supposes that believing in God is simply a safer bet against even vanishingly narrow odds of eternal damnation, leans on a potentially fatal premise: Surely any conceivable God would know you\u2019re just making a bet? But we ascribe no such powers to algorithms. Machine surveillance can be fooled in small ways and big ones: by the creation of blacked-out spaces, the introduction of strategically tainted data and the performance of a particular version of the self.Social platforms also expect faith from their users: that data will be used responsibly, that at least some forms of privacy among people will be respected. But the flashing reminders of the automatic surveillance on which they are increasingly built can undermine those expectations and remind us instead of our ability to withdraw. Residents in neighborhoods that have been flooded by drivers following directions from Waze \u2014 which is owned by Google and supplies data to for Google Maps \u2014 have resorted to filing false accident reports to divert drivers. Waze has sought to curb these reports, but in so doing, it has come across less as omniscient than unthinking and defensive \u2014 and above all, corporate. Knowing that our maps were watching us produced individual acts of defiance that amounted to collective acts of resistance.Increased awareness of automated surveillance, in other words, is most effective at demystifying the systems doing the watching, not reifying their wisdom and authority. It clarifies our relationships with them: each recommendation or subtle change reminds us not only that we\u2019re being watched, but also that we\u2019ve consented to it. And such awareness will also be a necessity should one or all of these platforms \u2014 through more brazen exploitation, calamitous hacking or even greater sharing with governments \u2014 cause us to well and truly lose faith. They may aspire to divine levels of omniscience, but they risk driving away their followers in the process.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Remote Control, Out of Control: Why \u00e0 la Carte TV Is Too Much for a Trekkie", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo, I have not watched the new Star Trek series. Sore subject. CBS is airing the latest spinoff, \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d only on CBS All Access, yet another paid video streaming service, in this case for $5.99 a month, or $9.99 without commercials. And I\u2019m not doing that.I\u2019ve got Netflix. I\u2019ve got Amazon. I\u2019ve got cable. I\u2019m done.For consumers, this is not going to get any easier. Disney has two streaming services in development, one for entertainment and another for sports. If Disney\u2019s acquisition of much of Fox goes through, that would further alter the landscape. And then there\u2019s net neutrality, which could take the whole picture and shake it up like a snow globe.Martin Kon, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, in the firm\u2019s technology, media and telecommunications practice, said that \u201cover time, all major content owners will have ways of presenting their content offerings\u201d in what he referred to as on-demand \u201cbouquets of content.\u201d\u201cIt will be onerous for consumers to have a couple dozen discrete relationships,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question then is how do they get re-aggregated back into a very compelling consumer proposition?\u201dBreaking the cable bundle is also changing how television is developed, because more companies have access to our data. McKinsey, the consulting firm, has been collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using artificial intelligence to help media companies make sense of the viewer data they collect. Among other things, they did a computer analysis of 1,500 short films from the website Vimeo, graphing their emotional peaks and valleys and correlating them to user comments.\u201cThe risk in the industry is spending large amounts of money for early-stage television series, most of which fail,\u201d said Jonathan Dunn, a McKinsey partner who co-authored the analysis, adding that the goal is to \u201ctake all of that information you\u2019ve learned about recommendation and discovery\u201d and \u201cget an edge on your production and greenlighting choices.\u201dThings used to be simpler. My father made a ritual of coming home from work, settling in a leather chair with a Scotch and soda and watching reruns of \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201d I stationed myself on a couch to his right.Now we have our own content corners. There\u2019s a 12-year-old in my house who watches YouTube videos of other kids playing video games. I\u2019m catching up on \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d the Netflix cartoon about a washed up, drunken actor who happens to be a horse. Hulu and Showtime haven\u2019t made the cut. As for HBO, get back to me in 2019, when \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d returns.Marc DeBevoise, president and chief operating officer of CBS Interactive, said \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d was in production when the company was looking for an anchor for its new streaming service, which now has more than two million subscribers.\u201cWe realized that building this into a multimillion-subscriber service was going to take a great base,\u201d he said, \u201cand we realized we were going to have our own exclusive content to differentiate it.\u201dI understand the business rationale. But I\u2019m done paying for more TV, even if it means turning my back on Star Trek. This is an absolute red line I will not cross until after Feb. 11 when the first season of the show ends and I can sign up for the free trial week they offer and binge-watch it all at once.Until then, the entertainment industry should remember we don\u2019t have to watch television. I read a novel recently, and I might read another one, if it\u2019s short enough. Really, I will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Years After a Breakthrough at Sundance, Trying to Break Through Again", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year at the festival, which runs through Jan. 28, the program Women at Sundance is acknowledging Ms. Harris on the 25th anniversary of the movie. Ms. Harris has yet to make another feature, though not for lack of trying. In an interview mid-festival, the filmmaker (whose husband is a photographer for The New York Times) discussed how she got her small movie made, the current climate of independent filmmaking and why it has been so difficult to make a follow-up. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.In the end credits of \u201cJust Another Girl on the I.R.T.,\u201d you dubbed it \u201cA Film Hollywood Dared Not Do.\u201d Could you talk about what the filmmaking climate was like when you decided to make this?At the time, it was all about \u201cBoyz N the Hood,\u201d \u201cJuice,\u201d \u201cHangin\u2019 With the Homeboys.\u201d It was all male-centric. Those movies gave me the impetus to write a contemporary film from a black woman\u2019s point of view. But it\u2019s interesting because even now I have a fan base. Young people love the movie and I get tweets about it. They\u2019ve seen it on Amazon or Netflix.What are new fans responding to?They like that she was rocking the natural hair, the Senegalese twist. She was very political and stood up for herself and for injustice. She\u2019s not silent, she\u2019s not just the girlfriend, the mother, the daughter. I wanted her to have a full-fledged life herself.Did you feel like you were breaking ground when you made it?How does it feel to be back at Sundance? I feel like this is the place to be right now because there\u2019s change.Were there movies you had seen that represented your experience before you decided to make your film?I studied film in France and I\u2019m a big international film buff. I love Godard, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, Mizoguchi. These filmmakers often focused on a woman\u2019s story. Also Spike\u2019s film \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d I liked that it was about one woman\u2019s journey. But, it was from a male\u2019s point of view. Still good though.So you\u2019re saying that although Spike Lee\u2019s film stars a woman character, you feel the character is written more like how a man would see her?Yep.How did you get your movie made?I actually submitted my script to some of the mini majors [studio divisions]. One person said, \u201cWe love the script, we think it\u2019s great. But could you make her boyfriend, Tyrone, a drug dealer?\u201d I said no, I wouldn\u2019t change it. So I ended up starting a company and raising money myself through grants.But we ran out of money in post. I sent a script to the writer Terry McMillan. She sent a check to help. Also Michael Moore saw a rough cut of the film and he helped, too.And he said yes.You also asked him about what the mostly male, white Hollywood execs could do to help open doors for more people of color.What\u2019s happening with the film you said you\u2019d give Michael Moore a role in?We\u2019re still trying to get financing. It\u2019s still rare to have a black director, writer and producer making a film with a black lead female character. This one is about a cinema professor. It\u2019s called \u201cI Love Cinema.\u201dHas this been the case ever since \u201cJust Another Girl?\u201dHow do you think more change will happen?Well I think art really reflects our society. And maybe now with more women speaking up and having their voices be heard, we can see a shift. Maybe if we had more black executives, they would see the importance of these stories. I mean, how can you not do a film about Bessie Coleman?Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla pushes back its Model 3 production targets again.\u2022 Manafort\u2019s lawsuit faces a tough road.\u2022 Researchers discover two major flaws in the world\u2019s computers.\u2022 Spotify filed confidentially to go public.\u2022 The death of Ant Financial\u2019s bid to buy MoneyGram raises questions about how useful close ties to President Trump are.\u2022 Dominion Energy and Scana are combining.\u2022 Underwriting for free.The electric carmaker said it delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter and would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.Those numbers were well below analyst expectations and Tesla\u2019s past forecasts.In September, analysts predicted that Telsa would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered.Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter.The news hasn\u2019t spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close.Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one.But that\u2019s a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans.Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court.Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThose are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit.From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT:\u201cThe two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201dThe business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats.The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.Intel\u2019s shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively.The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines.The bad news? The gains could be shortlived.Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index to $153 from $139.\u201cThe biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions.\u201dBut tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019.\u201cWhile tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth.\u201dNot Spotify it seems.A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets.Direct listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money.While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: \u201cUnderwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn\u2019t keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance.That is raising concerns that underwriting \u201ccould become largely unprofitable\u201d in Asia.In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering.The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps.Who should be worried\u2022 Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm \u2014 and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.)\u2022 Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president. (Think Disney and Fox, whose proposed transaction raised antitrust concerns but garnered praise from Mr. Trump.)\u2022 American companies looking to do business in China, who may now face retaliatory blowback.Critics\u2019 cornerShares of Scana jumped 22 percent on the news, while Dominion slipped 4 percent.Scana\u2019s shares are down more than 40 percent since midsummer.\u201cIn this case especially, Dominion will have to pull out all the stops to demonstrate that their offer is the best deal for customers, particularly given the uncertainty facing [SCANA\u2019s] rates over the coming months. We\u2019re looking for a reaction from the Governor as well as House Speaker Jay Lucas and the PSC commissioners for early signs of whether Dominion\u2019s proposal will fall flat.\u201dFrom Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.The Bitcoin flyaroundMore from Jonathan Martin of the NYT:Mr. Romney\u2019s potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber.Also worth notingThe Washington flyaroundOil is at its highest level since 2015, edging up this morning toward $67 a barrel. Geopolitical risks, like protests in Iran, have prompted buying, while production curbs by OPEC members have tightened supply.More from David Sheppard of the FT:While global oil demand is forecast to rise by about 1.4m barrels a day next year, growing US shale output combined with new projects in Brazil and Canada are broadly expected to see non-OPEC supply rise by a similar amount.Hedge funds are, however, betting that prices are likely to head higher, with some arguing that geopolitical unrest \u2014 including in OPEC member Venezuela, where oil output has been falling \u2014 should keep prices well supported.The hedge fund\u2019s latest victory: Alexion Pharmaceuticals said that it would work with the activist investor on finding a new director for its board.We have been actively working to expand and diversify our board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion\u2019s board.\u201cIt\u2019s like your neighbor having a suitcase stuffed with $1 million in cash, but you\u2019ll only pay him $500,000 for it because you think he\u2019ll lose the rest on the way to your house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Norman\u2019s version is a far more conventional telling of the Dunkirk evacuation, done in a traditional style, with none of the shifting time frames of Nolan\u2019s interpretation. It is, however, a tightly crafted, hard-nosed war picture, told mostly through the eyes of two protagonists: one a British soldier (John Mills) awaiting evacuation from Dunkirk beach, the other a British reporter (Bernard Lee), who covers the events and then leads the charge of civilian boats assisting the rescue. It may not be as formally flamboyant as Nolan\u2019s telling, but it\u2019s a brilliant antecedent.Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk\u201d is not a remake of this 1958 British film from director Leslie Norman, though it bears the same title and portrays the same event.

That campaign, which lasted nearly four months, is the basis of this 1969 war film from director Guy Hamilton. Hamilton was best known for such classic Bond films as \u201cGoldfinger\u201d and \u201cDiamonds Are Forever,\u201d and his work here is less winking but just as technically impressive; the large-scale flying and battle sequences are spectacular, their scale, scope and intensity not unlike those in Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk.\u201dBarely a month after the Dunkirk Evacuation, the Royal Air Force\u2019s extended defense of Britain from German Luftwaffe began.

Adapted from the novel by James Jones (sprinkled with bits from another of his novels, \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d), it was Malick\u2019s first film in two decades, extending his shift away from the straightforward narrative inclinations of his debut feature, \u201cBadlands\u201d (a shift begun with his shimmering pastoral from 1978, \u201cDays of Heaven\u201d). Malick had become more interested in cinematic poetry than prose, and set about crafting images and voice-overs that captured mood more than story points.It\u2019s difficult to imagine Nolan\u2019s pulling off such a stylistically experimental World War II movie without the this 1998 masterpiece from director Terrence Malick as precedent.

Kurosawa alternates intensely vibrant full-canvas battles \u2014 symphonies of blood and barbarism \u2014 with quiet scenes of psychological struggle and stunned silence.

In other words, \u201cDunkirk\u201d is the closest he\u2019s come to making a silent movie, and when approached that way, its debt to this 1925 Soviet classic from Sergei Eisenstein is all the more apparent. The force of its images, the immediacy of its telling, and the evocative, ticktock urgency of its editing style all owe a debt to Eisenstein, as do its underlying themes of self-sacrifice and hope.\u201cDunkirk\u201d is Nolan\u2019s shortest film, and also his most succinct; rather than rely on the reams of expositional dialogue that usually summarize his plots and characters, he parachutes us into the action (much like the troops at the story\u2019s center) and tells the story via action, montage and onscreen text.

{"Headline": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpen ThreadGreetings from Paris, where the couture shows have been going on for the last week and it has been raining, on and off, the entire time.Wait, you ask \u2014 couture, that most ancient and expensive part of fashion, where clothes are made by hand to order \u2014 is still happening? Isn\u2019t that awfully retrograde? Why should anyone who isn\u2019t one of the few hundred couture clients around the world care?Partly because it is a way of preserving a traditional form of know-how, employing a host of skilled artisans whose techniques with a needle and thread are truly eye-popping and are currently being passed down to a new generation of \u201cpetites mains.\u201dAnd partly because it is, as Maria Grazia Chiuri, the artistic director of Dior, told me before her show, a \u201clab\u201d for a designer to experiment with ideas and techniques that then may trickle down to the ready-to-wear, which then explode out to the mass market.In other words, couture is part of the origin story for a lot of what you may buy. You might as well understand where it came from. That\u2019s why we still go, anyway. It\u2019s not for the baguettes.Besides, it\u2019s also a sneak peek of what you are going to see on the red carpet come awards time. Celebrities love a dress made just for them that hasn\u2019t really been seen before, and that\u2019s couture by definition. It\u2019s a coincidence that Giorgio Armani held his show the day the Oscar nominations came out, but it\u2019s a telling one.Isabelle Huppert (in a black tux), Marion Cotillard (in jeans, a striped shirt and a major ear cuff) and Diane Kruger (in an evening gown, though it was only 6 p.m. on a Tuesday) were all in the audience.Guess-the-gown has become something of a parlor game to pass the time between shows, but all I\u2019ll say is this: My top four shows of the week were Givenchy, Valentino, Iris van Herpen and Maison Margiela.I think the odds are high that something from the first two will show up come Academy Awards day \u2014 though Margiela and van Herpen would be more challenging. Nevertheless I dearly wish someone would break all the rules and wear one of the latter\u2019s eye-boggling 3D-printed, heat-bonded and laser-cut dresses on the red carpet. It would be worth it just to see the look on Ryan Seacrest\u2019s face.First, try a tunic and leggings. The bottoms can be as basic (and stretchy and replaceable) as you like, but switch up the tops \u2014 which should be long enough to never put you in a compromising position, but allow for a more feminine edge \u2014 with patterns and colors. Good places to try are Tibi, Cos and Tory Burch.Another possible solution is a shirtdress over loose trousers. This is a Phoebe Philo look, and should also check your main boxes (coverage, flexibility) but give you a chance to inject a bit of personality into your wardrobe while still looking professional. Try Everlane, Equipment and Zara.As for your shoes, the verdict was unanimous: Go for white Stan Smiths or Converse, and wear them with everything. Instead of merely a sneaker, they can become a signature. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMANAdvertisement"}

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wynn Resorts Slides on Report of Sexual Misconduct by C.E.O: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Steve Wynn is accused by several former employees of sexual misconduct over the years.\u2022 What he told C.E.O.s in Davos about Nafta and economic growth.\u2022 What\u2019s happening at Dell?Shares of Wynn Resorts tumbled almost 9 percent in afternoon trading after a report of sexual misconduct by its founder and chief executive.From the article by Alexandra Berzon, Chris Kirkham, Elizabeth Bernstein and Kate O\u2019Keeffe:Former employees said they sometimes entered fake appointments in the books to help other female workers get around a request for services in Mr. Wynn\u2019s office or arranged for others to pose as assistants so they wouldn\u2019t be alone with him. They told of female employees hiding in the bathroom or back rooms when they learned he was on the way to the salon.\u201cEverybody was petrified,\u201d said Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the salon. Mr. Nielsen said he and others repeatedly told high-level company executives that Mr. Wynn\u2019s sexual advances were causing a problem, but \u201cnobody was there to help us.\u201dMr. Wynn told the WSJ, \u201cThe idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous\u201d and blamed his ex-wife, Elaine, of instigating the investigation. Ms. Wynn disputed that assertion.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIn a surprise decision, the United States International Trade Commission struck down a Commerce Department recommendation to place steep duties on imported Canadian jets.From the NYT\u2019s Ana Swanson:\u201cThe case was brought by Boeing, which accused the Canadian jet maker Bombardier of subsidizing its products and selling them at unfairly low prices in the United States in violation of American trade rules.\u201d\u201dThe Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries aircraft. But the trade commission, a quasi-judicial body of trade experts, disagreed.As is its usual practice, the commission did not explain the factors behind its decision.Critics cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFor the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency, to unanimously reject the arguments of America\u2019s largest exporter and the Trump administration is a stunning rebuke. It suggests that President Donald Trump may find it as hard to back up some of his tough trade talk as trying to dismantle Obamacare and build a wall on the Mexican border.\u201cFor Boeing, the verdict will redouble the pressure it faces to strike a deal with Embraer, whose E-jet family competes head-on with Bombardier.\u201dPresident Trump used his speech to set out his economic record, while seeking to reconcile his \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionist stance with a call for free trade and foreign investment.Mr. Trump took credit for the strong American economy, which he said had followed \u201cyears of stagnation.\u201d He also pointed to rising stock prices, improving consumer and business confidence, and job growth. Growth in gross domestic product since he took office, however, is similar to that of 2014 and 2015.Addressing the World Economic Forum, the Alpine conclave of business and political elites that American presidents have usually shunned, Mr. Trump said he would \u201calways put America first, just as the leaders of other countries should put their countries first.\u201d\u201cBut America first does not mean America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the United States grows, so does the world.\u201dMr. Trump \u2014 never invited when he was a businessman \u2014 also delivered the message that the United States was open for business, appealing for international investment.But he hit one of his favorite themes: that the global free trade regime has often treated the United States unjustly.\u201cWe cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal, because in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.\u201dMr. Trump specifically mentioned theft of intellectual property and central government direction of economies. In the past, he has linked those practices with China, but on Friday he did not do so.\u2014Richard Perez-PenaCritics\u2019 cornerRob Cox and Una Galani of Breakingviews:\u201cWhat was new in Trump\u2019s Davos appearance aside from the style was the framing of his administration\u2019s approach to trade and the like. Rather than bashing the Chinese for stealing American jobs, he stuck to larger principles of fairness. The United States \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual-property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a rational argument \u2013 and hints at something like leadership.\u201dWhat Salesforce C.E.O. Marc Benioff tweeted after the speech:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHe also spoke openly about the White House\u2019s internal debate about Nafta, and whether he would need to rip it up and start over.Our colleague Peter Goodman told us more about the president\u2019s dinner with European business leaders last night:The message was that the U.S. is open for business and eager to welcome fresh investment. Attendees included the heads of Siemens, Adidas, HSBC and Volvo.Many of the European corporate chieftains arrived at the dinner concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative words about a possible trade war, his harsh treatment of immigrants, his skepticism about climate change, and his apparent disdain for international cooperation. But in the course of a conversation with the C.E.O.s, moderated by Gary Cohn, the dinner appears to have assuaged the worst concerns, leaving many convinced that Mr. Trump employs outrage as a negotiating tactic while pursuing pragmatic aims.\u201cThere\u2019s a very constructive mind-set in the Trump administration to find the best path forward,\u201d one attendee, Vas Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Novartis, said.More from the World Economic ForumIt was taken private by Michael Dell and Silver Lake in 2013 and closed its takeover of EMC, one of the biggest-ever tech deals, in 2016. Now it\u2019s reviewing what it could do next.\u2022 A full takeover of VMware, of which it owns 80 percent\u2022 An I.P.O. of Pivotal Software, a cloud-services providerThe deals flyaroundBut not everyone at the bank is comfortable with the approach. More from Landon Thomas Jr. of the NYT:\u201cThis would be a cultural and organizational shift for the bank, which has not engaged with the private sector in a substantial way,\u201d said Joel Hellman, a former top economist at the bank who is now dean of Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \u201cWorld Bank staffers are used to talking to governments, and now they have to leverage the private sector? It is a different skill set, and flexibility is not the hallmark of development institutions.\u201dDeal-makers and investors think Airbnb could go public as soon as this year.

{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.More misconduct newsAndrew\u2019s take:\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them. He did the opposite. He stayed on script and made a compelling argument for investment in the U.S. C.E.O.s from around the world wanted selfies with him.\u201dPer Daniel Yergin of IHS Markit:\u201cHe was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.\u201dAnd Ishmael Sunga of the Southern Africa Confederation of Agricultural Unions:\u201cHe made no controversial statements. He was talking to the crowd of people that he\u2019s been brought up to be part of.\u201dThe bigger pictureMore from Jonathan Swan, David McCabe, Ina Fried and Kim Hart of Axios:The memo argues that a strong 5G network is needed in order to create a secure pathway for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and virtual reality \u2014 and to combat Chinese threats to America\u2019s economic and cyber security. A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.The bigger pictureAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown? Here\u2019s the take of Dan Leal, a pornographer who bought followers:\u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dCoincheck has until Feb. 13 to explain the cause of the incident and how it will stop it happening again.\u201cThe problem now is that innovation is not viewed as an unalloyed way to improve the human condition. And that\u2019s fair, because it\u2019s not pure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d a coming-of-age tale set in Sacramento, was honored with prizes for best comedy and Saoirse Ronan\u2019s acting.The major TV winners were the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which received four Globes, including awards for Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern; \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d a new Amazon series that collected two prizes, including best TV comedy; and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which received two Globes, including best TV drama.\u201cWhen that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said. She received multiple standing ovations \u2014 some people stayed standing as she spoke \u2014 and finished her comments with an assertion of hope, looking forward to \u201cthe day when nobody ever has to say \u2018Me too\u2019 again.\u201dHere\u2019s a guide to the Golden Globes nominees that are both streamable and worth your time from Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.For some people watching at home, the pronouncements struck a hypocritical note. Weren\u2019t some of these people the same ones who had been silent about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior for decades?And Ms. Winfrey, of course, was accepting an award named for a man who had helped cement a culture of male domination in Hollywood. It was also notable that many of the men who won awards did not mention the current reckoning that Hollywood is undergoing regarding sexual harassment and the role of women in entertainment.But several movies received nothing, most notably Steven Spielberg\u2019s newspaper drama \u201cThe Post,\u201d which was nominated for six prizes. \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d \u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cMudbound\u201d and \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d were also ignored.The night\u2019s first award went to Ms. Kidman, who won best actress in a television movie or limited series. \u201cPower of women!\u201d she said, holding up her Globe and name checking her female co-stars. Ms. Kidman won for her role in \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d in which she plays a battered wife who summons the courage to leave her husband. Her co-star Alexander Skarsgard won for best supporting actor, and the show won for best limited series or TV movie.As expected, Hulu\u2019s adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel about the repression of women, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d matched its best drama win last year at the Emmy Awards. Elisabeth Moss, who stars in that series, also repeated her Emmys win, collecting the trophy for best actress in a drama. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star Sterling K. Brown was named best dramatic actor, the first time in Globes history that a black man had won that prize.\u201cYou wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,\u201d Mr. Brown said in his speech, thanking the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d creator, Dan Fogelman, for creating his part. \u201cI am being seen for who I am, and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me.\u201d(It was a reminder of how much has changed in Hollywood in recent months. Kevin Spacey won the category at the 72nd ceremony for his performance in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a series that fired him late last year after men came forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances.)The Amazon series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d about a perfectionist 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic, won the Globe for best TV comedy, and its star, Rachel Brosnahan, collected the trophy for best actress in a comedy.\u201cTheir support was completely unwavering,\u201d Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show\u2019s creator, said of Amazon from the stage while wearing a top hat festooned with feathers. She made no mention of Roy Price, who had helped push forward the series before resigning in October following accusations of sexual harassment.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create hierarchies \u2014 saying that women in Hollywood are more important than other women,\u201d Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a British network of organizations dedicated to ending violence against black women, said on the E! arrivals special. \u201cWe have a platform, and we\u2019re trying to use it in the best way we possibly can.\u201d Ms. Larasi attended as Emma Watson\u2019s guest.But the tone on the red carpet was not entirely serious. Smiles abounded. Along with discussion about women\u2019s rights came lighthearted banter by nominees about butterflies (the stomach variety) and some of the usual fashion chitchat. Alexis Bledel carried a black crystal clutch from Onna Ehrlich; Gucci dressed Margot Robbie and Dakota Johnson.And inside the ballroom, the ceremony in many ways felt like business as usual. Stars, producers and studio executives schmoozed in frantic fashion during the commercial breaks and straight through some awards. The vibe even approached easygoing and carefree \u2014 as if Hollywood felt it had exculpated itself with all of the serious talk on the red carpet and the sharp-edged jokes Mr. Meyers cracked during his monologue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM May Finally Stop Shrinking. But Is It a Turnaround?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five and a half years, nearly the entire tenure of its chief executive, Virginia M. Rometty, IBM has reported a steady erosion of revenue.Selling off its chip manufacturing and smaller data-center computer businesses contributed to the decline. So, too, did the fact that new businesses like cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence had not yet grown big enough to make up for the downturn in IBM\u2019s traditional hardware and software products.But IBM\u2019s half-decade losing streak will most likely end on Thursday, analysts predict, when the company reports its quarterly performance.The crossover to growth would be a long-awaited bright spot for Ms. Rometty and IBM, a challenged giant that has been overshadowed in recent years by the younger technology giants on the West Coast.Even if IBM delivers a revenue gain, however, the bigger question facing the company remains: Has Ms. Rometty turned it around?Skeptics abound. IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company\u2019s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cIs a turnaround afoot? I don\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company\u2019s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers.The new businesses \u2014 \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d IBM calls them \u2014 now account for 45 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations \u2014 and gained converts.The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM\u2019s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM\u2019s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year.IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward.Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google.The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis \u2014 all delivered via the cloud and available \u00e0 la carte.IBM\u2019s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter.\u201cWe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.\u201dCompanies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure.AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant\u2019s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM \u2014 a longtime technology supplier to AT&T \u2014 was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T\u2019s president of business operations.The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.\u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201dThat was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.\u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201dThe start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Alexandra Alter, who covers the books industry for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Given that you write about the books industry, how do you prefer to read books? On a Kindle or iPad or some other device, or printed books? I still love print books and find it to be a much more relaxing and immersive experience, but when I\u2019m reading books for work \u2014 honestly, the bulk of my reading \u2014 the Kindle is incredibly convenient. I have all my books on a single device that I always have with me. I read advance copies of books that way: Publishers send me digital copies through NetGalley or Edelweiss, sites where book industry professionals and critics can get digital copies of books before they\u2019re published.I like that e-books are searchable, which is helpful for fact-checking, and the device stores all my notes and highlights, so I can quickly look stuff up when I\u2019m writing. And I can read with one hand on a crowded train. One of my mild phobias is being trapped somewhere, on a plane or a stalled train or in a line, with nothing to read, and I also have the Kindle reader app on my iPhone, so I always have my entire library with me.How is technology affecting the publishing industry?About a decade ago, when Amazon introduced its first e-reader, publishers panicked that digital books would take over the industry, the way digital transformed the music industry. And for a while, that fear seemed totally justified. At one point, the growth trajectory for e-books was more than 1,200 percent. Bookstores suffered, and print sales lagged. E-books also made self-publishing easier, which threatened traditional publishers.One possible reason is that e-book prices have gone up, so in some cases they\u2019re more expensive than a paperback edition. Another possibility is digital fatigue. People spend so much time in front of screens that when they read they want to be offline. Another theory is that some e-book readers have switched to audiobooks, which are easy to play on your smartphone while you\u2019re multitasking. And audiobooks have become the fastest-growing format in the industry.Self-publishing has been one of the most fascinating corners of the industry to me. There have been a handful of massively successful self-published authors who have started their own publishing companies, and they\u2019ve started to publish other \u201cself-published\u201d authors. But publishers have survived so far through consolidation, and we\u2019ll probably see more of that.What will be the fate of physical bookstores? And what do you think about Amazon\u2019s bookstores?I\u2019ll be curious to see how Indigo Books, the Canadian chain, will do here next year when it expands into the United States. Maybe it will shake up the model.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?I am, my family would confirm, not great with gadgets. It would be fair to say that I\u2019m actively bad with them. I\u2019m wary of some of the new home assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home, not necessarily because I\u2019m paranoid about my conversations being recorded \u2014 Amazon and Google already know everything about me \u2014 but because my kids would likely be yelling at the devices all the time, and the Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande songs would play in an endless loop.What tech is popular with your family?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201dThe analysts add:\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.\u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201dG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow\u2019s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT\u2019s Stacy Cowley reports:When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director \u2014after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 could only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u201d That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president.The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.Ensuring that financial services are not badly hit by Brexit is a top priority for the UK, since the sector is Britain\u2019s biggest source of exports and tax revenue.Theresa May\u2019s government has also argued that if the City is damaged it would adversely affect financial stability and EU groups\u2019 cost of financing, while contributing to the fragmentation of the sector.But participants said that in the EU27 meeting the European Commission played down the risks of cutting off the City to EU businesses, saying the financial sector was mobile enough to adapt.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSince then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm.

Many others aren\u2019t.The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling.

{"Headline": "Inside Amazon Go, a Store of the Future", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe technology inside Amazon\u2019s new convenience store, opening Monday in downtown Seattle, enables a shopping experience like no other \u2014 including no checkout lines. SEATTLE \u2014 The first clue that there\u2019s something unusual about Amazon\u2019s store of the future hits you right at the front door. It feels as if you are entering a subway station. A row of gates guard the entrance to the store, known as Amazon Go, allowing in only people with the store\u2019s smartphone app.Inside is an 1,800-square foot mini-market packed with shelves of food that you can find in a lot of other convenience stores \u2014 soda, potato chips, ketchup. It also has some food usually found at Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that Amazon owns.But the technology that is also inside, mostly tucked away out of sight, enables a shopping experience like no other. There are no cashiers or registers anywhere. Shoppers leave the store through those same gates, without pausing to pull out a credit card. Their Amazon account automatically gets charged for what they take out the door.On Monday, the store will open to the public for the first time. Gianna Puerini, the executive in charge of Amazon Go, recently gave tours of the store, in downtown Seattle. This is a look at what shoppers will encounter. There are no shopping carts or baskets inside Amazon Go. Since the checkout process is automated, what would be the point of them anyway? Instead, customers put items directly into the shopping bag they\u2019ll walk out with. \u201cWe\u2019ve just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience,\u201d Ms. Puerini said.Most people who spend any time in a supermarket understand how vexing the checkout process can be, with clogged lines for cashiers and customers who fumble with self-checkout kiosks.At Amazon Go, checking out feels like \u2014 there\u2019s no other way to put it \u2014 shoplifting. It is only a few minutes after walking out of the store, when Amazon sends an electronic receipt for purchases, that the feeling goes away. Actual shoplifting is not easy at Amazon Go. With permission from Amazon, I tried to trick the store\u2019s camera system by wrapping a shopping bag around a $4.35 four-pack of vanilla soda while it was still on a shelf, tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store. Amazon charged me for it.A big unanswered question is where Amazon plans to take the technology. It won\u2019t say whether it plans to open more Amazon Go stores, or leave this as a one-of-a-kind novelty. A more intriguing possibility is that it could use the technology inside Whole Foods stores, though Ms. Puerini said Amazon has \u201cno plans\u201d to do so. There\u2019s even speculation that Amazon could sell the system to other retailers, much as it sells its cloud computing services to other companies. For now, visitors to Amazon Go may want to watch their purchases: Without a register staring them in the face at checkout, it\u2019s easy to overspend. Advertisement"}

With \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d the format takes its next evolutionary step, with a new story and creative team for each episode.The approach is unlike that of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d or FX\u2019s other major anthology success, Noah Hawley\u2019s \u201cFargo,\u201d where stories unwind over an entire season. And it differs from shows like HBO\u2019s \u201cRoom 104,\u201d where the stories and cast change every episode but all are driven by the distinct auteur sensibility of the Duplass Brothers (the show\u2019s creators), which lends a tonal seamlessness from week to week.By contrast, the \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d creative teams, which include veterans of \u201cThe Night Manager,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the Harry Potter universe, were given free rein by the showrunner, Michael Dinner, to veer wildly from episode to episode, from satirical to earnest to deeply, psychedelically strange. \u201cEveryone is trying to do original things to stand out, so you\u2019re not boxed into a format anymore,\u201d said one of the executive producers, Ronald D. Moore, who is best known for creating the acclaimed 2004 \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d reboot.There are some clear advantages to the anthology format. For one, shows can be written in satisfying movie-like arcs, rather than the open-ended storytelling that traditional TV requires. And major stars are much more willing to sign on for a single season, or in the case of \u201cElectric Dreams,\u201d a single episode. \u201cWe had so many actors who were interested because of that,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, I can come in for five days and get it done?\u2019 That\u2019s a very appealing prospect.\u201dThe actors attracted to the series included Bryan Cranston of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (also one of the show\u2019s executive producers), Steve Buscemi, Maura Tierney and the avant-R&B singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e. And \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d attracted writers and directors like Dee Rees (\u201cMudbound\u201d), Peter Horton (\u201cAmerican Odyssey,\u201d \u201cThirtysomething\u201d) and Alan Taylor (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d).Dick\u2019s daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, whose production company Electric Shepherd oversees adaptations of her father\u2019s work, reached out in 2012 to Mr. Dinner, executive producer of FX\u2019s \u201cJustified,\u201d and invited him to look at the short stories. \u201cMichael really had the idea to do it as anthology,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a friend of Mr. Dinner\u2019s who was brought on soon after.Mr. Dinner, who had a deal with Sony, also recruited Mr. Cranston, who, like the others, is a major Philip K. Dick fan. All four brought in people they\u2019d worked with as well as reaching out to talent they admired. \u201cI sent Janelle Mon\u00e1e a letter and asked her if she\u2019d want to be a part of it,\u201d Ms. Hackett said. \u201cI knew that she was a big fan of my dad\u2019s.\u201dEpisodes include \u201cThe Commuter,\u201d starring Timothy Spall, about a mysterious British town that doesn\u2019t appear on any maps, and Mr. Cranston\u2019s \u201cHuman Is,\u201d which ponders whether it\u2019s better to be married to a to a total jerk or an attentive guy who happens to be bodysnatched by an alien. Mr. Moore wrote the episode \u201cReal Life,\u201d which stars Terrence Howard and Anna Paquin and deals with virtual reality. And Ms. Mon\u00e1e plays an android who falls in with a band of post-apocalyptic survivors in her episode, \u201cAutofac.\u201dBut the show\u2019s creative freedom came at a cost in terms of complexity and difficulty for the producers. Scheduling and delivery pressures required two concurrent full-scale productions in London and Chicago. Each episode needed new sets, costumes, locations, casts and more. \u201cIt\u2019s backbreaking,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cNone of us knew how much more expensive and time-consuming this would be than a typical show.\u201dIt\u2019s a little hard to believe now, but during his lifetime Dick was a fringe figure, even in science fiction circles. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would ever have imagined that \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 would have a Philip K. Dick category,\u201d Ms. Hackett said of her father.And what would he have made of a TV series based on his work, hosted on a newfangled thing called a streaming service that is available to watch at any time and on all sorts of devices? \u201cThe way that he felt about his work being adapted is ambivalent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think he would love that every person that took this on did it because they love his work and wanted to do their version of P.K.D. There\u2019s love all over it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Eisner Sketches a Happy Ending for Portsmouth F.C.", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerJust like in any sports movie worth its salt, the montage told the story best.In early May 2017, Michael Eisner arrived at the Guildhall in Portsmouth, England, to face 1,500 fans of the city\u2019s soccer team. His task was a delicate one: to persuade at least 75 percent of them to sell their beloved club, Portsmouth F.C., to \u201can ancient Hollywood executive\u201d and his sons.There would be, he knew, a degree of skepticism. Portsmouth\u2019s previous experience with foreign owners suggested they brought nothing but trouble. First under Russian-Israeli, and then Emirati, Saudi and Nepali ownership, the century-old club had sunk all the way from the Premier League to League Two, English soccer\u2019s fourth tier. It had flirted with oblivion; only a consortium comprising some 3,000 local fans, reaching into their own pockets, had saved it from extinction.Facing those fan-owners, Eisner realized he had a tough sell. He knew it would not be enough to turn up to the Guildhall and \u201csit on a stool and pontificate.\u201d A naval base on England\u2019s south coast, Portsmouth is a tough, tight-knit sort of a place; being lectured by a mogul who had just jetted in from California with no prior knowledge of or investment in soccer would not go over well.Instead, he started with a 25-minute presentation \u2014 \u201cThe sort I have done all my life,\u201d Eisner said. He laid out his vision for what Portsmouth F.C. would be under the aegis of the Tornante Company, his investment firm. \u201cWe did not promise to spend hundreds of millions of pounds, to build up debt,\u201d Eisner said. \u201cI said, \u2018If that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m not the guy.\u2019\u201d Instead, he preached caution, continuity: \u201cSlow and steady.\u201dAnd then, just before he and his sons answered fans\u2019 questions for an hour, Eisner directed his audience to the short video montage he had made. \u201cWinning feels good, and it sure is fun,\u201d he said as he turned toward the screen at his back. \u201cThis should give you an idea of what I mean.\u201dThe montage took in Eisner\u2019s real-life sporting success during his two decades leading Disney \u2014 the Anaheim Angels winning baseball\u2019s World Series; the Anaheim Ducks lifting hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup \u2014 but also nodded to Portsmouth\u2019s winning the F.A. Cup in 2008, and its sealing promotion out of League Two only a couple of weeks before the gathering.No distinction was made, no line drawn, between the real and the imagined, the spontaneous and the scripted. There was no need to do that, in Eisner\u2019s eyes. The films all followed the same narrative: the triumph of the underdog.\u201cIf it\u2019s a good sports movie, it\u2019s to do with winning,\u201d Eisner said. Sports and movies, to Eisner, are the same thing at heart: They are both \u2014 they are all \u2014 stories. He has spent his career telling them, and Portsmouth is simply the latest.That is not to say that this is some whim. He is asked \u201call the time\u201d why he has, at age 75, chosen to get involved with the ownership of an English soccer team, particularly one so stripped of glamour and so deprived of investment as Portsmouth. Even his wife has ventured the question.\u201cThe only thing in the future, and today, that is appointment to view,\u201d he said of live sports. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in hockey: you skate to where the puck is going to be. This is a good place to be in the media.\u201dThen, inspired by his ownership of the Topps trading card company and encouraged by visits to Arsenal with his son, he decided that English soccer was a better bet. He discussed buying a Premier League team, but when a Chinese investor gazumped his offer on one club, he decided to alter his strategy.\u201cI thought about promotion and relegation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I paid a Premier League price to get into this exclusive club, and they got relegated, I would fall into a deep depression. But if I bought a club in League One or League Two, where the upside was big and the downside small, where you can build up, not fall off the floor, that would be better.\u201dBut it also may be what made Portsmouth so attractive to Eisner: the sense that there is a story here to be told, something to build, a team to take from the depths to the heights. That is the narrative arc of the sports movies he knows so well, after all \u2014 the small made mighty, the underdog rising from obscurity to greatness.It is a story into which Eisner has thrown himself. The little things hint at his commitment. He says \u201cpitch,\u201d not \u201cfield.\u201d He pronounces Portsmouth, as the British do, with the emphasis on the first syllable, not the last, as most outsiders might.So far, fans seem encouraged by what they have seen. Mark Catlin, a chief executive first installed by the Pompey Supporters\u2019 Trust, remains in place, running the club\u2019s day-to-day operations. \u201cIt is still early days, but there is a different competence level,\u201d said Colebrook, compared to what has gone before.Much will depend on what Eisner can do with Fratton Park, Portsmouth\u2019s evocative but crumbling home. In December, he invited the famed architect Robert A. M. Stern to a match to pick his brain on a potential redesign. \u201cThat is where he will be able to leave a legacy,\u201d Colebrook said.Eisner is not in a rush. He is preaching caution, the slow and steady progress he discussed on the stage at the Guildhall. He says he is not going to do something \u201ccrazy.\u201d Portsmouth has tried that before, that \u201ctemporary high and enormous low.\u201d It is a story the club, and city, knows all too well. It is not a story that ends in a montage, and it is not the story Eisner is here to tell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Curling Can Make It in Tampa, It Can Make It Everywhere", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "It was Saturday, Dec. 16, 2017, and 75 degrees outside the LongHorn Steakhouse at the Tampa Premium Outlets. Bernard Skerkowski, an accountant, was running late. When he arrived with his partner, Lisa Wycoff, they ordered \u201cthe usual,\u201d a rum and Diet Coke and a Cosmo. \u201cWe\u2019re not alcoholics,\u201d Skerkowski clarified. \u201cBut once you see these guys, you\u2019ll know why we need a drink.\u201dThe guys in question were fellow members of the Tampa Bay Curling Club. Skerkowski, its 58-year-old founder, grew up playing the sport in Canada before moving in the early 1990s to Florida, where expanses of ice are as exotic as man-eating reptiles are commonplace. Two and a half decades later, when he heard that a huge skating complex would be opening in nearby Wesley Chapel, Skerkowski started ordering equipment and plotting to reserve three hours of weekly rink time, which the facility priced at $450 per hour. He would persuade a few dozen snowbirds to join him or eat his investment. In fact, when he offered demonstrations early last year to gauge interest, more than a hundred Floridians signed up: big, small, old, young, athletic, arthritic. All they had in common was their raw enthusiasm for the sport, matched by their near-total ignorance of how to play it.Skerkowski \u2014 whose own imposing physique belies his gracefulness on ice \u2014 resolved to teach them. He arrived early to make sure a Zamboni driver flooded the surface, which mitigates skate scars (a stray hair can redirect a stone), and to help bolt starting-block-like \u201chacks\u201d into place. Then, using a hose from a shoulder-borne water pack, he sprinkled the frozen surface, creating \u201cpebbles\u201d for the rocks to slide on. When the curious recruits arrived, he gave them lessons in how to crouch, push off from a hack and deliver a 42-pound stone, diamond-cut from one of the world\u2019s only two quarries, in Wales and Scotland, that have the right quality of granite; how to \u201csweep\u201d the ice with a broom to make the rock go farther and straighter while en route to the bull\u2019s-eye-like \u201chouse.\u201d By last September, he had trained enough beginners to hold an actual league season. Now, just three months later, several of his more ambitious disciples were eager to enter national tournaments, or \u201cbonspiels.\u201d When Skerkowski gently encouraged them to focus on gaining experience, he began to hear rumors of an imminent leadership coup.\u201cTheir etiquette isn\u2019t quite there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing is, they\u2019re so excited about the rocks and the house, they stand up close looking at it, which you\u2019re not allowed to do. The other thing is cutting across the ice. And you sort of don\u2019t cheer for bad things to happen to the other team\u2019s stone. But tell that to people who want their team to win. Oh, my God, there\u2019s a big learning curve. I think in retrospect I made a mistake. I have this trophy that everyone is vying for, and I think I shouldn\u2019t have done that. It\u2019s not about the cheap-ass trophy.\u201dWhat none of his would-be usurpers knew was that between equipment, national club dues, ice time, beer and pizza, Skerkowski had poured at least $10,000 of his own money into the enterprise. \u201cBernie Skerkowski is the Tampa Curling Club,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie could make it all go away. I\u2019m looking for fun. I\u2019m looking for learning, for people to have a good time \u2014 not all this crazy competition-type thing.\u201dOver the last 15 years, membership in the United States Curling Association doubled to 20,000. As Kate Caithness, the president of the World Curling Federation, put it to me recently: \u201cThe U.S., you are our sleeping giant. The sleeping giant has woken up.\u201d Afghanistan, Brazil, Guyana, Mexico, Mongolia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have also begun to embrace the sport, whose chief appeal may lie in its ability to revive a singular crushed dream: \u201cYou see ice dance or skiing and think, I\u2019ll never be an Olympic champion,\u201d Caithness says. \u201cBut curling, you can.\u201dSkerkowski is counting on this year\u2019s Games to spur hundreds of Tampa residents to join his club. In anticipation, he will forgo league play for the summer to offer more beginner clinics. He dreams of soon having a rink with dedicated curling ice, perfect, unscarred by hockey skates. More people could play \u2014 and practice, which, because of scheduling and cost restrictions, is impossible now.\u201cYou got my drink?\u201d Skerkowski called to Lisa, having repaired from the LongHorn to the skate complex, where they set about unloading equipment from the bed of his pickup. \u201cThis is Diet Coke,\u201d Wycoff said, handing him a travel mug.\u201cBecause I am an old man, this is Captain Morgan and Diet Coke,\u201d Skerkowski said as they crossed the parking lot and entered the facility. \u201cHello, guys!\u201d he bellowed at no one in particular. \u201cCurling night! Curling night!\u201dEager to help him set up were two young fathers whose purple pants featured cats shooting lightning bolts out of their paws. \u201cBernie said: \u2018You want to be different. You want to stand out,\u2019\u2009\u201d one of them, Jason Wagner, explained. \u201cSo I got on Amazon and I looked up \u2018wild curling pants,\u2019 and these are the ones that came up.\u201dTheir squad watched the United States Olympic team trials in Omaha, Neb., on TV. \u201cWe were studying it so hard,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cWe would spend the entire night talking about it.\u201d\u201cHe will not do anything but this,\u201d Amanda, Wagner\u2019s wife said.\u201cYou never know,\u201d Wagner went on. \u201cWe might have new dreams of taking it all the way. We could be the first team from Wesley Chapel, Fla. \u2014 \u201d\u201cTwo thousand forty-seven!\u201d his teammate Jimmy Burd interrupted. (There will not, in fact, be a Winter Olympics in 2047.) \u201cThis is how unknown it is,\u201d Burd said. \u201cI have a bunch of friends in the area. I told them, \u2018Hey, does anyone want to help sponsor our curling team?\u2019 And somebody actually said to me, \u2018Like biceps curls?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cLadies and gentlemen! May I have your attention, please?\u201d Skerkowski\u2019s voice ricocheted off the boards. He called roll for the teams and informed them that the pitchers of beer being carted out onto the ice were courtesy of the club. (Pairing curling and imbibing is tradition, presumably begun with Scotch.) \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d he continued. \u201cLook at this beautiful trophy. That\u2019s solid gold. At least that\u2019s what I reported on my tax returns.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Canadian,\u201d someone whispered meaningfully.Scott Gargasz, one of the club\u2019s only experienced players, passed around copies of a booklet he wrote for the league, \u201cCurling Rules and Etiquette.\u201d Skerkowski encouraged everyone to read it and offer feedback. \u201cRemember, despite what you all think, it\u2019s not about Bernie. It\u2019s about the Tampa Bay Curling Club and making the sport of curling a better place for everyone in Tampa Bay,\u201d he said by way of adjournment. There was a general hurrah, and then the teams took the ice.Joy and Dennis Meyers, who identified themselves as the club\u2019s No. 1 (and so far only) fans, came every weekend to cheer for their son, Michael, 42, and grandson, Chris, 15. \u201cThis is a fun league, I\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cWhat I like about it is there\u2019s no hotheads.\u201dAfter two hours, a 10-minute warning bell signaled the final throws of the night; winners and losers alike then headed to the bar upstairs for a club-sponsored pizza party. Except for Skerkowski himself, who lingered, as was his habit, to bait bystanders with a free tutorial.\u201cThe rock is going to pull you down the ice \u2014 look up!\u201d he hollered at one participant. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking up! Look at that! Woooo!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to push off because you might hurt yourself, right?\u201d he asked another, adding, without a trace of sarcasm, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to be scared.\u201dWhen it was finally time to cede the ice, he shooed away this latest batch of doubtless future Olympic hopefuls. \u201cNow,\u201d he informed them, \u201cwe go drink.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the curling-club teammate who found the squad\u2019s uniform online and who described watching Olympic team trials on TV. It was Jason Wagner, not Sean Moats.\nAdvertisement"}

Usually in this space, my colleague Mike Isaac and I chat about the week\u2019s tech news. But Mike is now fixing to become a big-time author. For the next few months, he\u2019ll be out on book leave, which leaves me free to run this show on my own!Strap in. Let\u2019s talk about some of the big stories in tech this week.It\u2019s that time of the year \u2014 CES! The world\u2019s largest technology convention is again taking place in Las Vegas, bringing thousands of nerds to see some really cool stuff that will probably never be released.I kid, but that\u2019s generally how this goes. CES used to be cool for all the new stuff companies unveiled there, but then it got so crowded that it didn\u2019t make sense to put out your product in the torrent of announcements. Now the biggest companies skip the event, so we\u2019re left with a lot of strange news from unheard-of companies.On the other hand: When the self-driving suitcase is perfected, I\u2019m buying one.When President Trump tweeted a threat of nuclear war against North Korea this month, it at the very least seemed to constitute a threat of violence that might violate Twitter\u2019s terms of service. The company has lately been trying to crack down on abusive accounts. So some people on Twitter started to wonder, would the company possibly decide that Mr. Trump had crossed the line?Sure, if Twitter barred him, he could always just go on TV and say what he had planned to tweet. But that would be slower and less automatic, and perhaps \u2014 I\u2019m going out on a limb here \u2014 he might not blurt out threats of nuclear war.This is a small slowdown, but it\u2019s not insignificant. After all, people buy new computers for speed, so being hit with a slowdown after you\u2019ve already purchased the thing is going to make lots of customers seethe.Unless the government steps in with stricter penalties, this system seems headed for catastrophe. Everything is interconnected now; it\u2019s only a matter of time until there\u2019s a hack big enough to cause widespread social and economic disruption. We should probably do something about that, maybe?The move could have wide repercussions for media outlets \u2014 which depend on Facebook for traffic \u2014 and potentially for Facebook\u2019s own bottom line. But as with all Facebook product changes, it will probably be months before we know how the move plays out. One thing is for sure: Initially, you\u2019re bound to hate it, because that\u2019s just how it goes with anything new online.O.K., that\u2019s it for now.

{"Headline": "Alexa, We\u2019re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors.The challenge isn\u2019t finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom.A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions.Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 \u201cskills\u201d \u2014 third-party apps that tap into Alexa\u2019s voice controls to accomplish tasks \u2014 it makes available.But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, \u201cpeople are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that there is something that\u2019s going to drive people to use these.\u201dThere is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon.Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services \u2014 like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals.With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes.Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant.For now, consumers\u2019 satisfaction with their smart speakers \u2014 and by extension, the onboard assistants \u2014 is helped in part by the fact they didn\u2019t pay a lot to get them into their homes.Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he\u2019s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that.\u201cThere\u2019s only certain things I use it for, but I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my taxes with it.\u201dPaul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances.\u201cThe more interesting functionality is yet to come,\u201d Mr. Erickson said. \u201cPart of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we\u2019re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.\u201dCompetitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software.Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories \u2014 although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language.Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 \u2014 or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units.There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren\u2019t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad\u2019s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some of its new investments will come from bringing back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it has long held abroad.Under the new tax law, foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated and taxed at reduced rates.Here\u2019s what Apple plans to do:Google, Amazon and Facebook aren\u2019t like the Standard Oil or AT&T of old, gouging consumers on price. (Indeed, many of their services are free.) But if the question is \u201cAre consumers better off?\u201d then could there be an opening for regulatory action?More from Mr. Ip:If market dominance means fewer competitors and less innovation, consumers will be worse off than if those companies had been restrained. \u201cThe impact on innovation can be the most important competitive effect\u201d in an antitrust case, says Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist who served in the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division under Barack Obama.This morning it posted a quarterly loss in part because of the poor performance in its trading unit.The numbers:Federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed an indictment charging Nicolas De-Meyer, 40, with stealing $1.2 million worth of rare wine from a former employer. The former employer in question was Mr. Solomon, who employed Mr. De-Meyer as a personal assistant, according to two sources familiar with the matter.According to the indictment, the wine was stolen from around October 2014 to around October 2016, when Mr. De-Meyer had been asked to transport it from his former employer\u2019s Manhattan apartment to his wine cellar in East Hampton, N.Y.Mr. De-Meyer was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles federal prosecutor\u2019s office. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\u201cThe theft was discovered in the fall of 2016 and reported to law enforcement at that time,\u201d a Goldman spokesman said.The numbers:Let\u2019s recount the hits that U.S. banks took from the tax overhaul:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase: $2.4 billion\u2022 Goldman Sachs: $4.4 billionMore from Jim Tankersley of the NYT:\u201cThe good news is that tax reform has produced both current and future benefits for our shareholders,\u201d PNC\u2019s president and chief executive, Bill Demchak, told analysts on Friday. He said the bank\u2019s preference would be to divert the tax savings \u201ctoward dividend\u201d \u2014 which is to say, to return a higher dividend to shareholders.The conglomerate itself isn\u2019t planning on going that far just yet.Here\u2019s John Flannery, its chief, on a conference call yesterday:\u201cWe are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses. Our results, over the past several years, including 2017 and the insurance charge, only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape G.E.\u201dThe contextCritics demand more boldnessThe issuesThe state of playRed-state Democrats are uneasy about allowing a shutdown in an election year. Some Republicans are irked by a stream of temporary funding resolutions, rather than a full agreement that would permit more military spending.The politics flyaroundMore from Mr. Johnson:What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity.\u201cI have a Zen philosophy that you just go with the flow,\u201d said George Tasick, a part-time cryptocurrency trader in Hong Kong whose day job is making fireworks. \u201cI\u2019m not really changing my behavior in any way.\u201dMore from Jonathan Randles and Peg Brickley of the WSJ:A Chapter 11 filing would halt lawsuits brought by women against the studio, forcing them to line up with low-ranking creditors to await their fate. Once the money from a sale comes in, bankruptcy law dictates who gets paid first \u2014 the banks that kept Weinstein Co. in business \u2014 and who gets paid last \u2014 women claiming that Weinstein Co. was part of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s pattern of alleged sexual misconduct.But it\u2019s complicated. A bankruptcy filing could provide legal structures for Mr. Weinstein\u2019s accusers, like a judge\u2019s supervision of sales and settlements.RICO lawsuits are tempting. They allow a plaintiff to sue a variety of defendants by claiming that they acted together and seek an award of triple damages, a bonanza in some business disputes that can run into millions of dollars. But these cases should also come with a bright red warning sign: Tread lightly or see your case thrown out of court before it even gets started.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Humble Ascent of Oat Milk", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen did finding something to put in your coffee get so complicated?\u201cWe know how it sounds,\u201d Oatly\u2019s website acknowledges. \u201cTall, blond, beautiful, hard to get, extremely liberal with no sense of attachment or responsibility whatsoever. Sorry to disappoint you, that\u2019s just not us.\u201dThe company decided to introduce its product not on grocery shelves but at specialty coffee shops, where baristas could act as oat-milk ambassadors to customers and other professionals within the brewing and roasting communities. In just a year, Oatly has spread from 10 locations in New York to more than 1,000 locations nationwide.Over oat-milk hot chocolates at La Colombe on Vandam Street, a shop regularly flooded by workers from nearby tech companies and art galleries, Josey Markiewicz, who manages training and quality assurance at the cafe, described the Oatly onslaught.Not everyone has been convinced that the milk-alternative boom is a health boon.\u201cFrom a nutritional standpoint, they have some value,\u201d Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, wrote in an email, \u201cbut as is the case with most processed foods, eating the original \u2014 almonds, oatmeal or whatever \u2014 is always better.\u201dSara Haas, a culinary dietitian in Chicago, sees oat milk not as a dairy substitute but as part of a trend, referring to its popularity in Britain.\u201cIf you\u2019re using it just to enjoy in your coffee, and you\u2019re not really looking at it as an equal replacement for dairy, in a nutritional sense, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. But as with any dietary alternative, \u201cyou have to learn to be a label reader, because they\u2019re not all equal.\u201dNor so in price.Because of a higher wholesale price, Oatly comes with a surcharge of $1. But Andrea Allen, who owns Onyx with her husband, Jon, and was impressed by Oatly\u2019s flavor when she sampled it at a trade show, says this hasn\u2019t discouraged customers, many of whom were converted by an oat-milk-focused seasonal menu last fall.\u201cWe\u2019re always on the lookout for something new and tasty that\u2019s in the alternative realm,\u201d Ms. Allen said.Those trying to get their fix at home can buy six-packs of unrefrigerated Oatly on the company\u2019s website and from Amazon, if you\u2019re comfortable schlepping a 14-pound box inside and have ample storage. You can also order chilled quarts of Oatly from FreshDirect for day-of delivery. But you won\u2019t find it in your local grocery store \u2014 yet.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories, particularly here in New York, of some of our coffee partners selling Oatly over the counter, almost like black-market oat milk, to their regulars,\u201d Mr. Messersmith said.Starting next week, however, Oatly will be available at Wegmans. It will arrive on shelves at Fairway, ShopRite and the California grocery chain Bristol Farms in February. After grocery stores, the next logical step may be Big Coffee: Starbucks, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and the death knell of Swedish oat milk\u2019s exclusionary allure.Mr. Markiewicz of La Colombe would be just fine with that.\u201cI would prefer that oat milk become as commonplace as nonfat or whole milk, where people think of it as a third option,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what sustainability is about: eventually making it a part of the fabric of our lives. I don\u2019t care much about the cool factor. Even saying \u2018oat milk\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Names Newark and New York City as \u2018HQ2\u2019 Finalists", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York metropolitan area picked up a one-two punch Thursday in the battle among North American cities hoping to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, when both Newark and New York City landed on the retail giant\u2019s shortlist.More than 238 applications poured in to Amazon from cities and regions vying to become its \u201cHQ2.\u201d Amazon has narrowed the list to 20, with most finalists far from the tech-saturated hubs on the West Coast. Along with Newark and New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Denver and Nashville all made the cut.\u201cNew York gets two bites of the apple,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, of the Anderson Economic Group, which advises cities on economic development and had handicapped the Amazon sweepstakes.Before Amazon released its list of finalists, some analysts had dismissed the chances of either New York City or Newark. New York City was considered too expensive, and Newark was seen as hampered by its reputation as a hardscrabble urban center.But Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the city\u2019s most prominent residents, seemed intent Thursday on trying to capitalize on that image by appealing to Amazon\u2019s potential to be a game-changer for the state\u2019s largest city.\u201cWe have sites ready downtown, or on the waterfront. We have universities and fiber,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cAmazon could have a transformative effect on one of America\u2019s oldest cities. This is an opportunity for Amazon to change the narrative about the company and where it\u2019s headed.\u201dNew York City is already home to a large Amazon distribution center in Staten Island and offices for more than 2,000 finance, sales and marketing workers in Manhattan. New Jersey has three Amazon distribution centers, including one 12 miles from Newark.If Amazon finds housing and the cost of doing business too high in New York City, it could turn to Newark, which sits atop the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard and is in the midst of a resurgence. Office and apartment rents are substantially lower and Amazon already has a subsidiary there, Audible.Either way, Amazon could tap into a tech work force of nearly 300,000 people, far more than Chicago (138,813) or Los Angeles (166,234), two cities that also made Amazon\u2019s shortlist. The impact of 50,000 new jobs would be felt throughout the metro area.\u201cNewark, New York City and Chicago all have very strong workforces,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNewark has the advantage on cost of doing business, which is very important to Amazon.\u201dMr. Anderson had put New York at the top of his list when he rated the competition last fall. Nearly three-quarters of his top 20 picks landed on Amazon\u2019s shortlist.But the eventual winner is by no means a foregone conclusion.The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area presents a triple threat, with three areas \u2014 Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, Md., and the capital itself \u2014 making the list. Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon, has a home in Washington and owns the local newspaper, The Washington Post.Still, there are 100,000 more tech workers in the New York region than in Washington and its suburbs.\u201cThis is what Amazon said they wanted in a candidate,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNo incentives, silly sales pitches or talk of how cool their sports teams are.\u201dBut at this stage of the contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, the subsidy packages that competing cities offer Amazon may influence the decision.\u201cAmazon, like most big companies, is dollars-and-cents oriented,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cHere\u2019s where incentive packages may tip the scales.\u201dThe state of New Jersey, which is backing Newark\u2019s bid, has offered the biggest plum of all: $5 billion in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies. Newark officials have also discussed a supplementary subsidy package that could be worth as much as $2 billion.\u201cIn the last decade, Newark has experienced unparalleled growth, paving the way for many new companies to call our city home. A Newark HQ2 would mean tens of thousands of local jobs, a boost to our regional economy and small businesses, and an opportunity for Amazon to take a tremendous stake in the continued transformation of our great city,\u201d Mr. Booker said.Critics contend that the Garden State is being overly generous with tax dollars.\u201cWe remain wary of the steep price tag for taxpayers that state and local lawmakers have already put on this project,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cIt has ensured that the returns will be minimized if Amazon were to ultimately choose the state.\u201dOn the same day New York City submitted its bid to Amazon, Mr. de Blasio criticized the company for its destructive impact on local shop owners. But at this point, neither that criticism nor the lack of an enhanced subsidy package has hurt New York\u2019s chances.\u201cWe\u2019re not changing our approach,\u201d said Alicia Glen, New York City\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development. \u201cWe offered four very viable options in different neighborhoods. If you want to hire 50,000 incredibly smart people, there\u2019s no better place. And a city that has art, culture, food and urban walkability are a huge priority for this generation of workers.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, a business group that has strongly supported the city\u2019s bid for Amazon, said New York\u2019s chances are good.\u201cAmazon is notoriously cheap and our costs our high,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership\u2019s president. \u201cBut in every other way, New York is a winner. It has the markets they want to reach, the talent and a strong history as a global retail capital. The question is, \u2018Does Bezos sees the value of mixing with the global industries and market leaders that are based in New York?\u2019 \u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Now that, as the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer writes in \u201cWorld Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech,\u201d \u201cour phone is an extension of our memory; we\u2019ve outsourced basic functions to algorithms,\u201d doesn\u2019t the world seem like an ever-larger parking lot that has mysteriously swallowed our Toyota? Don\u2019t we all wish, now more than ever, that acquaintances came equipped with their own \u201cPreviously on this series \u2026\u201d trailer?Mr. Foer and Ms. Saunders aren\u2019t the only writers on this beat. Recent books by Robert Sapolsky, Michael Lemonick, Felicia Yap, Emily Barr, Dale Bredesen, Val Emmich, Oliver Sacks and Elizabeth Rosner, among others, have addressed the theme of non-historical memory. Last July alone, more than a dozen books specifically about the topic, most of them self-published, were released.You\u2019d expect the themes of amnesia or powers of recall to be prevalent in thrillers or in memoirs by trauma survivors or over-beveraged rock stars, but even literary fiction is getting in on the act. In Rachel Khong\u2019s sly, diaristic \u201cGoodbye, Vitamin,\u201d a 30-year-old who moves back home learns she has to care for a dementing father who has started leaving his pants in trees. In Alissa Nutting\u2019s outrageous sex comedy \u201cMade for Love,\u201d a woman on the lam from her tech pioneer husband discovers that he has implanted a chip in her brain that allows him to download all her experiences.A majority of the recent or upcoming books about the topic, though, are nonfiction works that take a prescriptive approach to memory loss. I recently spent a month trying to follow the dictates of two of them, both written by doctors: Daniel G. Amen\u2019s \u201cMemory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss and Remember What Matters Most\u201d and Andrew E. Budson and Maureen K. O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cSeven Steps to Managing Your Memory: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not, and What to Do About It.\u201dThe first thing I noticed about these two workbook-type tomes is, because they\u2019re not intended to be read straight through, they repeat information so frequently as to render a reader frantic about his mental health. I kept wanting to ask Dr. Amen, a physician with his own chain of clinics: Didn\u2019t you pimp turmeric 10 pages ago? Before reading the books, I\u2019d taken eight memory tests that I\u2019d found on various websites, to get a baseline of my powers of recall. Consolingly, I\u2019d tested slightly above average for my age. But once turmeric started to ominously reappear, I felt like Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cMother.\u201dOn the diet and exercise front, the two books were mostly in agreement: Strangely, neither wants you to lie on the couch while idly nursing a stick of French butter. (But take heart, both books want you to eat a little dark chocolate each day. Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor, who teach neurology at Boston University, don\u2019t even stipulate that it needs to be unsweetened.)For me, the doctors\u2019 bodily prescriptions fell into two categories: Things I Already Do, and Things I Can\u2019t Be Bothered to Change. On the former front: I dance two hours a week, walk briskly 30 minutes a day and consume a lot of vegetables and water but not much alcohol or butter. On the latter: Hands off my trusty colleagues caffeine and baked goods, not to mention my occasional visitors, Mr. Charred Meats and Ms. Marijuana.When it came to recommended activities, this Scrabble enthusiast was dismayed to learn from Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor that \u201cthere is not currently strong enough evidence for us to suggest the use of brain-training games.\u201d Rather, they encourage you to learn new skills or information while being social. To this end, I took an Iyengar yoga class. I chatted up a friend about the recent Mayweather-McGregor boxing bout. I had a CVS employee show me how to use a price scanner, and a church employee tell me what an undercroft is. (\u201cAre we in the undercroft now?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes, we\u2019re in the undercroft,\u201d he told me. I felt like I\u2019d wandered into a young adult novel about hot, troubled teens who foil the time-space continuum.)In a similar vein, Dr. Amen encourages you to undertake various activities while using your non-dominant hand. Slight splattery mayhem ensued in my kitchen one night when I tried to slice 30 or so cherry tomatoes in half with my left hand for a salad. It looked like an audience at La Scala had had very strong feelings about our floor tiles.Two of the books\u2019 dictates seemed like they were demonstrably working. First, Dr. Amen recommends that you spend 15 minutes a day in deep prayer or meditation, which \u201creliably activates the prefrontal cortex.\u201d Of the 30 days I tried meditating \u2014 I stare at a spot on the wall, and repeatedly clear my mind \u2014 I was unable to focus eight times and fell asleep once. But two of the sessions led to the most productive workdays I\u2019ve had all year.I also noticed good results with memorization techniques wherein you create images in your mind. One of these is a rhyme that runs, \u201cOne is a bun, two is a shoe, three is a tree\u201d and so on up to 10. Thus, if given a list of words to memorize that starts \u201csally, smokey, desperate,\u201d I\u2019d first imagine the \u201cAll in the Family\u201d co-star Sally Struthers bursting from a hot dog bun; then a pair of shoes being barbecued; and then a tree whose roots spell out \u201ckill me now.\u201d Equally effective was imagining walking through our apartment and finding the 10 words, in groups of two or three, in various rooms. So, I\u2019d imagine opening our front door and finding Sally Struthers, on fire, playing a nonspeaking juror on \u201cLaw and Order.\u201dIn the end? I will probably keep meditating. I will definitely keep imagining 1970s sitcom stars emerging from breadstuffs. To celebrate my gains, I thought about buying Robert Wright\u2019s \u201cWhy Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.\u201d But, given my attention deficit, the better bet might be Mike McCormack\u2019s much-lauded novel \u201cSolar Bones,\u201d about an Irishman ruminating, Molly Bloom-style, on his whole life: It\u2019s written as one sentence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "FeatureYes, it\u2019s driven by greed \u2014 but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.Supported bylayer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maidOn the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fusion GPS Founder Hauled From the Shadows for the Russia Election Investigation", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From the start, he was a central casting misfire \u2014 the dark artist slicing through the capital by electric scooter, a cloak-and-dagger digger better known to former colleagues for scratching his bare belly in plain office view.Mr. Simpson\u2019s life has not been boring for some time now. It has, perhaps inevitably, become news.As investigators circle President Trump\u2019s administration over ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Simpson, a 53-year-old Wall Street Journal veteran-turned-master of high-dollar research, has arrived at the biggest story of either of his careers, lurching to the center of the Russia-tinged scandal that clouds the presidency.For months, Mr. Simpson\u2019s name has ricocheted across the halls of Congress and the airwaves of Fox News, becoming shorthand in conservative circles for purported investigatory overreach and counterconspiracies against the White House. Questions about his research have become central to Republican attempts to discredit not just Fusion but the very existence of inquiries into Mr. Trump, including the efforts of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Simpson himself has been hauled before three congressional committees for some 20 hours of questions and answers, placing him among the most significant players in the Trump-Russia affair, if math is the metric.\u201cUncooperative,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said of Mr. Simpson\u2019s turn before the Judiciary Committee, which he leads.\u201cVery cooperative,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Simpson also appeared.Mr. Simpson can be both of these things \u2014 according to interviews with dozens of friends, colleagues and investigative targets \u2014 and a few more: brash, obsessive, occasionally paranoid, perhaps with cause.The name of the firm, founded in 2010, was intended to represent a \u201cfusion\u201d of journalism and business intelligence. The \u201cGPS\u201d hinted aspirationally at a global reach.In practice, Fusion\u2019s task has often translated, roughly, to finding unsavory things about unsavory people, at the behest of not-especially-savory clients. The firm often represents corporations, hedge funds or law firms, providing a sort of public-records forensics that resembles journalism. It leans on its understanding of the news media, and its contacts among reporters, to elevate its clients and squeeze their adversaries.In election years, political opposition research can consume more of Mr. Simpson\u2019s time, with bipartisan demand.The pay is good. And the targets are rich.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out the puzzle,\u201d said Stuart Karle, a friend and the former general counsel for The Journal. \u201cThat animates him. It always has.\u201dMore notable to some lawmakers is Mr. Simpson\u2019s connection to two figures with deep bonds to Russian power, who have long fought for a pet Kremlin cause: Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a lawyer known as a formidable Moscow insider.The two have worked to turn back the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 American law detested by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, that punishes Russian human rights violators. And together with Mr. Simpson, the trio worked on behalf of a Russian-owned company accused by the United States government of laundering some of the funds stolen in a fraud uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, after whom the act was named.\u201cHe\u2019s a professional smear campaigner and liar for money,\u201d Mr. Browder said of Mr. Simpson. \u201cThe credibility of anything that he does is in question.\u201dMr. Simpson was in court with Ms. Veselnitskaya hours before the Trump Tower meeting and saw her again shortly after it, his lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, confirmed. But these contacts were related to Mr. Simpson\u2019s work on the case for BakerHostetler, Mr. Levy said, and Fusion only learned about the Trump Tower meeting in news reports last year.\u201cWe collect facts,\u201d Fusion said in a statement, describing itself as a research company. \u201cOccasionally, the facts turn out to be helpful to people we deplore, like Vladimir Putin, or undermine people for whom we have considerable sympathy, like William Browder.\u201dFor his efforts, Mr. Simpson has been presented with a defamation lawsuit and a congressional subpoena demanding bank records, which the firm is fighting in court, saying it could jeopardize a confidential client list in an industry where privacy is paramount. A legal defense fund has been formed, one of Fusion\u2019s lawyers, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., said, adding that the firm\u2019s legal costs had by now outstripped all compensation for investigations into Mr. Trump and his links to Russia during the campaign.But the work has not stopped. Fusion continues to look into ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, according to several people briefed on the research. Mr. Simpson\u2019s specific areas of focus, and information about any current benefactors, are closely guarded.\u201cGlenn\u2019s a relentlessly digging sort of guy,\u201d said Tim Burger, a friend and former colleague. \u201cIf there is a document out there about anything, he will find it.\u201dThe marriage made enough sense on paper: the former spy and the former scribe, feeling their way through second acts of lives spent investigating furtive actors who preferred to be left alone.Mr. Steele, now in his 50s, had worked undercover in Moscow in the 1990s, later serving as the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6.Like Mr. Simpson, he had changed careers in 2009, opening his own commercial intelligence firm.Like Mr. Simpson, according to people who know them, he came to hold a dark view of Mr. Putin.Mr. Simpson connected with Mr. Steele, whom he had met in 2009, when they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance who knew of their shared interest in investigating Russian corruption. They quickly got to work.As a former spy inside Russia, Mr. Steele was ill positioned to travel there himself. He hired native speakers to call informants inside the country and communicated discreetly with his own connections.The research also described a series of contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.In time, Mr. Steele shared some of his information with the F.B.I.\u201cHe felt he was witnessing a national security crime in progress,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who declined to be interviewed for this article but addressed some questions via email. \u201cI did not object, and did not ask for permission from our clients. Chris was the national security professional, so I deferred to him.\u201dBy then, Mr. Simpson\u2019s period of relative anonymity had come and gone, replaced by a spotlight that has exacerbated the kind of distrust endemic to his line of work.His name was back in the paper the next day. It had been awhile since that happened against his will.Mr. Simpson was a high school senior, not yet 18.It was nearly graduation for Conestoga High School\u2019s Class of 1982, and Mr. Simpson capped the first day of spring at his family\u2019s home in a Philadelphia suburb with a Saturday night party, stocked with alcohol. After an evening of hard drinking, a friend staggered outside and into the road. He was struck by a car and killed.At once, a reckoning gripped the region. Mr. Simpson\u2019s mother, Jane, was charged with allowing her son to hold the party. A front-page article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, centered on Mr. Simpson\u2019s gathering, detailed the rise of binge drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a release,\u201d Mr. Simpson was quoted telling the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to forget.\u201dThe most serious charges against Mrs. Simpson were dismissed. But the episode was an early signpost of an often tumultuous life for her son, vacillating from swashbuckling fact-finding to bursts of trauma and back again.In his early 20s, as a student at George Washington University, Mr. Simpson broke his neck in a car crash. In his late 30s, he turned back spinal cancer.\u201cHe had a very strong sort of ethical backbone,\u201d said Jim Glassman, the former editor in chief of Roll Call, a publication dedicated to covering Congress and Mr. Simpson\u2019s professional home before he joined The Journal. \u201cHe was a terrific reporter, kind of a prodigy.\u201dBefore long, the book industry beckoned. Mr. Simpson\u2019s \u201cDirty Little Secrets,\u201d written with Larry J. Sabato, focused on political corruption.One section tackled the burgeoning field of opposition research: \u201cThere is relatively easy money to be made,\u201d it read. \u201cThe scrupulous and unscrupulous alike are attracted to offer their wares.\u201dBy the time he reached The Journal in 1995, Mr. Simpson had assumed an eclectic place among the capital\u2019s constellation of influencers \u2014 a hard-charging reporter with a deep Rolodex, a weakness for Bob Dylan and an unquenchable thirst for revelry, mischievous or otherwise. The weekend of his Arkansas wedding to Mary Jacoby, who was also at Roll Call, included skeet shooting, chicken fried steak and a write-up previewing the festivities in The Washington Post.His home in Washington\u2019s Friendship Heights became a rollicking hub for journalists blowing off steam, with sporadic appearances from political power brokers. His Journal desk became a gathering place for half-eaten sandwiches and burps he would not bother stifling.After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. Simpson turned his attention abroad, eventually relocating to Brussels, pursuing stories on the financial sources of terrorism. He was sued repeatedly in foreign courts. The Journal suffered losses in legal fees, if not credibility, on his account.\u201cGlenn Simpson changed 800 years of English libel law,\u201d Mr. Karle, the paper\u2019s former general counsel, said of one case. \u201cIt was the first significant decision from the House of Lords that found that a journalist had behaved well.\u201dBy the late 2000s, the ground at The Journal, and across journalism, had begun to shift. Rupert Murdoch assumed control of the newspaper. The industry, generally, allowed less latitude for the kinds of costly, long-term investigations that were Mr. Simpson\u2019s trade.In 2009, Mr. Simpson announced he was leaving the profession to start SNS Global, a research company that predated Fusion, with a Journal peer, Susan Schmidt. On his last day, former reporters there recalled, Mr. Simpson brought his dog, a dachshund-beagle mix named Irving, to join him in the office, loudly encouraging him to defecate near some editors. (It is not clear if Irving obliged.)But before he was gone, Mr. Simpson had wandered down rabbit holes that would prove instructive.The name has not helped.\u201cFUSION GPS SCANDAL,\u201d read a recent headline from Sean Hannity on Fox News, stretching across the top of a studio monitor. From this screen, he connected a series of rectangles with short white lines to allege a Fusion-powered megaconspiracy against Mr. Trump.Yet Fusion\u2019s typical mandate, even defenders acknowledge, is not dripping with nobility.Few Washington industries traffic in sainthood. Many are mercenary in nature. And Fusion seems to be of a piece, hustling for its cut from an office in Dupont Circle.Amid skepticism over the dossier, Fusion has trumpeted Mr. Steele\u2019s strong standing in the intelligence community, noting that the former spy is trained to screen out disinformation.Still, at a firm that casts itself as a collector of facts, the dossier is not the equivalent of a finished news article, in journalism parlance. It is more a compilation of prepublication notes, requiring further vetting.But Mr. Simpson has bristled at the idea that the dossier is some kind of liberal fever dream. Its broad conclusions \u2014 once outlandish themselves \u2014 have already proved prescient, the firm has argued. Sometimes the conspiracy is true.\u201cMore than a year has gone by since these memos were produced,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cI have not become aware of any disinformation.\u201dDavid Enrich contributed reporting from New York.

But at a moment when women\u2019s voices and stories have been amplified as never before, Ms. Farrow\u2019s account carries more force \u2014 as even defenders of Mr. Allen are starting to acknowledge.\u201cI do feel that it\u2019s an escalation,\u201d Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen\u2019s sister and longtime producer, said in an interview, calling #MeToo a tool that has been used for \u201culterior motives.\u201d Ms. Farrow told The Times that she was using the movement as it was intended, to shine a light on \u201cthe truth\u201d about sexual abuse.Onscreen, another casualty could be \u201cA Rainy Day in New York,\u201d Mr. Allen\u2019s soon-to-be-completed next movie, which was financed and due to be distributed by Amazon. The company has not made any decisions about the film\u2019s future, but Amazon is having serious conversations about ending its relationship with Mr. Allen, which could leave the movie without distribution, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Amazon has contractual obligations to Mr. Allen and the film, one of these people noted.Cherry Jones, the Tony- and Emmy-winning actress who also appears in \u201cRainy Day,\u201d had a different response when asked how she felt about Mr. Allen and whether she would work with him again. \u201cThere are those who are comfortable in their certainty. I am not. I don\u2019t know the truth,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cWhen we condemn by instinct our democracy is on a slippery slope.\u201dAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment on \u201cRainy Day\u201d beyond a terse statement: \u201cWe have not announced a release date for this film.\u201d Ms. Aronson said Mr. Allen was still editing the movie and did not expect it to be released before next winter.At any point, the film\u2019s marketing may suffer if stars like Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Hall don\u2019t promote it \u2014 typically a vital part of the publicity for Mr. Allen\u2019s actor-driven films. For Amazon, part of the calculation is likely about the bottom line: whether the company would be harmed financially, or reputationally, by continuing to be associated with Mr. Allen.Ms. Aronson argued that Ms. Farrow and her supporters had \u201ccapitalized\u201d on the #MeToo movement to intensify attention on what the Allen camp views as discredited accusations against him. In a statement, Mr. Allen said that Ms. Farrow was \u201ccynically\u201d aligning herself with Time\u2019s Up.Ms. Farrow, in an email to The Times, replied: \u201cIf Woody Allen and his surrogates\u2019 response to this is that I\u2019m capitalizing on a moment in which it is in vogue to carefully look at the facts, rather than rely on thin defenses from powerful men without question \u2014 a moment in which the truth is in fashion \u2014 I\u2019d say they\u2019re right.\u201dA top Hollywood strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her professional relationships said that she would advise her clients not to work with Mr. Allen. She said a role in an Allen film would be too hard to justify \u2014 a career choice over a possible moral stand.Others pointed to the trajectory of artists like Roman Polanski as an example of the entertainment industry\u2019s longstanding moral leniency. In the decades since Mr. Polanski fled the United States to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, he has enjoyed a flourishing career in Europe, where audiences have been conditioned to separate the art from the artist. He continued casting top Hollywood stars and won an Oscar in 2003 for directing \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d (Mr. Allen has long had devoted fans, and more box office fortune, in Europe. \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d which has taken in $9 million overseas thus far, is due to open in France this week.)Mr. Allen is continuing on the creative path he has followed for decades: always writing \u2014 in addition to a screenplay, Ms. Aronson said he may be working on short stories or possibly a book \u2014 and playing clarinet at his regular Monday-night gig at the Carlyle on the Upper East Side. \u201cHis life hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said.But his artistic vision may be out of step with the times. His last four films have flopped at the North American box office, taking in a cumulative $26.9 million \u2014 roughly half of which goes to theater owners \u2014 while carrying a collective $85 million in estimated production costs, not including marketing.Before Amazon\u2019s largess, Mr. Allen, like most indie filmmakers, financed his movies by preselling distribution rights. Even as his box office results faltered, he was able to attract continued interest from distributors by casting major stars. And he was able to cast major stars (and often persuade them to work for reduced salaries) because of his reputation as a film legend and because awards sometimes followed. But pull out one element \u2014 the stars \u2014 and the model could collapse.Despite signs of wavering support in Hollywood, Ms. Aronson was still defiantly confident that Mr. Allen could make any movie he wants. Financing is already in place for the script he\u2019s working on now, she said, outside the Amazon deal. And as for casting, actors are a renewable resource. \u201cI have no doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cthat he\u2019ll be able to find new talent.\u201dThough prolific, at 82, Mr. Allen may be nearing his closing chapter as a filmmaker. Some industry observers suggested that if he continued working quietly, the controversy would blow over, as it has before \u2014 because, until #MeToo, Hollywood always had a short memory.Advertisement"}

Thursday Night Games", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThursday Night Football\u201d has a new home: Fox.The league announced on Wednesday that it had reached a five-year agreement with Fox to broadcast 11 games a season on Thursdays.

A digital partner for the games \u2014 it was Amazon last season \u2014 has yet to be announced.\u201cYou either have the rights to the most-watched content, or you don\u2019t,\u201d Peter Rice, president of 21st Century Fox, said on a conference call announcing the agreement. \u201cWe believe in buying the very best rights, and the best rights are N.F.L.\u201dAccording to multiple reports, both CBS and NBC bid less than they had paid previously, underscoring the difficulty in finding profit by showing football on Thursday nights.\u201cWe explored a responsible bid for \u2018Thursday Night Football,\u2019 but in the end are very pleased to return to entertainment programming on television\u2019s biggest night,\u201d CBS said in a statement.\u201cWe made a competitive bid based on our two years of carrying \u2018T.N.F.,\u2019 \u201d NBC said.Fox is in a substantially different position from NBC and CBS, perhaps underscoring why it was willing to bid so much more on the package.Fox sees the agreement as a harkening back to 1993, when the network made a stunning bid to win the rights to broadcast N.F.L. games, in what some critics thought was an overpay.\u201cTwenty-five years ago, we made our first historic deal to broadcast N.F.C. games, and that helped transform our then fledgling network into the powerhouse it is today,\u201d Rice said.The N.F.L. has used the Thursday night package as a trial balloon, keeping contract lengths short and experimenting with digital partnerships. The five-year agreement with Fox will make it the home for football on Thursday nights for the medium term, and expires after the 2022 season, the same time the N.F.L.\u2019s Sunday and Monday broadcast agreements expire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Gunman Took Elaborate Steps to Hide His Tracks, New Documents Show", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he meticulously planned the Las Vegas attack, the man responsible for the worst mass shooting in modern American history took elaborate steps to stymie the inevitable law enforcement investigation, according to federal court documents unsealed on Friday.The F.B.I. search warrants shed new light on the degree to which the gunman, Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others when he opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October, planned the attack and prepared for the aftermath. One of the warrants described how Mr. Paddock \u201cdestroyed or tried to hide digital media devices.\u201dInvestigators said he used anonymous communications devices, including a prepaid cellphone, to cover his tracks and employed a \u201clevel of sophistication which is commonly found in mass casualty events.\u201d\u201cPaddock planned the attack meticulously and took many methodical steps to avoid detection of his plot and to thwart the eventual law enforcement investigation that would follow,\u201d the F.B.I. said.Mr. Paddock\u2019s motive for the attack remains unknown.The search warrants, which were approved by judges shortly after the shooting, said three cellphones belonging to Mr. Paddock were found in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, including two that investigators searched and one that they could not unlock. An F.B.I. agent wrote that he believed \u201cif there were any information related to a potential conspiracy, it would be found within\u201d the locked phone, which used a Google operating system.The search warrants detail how law enforcement focused on Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Mr. Paddock. She has not been charged with a crime and has spoken to investigators several times, and her lawyer has said she was not aware of Mr. Paddock\u2019s deadly plans. The investigation is continuing, and the warrants only reflect its early stages.\u201cShe has been identified thus far as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack,\u201d according to one of the documents.She told investigators she occasionally helped Mr. Paddock load magazines. The F.B.I. said there was no evidence that she knew of his plans or had been deceptive, but it cautioned soon after the shootings that she was still the \u201csubject of intensive review.\u201dMs. Danley corroborated much of what had been previously pieced together by investigators, but she has been adamant that she had no prior knowledge of Mr. Paddock\u2019s intention to carry out the mass shooting.According to the documents, it appears that Mr. Paddock relied on the internet to buy many of the items used in the attack, including guns and ammunition, during the 12 months leading up to it.He spent \u201csignificant time and expense prior to the attack purchasing and caching weapons\u201d and other items, such as glass cutters and suitcases. The authorities have said he used the glass cutters so he could fire out of his hotel window at the people below, who were attending a country music concert.Much of what investigators found in the hotel room had already been made public, but the search warrants add additional details. The F.B.I. said there were hundreds of rounds of spent ammunition as well as \u201cpreloaded high-capacity magazines,\u201d found in suitcases that Mr. Paddock had brought to the room. Investigators also found body armor, range finders and a homemade gas mask.Investigators also revealed that Mr. Paddock may have been treated for \u201cunidentified medical conditions.\u201d In October, Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock\u2019s physical and mental health seemed to have deteriorated in recent months.In an affidavit submitted as part of a search warrant application, an investigator said that access to Ms. Danley\u2019s email account could \u201clead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan and Marilou Danley\u2019s possible involvement.\u201d The authorities also requested information about several Instagram accounts that they believed were connected to Ms. Danley.In their requests for data from Instagram, investigators said they were seeking \u201cevidence showing the possession, use, purchase or sale of firearms, firearms accessories, ammunition or explosives by Paddock.\u201d They also sought information about Ms. Danley\u2019s \u201cstate of mind as it relates to the crime under investigation\u201d and the identities of anyone who communicated with her about what would amount to violations of federal weapons laws.Ms. Danley deleted her Facebook account just hours after the attack, investigators wrote in their affidavit. At 12:30 a.m., about two-and-a-half hours after the shooting began, she changed the status of her account to private. By 2:46 a.m., she had deleted the account entirely.In September, the court records suggested, Mr. Paddock ordered from Amazon a holographic weapon sight that investigators believe he ultimately used during the assault. On Friday night, Amazon listed the same model, which was described as \u201cdesigned for close-in combat speed and versatility.\u201d The price is $429, according to the listing, which said the sight \u201cimproves target acquisition, boosts accuracy and increases control.\u201dThe F.B.I. also discovered emails between two accounts connected to Mr. Paddock. One from early July indicated that Mr. Paddock had begun taking steps to carry out the attack, referring to a \u201cbump stock,\u201d an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster.In an email Mr. Paddock sent on July 6 to an account that also may have belonged to him, he wrote: \u201ctry an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area.\u201d Another email sent between the accounts read, \u201cfor a thrill try out bumpfire ar\u2019s with a 100 round magazine.\u201d By \u201car,\u201d Mr. Paddock appeared to be referring to rifles.The affidavit later adds that \u201cinvestigators have been unable to figure out why Stephen Paddock would be exchanging messages related to weapons that were used in the attack between two of his email accounts,\u201d and that it was possible that someone else was controlling one of the accounts. If that was the case, the investigator said, the F.B.I. needed to identify that person. Receiving a search warrant for that account \u201cwill lead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan,\u201d an F.B.I agent wrote to the judge.Alan Blinder and Mitch Smith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Makes a Late Entry Into the E-Book Market", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is making a circuitous and belated push into the digital book market, teaming up with a Japanese company to sell e-books and audiobooks.The deal with Rakuten, an e-commerce giant based in Japan, will allow Walmart to start selling digital books on its website for the first time later this year.The move, which was announced late Thursday, comes years after Walmart\u2019s archrival, Amazon, began to dominate the market for digital readers.The partnership is part of Walmart\u2019s effort to ensure that its online offerings include every conceivable product line, giving shoppers no reason to click over to Amazon.But by many measures, Walmart is arriving late to the digital book party. Amazon, which built its business around book sales in its early days, has a huge head start. Beyond that, the e-book market has shown signs of fizzling, as screen-weary readers turn back to print copies.\u201cThis ship sailed years ago,\u201d said Peter Hildick-Smith, president of Codex-Group, a book audience research firm.E-book revenue among 1,200 publishers reporting data fell to $743.5 million from January to August last year, 5.3 percent below the same period in 2016, according to the Association of American Publishers.Mr. Hildick-Smith said the decline was driven in part by \u201cdigital fatigue\u201d among readers, who spend hours looking at computers and smartphones and are looking for an escape by picking up a paper book.Kobo, a Canadian company that Rakuten bought in 2011, is a small player in the United States market.Rakuten Kobo\u2019s chief executive, Michael Tamblyn, said in an interview that the deal gave Kobo a vast new audience for its digital books through Walmart\u2019s website and eventually its stores, which sell print books.Mr. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, brings \u201cincredible scale\u201d to Kobo\u2019s book platform, he said. The company\u2019s e-books \u2014 which include six million titles, from best-sellers to children\u2019s books \u2014 can be read on Kobo devices or on a new co-branded Walmart-Kobo app.According to Mr. Hildick-Smith\u2019s analysis, Kobo accounted for fewer than 1 percent of e-book purchases last fall, while purchases from Amazon totaled about 75 percent.Mr. Tamblyn declined to comment on Kobo\u2019s share of the e-book market, but said sales had been \u201csteady.\u201dThe deal \u2014 which Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, flew to Tokyo to announce \u2014 will allow Walmart\u2019s online grocery business in Japan to expand exponentially. Rakuten\u2019s online marketplace has 93 million registered members, capturing a huge volume of e-commerce in Japan.Online grocery is a major initiative for Walmart, which re is going head-to-head with Amazon in that area.In the United States, Walmart has been focusing on encouraging customers to order their food online and then pick it up at stores. In Japan, the partnership with Rakuten will focus on delivering groceries to homes.Advertisement"}

Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor at The Times who oversees digital initiatives, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You oversee podcasts, virtual reality and other new digital efforts. What does a typical day look like for your media consumption?I used to begin the day scrolling through my phone while still in bed. Recently I\u2019ve gotten better at leaving my phone in another room while I sleep \u2014 which means that now the first thing I do when I wake up is make a mad dash to retrieve my phone from the living room.I read several email newsletters, then I read The Times\u2019s front page in print, flip to the Opinion pages and scan for other articles to read on my phone during the commute.My 7-year-old daughter will usually ask Alexa to play a terrible song \u2014 the democratization of music choice is one of the untold perils of the modern era. Then, Alexa will thankfully interrupt with an alarm that it\u2019s time to leave for the bus.At night, my wife and I will often watch a streaming show. We just started \u201cWormwood\u201d on Netflix. And then I read actual physical books before going to sleep.You study new opportunities for The Times to distribute its journalism. How do you decide which ventures are worth pursuing? Lots of people have referred to this past year as a \u201cmedia apocalypse\u201d because of the harsh realities of digital advertising. But from a different angle, there\u2019s never been a more exciting time to tell important stories and reach more people in more ways. Our mission at The Times is to help people understand the world, so we pursue opportunities where we can further that in new ways.And then we made a major push into audio because we saw a giant opportunity to reinvent our journalism in a medium that is quickly rising in importance. We are living in a world where the mobile phone is dominant, and audio, which doesn\u2019t require your eyes or your hands, is the ultimate mobile medium. We launched The Daily in February, and it immediately became our best push toward rebuilding the daily habit of print reading. It\u2019s really working. The Daily was the top downloaded podcast in Apple podcasts in 2017.We\u2019ve got more to come in 2018, but look for those common threads. We\u2019ll go to places where lots of people are already spending their time and mediums that allow us to help people understand the real world in new ways.What are some of your favorite new publishing strategies that you see The Times or other outlets experimenting with?I know some people find push alerts to be intrusive, but I\u2019m fascinated by them. I watch N.B.A. highlights right from my phone\u2019s lock screen: The great Bleacher Report app sends out push alerts with embedded videos of the key moments from the games, often in real time. I never even open the app, but it has totally changed how I watch basketball.I\u2019m also seriously interested in newsletters as a lo-fi way to form a deep relationship with readers. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been to the Axios site, but I spend more time with Mike Allen\u2019s newsletter every week than I do with most publishers\u2019 home pages.Finally, streaming TV feels like a new frontier where old rules about length, format and expectations are exploding in real time. When you\u2019re not locked into 30 minutes with commercial breaks, what other conventions can you throw out?What is your advice for people who aspire to become reporters? What new digital tools should they start using today?Reporters of the future should master the building blocks of traditional journalism. The coin of the realm, no matter the medium, is the ability to find out new facts and to uncover things that someone doesn\u2019t want you to uncover. If you can get inside the room and explain to people what happened there, and if you can do it quickly and reliably, you\u2019ll become a strong reporter no matter how or where you tell your stories.You should start your own newsletter. You\u2019ll want to understand what makes for a good podcast, and what makes for a good video \u2014 all the better if you develop skills to make them yourself.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your personal life?What are some of your favorite podcasts other than The Daily?One of the Daily producers turned me on to an insane podcast called Dissect, where a guy analyzes, at very great length, every song on a Kanye West record.

{"Headline": "The Real Burning Man", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "Driving converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, \u201cskoolies\u201d and the odd Prius, a few thousand gather in defiance of consumerist society.Supported bySkoolies are school buses that have been turned into houses on wheels, and the Blacks, who bought theirs through Craigslist for $7,500 and have been on the road for a year, are new members of a sprawling and disparate tribe of vehicular nomads that flock to this dusty desert town each winter. They come for the boondocking \u2014 nomad vernacular for free or low-cost camping \u2014 on the thousands of acres of federal land that are adjacent to the place, and for the community, particularly that found at a two-week-long rally called the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous.Organized by Bob Wells, a 62-year-old van-dwelling evangelist who has been living on the road for over two decades, the RTR drew just 45 people when it began in 2010. This year, Mr. Wells said, rangers estimated the crowd at over 3,000. Often called a Burning Man for retirees, the RTR is starting to skew younger, at least by anecdotal measures.Melody Tilton, a 31-year-old massage therapist, said she had been inspired by Mr. Wells\u2019s YouTube videos to take to the road last fall with her husband, Kyle, also 31, who had worked in information technology, in a white \u201997 Roadtrek, though she hankered for a skoolie. (Roadtreks are easier to park.) They sold their house in Minnesota, and are running on the proceeds. \u201cI had been looking for ways to be a full-time hobo,\u201d Ms. Tilton said. \u201cI thought you had to be retired.\u201dCommitted nomads come to share tips on solar power, stealth overnights in parking spots on city streets, van conversion, mail, hygiene, finances and low-cost dental care, which can be found over the border in the Mexican town of Los Algodones, an hour and a half away. Aspirational nomads come to test the waters, in rented mini-Winnies and camper vans. And they come to meet Mr. Wells, a celebrity here. With his abundant gray hair, lustrous beard and mellifluous voice, he is an amiable philosopher-elder of the road: Bruce Chatwin in a GMC cargo van.Twenty-three years ago, Mr. Wells went through a bitter divorce that upended his finances. He couldn\u2019t afford to rent an apartment on his own; with his last $1,500 in savings, he bought a box van and moved into it, stealth-parking on the streets of Anchorage, where he worked at a Safeway and where his ex-wife and two sons lived. The first nights, he cried himself to sleep. \u201cI came into the van life kicking and screaming, but I fell in love with it,\u201d he said.The pressures of sticks-and-bricks living, as nomads call traditional dwellings \u2014 the mortgage, the taxes, the maintenance \u2014 currently holds no allure for Mr. Wells. \u201cThe Titanic is going down,\u201d he said, alluding to the general state of the economy and environment, \u201cand this is a lifeboat. This is a hope, a promise of a better, more meaningful life.\u201dThe road from Quartzsite to the site of this year\u2019s RTR was pocked with muffler-scraping craters. (\u201cEnd Arizona Dept. of Transportation Maintenance,\u201d read a helpful sign.) Most nomads left the rutted tarmac for the dusty shoulder, bucketing along until they hit a dirt track. It wasn\u2019t easy to discern the shape and scope of the rally, or figure out where it actually began.Converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, skoolies and even a few cars (Mr. Wells likes to say that those who are living in Priuses are the saints of the community) were camped along the washes at decorous intervals from each other, in distinct contrast to the more conventional RV campgrounds that also surround Quartzsite, where gleaming Winnebagos park nose to tail and side by side.The Rubber Tramp Rendezvous agora was a centrally located patch of chalky ground ringed by creosote bushes and giant saguaro. There were seminars on creating YouTube videos; a tin can Q. and A., and show-and-tells of favorite gadgets. Two tarps were neatly arrayed with books, clothing, housewares and personal care products. Attendees could leave unwanted goods from decluttering their rigs or pick up needed items for free.One afternoon, the faint smell of charcoal briquettes wafted over the crowd, sunburned men and women planted in camp chairs and trying to keep snuffling dogs not used to leashes to heel. As Mr. Wells was extolling the virtues of camping above 7,000 feet, a late visitor wondered why.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to get hot,\u201d one woman whispered.A man raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re an introvert. So what are we doing here?\u201dMr. Wells nodded and asked all the introverts in the crowd to raise their hands. Mostly everyone did.\u201cGood question,\u201d Mr. Wells said. \u201cWhy have we driven thousands of miles to be together? It\u2019s because we need each other so much. Even the most introverted of us knows that. We\u2019re looking for like-minded people who will let us be our authentic selves. Together, at a distance. Humans are funny things. Don\u2019t worry. The RTR is going to end, and you\u2019ll be alone again soon.\u201d\u201cAre you dating?\u201d a woman in the crowd asked.They are not, though they like to tease their audience.\u201cThe world stigmatizes people who live differently,\u201d Ms. Bruder said. \u201cThe RTR is full of kindred spirits, like a non-blood family. People there feel heard and understood and valuable. There can be a sense of isolation out there in the world. When they get to the RTR, it melts away.\u201dWhile van culture may be growing because more and more people are caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of flat wages and rising home prices, Ms. Bruder added, \u201cI also think people are frustrated by consumer culture and what they are supposed to want. People who are constrained by economics are also saying, \u2018I can opt out.\u2019 I think that can be tremendously liberating.\u201dFor her research, Ms. Bruder bought a white GMC Vandura, named it Halen, for the 1980s hair band, and learned to correct for its sideways drift on the highways. Despite aching shoulders from keeping it on course, she loved being out in her van, she said. \u201cThere was one day when we were driving in a caravan, like horses galloping across the desert. I was following a 70-year-old woman named Swankie, and we were on our way to see an ancient earthwork in a petrified forest. My heart was in my throat. That sense of constant motion on the road, when everything feels new. The mythos of the desert landscape. It got me.\u201d\u201cI think a lot of women my age have a feeling they\u2019d like to take control,\u201d Ms. Higgins said, noting that her videos seem to have struck a chord. \u201cMaybe they are recognizing that mainstream society doesn\u2019t feel safe anymore. For many of us, we\u2019ve been fed the lie that we have to have the heels, the makeup. That we aren\u2019t complete without a man. We\u2019ve been fed the lie we have to get married and take care of everyone. I think women are saying, \u2018What about me?\u2019\u201dPerhaps more of an introvert than Mr. Wells, Ms. Higgins has struggled with her YouTube fans, who crowd her at campsites \u2014 \u201cImagine it being Halloween for two weeks straight,\u201d she said \u2014 clamor for her autograph and send her marriage proposals. At the RTR, she was parked so far away from the action that this reporter nearly got lost among the washes trying to make her way out. But Ms. Higgins gamely led a caravan of nine rigs with her to the Women\u2019s March anniversary rally in Las Vegas, and to a meet-and-greet with Mr. Wells at the RTR.\u201cThis event has changed my life,\u201d she said then, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that I found my voice, and that it matters.\u201dOn the final Saturday night, the RTR had lost much of its crowd, but those remaining made a merry bonfire of the small cardboard van built by art camp volunteers, an RTR tradition. (Midweek, someone called the Bureau of Land Management rangers, warning that there was a plan to burn an actual van.) The mock van was about knee-high, and in its window was a Sharpie portrait of Mr. Wells and his dog, Cody. When it burned, the group sang the RTR anthem, to the tune of the Willie Nelson hit \u201cOn the Road Again.\u201dRubber tramps againLike a band of Gypsies we go down to QuartzsiteWe\u2019ll see Bob againWe\u2019ll share our tales at campfires in the nighttimeWarm fire time\u201cWe follow good weather, we meet fascinating people, we sell some books,\u201d Ms. Black said. \u201cThis is about the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Even on the Internet, What\u2019s Old Is New Again", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryIt is indisputable that the internet \u2014 facilitated by both vast improvements in access and computing power \u2014 has had a disruptive impact on not just business but politics and many aspects of our daily lives. Demonstrating precisely what that impact is, however, has been remarkably challenging. Pronouncements on the topic have a tendency to be overblown. \u201cTransformational,\u201d \u201cexponential\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d are increasingly favored adjectives, whether they are applicable or not.The impression that the world is changing faster today than ever before has become conventional wisdom. Yet the magnitude of change that occurred between when America galloped into World War I on horses and dropped the atomic bomb feels more significant than that undergone since the first dot-com domain name was registered. This observation is not meant to diminish the importance of the seismic changes wrought by the digital age, but rather to suggest the relevance of historical context often absent from the conversation.The internet itself is a network of networks. The ability to communicate and transact across its vast reach is indeed unprecedented and represents the basic infrastructure of what has been termed the \u201cnetwork society.\u201d Mr. Ferguson\u2019s book does far more than simply track the use of the word \u201cnetwork\u201d from its introduction in English language publications in the late 19th century, when it \u201cwas scarcely used,\u201d to the modern day, when he points out that it appeared in 136 articles in The New York Times during just the first week of 2017. Rather he seeks to reframe the entirety of human history as an endless tug-of-war between eras in which powerful hierarchical institutions predominate (the Tower of the title) only to be undermined by the influence of emerging networks (the corresponding Square). In Professor Ferguson\u2019s telling, these networks are invariably co-opted by reconstituted hierarchies and the process begins again.The new industrial, financial and communications networks that emerged during this time did not, however, overturn the hierarchical nature of things. This dominant structure survived both world wars, according to Professor Ferguson, with the mid-twentieth century actually representing the \u201czenith of hierarchy.\u201d His account shows how the ability to navigate and influence these and other nascent networks determined which empires thrived in the reconfigured hierarchical orders.One does not have to completely buy in to the book\u2019s reframing of key social and political turning points to find the narrative both captivating and compelling. Whether describing the surprisingly ineffective 18th century network of the mysterious Illuminati that continue to be the subject of crank conspiracy theorists or the shockingly effective 20th century network of Cambridge University spies working for the Soviets, Professor Ferguson manages both to tell a good story and provide important insight into the specific qualities that power successful networks.Attempting to cover so much ground in such short space (\u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is less than half the length of Professor Ferguson\u2019s recent biography of Henry Kissinger) risks fatal oversimplification. The book\u2019s most impressive accomplishment is to avoid such a fate. Professor Ferguson provides a credible summary of contemporary network theory and makes clear that \u201ca hierarchy is just a special kind of network\u201d in which nodes communicate up and down but never connect laterally. There are no true pure hierarchies \u2014 Stalin\u2019s Russia probably comes closest \u2014 and the greatest strength of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that it generally avoids caricature. Instead, it emphasizes the critical questions of what distinguishes network effectiveness and what happens when networks interact.Professor Ferguson brings us up to the present with a discussion of the technology giants that have emerged in the last few decades. His focus is on their political and economic influence. He includes an interesting discussion of the similarities and differences between the impact of the internet and the printing press.There is a burgeoning literature in management journals and business books that focuses on the internet\u2019s influence on business strategy rather than politics. In some ways, this work reflects a variation on the paradigm described by Professor Ferguson. Corresponding to the discussion of \u201cold hierarchies\u201d are businesses that rely on high fixed costs to build barriers to competitive entry, whereas the disruptive \u201cnew networks\u201d are constructed on digital platforms made possible by the internet. These new businesses, it is argued, fuel so-called \u201cnetwork effects\u201d that lead inevitably to winner-take-all marketplaces.These analyses, however, have lacked the historical perspective of \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d In place of the nuanced discussion of how hierarchies and networks interact, is a broad-brush assertion that scale achieved through network effects is inherently superior to that based on old-fashioned fixed costs.In fact, platforms are no more a peculiarly modern phenomenon than networks are, and their digital incarnations are not necessarily better businesses than those that came before. Analog malls had the benefit of their shoppers being many miles away from competing malls and their retail tenants being committed to long-term leases. On the internet, platform competitors are only a click away and relationships are notoriously transactional.The important lesson of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that the existence of a network, or network effects for that matter, should be the beginning not the end of the analysis. The critical questions relate to the network\u2019s key characteristics and how it interacts with other networks and hierarchies.The same is true of platform businesses, which are of highly diverse quality depending on their structural attributes and the ecosystems within which they operate. It is not a coincidence that the two largest and most enduring purely digital platforms \u2014 Google and Amazon \u2014 are not primarily network-effects businesses, but instead are companies that benefit from leveraging multiple, complementary sources of competitive advantage including, notably, traditional fixed-cost scale.Predicting the viability of new business models requires a careful understanding of both history and industry structure. If \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d encourages digital business strategists and venture capitalists to take this to heart, it will have made an important, if unexpected, contribution.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Going to the Source for a Sacred Italian Cheese", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsYet there I was, surrounded by a hundred little animals, white wool coats matted down with hay and dirt, making small, timid bleats as they trotted past me up the ramp to the milking station. As the sun rose, rivers of dust filled shafts of light; you could sense the day was going to be scalding by breakfast. But for now, in the barn, it was bearable \u2014 just me, a pretty young farmer named Giulia, and a herd of sheep ready to be milked. \u201cPecorino is poorly understood,\u201d said Matthew Rubiner, the owner of Rubiner\u2019s Cheesemongers & Grocers in Great Barrington, Mass., and a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things cheese. \u201cPeople assume all pecorino is Pecorino Romano \u2014 which is very salty and more of a cooking cheese. But that image is seared into the minds of even my most food-conscious customers. So I don\u2019t call it pecorino \u2014 I say it\u2019s a sheep milk cheese from Italy. And as soon as we stock it, we sell out.\u201d \u201cTo make a great pecorino, you must know what your sheep eat, how they live,\u201d explained Giancarlo Floris a few days later. Mr. Floris is the owner of Caseificio Piu, another organic farm, home to 1,400 sheep, and some of the most celebrated pecorino di Pienza. He moved to Tuscany from Sardinia when he was only 18. \u201cHalf of my sheep eat wild herbs; their milk is very strong. Half eat planted grains so their cheese tastes softer. A great pecorino should always taste different.\u201dI asked Mr. Floris how many pecorino producers there are in the Val d\u2019Orcia. He started counting on his hand. \u201cTwelve,\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cBut maybe 20.\u201d According to the farmers I met, the secret to their product is the unique combination of Sardinian sheep and Tuscan grass: wild fennel, clover and \u201cthese pastures are full of absinthe,\u201d one farmer told me with a wink, referring to wormwood, the infamous herb that is a primary ingredient of the liquor. \u201cMaybe you love it, maybe you hate it, but pecorino should always surprise you,\u201d Mr. Floris told me. \u201cSupermarket cheese will never surprise you.\u201dWe had moved into the tasting room. Mr. Floris was slicing off pieces of a pecorino stagionato \u2014 pecorino di Pienza aged at least six months. It was salty and earthy, delicately crumbly \u2014 and served by a passionate, fast-talking man who revered the process of making this cheese as much as its history. I may have been eating the perfect food. \u201cThere are about 3,000 sheep in Pienza,\u201d said Mr. Coluccio, a handsome man with an easy smile. \u201cYou would need three million to account for all the cheese that calls itself pecorino di Pienza.\u201dTo understand pecorino di Pienza, to respect it, I had to visit an uncomfortable place that sounded like a Lemony Snicket book: La Camera Calda \u2014 the Hot Room. This is where the whey drains from the curd \u2014 a place as humid as the Amazon and fetid as, well, old milk. A place that smells like something horrible happened. A place no one (who wants to love cheese in ignorance) should ever have to visit. I held my breath the whole time. Blessedly, moments later we continued the tour \u2014 first to La Camera Freda, where the cheese is dried, then to the cantina, the cave in which it is aged. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get bigger,\u201d Ms. Cugusi said. \u201cWe want to make a quality pecorino.\u201d To these artisanal farmers, the two are mutually exclusive. \u201cMy father moved his family here in 1962. The Val d\u2019Orcia has gotten richer but the environment hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 we protect the land, we don\u2019t use chemicals, the shepherds respect the countryside.\u201dWe began our odyssey with pecorino fresco paired with vin santo jam. Then pecorino with saffron, drizzles of local honey, aged pecorino wrapped in walnut leaves, Tropean onion preserve, green tomato mostarda, and on and on. As in any industry, there is competition \u2014 but not between the farmers. \u201cThe French sheep are a problem,\u201d said Michael Schmidig, the son of a local farmer, talking about another breed that has showed up in the valley recently. \u201cThey produce three liters of milk a day. They eat grain and live in a barn. Sardinian sheep produce one liter. They eat grass, they need fences. The French sheep milk is not nearly as good, but you don\u2019t have the problem with wolves.\u201d\u201cThe amazing part of Pienza is that this valley has very poor soil,\u201d said Ulisse Braendli, the owner of Podere Il Casale, where I\u2019d watched the milking. \u201cAnd a suffering plant has to work harder; it will give you more flavor. This valley is full of suffering herbs.\u201d Mr. Braendli moved here from Zurich in 1991 and has been making pecorino di Pienza since 2003. (\u201cLet\u2019s say it wasn\u2019t so legal before that.\u201d)\u201cThe first 10 years were so different,\u201d he said. A good decade before the rest of the world was talking about farm-to-table, Mr. Braendli dreamed of agrarian utopia \u2014 a farm in which he sourced all his own food and wine. \u201cI\u2019m a shepherd,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many of us left.\u201d I asked him if the unseasonably hot summer had any effect on his trade. \u201cThe plants are going crazy; they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. When a clover has made a flower, the pasture is over \u2014 it\u2019s the end of the season. Our clovers bloom at the end of May. But because of the change in climate our clovers are blooming a month earlier. And now we have hail. We never had hail before.\u201d It\u2019s a jolt for a cheese that is \u201cone of the oldest in the world,\u201d Mr. Rubiner told me. \u201cWhat makes this cheese so special is that it\u2019s impossible to replicate elsewhere. Pecorino di Pienza is sweet and complex and it\u2019s reinforced by the emotional attachment to the beautiful place it comes from. It has a story.\u201d It\u2019s the story of an ancient cheese made by people from another place. Cheese that has been produced the same way for thousands of years. But that may not always be the case. The climate is changing. The big factories are moving in. And the French sheep are coming. FARMSRESTAURANTSSHOPsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Wants to Disrupt Health Care in America. In China, Tech Giants Already Have.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology companies like Alibaba and Tencent have made health care a priority for years, and are using China as their laboratory. After testing online medical advice and drug tracking systems, they are now focused on a more advanced tool: artificial intelligence.Their aggressive push underscores the differences between the health care systems in China and the United States.Chinese hospitals are overburdened, with just 1.5 doctors for every 1,000 people \u2014 barely half the figure in the United States. Along with a rapidly aging population, China also has the largest number of obese children in the world, as well as more diabetes patients than anywhere else.Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China\u2019s e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,\u201d said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.\u201cFew of them have made moves as big as in China,\u201d Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s American rivals.Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.Advances in artificial intelligence have already been transformative for China\u2019s overworked doctors.Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient\u2019s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.\u201cNow, you don\u2019t even need a minute,\u201d she said.The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China\u2019s working-age population.There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country\u2019s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for one person to read that many images,\u201d said Dr. Yu.Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China\u2019s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.Yunfeng, the personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invested in one company, Yitu, that hopes to address the shortfall of resources. Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.\u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201dTrying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital\u2019s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.\u201cWe have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.\u201dSui-Lee Wee reported from Beijing and Paul Mozur from Hangzhou.

The impetus for it had been concern over an increasing volume of heroin entering the prison system. During a single week in April 2015, more than 25 people were treated for overdoses across the state\u2019s prisons. Last year, over Columbus Day weekend, eight people were treated in a single facility.But among those who would no longer be able to supply books to prisoners was a volunteer organization called Books Through Bars that delivers thousands of books a year to prisoners around the country free, about cultural history, chess, origami, language-learning. Some of the books in highest demand deal with fighting addiction and depression. The organization was hardly a source of contraband.If you are thinking about running for president as a Democrat in 2020 you don\u2019t want to be the person who stood in the way of anyone reading de Tocqueville in lockup.

{"Headline": "Kimberly-Clark Cutting 5,000 Jobs Amid Pressure on Prices", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies and Kleenex, is laying off about 13 percent of its work force and shedding factories worldwide, amid declining birthrates that are affecting diaper sales and a retail price war that is weighing on profits.The company said Tuesday that it would cut between 5,000 and 5,500 jobs in an effort to reduce expenses as it faced stiffer competition for consumer staples like tissues, paper towels and wet wipes.To help pay for the cuts and other restructuring moves, Kimberly-Clark said, it will use savings from the recently enacted corporate tax cut.The pressures on Kimberly-Clark reflect the upheaval in the retail industry, where a fierce battle among behemoths like Amazon and Walmart is driving down prices, particularly for household items that many consumers treat increasingly as commodities. That competition, in turn, is driving down Kimberly-Clark\u2019s selling prices \u2014 which fell more than 1 percent last year.The price war shows no signs of letting up, as European grocery discounters like Lidl make a big push in the United States, driving down the costs of staples like diapers and milk in certain cities.But the restructuring at Kimberly-Clark is a reminder that while declining prices may benefit consumers, they are sometimes hurting workers.\u201cIt is marginally better for consumers but lousy for workers,\u201d said Peter Cappelli, a professor at management at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThat is the story of modern society.\u201dRestructurings typically come with upfront costs for the companies, as they pay workers severance or renegotiate leases. In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s chief financial officer, Maria Henry, said \u201ccash flow benefits\u201d from the Republican tax cut would help fund \u201cthe restructuring program over the next few years.\u201d She said the tax savings would also be used to make capital investments and to \u201callocate significant capital to shareholders.\u201dProcter & Gamble still faces pressure. On Tuesday, the company said that its total net sales for the second quarter of its fiscal year had increased 3 percent from a year earlier, to $17.4 billion, but that its gross margins across its brands were down.In addition to announcing job cuts on Tuesday, Kimberly-Clark said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 3.1 percent this year. Last year, the company spent about $900 million repurchasing its own shares.But investors have been unimpressed. While the stock market has been roaring, Kimberly Clark\u2019s shares have barely budged, climbing less than 1 percent over the past year.Although Mr. Falk said the restructuring plan would improve the company\u2019s results in 2018, he conceded that \u201cmarket conditions will remain challenging in the near term.\u201dIn the conference call with analysts on Tuesday, executives said that even in the current slow-growth environment, the company needed to find ways to increase profits. The company projected sales growth of between 1 and 2 percent for this year.Kimberly-Clark said the job cuts were expected to affect all parts of the business around the world. The company also said it would close or sell about 10 factories.One particular area of weakness are diaper sales in the United States \u2014 a slowdown that Kimberly Clark executives attributed to lower birthrates.That development may be partly driven by millennials who are putting off or skipping parenthood. Whatever the reason, analysts at JPMorgan Chase attributed their negative view of the company in part to that demographic trend. In October, when the bank downgraded Kimberly-Clark to \u201cunderweight,\u201d it wrote: \u201cLooking ahead, we see potential for an incremental downtick in the birthrate.\u201dKimberly-Clark said its 2017 sales were stronger in emerging markets \u2014 many of which tend to have higher birthrates. But chasing growth in the developing world can be risky because economic conditions can be volatile and logistics more challenging.The job and factory cuts \u2014 which are expected to save up to $550 million by the end of 2021 \u2014 are part of the biggest restructuring move at Kimberly-Clark in over a decade.The company is also aiming to save more than $1.5 billion from its so-called Force program through efforts like improved productivity at its factories and more efficient distribution.Professor Cappelli said that while these measures might help improve profitability in the short term, they did not solve the fundamental challenge of competing in an increasingly commoditized business, where price is the overwhelming driver.\u201cA lot of these announcements are done for the benefit of the stock market,\u201d Mr. Cappelli said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t always work, and then you have to ask, \u2018What is their next move?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Men Who Want to Live Forever", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWould you like to live forever? Some billionaires, already invincible in every other way, have decided that they also deserve not to die. Today several biotech companies, fueled by Silicon Valley fortunes, are devoted to \u201clife extension\u201d \u2014 or as some put it, to solving \u201cthe problem of death.\u201dIt\u2019s a cause championed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the TED Talk darling Aubrey de Gray, Google\u2019s billion-dollar Calico longevity lab and investment by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. The National Academy of Medicine, an independent group, recently dedicated funding to \u201cend aging forever.\u201dAs the longevity entrepreneur Arram Sabeti told The New Yorker: \u201cThe proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn\u2019t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it.\u201d Of all the slightly creepy aspects to this trend, the strangest is the least noticed: The people publicly championing life extension are mainly men.Not all of them, of course. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn received the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, protein caps on chromosomes that may be a key to understanding aging. Cynthia Kenyon, the vice president for aging research at Calico, studied life extension long before it was cool; her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Laura Deming, now runs a venture capital fund for the cause. But these women are focused on curbing age-related pathology, a concept about as controversial as cancer research. They do not appear thirsty for the Fountain of Youth.Professor Blackburn\u2019s new book on telomeres couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cDoes our research show that by maintaining your telomeres you will live into your hundreds?\u201d it says. \u201cNo. Everyone\u2019s cells become old and eventually we die.\u201d Ms. Kenyon once described her research\u2019s goal as \u201cto just have a healthy life and then turn out the lights.\u201d Even Ms. Deming, a 23-year-old prodigy who worked in Ms. Kenyon\u2019s lab at age 12, points out that \u201caging is innately important to us.\u201dFew of these experts come close to matching the gaudy statements of the longevity investor and \u201cbiohacker\u201d Dave Asprey, who has told journalists, \u201cI decided that I was just not going to die.\u201d Or those of Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who has tested an anti-aging gene therapy he developed on himself, who claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of things that will need to be done to achieve life spans into at least hundreds of years. But we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Or of the 74-year-old fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who during a promotional clip receives injections of his own stem cells to reverse his aging while declaring: \u201cPonce de Le\u00f3n had the right idea. He was just too early. That was then. This is now.\u201dI came across Mr. Nygard\u2019s ode to human endurance three years ago while beginning research on a novel about a woman who can\u2019t die, and watching that video allowed me to experience something close to life extension. As Mr. Nygard compared himself to Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin while dancing with a bevy of models \u2014 or as a voice-over explained, \u201cliving a life most can only dream of\u201d \u2014 nine minutes of YouTube expanded into a vapid eternity, where time melted into a vortex of solipsism.At that time I was immersed in caring for my four young children, and this paean to everlasting youth seemed especially stupid. I recall thinking that if this was eternal life, death didn\u2019t seem that bad.But now, as powerful men have begun falling like dominoes under accusations of sexual assault, that video with its young women clustered around an elderly multimillionaire has haunted me anew. As I recall my discomfort with the proclamations of longevity-driven men who hope to achieve \u201cescape velocity,\u201d I think of the astonishing hubris of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, those who saw young women\u2019s bodies as theirs for the taking.Much has been said about why we allowed such behavior to go unchecked. What has remained unsaid, because it is so obvious, is what would make someone so shameless in the first place: These people believed they were invincible. They saw their own bodies as entirely theirs and other people\u2019s bodies as at their disposal; apparently nothing in their lives led them to believe otherwise.Historically, this is a mistake that few women would make, because until very recently, the physical experience of being a woman entailed exactly the opposite \u2014 and not only because women have to hold their keys in self-defense while walking through parking lots at night. It\u2019s only very recently that women have widely participated in public life, but it\u2019s even more recently that men have been welcome, or even expected, to provide physical care for vulnerable people.Only for a nanosecond of human history have men even slightly shared what was once exclusively a woman\u2019s burden: the relentless daily labor of caring for another person\u2019s body, the life-preserving work of cleaning feces and vomit, the constant cycle of cooking and feeding and blanketing and bathing, whether for the young, the ill or the old. For nearly as long as there have been humans, being a female human has meant a daily nonoptional immersion in the fragility of human life and the endless effort required to sustain it.The most obvious cure for today\u2019s gender inequities is to put more women in power. But if we really hope to create an equal society, we will also need more men to care for the powerless \u2014 more women in the boardroom, but also more men at the nurses\u2019 station and the changing table, immersed in daily physical empathy. If that sounds like an evolutionary impossibility, well, it doesn\u2019t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it. It is surely worth at least as much investment as defeating death.Perhaps it takes the promise of immortality to inspire the self-absorbed to invest in unsexy work like Alzheimer\u2019s research. If so, we may all one day bless the inane death-defiance as a means to a worthy end.But men who hope to live forever might pause on their eternal journey to consider the frightening void at invincibility\u2019s core. Death is the ultimate vulnerability. It is the moment when all of us must confront exactly what so many women have known all too well: You are a body, only a body, and nothing more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While You Were Sleeping", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump poses a huge dilemma for commentators: to ignore his daily outrages is to normalize his behavior, but to constantly write about them is to stop learning. Like others, I struggle to get this balance right, which is why I pause today to point out some incredible technological changes happening while Trump has kept us focused on him \u2014 changes that will pose as big an adaptation challenge to American workers as transitioning from farms to factories once did.Two and half years ago I was researching a book that included a section on IBM\u2019s cognitive computer, \u201cWatson,\u201d which had perfected the use of artificial intelligence enough to defeat the two all-time \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champions. After my IBM hosts had shown me Watson at its Yorktown Heights, N.Y., lab, they took me through a room where a small group of IBM scientists were experimenting with something futuristic called \u201cquantum computing.\u201d They left me thinking this was Star Wars stuff \u2014 a galaxy and many years far away.Last week I visited the same lab, where my hosts showed me the world\u2019s first quantum computer that can handle 50 quantum bits, or qubits, which it unveiled in November. They still may need a decade to make this computer powerful enough and reliable enough for groundbreaking industrial applications, but clearly quantum computing has gone from science fiction to nonfiction faster than most anyone expected.Who cares? Well, if you think it\u2019s scary what we can now do with artificial intelligence produced by classical binary digital electronic computers built with transistors \u2014 like make cars that can drive themselves and software that can write news stories or produce humanlike speech \u2014 remember this: These \u201cold\u201d computers still don\u2019t have enough memory or processing power to solve what IBM calls \u201chistorically intractable problems.\u201d Quantum computers, paired with classical computers via the cloud, have the potential to do that in minutes or seconds.For instance, \u201cwhile today\u2019s supercomputers can simulate \u2026 simple molecules,\u201d notes MIT Technology Review, \u201cthey quickly become overwhelmed.\u201d So chemical modelers \u2014 who attempt to come up with new compounds for things like better batteries and lifesaving drugs \u2014 \u201care forced to approximate how an unknown molecule might behave, then test it in the real world to see if it works as expected. The promise of quantum computing is to vastly simplify that process by exactly predicting the structure of a new molecule, and how it will interact with other compounds.\u201dQuantum computers process information, using the capabilities of quantum physics, differently from traditional computers. \u201cWhereas normal computers store information as either a 1 or a 0, quantum computers exploit two phenomena \u2014 entanglement and superposition \u2014 to process information,\u201d explains MIT Technology Review. The result is computers that may one day \u201coperate 100,000 times faster than they do today,\u201d adds Wired magazine.Classical computers don\u2019t solve \u201cbig versions of this problem very well at all,\u201d she said, like trying to crack sophisticated encrypted codes, where you need to try a massive number of variables, or modeling molecules where you need to account for an exponential number of interactions. Quantum computers, with their exponential processing power, will be able to crack most encryption without breaking a sweat.It\u2019s just another reason China, the N.S.A., IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Google are now all racing \u2014 full of sweat \u2014 to build usable quantum systems.\u201cIf I try to map a caffeine molecule problem on a normal computer, that computer would have to be one-tenth the volume of this planet in size,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, head of research at IBM. \u201cA quantum computer just three or four times the size of those we\u2019ve built today should be able to solve that problem.\u201dBut, again, look at where we are today thanks to artificial intelligence from digital computers \u2014 and the amount of middle-skill and even high-skill work they\u2019re supplanting \u2014 and then factor in how all of this could be supercharged in a decade by quantum computing.This will be a challenge for developed countries, but even more so for countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, China and India \u2014 where huge numbers of youths are already unemployed because they lack the education for even this middle-skill work THAT\u2019S now being automated.It\u2019s why IBM\u2019s C.E.O., Ginni Rometty, remarked to me in an interview: \u201cEvery job will require some technology, and therefore we\u2019ll need to revamp education. The K-12 curriculum is obvious, but it\u2019s the adult retraining \u2014 lifelong learning systems \u2014 that will be even more important.\u201dArtificial intelligence \u201cis the opportunity of our time, and skills are the issue of our time. Some jobs will be displaced, but 100 percent of jobs will be augmented by A.I.,\u201d added Rometty. Technology companies \u201care inventing these technologies, so we have the responsibility to help people adapt to it \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just giving them tablets or P.C.s, but lifelong learning systems.\u201dTo back that up, said Rometty, IBM designed Pathways in Technology (P-Tech) schools, partnering with close to 100 public high schools and community colleges to create a six-year program that serves large numbers of low-income students. P-Tech schools offer calculus and physics alongside workplace skills \u2014 problem solving, writing and job interviewing. These skills are reinforced through mentorships and internships with IBM and more than 300 other companies. Kids graduate in six years or less with both a high school diploma and an associate junior college degree.\u201cThe graduation rates are four times the average, and those getting jobs are at two times the median salary,\u201d said Rometty, \u201cand many are going on to four-year colleges.\u201dEach time work gets outsourced or tasks get handed off to a machine, \u201cwe must reach up and learn a new skill or in some ways expand our capabilities as humans in order to fully realize our collaborative potential,\u201d McGowan said.Therefore, education needs to shift \u201cfrom education as a content transfer to learning as a continuous process where the focused outcome is the ability to learn and adapt with agency as opposed to the transactional action of acquiring a set skill,\u201d said McGowan. \u201cInstructors/teachers move from guiding and accessing that transfer process to providing social and emotional support to the individual as they move into the role of driving their own continuous learning.\u201dAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to distract from the \u201cTrump Reality Show,\u201d but I just thought I\u2019d mention that Star Wars technology is coming not only to a theater near you, but to a job near you. We need to be discussing and adapting to its implications as much as we do Trump\u2019s tweets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Follower Factory", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "\n  \n    Photo illustration by Adam Ferriss\n  \nBut on Twitter, there is a version of Jessica that none of her friends or family would recognize. While the two Jessicas share a name, photograph and whimsical bio \u2014 \u201cI have issues\u201d \u2014 the other Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments, cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography, retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200 million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.The accounts that most resemble real people, like Ms. Rychly, reveal a kind of large-scale social identity theft. At least 55,000 of the accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis.\u201cI don\u2019t want my picture connected to the account, nor my name,\u201d Ms. Rychly, now 19, said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone would even pay for it. It is just horrible.\u201dIn November, Facebook disclosed to investors that it had at least twice as many fake users as it previously estimated, indicating that up to 60 million automated accounts may roam the world\u2019s largest social media platform. These fake accounts, known as bots, can help sway advertising audiences and reshape political debates. They can defraud businesses and ruin reputations. Yet their creation and sale fall into a legal gray zone.\u201cThe continued viability of fraudulent accounts and interactions on social media platforms \u2014 and the professionalization of these fraudulent services \u2014 is an indication that there\u2019s still much work to do,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the spread of fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.Despite rising criticism of social media companies and growing scrutiny by elected officials, the trade in fake followers has remained largely opaque. While Twitter and other platforms prohibit buying followers, Devumi and dozens of other sites openly sell them. And social media companies, whose market value is closely tied to the number of people using their services, make their own rules about detecting and eliminating fake accounts.Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, denied that his company sold fake followers and said he knew nothing about social identities stolen from real users. \u201cThe allegations are false, and we do not have knowledge of any such activity,\u201d Mr. Calas said in an email exchange in November.The Times reviewed business and court records showing that Devumi has more than 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors and models. In most cases, the records show, they purchased their own followers. In others, their employees, agents, public relations companies, family members or friends did the buying. For just pennies each \u2014 sometimes even less \u2014 Devumi offers Twitter followers, views on YouTube, plays on SoundCloud, the music-hosting site, and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional-networking site.The actor John Leguizamo has Devumi followers. So do Michael Dell, the computer billionaire, and Ray Lewis, the football commentator and former Ravens linebacker. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who today presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, has hundreds of thousands of fake Devumi followers, as does Akbar Gbajabiamila, the host of the show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d Even a Twitter board member, Martha Lane Fox, has some.At a time when Facebook, Twitter and Google are grappling with an epidemic of political manipulation and fake news, Devumi\u2019s fake followers also serve as phantom foot soldiers in political battles online. Devumi\u2019s customers include both avid supporters and fervent critics of President Trump, and both liberal cable pundits and a reporter at the alt-right bastion Breitbart. Randy Bryce, an ironworker seeking to unseat Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, purchased Devumi followers in 2015, when he was a blogger and labor activist. Louise Linton, the wife of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, bought followers when she was trying to gain traction as an actress.Devumi\u2019s products serve politicians and governments overseas, too. An editor at China\u2019s state-run news agency, Xinhua, paid Devumi for hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter, which the country\u2019s government has banned but sees as a forum for issuing propaganda abroad. An adviser to Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, bought tens of thousands of followers and retweets for Mr. Moreno\u2019s campaign accounts during last year\u2019s elections.Kristin Binns, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not typically suspend users suspected of buying bots, in part because it is difficult for the business to know who is responsible for any given purchase. Twitter would not say whether a sample of fake accounts provided by The Times \u2014 each based on a real user \u2014 violated the company\u2019s policies against impersonation.\u201cWe continue to fight hard to tackle any malicious automation on our platform as well as false or spam accounts,\u201d Ms. Binns said.Unlike some social media companies, Twitter does not require accounts to be associated with a real person. It also permits more automated access to its platform than other companies, making it easier to set up and control large numbers of accounts.Tweets from a Twitter bot look just like those of a normal user, but a bot\u2019s tweets are generated by a computer program, rather than a person. Below are three examples of common bot types you might encounter on Twitter and an approximation of the code controls them.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cSocial media is a virtual world that is filled with half bots, half real people,\u201d said Rami Essaid, the founder of Distil Networks, a cybersecurity company that specializes in eradicating bot networks. \u201cYou can\u2019t take any tweet at face value. And not everything is what it seems.\u201dIncluding, it turns out, Devumi itself.Last year, three billion people logged on to social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and China\u2019s Sina Weibo. The world\u2019s collective yearning for connection has not only reshaped the Fortune 500 and upended the advertising industry but also created a new status marker: the number of people who follow, like or \u201cfriend\u201d you. For some entertainers and entrepreneurs, this virtual status is a real-world currency. Follower counts on social networks help determine who will hire them, how much they are paid for bookings or endorsements, even how potential customers evaluate their businesses or products.High follower counts are also critical for so-called influencers, a budding market of amateur tastemakers and YouTube stars where advertisers now lavish billions of dollars a year on sponsorship deals. The more people influencers reach, the more money they make. According to data collected by Captiv8, a company that connects influencers to brands, an influencer with 100,000 followers might earn an average of $2,000 for a promotional tweet, while an influencer with a million followers might earn $20,000.Genuine fame often translates into genuine social media influence, as fans follow and like their favorite movie stars, celebrity chefs and models. But shortcuts are also available: On sites like Social Envy and DIYLikes.com, it takes little more than a credit-card number to buy a huge following on almost any social media platform. Most of these sites offer what they describe as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d followers, never quite stating whether real people are behind them. Once purchased, the followers can be a powerful tool.\u201cYou see a higher follower count, or a higher retweet count, and you assume this person is important, or this tweet was well received,\u201d said Rand Fishkin, the founder of Moz, a company that makes search engine optimization software. \u201cAs a result, you might be more likely to amplify it, to share it or to follow that person.\u201dTwitter and Facebook can be similarly influenced. \u201cSocial platforms are trying to recommend stuff \u2014 and they say, \u2018Is the stuff we are recommending popular?\u2019\u201d said Julian Tempelsman, the co-founder of Smyte, a security firm that helps companies combat online abuse, bots and fraud. \u201cFollower counts are one of the factors social media platforms use.\u201dTo better understand Devumi\u2019s business, we became a customer. In April, The Times set up a test account on Twitter and paid Devumi $225 for 25,000 followers, or about a penny each. As advertised, the first 10,000 or so looked like real people. They had pictures and full names, hometowns and often authentic-seeming biographies. One account looked like that of Ms. Rychly, the young Minnesota woman.But on closer inspection, some of the details seemed off. The account names had extra letters or underscores, or easy-to-miss substitutions, like a lowercase \u201cL\u201d in place of an uppercase \u201cI.\u201dDevumi claims to use its own \u201cprivate network of hand-picked real and active Twitter users and influencers\u201d. In reality, it sells bots with stolen profiles. Here are the details that give them away.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusThe next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: no profile pictures, and jumbles of letters, numbers and word fragments instead of names.But company records reviewed by The Times revealed much of what Devumi and its customers prefer to conceal.Most of Devumi\u2019s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. In interviews, their explanations varied. They bought followers because they were curious about how it worked, or felt pressure to generate high follower counts for themselves or their customers. \u201cEveryone does it,\u201d said the actress Deirdre Lovejoy, a Devumi customer.While some said they believed Devumi was supplying real potential fans or customers, others acknowledged that they knew or suspected they were getting fake accounts. Several said they regretted their purchases.\u201cIt\u2019s fraud,\u201d said James Cracknell, a British rower and Olympic gold medalist who bought 50,000 followers from Devumi. \u201cPeople who judge by how many likes or how many followers, it\u2019s not a healthy thing.\u201dMs. Ireland has over a million followers on Twitter, which she often uses to promote companies with whom she has endorsement deals. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance, for example, said that the former model was one of its most influential Twitter \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d celebrities who are paid to help promote products.But in January last year, Ms. Ireland had only about 160,000 followers. The next month, an employee at the branding agency she owns, Sterling/Winters, spent about $2,000 for 300,000 more followers, according to Devumi records. The employee later made more purchases, he acknowledged in an interview. Much of Ms. Ireland\u2019s Twitter following appears to consist of bots, a Times analysis found.A spokeswoman said that the employee had acted without Ms. Ireland\u2019s authorization and had been suspended after The Times asked about the purchases. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thought he was fulfilling his duties, but it\u2019s not something he should have done,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Rona Menashe.Several Devumi customers or their representatives contacted by The Times declined to comment, among them Mr. Leguizamo, whose followers were bought by an associate. Many more did not respond to repeated efforts to contact them.A few denied making Devumi purchases. They include Ashley Knight, Mr. Lewis\u2019s personal assistant, whose email address was listed on an order for 250,000 followers, and Eric Kaplan, a friend to Mr. Trump and motivational speaker whose personal email address was associated with eight orders. A Twitter account belonging to Paul Hollywood, the celebrity baker, was deleted after The Times emailed him with questions. Mr. Hollywood then sent a reply: \u201cAccount does not exist.\u201dMany of these celebrities, business leaders, sports stars and other Twitter users bought their own followers, records show. In other cases, the purchases were made by their employees, agents, family members or other associates.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusOver two years, the Democratic public relations consultant and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen bought more than a half-million fake followers from Devumi. Ms. Rosen previously spent more than a decade as head of the Recording Industry Association of America. In an interview, she described the purchases as \u201can experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked.\u201d She made more than a dozen purchases of followers from 2015 to 2017, according to company records.Other buyers said they had faced pressure from employers to generate social media followers. Marcus Holmlund, a young freelance writer, was at first thrilled when Wilhelmina, the international modeling agency, hired him to manage its social media efforts. But when Wilhelmina\u2019s Twitter following didn\u2019t grow fast enough, Mr. Holmlund said, a supervisor told him to buy followers or find another job. In 2015, despite misgivings, he began making monthly Devumi purchases out of his own pocket.\u201cI felt stuck with the threat of being fired, or worse, never working in fashion again,\u201d said Mr. Holmlund, who left in late 2015. \u201cSince then, I tell anyone and everyone who ever asks that it\u2019s a total scam \u2014 it won\u2019t boost their engagement.\u201d (A Wilhelmina spokeswoman declined to comment.)Several Devumi customers acknowledged that they bought bots because their careers had come to depend, in part, on the appearance of social media influence. \u201cNo one will take you seriously if you don\u2019t have a noteworthy presence,\u201d said Jason Schenker, an economist who specializes in economic forecasting and has purchased at least 260,000 followers.Not surprisingly, Devumi has sold millions of followers and retweets to entertainers on the lower and middle rungs of Hollywood, such as the actor Ryan Hurst, a star of the television series \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d In 2016 and 2017, he bought a total of 750,000 followers, about three-quarters of his current count. It cost less than $4,000, according to company records. Mr. Hurst did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Mr. Aiken and Ms. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.More than a hundred self-described influencers \u2014 whose market value is even more directly linked to their follower counts on social media \u2014 have purchased Twitter followers from Devumi. Justin Blau, a popular Las Vegas-based D.J. who performs as 3LAU, acquired 50,000 followers and thousands of retweets. In an email, Mr. Blau said a former member of his management team bought them without his approval.At least five Devumi influencer customers are also contractors for HelloSociety, an influencer agency owned by The New York Times Company. (A Times spokeswoman said the company sought to verify that the audience of each contractor was legitimate and would not do business with anyone who violated that standard.) Lucas Peterson, a freelance journalist who writes a travel column for The Times, also bought followers from Devumi.But her Twitter account \u2014 and her brother\u2019s \u2014 are boosted by thousands of retweets purchased by their mother and manager, Shadia Daho, according to Devumi records. Ms. Daho did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her by email and through a public relations firm.Mr. Pallen at first denied buying those followers. After The Times contacted Ms. Greiner, Mr. Pallen said he had \u201cexperimented\u201d with the company but \u201cstopped using it long ago.\u201d A lawyer for Ms. Greiner said she had asked him to stop after learning of the first purchases.Still, records show, Mr. Pallen bought Ms. Greiner more Devumi followers in 2016.Marketing consultants sometimes buy followers for themselves, too, in effect purchasing the evidence of their supposed expertise. In 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, a former adjunct professor at the University of Southern California who calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading celebrity branding authority,\u201d began buying hundreds of thousands of fake followers from Devumi.He did not respond to requests for comment. But in his recent best-selling book, \u201cThe Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells,\u201d he had a different explanation for his rising follower count. \u201cMy social media following exploded,\u201d Mr. Sehdev claimed, because he had discovered the true secret to celebrity influence: \u201cAuthenticity is the key.\u201dAmong the followers delivered to Mr. Sehdev was Ms. Rychly \u2014 or at least, a copy of her. The fake Rychly account, created in 2014, was included in the purchase orders of hundreds of Devumi customers. It was retweeted by Mr. Schenker, the economist, and Arabella Daho, the teenage influencer. Clive Standen, star of the show \u201cTaken,\u201d ended up with Ms. Rychly\u2019s stolen social identity. So did the television baker Mr. Hollywood, the French entertainer DJ Snake and Ms. Ireland. (DJ Snake\u2019s followers were purchased by a former manager, and Mr. Standen did not respond to requests for comment.)The fake Ms. Rychly also retweeted at least five accounts linked to a prolific American pornographer named Dan Leal, who is based in Hungary and tweets as @PornoDan. Mr. Leal, who has bought at least 150,000 followers from Devumi in recent years, is one of at least dozens of customers who work in the adult film industry or as escorts, according to a review of Devumi records.In an email, Mr. Leal said that buying followers for his business generated more than enough new revenue to pay for the expense. He was not worried about being penalized by Twitter, Mr. Leal said. \u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dDevumi has sold at least tens of thousands of similar high-quality bots, a Times analysis found. In some cases, a single real Twitter user was transformed into hundreds of different bots, each a minute variation on the original.Individually, fake accounts are hard to detect. Study their group behaviour, and incriminating patterns begin to emerge.By Richard Harris and Mark HansenThese fake accounts borrowed social identities from Twitter users in every American state and dozens of countries, from adults and minors alike, from highly active users and those who hadn\u2019t logged in to their accounts for months or years.The fake account remained dormant until last year, when it suddenly began retweeting Devumi customers continuously. This summer, the fake Mr. Dodd promoted various pornographic accounts, including Mr. Leal\u2019s Immoral Productions, as well as a link to a gambling website.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019d take my identity \u2014 I\u2019m a 20-year-old college student,\u201d Mr. Dodd said. \u201cI\u2019m not well known.\u201d But even unknown, Mr. Dodd\u2019s social identity has value in the influence economy. At prices posted in December, Devumi was selling high-quality followers for under two cents each. Sold to about 2,000 customers \u2014 the rough number that many Devumi bot accounts follow \u2014 his social identity could bring Devumi around $30.The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi\u2019s brand. The high-quality bots are usually delivered to customers first, followed by millions of cheaper, low-quality bots, like sawdust mixed in with grated Parmesan.Some of Devumi\u2019s high-quality bots, in effect, replace an idle Twitter account \u2014 belonging to someone who stopped using the service \u2014 with a fake one. Whitney Wolfe, an executive assistant who lives in Florida, opened a Twitter account in 2008, when she was a wedding planner. By the time she stopped using it regularly in 2014, a fake account copying her personal information had been created. In recent months, it has retweeted adult film actresses, several influencers and an escort turned memoirist.\u201cThe content \u2014 pictures of women in thongs, pictures of women\u2019s chests \u2014 it\u2019s not anything I want to be represented with my faith, my name, where I live,\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, who is active in her local Southern Baptist congregation.Other victims were still active on Twitter when Devumi-sold bots began impersonating them. Salle Ingle, a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Colorado, said she worried that a potential employer would come across the fake version of her while vetting her social media accounts.\u201cI\u2019ve been applying for new jobs, and I\u2019m really grateful that no one saw this account and thought it was me,\u201d Ms. Ingle said. Once contacted by The Times, Ms. Ingle reported the account to Twitter, which deactivated it.After emailing Mr. Calas last year, a Times reporter visited Devumi\u2019s Manhattan address, listed on its website. The building has dozens of tenants, including a medical clinic and a labor union. But Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, do not appear to be among them. A spokesman for the building\u2019s owner said neither Devumi nor Bytion had ever rented space there.Like the followers Devumi sold, the office was an illusion.In real life, Devumi is based in a small office suite above a Mexican restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., overlooking an alley crowded with Dumpsters and parked cars. Mr. Calas lives a short commute away, in a penthouse apartment.Mr. Calas, who is 27, grew up in South Florida, where as a teenager he learned web design and built sites for local businesses, according to earlier versions of his personal web page available on the Internet Archive.Eventually he taught himself techniques for search engine optimization \u2014 the art of pushing a web page higher in search results. While in high school, he began taking classes at Palm Beach State College, where he earned an associate degree in 2012, according to a school spokeswoman. Within a few years, Mr. Calas was claiming to have built dozens of online businesses serving 10 million customers, now under the Bytion umbrella.\u201cI started this company with a thousand dollars in the bank, without investors, and only the burning passion for success,\u201d Mr. Calas wrote last year on the job-listing site Glassdoor.According to former employees interviewed by The Times, turnover was high at Devumi, and Mr. Calas kept his operation tightly compartmentalized. Employees sometimes had little idea what their colleagues were doing, even if they were working on the same project.Dozens of Devumi\u2019s customer service and order fulfillment personnel are based in the Philippines, according to company records. Employing overseas contractors may have helped Mr. Calas hold down costs. But it also appears to have left him vulnerable to a kind of social identity theft himself.His copycat company used a similar name \u2014 DevumiBoost \u2014 and copied the design of Devumi\u2019s website, Mr. Calas alleged. The fake Devumi even listed the same phantom Manhattan address. Over a stretch of days last July, Mr. Boado, posing as a Devumi employee, emailed hundreds of Devumi customers to inform them that their orders needed to be reprocessed on DevumiBoost. Then he impersonated the customers, too, emailing Devumi under different aliases to ask that Devumi cancel the original orders. Mr. Boado, according to Mr. Calas, was trying to steal his customers. (Mr. Boado did not respond to emails seeking a response to Mr. Calas\u2019s claims.)Mr. Calas\u2019s lawsuit also revealed something else: Devumi doesn\u2019t appear to make its own bots. Instead, the company buys them wholesale \u2014 from a thriving global market of fake social media accounts.Scattered around the web is an array of obscure websites where anonymous bot makers around the world connect with retailers like Devumi. While individual customers can buy from some of these bare-boned sites \u2014 Peakerr, CheapPanel and YTbot, among others \u2014 they are less user-friendly. Some, for example, do not accept credit cards, only cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.But each site sells followers, likes and shares in bulk, for a variety of social media platforms and in different languages. The accounts they sell may change hands repeatedly. The same account may even be available from more than one seller.Devumi, according to one former employee, sourced bots from different bot makers depending on price, quality and reliability. On Peakerr, for example, 1,000 high-quality, English-language bots with photos costs a little more than a dollar. Devumi charges $17 for the same quantity.The price difference has allowed Mr. Calas to build a small fortune, according to company records. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $6 million in sales during that period.Last month, Mr. Calas asked for examples of bots The Times found that copied real users. After receiving the names of 10 accounts, Mr. Calas, who had agreed to an interview, asked for more time to analyze them. Then he stopped responding to emails.Ms. Binns, the Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not proactively review accounts to see if they were impersonating other users. Instead, the company\u2019s efforts are focused on identifying and suspending accounts that violate Twitter\u2019s spam policies. In December, for example, the company identified an average of 6.4 million suspicious accounts each week, she said.All of the sample accounts provided by The Times violated Twitter\u2019s anti-spam policies and were shut down, Ms. Binns said. \u201cWe take the action of suspending an account from the platform very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we want to aggressively fight spam on the platform.\u201dThe company also suspended Devumi\u2019s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.Yet Twitter has not imposed seemingly simple safeguards that would help throttle bot manufacturers, such as requiring anyone signing up for a new account to pass an anti-spam test, as many commercial sites do. As a result, Twitter now hosts vast swaths of unused accounts, including what are probably dormant accounts controlled by bot makers.Former employees said the company\u2019s security team for many years was more focused on abuse by real users, including racist and sexist content and orchestrated harassment campaigns. Only recently, they said, after revelations that Russia-aligned hackers had deployed networks of Twitter bots to spread divisive content and junk news, has Twitter turned more attention to weeding out fake accounts.Leslie Miley, an engineer who worked on security and user safety at Twitter before leaving in late 2015, said, \u201cTwitter as a social network was designed with almost no accountability.\u201dSome critics believe Twitter has a business incentive against weeding out bots too aggressively. Over the past two years, the company has struggled to generate the user growth seen by rivals like Facebook and Snapchat. And outside researchers have disputed the company\u2019s estimates for how many of its active users are actually bots.Small design changes over a number of years has placed an increasingly greater focus on user engagement with replies, retweets and likes in Twitter\u2019s timeline.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cWe\u2019re working with completely unregulated, closed ecosystems that aren\u2019t reporting on these things. They have a perverse incentive to let it happen,\u201d said Mr. Essaid, the cybersecurity expert. \u201cThey want to police it to the extent it doesn\u2019t seem obvious, but they make money off it.\u201dIn January, after almost two years of promoting hundreds of Devumi customers, the fake Jessica Rychly account was finally flagged by Twitter\u2019s security algorithms. It was recently suspended.But the real Ms. Rychly may soon leave Twitter for good.\u201cI am probably just going to delete my Twitter account,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa and Felipe Villamor.

{"Headline": "States Pay the Price When You Buy Online", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCan online retailers be compelled by law to collect a sales tax? According to the Supreme Court, no \u2014 but that could change if, in the next few weeks, it decides to take up a case challenging the current rule.Customers may be confused: Some online retailers do collect sales taxes, at least sometimes. Amazon, for example, collects them on Amazon transactions, but not on third-party-vendor transactions sold through Amazon.Quill sold office supplies to North Dakota customers by catalog and by phone. But it had no employees in the state and insignificant other property. North Dakota argued that since Quill engaged in \u201cregular and systematic solicitation\u201d of North Dakotans, it was required to collect sales tax from them. Quill countered that having to collect the tax would unduly burden interstate commerce.In deciding for Quill, the Supreme Court cited the \u201cadministrative and record-keeping requirements\u201d that could \u201centangle\u201d a mail-order house if it were subject to sales-tax obligations in every jurisdiction. These requirements, the court decided, were indeed undue burdens that would ultimately harm the national economy.As the landscape of commerce has changed to e-commerce, the costs of the Quill decision have become starkly obvious. Brick-and-mortar merchants collect the sales tax at the point of sale. But since states can\u2019t compel online retailers to collect sales taxes, they have to rely on citizens to report the tax (a \u201cuse tax\u201d) on their income tax returns, making enforcement and compliance difficult.The failure of e-commerce vendors to collect sales tax leads to broader problems. With the revenue shortfalls caused by under-compliance, states must either cut spending on services and public goods, like the police, or raise taxes on income, property and sales made by retailers that maintain a physical presence within the state.For their part, retailers say that out-of-state retailers should not be deputized as an agent of the state. That job, they say, is for the state to do, through the enforcement of the use tax. This is essentially the same argument made in Quill.But Quill arguments are less compelling now than in 1992. For example, the administrative and record-keeping burden didn\u2019t disappear under the physical-presence rule \u2014 it was merely shifted to consumers, who are left to comply with tax obligations on their own. And improvements in technology mean that collecting sales tax for different states isn\u2019t nearly the burden for retailers that it would have been in 1992.The Quill decision has now not only hurt states but also distorted behavior of big retailers: It discourages them from establishing a brick-and-mortar location (and creating jobs) in a new state and being liable for collecting its sales tax. Online retailers also enjoy state services \u2014 like roads that allow their products to be delivered efficiently to customers \u2014 without contributing to their upkeep.Normally, one does not have an opportunity to fix a mistake. Let\u2019s hope the Supreme Court in Wayfair takes advantage of that opportunity.If not, you may notice worse roads because most consumers are not voluntarily reporting the use tax.David J.

{"Headline": "4 Questions as Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan Take on Health Care: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital.\u2022 JPMorgan has (and hasn\u2019t) clarified its succession plans.\u2022 What should we expect in tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech?Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees.But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.1) What is it?The venture will be an independent company that \u201cis free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won\u2019t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm. His distinguished career of over 30 years leading global financial institutions and asset management businesses brings unique experience that will benefit Oz significantly.\u201dAnd a statement by Mr. Levin, who had weighed quitting \u2014 but was identified in today\u2019s statement as still being Och-Ziff\u2019s co-chief investment officer:\u201cOz is a tremendous firm with a talented and creative team that works each day to identify and execute on the most compelling investment opportunities around the world. I am excited about the future and look forward to welcoming Rob.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,\u201d JPMorgan said in its statement. But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years.Critics\u2019 cornerHere\u2019s what Ajit Pai of the F.C.C. said:\u201cAny federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\u201dIt lays bare the differences between two camps in the administration that have been present since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: economic nationalists and China hawks.Among those officials aggressively pushing the 5G network are two China hard-liners: Gen. Robert S. Spalding II, the senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council.Elsewhere in techThe recapMr. Weiss was one of Lazard\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking. He worked on InBev\u2019s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E. Master Blenders to JAB, the investment firm that later bought Keurig.)Since thenHe has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank. And he might yet start his own shop.Companies want to go public. But recent news suggests that many want to avoid the initial public offering process.Of course, there will still be I.P.O.s.: Uber, Dropbox and Airbnb are all working toward offerings. But if some companies can avoid the process, it appears they will.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Big Tech Trends to Follow at CES 2018", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixImagine this: When you leave the house, your air conditioner and lights turn off automatically. Then when a motion sensor detects a person in the house, like your house cleaner, it sends an alert to your phone. When you arrive home, a camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks.The real star is artificial intelligence, the culmination of software, algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated. It is A.I. that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you, or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect a person.\u201cIt\u2019s less about the hardware, and more about what\u2019s inside,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at CES. For consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices, A.I. is never as exciting, she said \u2014 but it\u2019s the magic that is making hardware evolve.That artificial intelligence will take center stage at CES also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years. It has become less of a venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers, and instead has turned into a showcase for nascent technologies.Here are some highlights you can expect from next week\u2019s show.Smaller tech companies have teamed up with Amazon to bring voice-controlled smarts to their products. Devices like light bulbs, car stereo accessories, robovacuums, home security systems and even coffee makers will work with Alexa. In addition, thousands of companies have developed \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, that work with Alexa voice commands. Sonos, a premium audio brand, recently released a speaker with Alexa functionality built in.\u201cIf I had to make a bet, it\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.Now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home.Consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them, and can then alert people when spots free up. Or a garbage can that can notify a waste collection facility when the container is full, or street lamps planted throughout a city that could monitor air quality.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the smart home,\u201d Mr. Gownder said. \u201cThe smart city is elevating that to the next level.\u201dNext week, companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure.Self-driving-car enthusiasts like Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, dream of a future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes.\u201cYour car doesn\u2019t drive itself, at least not reliably for a long period of time,\u201d said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.Still, at CES, carmakers like Ford, Hyundai, BMW and Audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self-driving tech, like smarter parking assistance and less error-prone collision avoidance. These are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles, but some features may appear in cars in the coming years.With 5G, wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download a movie in less than five seconds \u2014 roughly 100 times faster than the current network technology, 4G. Even more important, 5G is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times.(One caveat: the wireless industry is not expected to roll out 5G until 2020. Telecom equipment makers and tech companies are still fighting over which of their technologies should be standardized globally.)\u201cIt could be foundational to the next generation of advancements,\u201d said Greg Roberts, an executive at Accenture, a tech consulting firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more talk around the potential of 5G to remove the barriers around bandwidth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Chooses 20 Finalists for Second Headquarters", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Like a college applicant waiting for that special message in the mail, officials in Boston got what they wanted on Thursday: a cryptic four-sentence note informing them that the city made the finals in its bid to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u201cWe would like to move Boston forward in the process so we can continue to learn more about your community, your talent, and potential real estate options,\u201d Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive, wrote in the note. \u201cPlease email me back with available times for a call so we can discuss next steps.\u201dThe winner could get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in investment, figures that Amazon has dangled in front of local officials, setting off an unprecedented competition to be the second home for one of the internet\u2019s mightiest companies. In all, 238 cities and regions applied to bring the company to town, many using promises of tax breaks and public charm offensives to gain favor with the e-commerce giant.The finalists include places like Newark, where the local economy has struggled for decades, and hip centers like Miami and Austin, Tex. For other cities, like Los Angeles and New York, luring Amazon would cement their place as centers of the tech industry.The other finalists are Atlanta; Chicago; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Md.; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; Washington and Toronto \u2014 the only one outside the United States.Officials from the 20 locations celebrated their selections and, in most cases, reiterated their pitches for why Amazon should ultimately pick them. Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, said Amazon would have \u201ca tremendous social and economic impact on this city, state and region by coming to Newark.\u201dKathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, reacted with what could be perceived as a dig at her American competitors. Toronto was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d for Amazon, in part because of Canada\u2019s universal health care system and its openness to immigrants, she said.\u201cWe are already welcoming the best and brightest talent from around the world \u2014 no matter where you come from, you are welcome and you will feel at home in Ontario,\u201d Ms. Wynne said.But there were several surprise snubs, too. Amazon rejected applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego, plus all the bids from Mexico. The list leaned east, away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast.\u201cGetting from 238 to 20 was very tough \u2014 all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\u201d Ms. Sullivan, Amazon\u2019s head of economic development, said in a statement. \u201cThrough this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\u201dAmazon shrouded its selection process in secrecy. On Thursday, the company said little about how it had pared down the list, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier.The process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate, according to people briefed on the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term \u201cHQ2,\u201d was also involved, the people said.The veil of secrecy kept even the finalist cities in the dark until Thursday\u2019s announcement.Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, was on her way into the office when a deputy mayor called and said that the city had made the Top 20. \u201cI was, of course, pleased, but not that surprised because we know that Washington, D.C., matches what Amazon is looking for,\u201d Ms. Bowser said.Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.\u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said.The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year \u2014 and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. Emissaries from Amazon are expected to visit the finalist locations in person.Some of the finalists are neighbors, setting up what are likely to be intense regional rivalries. Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.\u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201dMayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.\u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.\u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201dTiffany Hsu, Patricia Mazzei, Conor Dougherty, Mitch Smith, Kirk Johnson and Zach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Promising Billions to Amazon: Is It a Good Deal for Cities?", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany economists, however, saw something else: a failed development strategy that they had hoped was falling out of favor.In their view, tax incentives are little more than corporate giveaways that divert money from education, infrastructure and other priorities that ultimately do more for a region\u2019s economy. In the last decade, those arguments seemed to be gaining traction, as state and local officials put limits on once-generous handouts.\u201cThe stakes are getting higher and the deals are getting worse for the taxpayer,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of tax incentives.More than 200 North American cities submitted bids for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, and the enthusiasm is hardly surprising. The e-commerce giant has said it plans to invest as much as $5 billion in the project and to hire up to 50,000 workers, most earning high salaries. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the project could be \u201ctransformational even for a big city.\u201dBut the project also carries risks. Accommodating Amazon\u2019s thousands of workers will require hiring more teachers, widening roads and building more housing. The costs for those upgrades will fall on residents and existing businesses.Gina Schaefer, who owns a dozen hardware stores in the Washington area, said she did not mind paying taxes, and had learned to deal with the bureaucratic hurdles that come with running a small business in the area. But she said it was frustrating to watch local governments \u2014 three of the 20 finalists for the Amazon project are in the Washington area \u2014 roll out the red carpet for a multibillion-dollar corporation. Suddenly, she said, her tax dollars could be flowing to one of her most daunting competitors.\u201cThere are no incentives for those of us who are already here,\u201d Ms. Schaefer said. Alluding to Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, she added, \u201cWhy should the richest man in the history of the world get money to open his business?\u201dIndeed, tax incentives tend to flow overwhelmingly to big, established companies, rather than to the local start-ups that research has shown are a more significant source of job growth. And some who have studied the issue say incentives rarely work: Companies will play cities and states off one another to save money, but ultimately base site-selection decisions mostly on other factors.Megan Randall, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies economic development policy, said companies cared most about a talented work force, which requires good schools and colleges, and amenities like affordable housing, parks and public transit that make a place desirable. Tax incentives, she said, make those investments harder for local governments to afford.\u201cThose dollars are things that could go toward educating kids, building roads, investing in quality of life for your residents,\u201d Ms. Randall said.Many local officials acknowledge the downsides to incentives, and say they try to build in protections, such as clawback clauses that require companies to repay incentives if they do not hire as many workers as promised. But they say that refusing to offer incentives at all is the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.\u201cNobody wants to get involved in it, nobody wants to have to do this, but we\u2019re in a competitive environment,\u201d said Dennis M. Davin, secretary of community and economic development for Pennsylvania, where two cities \u2014 Philadelphia and Pittsburgh \u2014 are among the 20 finalists for the Amazon project.Still, until recently there had been signs that cities and states were, if not declaring a cease-fire, at least taking steps toward de-escalation in the incentive wars. Counties in Ohio and Colorado reached regional agreements to stop using tax breaks to compete with one another, and Florida\u2019s Legislature voted to rein in that state\u2019s business incentive program. Several states commissioned audits of their programs and took steps to make them more transparent.And although megadeals never disappeared, the growth of incentives programs did slow for a period. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., has compiled a database of state tax incentives dating back to 1990. The value of such incentives soared in the 1990s, Mr. Bartik has found, but has largely leveled off since the early 2000s.\u201cIt really seemed like the incentive competition had kind of stabilized,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.Economists are not opposed to all incentives in all cases. Publicly funded transportation upgrades or job-training programs, for example, can help entice companies while also benefiting existing businesses. Tax credits aimed at revitalizing abandoned, polluted or blighted areas can encourage development that eventually expands a city\u2019s tax base.That is essentially the approach taken by New York, another Amazon finalist. Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said Amazon would probably get hardly any tax breaks if it chose to locate its second headquarters in Midtown or Lower Manhattan, the city\u2019s two traditional business centers. But the company would get tax breaks if it selected less-established sites in Brooklyn or Queens. Those incentives, she noted, are available to any company that locates in those areas, although New York State could also offer its own tax breaks.\u201cWe don\u2019t rely on incentives, but we do have incentives in place to encourage companies to go to parts of the city that they might not otherwise consider,\u201d Ms. Glen said.Many cities have kept the details of their bids under wraps, but have left little doubt that they are open to negotiations.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be outbid on Amazon doing business here,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas. \u201cWe dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best.\u201dBut even in Texas, there are limits.\u201cI knew it was going to be a big bloody incentive war,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, \u201cand I just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to play in that kind of game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of community and economic development. He is Dennis M. Davin, not David.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Amazon Benefits From Losing Cities\u2019 HQ2 Bids", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The other week, 218 cities and states lost in the sweepstakes to be the home of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, failing to make the list of 20 finalists.But Amazon thanks them for playing.That is because the hundreds of applications gave Amazon a hidden benefit: free research that the company can mine when picking spots for future warehouses and satellite offices.Amazon asked every city and state applying for its second headquarters for details about local resources, like available talent and transit options. Local officials were also prodded for tips on local education programs and tax incentives.The answers \u2014 most of which have not been released publicly \u2014 essentially do Amazon\u2019s homework for it, providing valuable information that the company otherwise would have needed to dig up on its own or obtain through one-on-one negotiations.The application from the Kansas City, Mo., region detailed a program for teaching technical skills to preschoolers through 12th graders, according to a person briefed on the submissions, who would speak only anonymously because the discussions were private. A local coalition that helps military veterans make the transition to civilian jobs, which could help Amazon\u2019s efforts to recruit veterans, also caught the company\u2019s eye.The company did not realize until it saw the application from Louisville, Ky., the person said, that there is a large pool of technical talent within 200 miles of the city and a local public-private partnership that helps train students to become entry-level software developers.The Montreal submission stood out, the person said, with its thinking about attracting foreign talent to the region.Amazon alluded to the upside of the information last week when Holly Sullivan, its head of economic development, said the rejected locations could receive a consolation prize of sorts.Amazon\u2019s plans are another illustration of how its search contest is about more than a second headquarters, or HQ2, as the company calls it. The winning location, Amazon says, will get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in construction. Those promises have generated extraordinary genuflection from politicians across North America, and a lot of glowing news coverage, at a moment of heightened scrutiny about Amazon\u2019s market power.By getting 238 communities to give their best pitch, Amazon has also gotten insight into the kinds of accommodations that places are willing to make to bring it to town.\u201cThis is not just about HQ2,\u201d said Richard Florida, an authority on urban development and a professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s about a broader locational strategy. HQ2 is the carrot. That\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.\u201dThe proposal from Detroit, which did not make the final 20, offers another peek into the sort of incentives that Amazon has received from the HQ2 bids, and how the inducements could factor into Amazon\u2019s planning for other projects.Mr. Adler said Amazon\u2019s bidding process would make Detroit a stronger contender for any company looking for a new or expanded location. Amazon already has other facilities in the state, and Michigan welcomes more of them, he said.\u201cWe heard from Amazon that some of the key things in our favor during the review process were our commitment to partnerships, the creativity of our proposal and the investments being made in the region\u2019s growth,\u201d Mr. Adler said.Only about 40,000 of Amazon\u2019s 540,000 global employees work in Seattle, its home base. Its work force is largely spread across warehouses and other parts of the logistics network that deliver the billions of items Amazon ships every year.Amazon warehouses are often close to metropolitan areas so orders can be delivered to population centers as quickly as possible. A company site selection team scouts potential locations.Mark Williams, president of the Strategic Development Group, a site selection consulting firm, said available tax breaks, like those offered by Detroit, could be one of the most important pieces of information for Amazon.\u201cThere are discretionary incentives that aren\u2019t on the books that come in the heat of a deal,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIn most cases, those are the most valuable incentives.\u201dBut he said the bids could also show a community\u2019s willingness to offer other benefits.\u201cThere are special grant funds, special bond funds, naming of roads,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can acquire these through a data search.\u201dMr. Florida, the urban studies professor, advised Kansas City (an also-ran) and Toronto (a finalist) on their bids. He believes Amazon also \u201chas something in mind\u201d for the 20 places still in the game \u2014 including Indianapolis, Miami and Columbus, Ohio. The company is talking to all 20 and getting even more information from them.\u201cWhat is a better distribution hub than Columbus or Indianapolis?\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cWhat is a better Latin America headquarters than Miami?\u201dThe city boasted about the large number of faculty at the University of Colorado, in nearby Boulder, focused on computer science. Denver also suggested a handful of possible development sites for Amazon, though those locations were redacted from the public material.\u201cThere is no better place for Amazon\u2019s second home than Colorado,\u201d John W. Hickenlooper, the state\u2019s governor, said in a cover letter with its application addressed to Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First State of the Union Address: A Call for Unity That Wasn\u2019t Always Heard That Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The centerpiece of the State of the Union address was what Mr. Trump called a \u201cdown the middle\u201d compromise on immigration, but Democrats booed some of his proposals.\u2022 The president called for bipartisan unity, citing infrastructure, but he gave no details and offered no road map for how to enact such an ambitious plan.\u2022 Also notable was what he left out. He made no mention of the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, nor did he acknowledge the #MeToo moment, even as female lawmakers wore black to mark the cultural moment.\u2022 Mr. Kennedy\u2019s use of Spanish in the middle of his speech signaled a different attitude toward immigrants than Mr. Trump\u2019s.The president promised an optimistic, bipartisan speech, and he largely avoided some of the negative imagery of past speeches. Gone was the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201dBut aside from a few offerings to the Democrats, mainly he appealed to enthusiastic Republicans. He did propose paid family leave and backed vocational schools and job training, winning grudging applause from Democrats.But his policy proposals were conservative: Keep open the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, burn coal, and above all, take on an immigration system that favors family reunification over skills-based migration.When he took office, President Trump painted a bleak picture of a country ravaged by economic turmoil, a landscape of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as he so memorably put it. A year later, he presented the nation on Tuesday night with a different narrative, one of a booming economy and a \u201cnew American moment.\u201dThe stock market has \u201csmashed one record after another.\u201d Retirement accounts have \u201cgone through the roof.\u201d Companies are \u201croaring back\u201d to the United States. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a long time,\u201d he exulted from the rostrum of the House chamber as he delivered his first formal State of the Union address. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming back.\u201dNever mind that in some fundamental ways the economy is growing no faster than it did at points during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Mr. Trump is at heart a salesman, and he rarely lets details get in the way of a good story. And by some measures, he has managed to convince many Americans, especially corporate leaders, that the economy really is surging in a way it has not for years.Read more of Peter Baker\u2019s analysis here \u00bbRepresentative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, emerged on the national stage to give the Democratic response \u2014 from \u201ca proud American city, built by immigrants.\u201dHere are some excerpts:\u201cIt would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.\u201d\u201cWe choose A Better Deal for all who call this country home. We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive. We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford. We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction. We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a full transcript \u00bbHe wasn\u2019t chosen as the official Democratic responder. But Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, spoke to his faithful with his own response to the State of the Union address.\u201cThe simple truth is that, according to virtually every poll, Donald Trump is the least popular president after one year in office of any president in modern American history. And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201dPresident Trump called for an infrastructure that would leverage federal dollars, state and local government contributions and private sector funds to total $1.5 trillion.But Democrats, who have pressed for infrastructure spending since Barack Obama was president, were not satisfied.\u201cPresident Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years. He expects states, localities, and the private sector to come up with $1.3 trillion on their own,\u201d said the office of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.Tonight\u2019s speech became the most Tweeted #SOTU or #Joint session address ever, passing last year\u2019s record of 3 million Tweets, according to Twitter.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump returned to a phrase he has used many times before: \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201dBut it has never been entirely clear what he means by it.Democrats were generally stone-faced for the president\u2019s address. But when Mr. Trump denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d some of them spoke out \u2014 with boos.For decades, immigrants who become American citizens have been able to sponsor their family members to join them from abroad. The \u201cfamily-based migration system\u201d has been relabeled \u201cchain migration\u201d by opponents, a new nomenclature not appreciated by many Democrats.\u201cI just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\u201d he said.Specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s order revokes an ill-fated January 2009 order signed by former President Barack Obama directing the government to close the prison within a year \u2014 a goal Mr. Obama failed to achieve. He did, however, winnow down the number of detainees, from the 242 he inherited from President Bush, to the 41 remaining there when Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Obama also refused to bring any new detainees to the prison. Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign that he intended to fill it back up \u201cwith some bad dudes,\u201d but to date his administration has not added any newly captured terrorism suspects to the inmate population, instead following the Obama approach of using law enforcement procedures and civilian courts to handle them.In August, Mr. Trump was on the cusp of signing it when he appointed the John Kelly, a retired marines general who formerly oversaw the prison operation as the leader of Southern Command, as his chief.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.In October, Mr. Trump declared that the crisis had become a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Overdoses killed about 64,000 Americans in 2016, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50.Mr. Trump mentioned the opioid crises again in his speech on Tuesday.\u201cWe must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting the number of overdose deaths in 2016. \u201cMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind having Congress enact legislation to update the 16-year-old statute that provides the legal basis for most counterterrorism operations around the world, making it explicitly cover the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS.\u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201dCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., in September 2001. It authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored or aided them \u2014 that is, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But in 2014, the Obama administration stretched it to justify combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without new Congressional sanction.That step was legally contentious because even though Islamic State grew out of an Al Qaeda affiliate, the two organizations had split and gone to war with each other. One of the reasons the Trump administration has not brought any Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo is warnings by legal specialists that doing so would risk giving a judge an opportunity to rule that the A.U.M.F. does not cover the group, jeopardizing the broader war.The Obama administration had fruitlessly asked Congress to enact a specific military force authorization for the Islamic State as well, while also saying it was legally unnecessary. But disputes over what it should say \u2014 including whether it should contain limits on duration, geographical scope, or the use of ground forces \u2014 prevented any consensus.President Trump praised Apple for a promise made earlier this month to invest $350 billion in the United States and create 20,000 domestic jobs over five years.But his speech was devoid of any mention of the role of technology in his vision for the economy. He called for legislation for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments for \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d He mentioned roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways. But he did not mention any of those funds going to the expansion and improvement of broadband internet networks.Trump talked about investing in work force development and job training. But instead of training for science, technology, engineering or math \u2014 or STEM \u2014 training, he talked about opening vocational schools.His words stood in contrast to State of the Union speeches by President Obama, who called for universal broadband for all Americans and the importance of spreading faster networks to close the digital divide.Yeah, there\u2019s the first lady\u2019s clothes or which big wig will fall asleep this year. But the State of the Union proceedings also have this bit of intrigue: Which cabinet official will earn the distinction of designated survivor?The mystery this time was solved two hours before Mr. Trump was due to give his address on Tuesday, when the White House said that the honor would go to Mr. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia and the president\u2019s agriculture secretary.Glamorous in title but, thankfully, not so far in practice, the designated survivor does not attend the president\u2019s address, and is poised to take over the commander-in-chief\u2019s responsibilities in the event that catastrophe strikes the Capitol and wipes out most of the government. If tradition holds, Mr. Perdue will be watching from a distant and secure location while Mr. Trump speaks.\u2014 Katie RogersHours before his first State of the Union address, President Trump told a group of news anchors at a lunch in the White House that his first year in office has taught him that the biggest difference between excelling in business and performing his current job is that governing takes compassion.\u201cI\u2019ve really learned a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump told the reporters, according to a partial transcript of an off-the-record lunch released publicly by the White House. \u201cIn doing what I\u2019m doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money \u2014 such as immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, who is expected to use Tuesday night\u2019s speech to call for a bipartisan compromise that pairs legal status for a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children with funding for a border wall, tougher enforcement and new restrictions on legal immigration, recently said he was hoping to sign a \u201cbill of love.\u201dThat tone is sharply at odds with the president\u2019s approach on immigration thus far, which has included a travel ban against visitors from six countries, slashing refugee resettlement and revoking temporary protected status for people from El Salvador and Haiti. He has been more publicly conflicted about his decision last fall to rescind DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has given legal status to certain people brought illegally to the United States as children.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned maybe more than anything else: You have to \u2014 you govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before.\u201dHere\u2019s a peek at the transcript:\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisDemocratic lawmakers have decided to put a face on the difficult negotiations happening in Congress over the fate of young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. They are bringing scores of such \u201cDreamers\u201d to the Capitol for Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address.Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s guest, Melody Klingenfuss, is just one of them. Born in Guatemala, she was brought to Los Angeles when she was 9, earned a degree in communications and political science from California State University, Los Angeles, a master\u2019s degree from the University of Southern California, then won protection under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2015.\u201cTonight, when President Trump looks into the gallery during his State of the Union, he will see the dignity, courage and patriotism of dozens of Dreamers,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.But there is a flip side. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, has called the cops.So much for the warm welcome.Mr. Gosar\u2019s fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake, didn\u2019t take kindly to his colleague\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri who faces a difficult re-election campaign this year, set the tone with a blast on Twitter.That concern is bipartisan, at least in some quarters of the Republican Party. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was flummoxed by the administration\u2019s decision:\u201cThat bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate. It was not partisan in the least,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cThe one thing we know for sure already is the Russians did attempt to meddle in our elections, and not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year, because we know that the Russians have not given up on their disinformation campaign and their attempt to sow discord in this country and also to undermine faith in democratic institutions.\u201dTestifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department had followed instructions under the sanctions law and drawn up a list of Russian targets for sanctions. An imposition of sanctions could still follow.President Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and one of the authors of the sanctions legislation, declined to criticize the administration\u2019s actions. He did say, \u201cI look forward\u201d to the implementation of the sanctions.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin spent part of the morning before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech tamping down expectations about a secretive Republican memo that some House members have claimed contains evidence that could undercut the Russia investigation.That was not enough to quiet the most ardent proponents of the notion that federal law enforcement agents have conspired to bring down the Trump White House. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, called on the president to release the memo during the State of the Union.\u2014 Nicholas FandosPresident Trump loves to brag about the stock market setting record highs, but on the day of his first State of the Union speech, the market isn\u2019t loving him back \u2014 for reasons that probably have nothing to do with him or his policies.As of midafternoon, Mr. Trump had not tweeted about the market news.\u2014 James TankersleyOne constant refrain from White House officials when it comes to State of the Union speeches is this: the president was personally involved in drafting the speech.It was no different on Tuesday as officials in President Trump\u2019s White House described a \u201crobust,\u201d monthslong process in which Mr. Trump actively reviewed drafts of the speech and repeatedly made suggestions of phrases or anecdotes or words that he wanted to be used when he delivers the address.The speech was assembled over weeks, with agency heads and cabinet secretaries offering suggestions on accomplishments that the president should highlight or priorities he could push for. Speech-writing meetings at the White House with Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top speechwriter, John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and others were coordinated by Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary.Aides said that in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump received printed drafts of the speech \u2014 with ample margins \u2014 and used a black felt marker to make additions, deletions and changes. They said he often edited the drafts in the Oval Office, but sometimes would come down from the residence in the morning with a new draft that he had marked up overnight.\u2014 Michael D. ShearAs the president prepares to speak, his campaign is preparing to cash in.\u2014 Rachel ShoreyChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has called the State of the Union address \u201ca political pep rally.\u201d But he is expected to attend tonight, along with three colleagues: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch, whom President Trump appointed to the court last year.Among the missing will be Justice Clarence Thomas, who has said that he cannot tolerate \u201cthe catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments.\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who has called the addresses \u201cvery political events\u201d and \u201cvery awkward,\u201d is also not expected to attend.Justice Alito famously mouthed \u201cnot true\u201d at the address in 2010 after President Obama\u2019s loose characterization of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case.Three members of the court will be out of town tonight: Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.The justices who do attend usually make coordinated choices about what statements from the president are uncontroversial enough to warrant applause.That is hard, Justice Alito said in 2010, because presidents \u201cwill fake you out.\u201d They may start with something bland, he said, like, \u201c \u2018Isn\u2019t this the greatest country in the world?\u2019 \u201c\u201cSo you get up and you start to clap,\u201d he said, \u201cand the president will say, \u2018Because we are conducting a surge in Iraq\u2019 or \u2018Because we are going to enact health care reform,\u2019 and then you immediately have to stop.\u201d\u2014 Adam LiptakAn eclectic cohort will join the first lady: emergency medical workers, service members and faces of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and immigration overhaul narratives. Here are a few of the people you\u2019ll see:For the full list, read on \u00bb\u2014 Emily BaumgaertnerAfter the women of Hollywood, the women of Congress.So far, a number of House members have complied, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.It is not, as it happens, the first time women have used clothing to send a message: at Mr. Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress last year, many of them wore suffragist white. In both cases, they let their clothes do the talking for them.\u2014 Vanessa FriedmanJonathan Horn, speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, has these thoughts:\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem for Donald Trump going into the State of the Union. He could come out with a very traditional State of the Union and for a normal president, that would help set the agenda for at least, you know, maybe a few weeks. In Washington, you\u2019d plan other policy speeches to follow up on certain aspects of the State of the Union and there would be an entire rollout around the State of the Union.I think with this president, you would expect it would be much shorter. Even if there is a surprise \u2014 Oh, look, Donald Trump sounded presidential \u2014 but then the next day there could be a tweet, and then, you know, work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by a 280 characters.That\u2019s my one prediction. In some sense, whatever he ultimately says is overshadowed by a 280-character tweet.\u201d\u201cThe power of that podium is not just the audience watching. It\u2019s the sense that the president is somebody who speaks for the whole country. And the way he has governed over the past year has been so filled with denunciations and racial division and flat-out falsehoods that he doesn\u2019t have a lot in the tank when it comes to credibility for anybody who isn\u2019t already an avid supporter.Often, these State of the Union addresses can be a time when the panoply of the presidency can give whoever the president is, sort of, a second chance with a lot of people. I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the case here.\u201dCody Keenan, chief speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, also had concerns:\u201cPresident Obama always wanted to close his State of the Union addresses with an argument about the state of our politics. You know, what can we do to make them better? What can we do to be better citizens? I always remember reading criticisms the next day, certainly from the left, saying why is he wasting real estate in the speech on that? It\u2019s never going to happen.\u201cWell, that\u2019s part of leadership. You know, there\u2019s a vision of what we should be, even if the odds of us getting there in one year or eight years is pretty slim.\u201d\u2014 Interviews by Michael D. ShearAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You\u2019re Not", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it\u2019s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys.The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends \u2014 developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks \u2014 who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order.There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize.They also remember who laughed at them and when.James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether.\u201cOne like,\u201d he said, pointing to his phone. \u201cIt got one like.\u201dWhether it\u2019s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There\u2019s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of ros\u00e9 while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn\u2019t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week.\u201cI do I.C.O.s. It\u2019s my thing,\u201d he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. \u201cIt\u2019s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s too early in my career to check out.\u201dHe drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all.A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he\u2019d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: \u201cProbably not,\u201d he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he\u2019s skeptical that it can add to his life.\u201cI literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,\u201d he said.A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest.\u201cNothing feels real, it doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I\u2019ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.\u201dNearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse.Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital.\u201cMy neurons are fried from all the volatility,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \u201cI don\u2019t even care at this point. I\u2019m numb to it. I\u2019ll lose a million dollars in a day and I\u2019m like, O.K.\u201dHis room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, \u2018The Lizard of Wall Street,\u2019 with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, \u201cmemento mori,\u201d to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse.\u201cThe worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \"It\u2019s almost like the ultimate short trade.\u201dMr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn\u2019t give specifics other than to say he\u2019d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There\u2019s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they\u2019ll be targeted and robbed since there\u2019s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course.\u201cIt\u2019s unforgiving,\u201d Mr. Buttram said. \u201cYou make one mistake and it\u2019s all gone.\u201dThis is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, \u201chold\u201d typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD \u2014 fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don\u2019t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically.\u201cHODL when everyone has FUD,\u201d Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. \u201cThis will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.\u201dHe knows this is strange.\u201cWhen I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different level of consciousness.\u201dThe tone turns somber.\u201cSometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,\u201d Mr. Buttram said.Mr. Hummer said, \u201cA bomb would set back civilization for years.\u201dA few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder\u2019s apartment.James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for \u201cgoing full YOLO\u201d and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him.\u201cI\u2019m taking over her education,\u201d Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms.Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers.\u201cIt\u2019s the entire world reorganizing itself,\u201d Mr. Fickel said. \u201cWe could get rid of our armies because for the first time you\u2019ll have people saying, \u2018I want to vote for a global order.\u2019 It\u2019s the internet waking up \u2014 it\u2019s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That\u2019s the blockchain.\u201dMr. Hummer is skeptical.\u201cAll I know is the price of ether is going to go up,\u201d Mr. Hummer said.At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel\u2019s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum.\u201cI\u2019m retired, man,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cI\u2019m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019m retired,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m going into business now. I\u2019m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.\u201dNearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group.\u201cObviously the bubble\u2019s going to burst and everyone\u2019s going to need a lawyer,\u201d she said.Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He\u2019s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology.\u201cThe technology still needs time to evolve,\u201d Mr. Wuille said. \"This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can\u2019t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.\u201dHe said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. \u201cI tell them I have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so many people rushing into the space, if it\u2019s a bit of speculation, I\u2019m O.K. with that,\u201d said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. \u201cBut we can\u2019t guarantee the website\u2019s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.\u201dAs the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy \u2014 Arya Bahmanyar, 28 \u2014 was getting ready to perform.Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (\u201cyou think I would dress up like this if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d). \u201cRight now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture \u2014 not inside crypto, and we\u2019ve got to change that,\u201d he said.He pointed to his outfit \u2014 a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes \u2014 and said, \u201cIt\u2019s gold, right? It\u2019s gold. It\u2019s a niche, and I\u2019m going to fill it.\u201dHe says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called \u201cLambo Party\u201d and another called \u201cCryptomom,\u201d about \u201call these moms are pumping in their children\u2019s savings accounts.\u201dMaria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, \u201cCinemark, the best seats in town.\u201d She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn\u2019t support her.\u201cCharges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,\u201d she said. \"And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.\u201dShe found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.\u201dShe had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Asked About CES 2018. We Answered.", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementWhy does Apple, the most valuable company in the world, boycott CES?Apple doesn\u2019t exhibit at trade shows in general. In 2008, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was pulling out of Macworld Expo, the Apple-centric trade show, where he had previously announced a number of important Apple products, including the original iPhone in 2007. Apple\u2019s reasoning was that the company had retail stores all over the world that could showcase Apple products. In addition, the company had the clout and budget to host keynotes, or marketing events to unveil products, independent of a giant trade show, where companies are competing for attention from the press. Many companies, like Amazon, Samsung Electronics and Google, have followed suit and introduced products at their own events.Here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: Over my last decade attending CES, Apple cast a long shadow over the conference despite not having an official presence. Many companies were making things that worked with the iPhone or iPad, like cases, speakers or apps. But this year, Apple doesn\u2019t seem very relevant here. The show now revolves around Amazon and Google and their battle for domination with voice assistants. There are a good number of companies here showing smart home products that work with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant and choosing to skip out on Apple\u2019s HomeKit because of the stricter privacy requirements and extra fees associated with making products that are certified to work with HomeKit. So the show seems to have moved on from one giant to two others.I've been attending CES for 5 years and feel really underwhelmed by the products showcased at the event this year. I feel like we need to figure out how to \"make gadgets great again.\" Analysts, entrepreneurs, and journalists I've talked to in Vegas this week shared similar impressions. Has CES gotten too big? Does it need to be more selective? What's going on?PG, that is definitely the sentiment among journalists and exhibitors I\u2019ve chatted with this week. I think this year is an incremental phase in consumer technology. A couple of years ago, virtual reality was the hot new tech at CES, with brand-new products like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets that worked very well. And Alexa was just starting to become popular, along with smart home accessories. This year, we\u2019re seeing those technologies mature with improved features that make them more capable. That isn\u2019t very exciting, but at the end of the day consumers will be getting better products in the coming year.What does it say about the state of tech companies and organizations that there are no female keynote speakers at CES, yet there are female robot strippers being showcased at the event? (CES added two female keynote panelists after backlash, but the point remains).In some ways, that mirrors the tech industry. The overwhelming majority of tech executives in Silicon Valley are white men. Tech companies have acknowledged their diversity issues, but over the years there has been little progress.How has the Spectre/Meltdown vulnerabilities been addressed at CES, if they have been?His statement was disappointing because downplaying the problem could make consumers complacent. Meltdown can be fixed with software updates for your operating system, browser and other important apps. But Spectre is an issue that can\u2019t be completely fixed with a software patch; tech companies can only mitigate the vulnerability with software updates. The bottom line is you have to be diligent about keeping your software up-to-date. And you should also run an ad blocker to prevent malicious code from infecting you through ad networks when you\u2019re browsing the web.What \"left-field\" finds did you stumble upon?I saw some pretty goofy gadgets, like a piece of rolling luggage with an electric scooter built into it. Can you imagine riding your luggage through the crowd at the airport? I also saw a robot sherpa \u2014 it was basically a big trunk for carrying heavy objects \u2014 that follows you around as you walk. It had sensors to avoid colliding with you.Brian, hi. I'm hoping that CES will bring announcements for in-wall light switch dimmers that don't require me to buy a separate hub. I don't need Alexa in my light switch, though I do want it to talk with her. Ideally, the same company would also have in-wall on/off switches and outlet controllers, so I don't need to have different apps to manage different switches. Thanks!Adam, I understand \u2014 a separate bridge or hub, which establishes a connection between your Wi-Fi router and a smart home device, is ugly and a waste of space. The good news for you is I did see some bridge-free light switch dimmers at CES. One example is Belkin\u2019s Wemo dimmer switch, which only requires a Wi-Fi connection to work with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. I think you will continue to see companies shift away from hubs toward Wi-Fi connections built into their appliances. The downside of this, in my experience, is that Wi-Fi-equipped smart home devices occasionally lose their connection with your Wi-Fi router, and you sometimes have to power cycle them (turn the power off and back on) to regain a connection. With a light dimmer, that might require flipping your circuit breaker, but hopefully not.What do you see as some of the big trends in the \u201csmart kitchen\u201d space? And who do you think is leading the charge as an appliance manufacturer?The smart kitchen, which is a segment of the smart home where devices are internet-connected, is very interesting to me because each big manufacturer is approaching it in a different way. Samsung is selling a very expensive smart fridge that is equipped with a 21.5-inch touchscreen and voice controls; the company is focused on making the kitchen the center of the home, where families convene and spend quality time together. (I don\u2019t know about your family, but that\u2019s never been my experience.) Whirlpool\u2019s smart kitchen vision is to try to make it easier for you to figure out what to cook with the ingredients you have. The company is offering an app that lets you use your smartphone camera to scan the ingredients in your pantry or fridge so that the software can give you some ideas of what to cook. It\u2019s tough to say who is leading the charge because these are fairly new ideas, so we will have to see what resonates with consumers.Just curious to know about any new technology in locks. I run an Airbnb and I\u2019m interested in battery technologies as most locks suck battery juice, especially the Wi-Fi models.Nick, I\u2019m not a fan of smart locks. Every type has flaws.There are complete lock systems that include the dead bolt, door handle, keypad and electric locking system that talks to a smartphone. These are the most robust solutions, but they don\u2019t fit on all doors. One lock I tried from Schlage didn\u2019t work on two different doors; I probably would\u2019ve had to cut new holes into the doors, which is a pain.Another approach to take instead is to try the robotic arm that attaches to your dead bolt and turns it. These are marketed as the simplest to install. The August lock is an example. But the reality is that when you install these devices, you need to make sure you have a modern high-quality deadbolt that can withstand being locked and unlocked repeatedly by a robot arm. In addition, you will need to change the batteries frequently, probably every other month.How are technology developers working to increase security with internet-connected devices?The tech giants that offer virtual assistants for controlling smart home devices \u2014 Apple, Google and Amazon \u2014 continually issue software updates with security updates. It\u2019s those smaller brands making the smart home accessories that you need to be wary of. While many smart home products work great, their security teams probably are not as thorough or experienced as the people that work for large tech companies. How will new large smart appliances like refrigerators and washing machines begin to pop up in the average American home or apartment? I find there is still a large amount of 10-plus years old appliances (that function fine of course) that still occupy many living spaces. But with a revolution in technology that senses how much water to use when cleaning your clothes or when you should buy a new container of milk, how long would you predict it would take for the technology of today to become the standard?It will likely be a very long time. Many of these smart appliances have premium price tags. A smart refrigerator with Alexa controls, for example, costs upward of $4,000. It\u2019s unclear why you would pay that much for a refrigerator when you can just put a cheap Echo Dot ($50) on your counter. It\u2019s also important to note that smart appliances have been around for many years. There are high-end ranges priced upward of $5,000 that include buttons you can press to tell the oven what you are cooking so it can set the temperature and time accordingly. At the end of the day, these features are a novelty: If you\u2019re going to spend that much on a range, you\u2019re probably a pretty good cook and know what temperature and timing to use to cook a roast or casserole. Smart home appliances need to be cheaper and have more useful applications before they reach the mainstream. Until then, they are an impractical luxury.I just purchased a 4K, OLED HDR TV. Anything at CES suggest it will be obsolete anytime soon?Nope, you\u2019re in good shape. At CES, LG demonstrated a so-called 8K TV, which has quadruple the resolution of 4K TV. But rest assured that your 4K OLED HDR TV, which is the best type of television you can buy right now, won\u2019t be obsolete for years. That\u2019s because content makers are taking their sweet time to transition from 1080P resolution to 4K, meaning there isn\u2019t much 4K video to watch right now, but there will be more coming over time. In addition, streaming devices like the Apple TV just recently added support for 4K. In other words, we\u2019re only at the beginning of the adoption curve with these TVs, so sit back and enjoy your fancy television set.Given the push now to sell OLED TVs, what could they possibly do to improve picture quality, especially since content quality is not keeping up?\u201cOLEDs can still improve quite a bit. For professional users, Sony makes a reference OLED that is an RGB OLED while consumer models are white OLEDs right now with color filters. The RGB version is over 50 percent brighter, and has more saturated, true colors for bright areas (fires, skies, leaves, and so on). Sony also just demoed a 10,000 nit LCD (a higher peak brightness than current OLED TVs) which is a long way off, but the extra brightness made everything look more like real life. 4K Blu-ray content, and streaming content, already has picture information that an OLED cannot correctly display. While they do look great, and are what I use as a reference, they still have a lot of room to improve, even with our current content.\u201dSamsung has announced a 146-inch 8k TV called The Wall. Is there a market for this type of \u201cconsumer\u201d product, how successful do you think this will be? And will other companies do the same?I wouldn\u2019t expect this to be a consumer product. When picking screen size, you should consider the distance between where you are sitting and where the television is placed. In order to properly consume a 146-inch television, you would have to live in an enormous house with a huge amount of space in the living room. Many products shown at CES are merely demonstrations of what tech companies are capable of doing today; very few actually materialize into products you will buy on Amazon or at Best Buy.Are mobile phones trending towards more user friendly or less user friendly this year?Less friendly. If you look at the sheer number of features that Apple and Google keep adding to iOS and Android year after year, mobile operating systems are becoming increasingly complex. (As an iOS user, I find the Mail app\u2019s user interface to be confusing, and I find it perplexing that Apple hid the useful Airdrop feature in a menu that is difficult to find.) In addition, now that Apple has nixed the physical home button on the iPhone X, the way we use phones is poised to change significantly in the coming year. In both Android and iOS, we are increasingly relying on touch gestures that are not as intuitive to discover as pressing a physical button.Should I replace my recent vintage Apple Time Capsule router with an Eero or similar mesh network device?The other benefit of modern mesh networking systems is that they automatically apply software updates with the latest security enhancements. Many older routers require the consumer to manually download the updates, and I don\u2019t know anyone who would even remember to do that. Advertisement"}

Find Out Now", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "Advertisement\u201cWe\u2019re interested in getting a sense of what\u2019s the same, and what\u2019s not, across many, many cultures\u2019 vocal music,\u201d said Samuel Mehr, a cognitive scientist and one of the project\u2019s directors (he also plays various woodwind instruments in the pit orchestra for musicals like \u201cChicago\u201d).\u201cIf you go back to people like Darwin and Herbert Spencer,\u201d Dr. Mehr continued, \u201cthey all wrote about music and every one of them said, \u2018This is weird, why do we do this? How come it\u2019s a love song that calms the dispirited youth? Why is it that the crying baby falls asleep when I sing to it?\u2019 These are old, old questions, but it\u2019s now the case that we have the computational tools to start really answering them.\u201d\u201cWhat this means is that in the cultures we studied, songs that are used for dancing, to calm babies down and in ceremonies of the shamanistic, spiritual type, share enough features that it\u2019s likely not only are they universal types of music, but the way they\u2019re performed has universals,\u201d Dr. Mehr said.The alternative explanation is that everyone who did the test shares a culture, and that influenced their decisions \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re all internet users, they\u2019ve all probably heard Taylor Swift and Bieber,\u201d Dr. Mehr admitted. But he is planning to repeat the experiment with isolated groups, to see if they can identify lullabies, dances and healing songs correctly, too. These will include Tsimane people from the Bolivian Amazon, horticulturalist-foragers who have had little contact with Western culture. They are unlikely to have heard Justin Bieber.Dr. Mehr\u2019s team is planning further studies, including analyzing transcriptions of melodies to see if there are similarities and examining some 5,000 descriptions of performances in traditional societies to look for patterns.The work has been welcomed by cognitive scientists. But one group of academics has not given it such a warm response: ethnomusicologists, the very people who collected many of the recordings and descriptions the Harvard project is using.The current study \u201cis based on all kinds of presumptions\u201d that ethnomusicologists would disagree with, said Matt Sakakeeny, associate professor of music at Tulane University in New Orleans. He said these included the ideas that you could remove songs from their social, political and cultural contexts, or draw conclusions from analyzing just a handful of lullabies.Professor Sakakeeny sang the pop song \u201cHey, Baby\u201d to his daughter as a lullaby, he added \u2014 how would the scientists deal with that? \u201cMy suspicion is they\u2019d dismiss it as statistically irrelevant because it\u2019s not a lullaby, and to me that\u2019s fundamentally the problem.\u201d More collaboration between scientists and ethnomusicologists was needed, he added.\u201cPeople all over the world interpret the music of their own culture in their own way,\u201d Dr. Mehr said in response to the criticisms. \u201cThat\u2019s a fascinating topic for research, but we\u2019re asking a different question: whether people interpret the music of other cultures in similar ways.\u201dThe search for universals has a long and often uncomfortable history, particularly in the early 1900s when some German scholars linked it with ideas about racial superiority. \u201cThere were a lot of people saying, essentially, \u2018Let\u2019s see why Beethoven is the best music,\u2019 \u201d said Patrick Savage, an ethnomusicologist at Keio University in Japan who briefly assisted the Harvard project.In the 1960s, Alan Lomax, the renowned collector of folk music, invented a system called Cantometrics to classify several thousand songs in the hope of spotting patterns. He believed that \u201cas people live so do they sing,\u201d meaning that a society\u2019s music changed as it developed economically. But ethnomusicologists quickly discredited his work, which was not helped by some awkward claims (he thought, for instance, that societies where infants experienced trauma produced music with a wider range). In the 1970s one ethnomusicologist wrote, \u201cThe only universal aspect of music seems to be that most people make it.\u201d The phrase has stuck.\u201cThe idea that there\u2019s anything universal in music has been looked down upon for so long, I do think more basic demonstrations like this study are important,\u201d Dr. Savage said.There\u2019s room for lots more work, he added. \u201cI think the most interesting area, but maybe the most controversial \u2014 potentially even dangerous \u2014 is aesthetics. Are there universal standards for what is beautiful music?\u201dDespite these other efforts to find universals in music, the controversy around the Natural History of Song is unlikely to die down. But this doesn\u2019t concern Dr. Mehr. The project\u2019s title may be bold (\u201cTo us, it was just catchy,\u201d he said) and the team may not have been clear they would be happy to discover no universals exist, but he is not worrying about criticisms unless he can learn from them. \u201cWe\u2019re doing science,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to make everybody in the world happy, it\u2019s to learn facts about the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Brace for Europe\u2019s New Data Privacy Rules", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs.Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information.And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center \u2014 a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served.With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley\u2019s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.\u201cEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,\u201d said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. \u201cG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.\u201dEuropean officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.\u201cThere has not been any pushback from American companies,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cIf anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.\u201dOfficials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google\u2019s director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. \u201cWhen G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation\u2019s mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services \u2014 from Gmail to its Cloud storage services \u2014 to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone\u2019s data.\u201cFor a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,\u201d Mr. Golan said.Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.The new privacy center would give Facebook a \u201cvery good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules.\u201cWe embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,\u201d Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. \u201cWe began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company.\u201dHow the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online.\u201cWhere the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see real changes across the board.\u201dMs. Jourov\u00e1 said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens.\u201cThere will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Maybe So, but No Better Than a Human", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan you predict a crime?More than a half-century ago, the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick imagined a world in which a \u201cprecrime\u201d agency made that possible.

Meanwhile, Compas, which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions, relies on six variables for assessing risk, according to Equivant, which sells the software.The authors are far from the first to raise questions about Compas\u2019s role in judicial decision making.In addition to their main finding, the authors also found evidence of racial bias from both Compas and the humans, even though neither considered race in the predictions. Compared with their white peers, a larger share of black defendants was falsely predicted to reoffend, while a smaller share was falsely predicted not to.Ms. Dressel and Mr. Farid based their analysis on a database of more than 7,000 pretrial defendants in Broward County, Fla., from 2013 to 2014. For each, the database included demographic information, criminal history, Compas risk scores and arrest records for the two years following the scoring.A subset of 1,000 defendants was then used to collect predictions from 400 people, recruited through Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, a marketplace for online labor. Those participants were presented with paragraphs about each of 50 defendants and asked to rate the likelihood that each would commit a crime in the following two years.The descriptions the individuals were presented with included the defendants\u2019 sex, age, crime they were charged with, the type of crime and their arrest history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Strange Origin of a Manakin\u2019s Golden Crown", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThree related species of manakins occupy adjacent parcels of the Amazon rain forest: Opal-crowned, snow-capped and golden-crowned. They are all plump like sparrows, small enough to cup in a hand and have radiant yellow-green upper bodies with golden undersides.Opal-crowned manakins wear an iridescent toupee, evocative of a unicorn\u2019s mane. Snow-capped manakins are topped with bright glacial patches. And members of the hybrid species, the golden-crowned manakin, display a burst of yellow to match their bellies. Choosy females prefer the particular color sported by males of their own species, leading to reproductive isolation.Hybrids often look like an intermediate between their parent species, which made scientists skeptical that you\u2019d get a golden-crowned manakin by crossing opal-crowned and snow-capped manakins.To settle the mystery, Dr. Barrera-Guzm\u00e1n and his colleagues sequenced much of the golden-crowned manakin\u2019s genome and confirmed that it has a blend of DNA from the other two species.The scientists then examined feathers from the heads of golden-crowned males under an electron microscope. They found that the manakin\u2019s warm crown comes from pigments called carotenoids, which the birds get from their diet. When chemically stripped of these pigments, the feathers turned grayish-white.Dr. Barrera-Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s team suspects that the first male mixes between snow-capped and opal-crowned manakins bore this dull tuft, an intermediate between the white and iridescent caps of their forebears.During the last ice age, the Amazon rain forest shrunk and possibly cut some hybrids off from their parent species \u2014 the golden-crowned manakin\u2019s habitat today is separated from snow-capped and opal-crowned territories by rivers and mountains.\u201cHybridization is a double-edged sword,\u201d Dr. Weir said. \u201cIt can erode diversity, but it can also be a creative force.\u201d In the case of the golden-crowned manakin, it even created a new head of gold.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Indianapolis Cool Enough for Amazon? It Just Might Be", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAmong Amazon\u2019s 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three.And then there\u2019s Indianapolis.In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon\u2019s initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn\u2019t find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist.The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls \u201ctech talent.\u201d Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities.And then there\u2019s what might be called the \u201ccool\u201d factor \u2014 which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking.Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com\u2019s Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201dBut if Mr. Stutz\u2019s experience is any indication, the oddsmakers may have to recalculate Indianapolis\u2019s chances. Since moving to the city 16 months ago, Mr. Stutz said, he has been \u201camazed.\u201d\u201cIndianapolis has done what may be the best urban redevelopment I\u2019ve seen in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here is aligned with making Indianapolis a successful place for technology companies. The people are tremendous, very friendly, polite, with a strong work ethic.\u201dWith over 1,700 Salesforce employees there, Indianapolis is now home to the company\u2019s second-largest office outside its San Francisco headquarters. In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that \u201cwe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Mr. Stutz said.Salesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. \u201cThis is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,\u201d he said.One area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon\u2019s top priorities, according to its proposal: \u201cA stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure.\u201dIndianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state.Both officials \u201cwere very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,\u201d said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis\u2019s Amazon proposal. \u201cThat made it so much easier for us.\u201dNeither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon.In opening the competition, Amazon also said that \u201ca strong university system is required.\u201d Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it\u2019s the geographic center of \u201ca surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,\u201d said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater).These include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation\u2019s No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years.Many university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, \u201cattracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,\u201d Dr. McCoy said. \u201cOver 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay.\u201dWith a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo.It\u2019s probably best known as a sports mecca, with the N.B.A. Pacers, W.N.B.A. Fever and N.F.L. Colts. It\u2019s the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it\u2019s home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race.Mr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. \u201cAustin was never a cool place,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn\u2019t quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities.\u201dThe airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris.Indianapolis\u2019s central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there.While Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon\u2019s Seattle employees value).For all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge.Unlike Amazon\u2019s home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana\u2019s governor before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s vice president.A strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation.Mr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said.Indianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn\u2019t count it out.Maureen Krauss, the chamber\u2019s chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis\u2019s proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight.\u201cWe finished it two days early,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that\u2019s the kind of proposal we tried to deliver.\u201dShe and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. \u201cWe hunkered down and started on Phase 2,\u201d Mr. Huber said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Wall of Love Outside a Jail", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaria stood outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, on a recent evening, looking up. The jail loomed above, a concrete bulwark more than a dozen stories high and lined in narrow windows. Behind one of them was her husband.Maria, who wished to be identified only by her first name because of her husband\u2019s notoriety, had been standing there for hours. She had flown in from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, for the weekend, only to learn she would not be allowed inside.The sun was going down and it was time to go; she had a flight to catch. But first, she went to her rental car and pulled out what looked like a rolled-up poster and some packing tape. \u201cA little message for my husband,\u201d said Maria, 33, in Spanish, walking over to a warehouse across the street from the jail.A section of the wall had been covered in signs. \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day Chris B.\u201d \u201cHappy Thanksgiving Luchie.\u201d \u201cI Love You Payroll.\u201d \u201cStay Strong Hubberz. We Got This.\u201d There were signs in Spanish, posters in Hebrew. Some were handwritten and covered in tape to protect them from the elements. Others were printed on durable plastic. They hung amid scraps of tape, deflated balloons and the tattered remnants of even older signs.Maria\u2019s sign said, in pink marker, \u201cTe amo, Gordo.\u201d \u201cI love you, Big Guy.\u201dBut inmates\u2019 families are also bound to the jail, where they pay weekly visits and gather to celebrate birthdays and holidays \u2014 and, lately, to post signs.The signs are clustered at one end of the low-slung warehouse that faces the detention center, on 29th Street. There is no formal system behind the effort, no Facebook group. Like Maria, who said she had noticed the signs during a previous visit, relatives see them and come back with their own. It\u2019s a gesture of last resort.A spokeswoman for Herman Quay, the jail\u2019s warden, said in an email that the jail was concerned about the posters only if they affected \u201cthe security or orderly running\u201d of the detention center, and that the jail \u201cencourages inmates to maintain family ties.\u201d Some jail personnel, who said they were not authorized to give their names, said that inmates were occasionally reprimanded for banging on their windows after spotting a family member posting a sign below.From his cell, Varick Winters, 26, who is in for drug-related offenses and violation of parole, could look out and see families arriving for visiting hours, posting signs and waving, he said through his mother, Leann Winters, who relayed questions by phone. Asked whether the message wall boosted morale, he said, \u201cIt makes you want to cooperate.\u201dIn most cases, inmates are allowed visitors on one day of the week. These visits can be whittled down to less than an hour, relatives say, because of the time-consuming process of entering the building, or they can be forbidden altogether depending on the inmate\u2019s risk factor or whether the jail is on lockdown.Relatives say the signs are a way to communicate when they can\u2019t visit, to show affection on a special day, and to defy a system that strictly limits personal touches: Mail is inspected, gifts must be ordered through a third-party vendor like Amazon, and in the visiting area, the only items that can be handed over are small bills and food from the vending machines.Another reason relatives post signs is that inmates not only can see them from above, but also can respond.\u201cHe\u2019s told me where he is,\u201d said Maria, pointing to the light. \u201cThat\u2019s why I know it\u2019s mine.\u201dThe Metropolitan Detention Center lies on a waterfront strip of Sunset Park known as Industry City. The area, once thoroughly industrial, has recently begun to transform as outlets, showrooms and start-ups open in redeveloped buildings. But around the jail, the view remains treeless and desolate.No one can say exactly when people began posting signs on the warehouse, but an image captured by Google Earth shows it was completely blank in 2013. A spokesman for Con Edison, which owns the warehouse, said that the signs were periodically removed and that the current batch would soon be taken down. In the meantime, the rain and the wind do much of the work.But new ones always appear.On a recent evening, Jeffrey, 17, and his brother Jason, 8, took the subway from the South Bronx to Sunset Park and walked to the jail. Jeffrey held Jason\u2019s hand as they crossed under the Gowanus Expressway toward the water\u2019s edge.The routine was familiar. The boys went into the jail to get the form they filled out before every visit, then joined visitors sitting in a glass-encased room outside to wait for their number to be called.They were there to see their father, who was detained on narcotics charges by the F.B.I. in the early hours of Jeffrey\u2019s birthday last February. Their mother was also arrested. She was released on a bond but could face deportation to Mexico. Because their mother was not allowed to visit their father, Jeffrey said he brought his three younger siblings to see him on his visiting day every week. They took turns.Last summer, Jeffrey made a sign for his father. \u201cHe asked the officer: \u2018May I have a chance to peek outside? Because my son put up a poster.\u2019 I put it right there with a picture of my mother and the four of us,\u201d he said, pointing to the warehouse.The poster said, as Jeffrey recalled, \u201cWe hope our father will be reunited again with our mother, his wife and his four children.\u201d It wasn\u2019t up for long; Jeffrey said he was told by a jail employee that the poster could be considered graffiti, so, after about two weeks, he took it down.By Christmas Day, Maria\u2019s sign had been smeared by the rain and snow and new ones had appeared. There was a poster wishing Misha a Merry Christmas and another that said Feliz Navidad. A Santa Claus decoration and some tinsel had been hung.As visiting hours began, a car pulled up, then another and another. Abraham Lebowitz had come from Monroe, N.Y. He had posted the signs in Hebrew earlier in the year, he said, \u201cfor a few people inside\u201d from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Satmar sect. They announced a religious celebration and the opening of a new building. \u201cJust to make a connection,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should see what is happening in the outside world.\u201dNot everyone\u2019s visiting day fell on Christmas, but some families had come anyway. In one car was the family that had posted the sign that said \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day, Chris B.\u201d months before. They had driven from East New York, Brooklyn. \u201cWe try to come as often as we can,\u201d said Khaiya Tucker, bundling her 2-year-old daughter Aubrey and holding her up so her grandfather could see her from his cell. She pointed to a blinking light on the third floor. \u201cLook, Bree-Bree, it\u2019s your G-Pops,\u201d she said.An icy wind swept in off the water, and down the street another family huddled beside their idling sport utility vehicle, holding up a bedsheet that said, in permanent marker, \u201cMerry Xmas We Love You Bebo.\u201d They had come from Queens to send a message to Victor, 30, who they said was arrested on drug-related charges about five months ago.\u201cI\u2019m here because I miss him,\u201d said his mother, who gave only her first name, Sonia, holding the sheet as it twisted and flapped in the wind. \u201cI want him to know I love him.\u201dUpstairs, a cell lit up.\u201cHis light went on. I saw it!\u201d she said.The family waved and blew kisses as the lights flicked on and off. Victor\u2019s father, Victor Sr., began to weep.Visitors rushed past, hunkered down. The puddles on the street had turned to ice. But Victor\u2019s family stayed outside, stomping against the cold, laughing, looking up. As long as that light was there, it was hard to leave.Finally, they got in the car, and Sonia\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Victor, calling from a shared jail phone. \u201cI just happened to look outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see anybody there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The group said its strategy will focus first on technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable access to medical services.Beyond that, here are some ideas from health care and medical experts about how the world\u2019s largest online retailer, the largest bank in the United States by assets and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett\u2019s holding company might reshape an industry._______\u201cAmazon could assume drug distribution. They could start to use voice platforms, like Alexa, to help discuss symptoms and get feedback, to coordinate hospital post-op care through voice-activated A.I., to do these and other rote things.\u201d\u2014 Dr. Eric Topol, director, Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego_______\u201cMaybe they will develop some kind of algorithm that can be loaded onto any company software to help employers identify the low-hanging fruit, the patients that are using the most care or the highest-cost drugs. These guys have the data resources to really mine what\u2019s going on, to get in the middle of that patient-doctor relationship. But employees are going to have to sign off on letting their employers really dig into that data.\u201d\u2014 Erin Fox, senior director of drug information, University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics_______\u201cThe companies have a wealthier work force, which tends to have a higher demand for broad networks. And these people are financially very sophisticated in how they do things, so they may be willing to have more complicated benefit design, and more willing to use I.T. tools to shop for care. I hope they work on building value-based insurance design plans, aligning incentives with the value of care.\u201d\u2014 Michael E. Chernew, director, HealthCare Markets and Regulation Lab at Harvard Medical School_______\u201cMost health care is local, even though people occasionally seek care away from home. So the opportunity is in leveraging telecommunications technology, in taking advantage of internet-based services that can be delivered to you everywhere, which is a movement already growing rapidly throughout health care.\u201d_______\u201cWith the technology that\u2019s available today, it seems like a logical next step for self-insured companies to administer the health benefit themselves. You could develop a relationship where you\u2019re significantly reducing costs, while still making the providers whole and cutting out so much of the red tape and bureaucracy that currently stymies and frustrates them. The providers\u2019 masters are largely those intermediaries \u2014 the health plans, the pharmacy benefit managers. This is a way for companies like Amazon to be the new masters.\u201d_______\u201cYou can imagine them using a different sort of model, where everyone gets a concierge to help them with their health care, to have a primary care doctor be an independent advocate that helps patients navigate the system, not as an agent of the hospital where they have to feed the beast. And then if you need lab tests, an M.R.I., an elective service in the hospital, you would have a health savings account and a marketplace with transparent pricing. And then, if something really bad happens \u2014 you get leukemia, you get hit by a bus \u2014 the high-deductible insurance kicks in. That\u2019s the way the market is moving anyway, so I bet this is where these companies are likely going.\u201d\u2014 Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, chief executive, Iora Health, BostonAdvertisement"}

But one investment legend is making a big bet on a more old-fashioned mode of analysis: philosophy.The gift, formally announced on Tuesday, appears to be the largest by far to a philosophy department anywhere in the world, the university said. It will allow the department, which will be renamed for Mr. Miller, to nearly double in size, to 22 full-time faculty members, while also supporting graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and new courses aimed at attracting undergraduates.\u201cI wanted the gift to go to something where it would have a significant impact, and change the trajectory,\u201d Mr. Miller, whose firm, Miller Value Partners, is based in Baltimore, said in a telephone interview.Philosophy, he added, \u201chas made a huge difference both to my life outside business, in terms of adding a great degree of richness and knowledge, and to the actual decisions I\u2019ve made in investing.\u201dBut Ronald Daniels, the president of Johns Hopkins, said Mr. Miller\u2019s gift would give a much-needed boost to the beleaguered humanities, at a moment when many universities, and the governments that support them, are heavily focused on the so-called STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.\u201cThis gift is so wonderfully contrarian,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cTo have someone of Bill\u2019s stature who is willing to lend an imprimatur to philosophy, this most ancient of disciplines, and to the idea of its continuing relevance as an end in itself, is simply spectacular.\u201dMr. Miller, whose father worked as a terminal manager for a trucking company, said he had essentially talked his way into the Ph.D. program at Hopkins, despite having taken only one six-week course in philosophy at the very end of his senior year.\u201cThey wanted to see three examples of your philosophical work,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any, so I took 30 days off the Army and wrote three papers.\u201dMr. Miller, who worked part-time in accounting during graduate school, completed the coursework and qualifying exams. But when it came time to start a dissertation, he looked at the difficult prospects of getting a teaching job, and left for (much) greener pastures.On Wall Street, Mr. Miller, an old-fashioned stock picker who focused on identifying undervalued companies, is famous for his 15-year streak beating the S.&.P 500, from 1991 to 2006, while at Legg Mason, where he spent most of his career. He was an early believer in Amazon, investing heavily at a time when most analysts were highly skeptical.\u201cThere was a huge amount of confirmation bias going on with Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an inability to do what Wittgenstein talked about in his \u2018Philosophical Investigations\u2019: crisscrossing the landscape from many angles, investigating in many different ways.\u201dThe scene, based on a real exchange, \u201cmade the person seem quite a bit more pompous than I think of myself as being,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\u201cIt is particularly insightful when trying to understand new social facts and structures such as crypto assets,\u201d Mr. Miller said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that Michael Bloomberg has given to Johns Hopkins over his lifetime.

{"Headline": "Walmart and Now Starbucks: Why More Big Companies Are Offering Paid Family Leave", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting to see the value in family-friendly benefits for hourly workers, too, although big disparities remain.Now, some employers are beginning to address the same challenge for lower-wage workers, starting with paid family leave. On Wednesday, Starbucks announced raises and stock grants for all employees in the United States, along with new benefits aimed specifically at workers with family caregiving responsibilities: paid time off to care for sick family members and paid paternity leave for hourly employees. It\u2019s a sign that the effects of low unemployment have reached companies that rely on low-wage workers. Both companies also credited tax cuts. Benefits like paid parental leave are a crucial factor for people, especially women, in continuing to work. Yet hourly workers, who generally have the most need for paid parental leave, have also been the least likely to get it. Only recently have more companies begun to change that. The United States is the only industrialized country not to mandate paid parental leave. Employers choose whether and how much to offer, and this varies greatly. Of the 20 largest employers, all but one, Lowe\u2019s, offer some form of paid parental leave. Eight of them give hourly employees less than salaried employees \u2014 in time, pay or both \u2014 including Starbucks and General Electric, according to a New York Times analysis. That\u2019s why the recent parental leave announcements have been so significant. Other companies \u2014 including McDonald\u2019s, IBM and AT&T \u2014 have also recently expanded their parental leave benefits. Starbucks had not given paid time off to fathers and other hourly workers who became parents but did not give birth, unless they adopted. Now it will give them six weeks, for both part-time and full-time workers. Walmart had not given hourly workers who were nonbirth parents any paid leave and had given hourly birth mothers partial pay for six weeks for uncomplicated births. Now it will give the same parental leave to salaried employees and full-time hourly employees: 16 weeks for birth mothers and six weeks for other parents, fully paid. Meanwhile, Gayatri Agnew, a Walmart corporate employee who also has a baby daughter, had 10 weeks off and was paid her full salary while she was out. \u201cOne of the things that kept me up at night when I was on leave was knowing that our field associates couldn\u2019t do the same,\u201d said Ms. Agnew, who pushed for the policy as a senior director of Walmart\u2019s foundation. Of the 20 biggest employers who provide paid leave for birth mothers, 13 offer salaried employees additional bonding time beyond the six weeks for physical recovery, which is often covered by short-term disability. Eight provide bonding time for birth mothers who are paid hourly, and they are more likely to receive partial pay. Twelve of the companies provide paid leave to salaried new parents who did not give birth, like fathers and adoptive, foster or same-sex parents. Eight provide it to nonbirth parents who are paid hourly. A mother\u2019s physical recovery from childbirth generally takes at least six weeks, doctors say, and there is an emotional adjustment period as well. Newborns demand frequent feedings, on an irregular schedule, and it is hard for mothers to breast-feed or rest if they return to work immediately. Most day-care providers do not offer newborn care, or it is very expensive. In the Pew survey, 16 percent of people employed in the last two years said they needed to take leave but were unable to. They were more likely to be low earners, and also more likely to be women, black, Hispanic or without a college degree. Many of the large employers that give hourly employees paid leave do so through short-term disability. It is available only to birth mothers, and generally pays about 60 percent of wages for six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a C-section. When Ferrara Candy Company, which makes Lemonheads and Red Hots, began offering paid parental leave last year, it supplemented birth mothers\u2019 disability pay to cover 100 percent of their wages, and gave all other new parents two weeks off at full pay. New parents can also work a reduced schedule for two weeks after returning to work. In the first year, 30 of its 2,300 employees used paid parental leave, and two-thirds were hourly workers in the candy factories. \u201cWe never thought about the distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing it for both was the right thing to do.\u201d Some companies offer unpaid leave in addition to the paid leave listed here, or employees can use vacation or sick days. Some pay all or part of the birth mother\u2019s pay from short-term disability, which is typically six weeks, but it can be longer if the mother has a complicated delivery, and it can be paid for by employer or employee contributions. Parental leave is often available only to employees who have worked at the company a certain length of time and who work a certain number of hours a week. In some cases, hourly employees are represented by different unions whose agreements may vary. These are the American companies that are the 20 biggest global employers, as measured by the Fortune 500. Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase: The longer leave is for primary parents, regardless of gender.Amazon: Leave for birth mothers includes four weeks prepartum.McDonald\u2019s: For salaried employees, adoptive primary parents receive additional leave. Hourly employees\u2019 leave depends on franchisee policies.Walgreens, Home Depot and TJX: Birth mothers who are hourly employees receive less pay than salaried birth mothers during leave.FedEx: For workers at FedEx Express, the largest operating company. Other divisions\u2019 policies differ.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the date of a rally in New York City for paid parental leave. It was in 2016, not last March.Advertisement"}

Asked at her daily briefing whether Breitbart News should fire Mr. Bannon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary said, \u201cI certainly think that it\u2019s something they should look at and consider.\u201dPresident Trump's legal team on Thursday demanded that the publisher of Michael Wolff's new book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" which is critical of the administration, halt its release and apologize or face legal action.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat generated a debate among advocates and legal scholars. \u201cThe president\u2019s attempt to halt publication of a book because of its content is flagrantly unconstitutional,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, the executive director of PEN America, a group that defends free expression around the world.The bar for any legal action by a president, the most public of public figures, is particularly high. \u201cAt the center of any libel case has got to be an actual statement of fact that\u2019s alleged to be inaccurate and damaging,\u201d said Bruce W. Sanford, a veteran media law specialist at BakerHostetler. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say we don\u2019t like this book and all the things in it and sue for libel. That\u2019s not what libel cases are about.\u201dThe book, which quickly shot up to No. 1 on Amazon\u2019s best-seller list after articles about it on Wednesday, presents Mr. Trump as an unengaged candidate and president who grew bored when an aide tried to explain the Constitution to him and refuses to read even one-page briefing papers.Advisers are reported to have called the president an \u201cidiot,\u201d a \u201cdope\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d as dirt, and Melania Trump is described as being so unhappy about the prospect of life in the White House that she was in tears on election night. Mrs. Trump has disputed the characterization, and spokesmen for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Gary D. Cohn, the national economics adviser; and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, all denied the disparaging quotes attributed to them.In his letter to Mr. Wolff and his publisher, Mr. Harder said the book itself admits \u201cthat it contains untrue statements.\u201d In an author\u2019s note, Mr. Wolff writes that many of the accounts that he collected \u201care in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue.\u201d He said he sometimes \u201clet the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge them,\u201d and in other instances \u201csettled on a version of events I believe to be true.\u201dMr. Harder argued that that proves actual malice and reckless disregard for the truth, standards that courts use to judge whether a public person has been libeled. Mr. Harder cited no specific statements that he judged untrue.But some people cited in the book have disputed episodes describing them. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain denied suggesting to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, that British intelligence might have spied on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis story, as we have pointed out, is a complete fabrication,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4. \u201cI mean literally, from beginning to end. I\u2019ve never had such conversations, in the White House, outside the White House, with Jared Kushner, with anybody else.\u201dAsked on Thursday for examples of potentially libelous inaccuracies in the book, Ms. Sanders cited only an anecdote in which Mr. Trump seemed not to recognize the name of former Speaker John A. Boehner, even though he had previously posted on Twitter about the lawmaker.\u201cThere are numerous mistakes,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to waste my time or the country\u2019s time going page by page, talking about a book that\u2019s complete fantasy and just full of tabloid gossip.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Toronto, Mr. Tory said, had only \u201cmade the playoffs.\u201dBut regardless of the outcome, the announcement that the city remains a contender showed how much progress Toronto, and the surrounding region, have made in establishing themselves as a major technology center.Amazon offered few details on Thursday about how it had come up with its 20 finalists. Unlike several other finalists, the region offered no tax or other incentives. But Mr. Tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues.In sharp contrast to President Trump\u2019s efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds.\u201cWe\u2019re able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world,\u201d Mr. Tory said.\u201cWe have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full,\u201d Mr. Tory said.But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever-escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker. He noted that several other finalists, including New York, had similar or higher costs.Soon after the announcement, Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, appointed Ed Clark, the former president and chief executive of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, to coordinate the province\u2019s reply.Mr. Tory said the cities would probably have to wait for Amazon\u2019s next move before taking any action of their own.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re expecting from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the 20 finalists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bargain Hunters Turn to Emerging Market Stocks", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBargain hunters have begun to pay close attention to emerging market stocks.They are a little late to the game. After all, momentum-driven investors have already noticed that shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like China and India came roaring back to life over the last year. Led by hot tech names such as Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group, many of them doubled in value in 2017.But now value-minded mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are rummaging in the parts of the emerging markets that many have ignored \u2014 staid sectors like manufacturing, mining and finance. Even these parts of the emerging markets posted sizable returns over the last year as global economic growth started to reaccelerate.But while the fast-growing segments of the emerging markets returned around 40 percent in 2017, the so-called value stocks rose about half as much.The more muted returns, coupled with the five-year bear market in emerging market equities before this surge, mean emerging market value stocks are still trading at relatively attractive prices. Some bargain hunters say emerging market value stocks are the only truly undervalued part of the global equity market.While the price-to-earnings ratio for the fastest-growing segments of the developing markets stands around 16, emerging market value stocks are trading at a P/E of just below 10.\u201cIf you can buy a well-diversified equity portfolio with a P/E of 10, you\u2019re getting an awful lot of earnings for each dollar of price you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Research Affiliates.There are risks, though, to the strategy of emphasizing value stocks in emerging markets. \u201cWhen most people think about the demographic trends driving the emerging markets and the high growth rates of India and parts of China, these things are all favorable to growth\u201d stocks, Mr. Jayaraman said \u2014 but not necessarily to value-oriented shares.But, he says, \u201cThe rubber band can only stretch so far\u201d when it comes to the rising prices of growth stocks.Ernest C. Yeung, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund, notes that in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate that much of the emerging markets have been mired in recently \u2014 where investors worry that growth will be hard to come by \u2014 \u201cpeople are willing to pay up for future growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why in this environment, high-quality growth stocks \u2014 names like Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 have done so well,\u201d he said. But that should start to shift, he said. \u201cWhen the macroeconomy recovers, value stocks normally begin to work.\u201dIn particular, value stocks in the financial industry stand to benefit.\u201cFinancials are a driven by the health of the macroeconomy and the direction of interest rates,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. And they\u2019re cheap.As a result, the stock now trades at just 0.7 times the bank\u2019s book value, which represents the net asset value of the company, compared with a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.5 to 2 before the global financial crisis. \u201cSo we are nowhere back to historical norms,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.The steel industry is another place that should thrive as the economy improves.\u201cThe common perception is that China keeps dumping cheap steel into the global markets,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. That may have been true several years ago, but the Chinese government recently carried out supply-side reforms that have reduced China\u2019s steel supply more than 20 percent, he said.As a result, Chinese exports have fallen more than 40 percent, creating breathing room \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for other emerging market steel producers.Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, notes that investors need not limit themselves to staid industries to gain exposure to attractively priced emerging market stocks.\u201cThink information tech based in Taiwan instead of China,\u201d she said.Why? A number of Taiwanese tech companies are regarded as old tech because they are involved in the manufacturing and supply chain that propels new economy tech products and services.Partly because Hon Hai is not regarded as a new economy name, the stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, compared with around 60 for Tencent Holdings, one of China\u2019s largest internet and social media companies.But Mr. Jayaram says that \u201cif we see better sales for iPhones in the first quarter, that could be a big catalyst\u201d to move Hon Hai\u2019s stock, too. And that creates a buying opportunity for bargain hunters right now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Backing Up Photos", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d says the award-winning National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, about backing up her photos. \u201cI\u2019ve had hard drives fail throughout my career. For example, back when I first started as a photographer, I had a very nice hard drive system in my home, and the whole thing failed.\u201d In retrospect, Ms. Vitale says, she would have definitely set the system up differently.\u201cI lost some historic moments from the first part of my career,\u201d she says, \u201cand they\u2019re gone forever.\u201dMs. Vitale may shoot photos differently from how most of us capture images these days \u2014 she shoots with a digital single-lens-reflex camera (or DSLR). But her cautionary tale should resonate, since many of the same vulnerabilities exist when photographing with smartphones. In other words, if you\u2019re snapping away without a backup plan for your photos, beware: In an instant, you could lose them all, forever.Before I explain how to back up your photos, it\u2019s useful to understand one important aspect of digital photos that relates to storing them properly. Namely, image resolution.Every digital photo has a certain image resolution, which is the total number of pixels that make up a photo. If an image you shot on your smartphone, say, is 4,000 pixels high by 3,000 pixels wide, it contains a total of 12 million pixels (the height multiplied by the width). Since one million pixels is known as a megapixel, the resolution of your smartphone image is 12 megapixels.But right now, most websites, including social media and even photo-printing sites, aren\u2019t designed to truly store photos. That\u2019s because when you back up your photos, you want to be able to retrieve an image file that is as close to, if not identical to, the original photo you captured on your phone or digital camera. That\u2019s also why you want to carefully choose a backup solution, whether it\u2019s online or an external hard drive.The important takeaway here is that you should consider using a combination of services and solutions to safely back up photos. Ideally, store them both online and on two external hard drives (one stored locally and another at a different location). However, at the very least, consider using one online backup, which lets you copy and transfer the photos on your phone, as well as other devices, to an alternate location.By contrast, you get free, unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, allowing you to automatically back up all images from your phone, computer and other devices. Google also recently updated its app for desktop computers, which now can automatically upload photos directly into Google Photos when transferring images from your camera to your computer, which is very convenient.However, Google Photos has limitations as well. If you shoot photos with a resolution larger than 16 megapixels, they\u2019ll be downsized, which some photographers find unacceptable. At this time, smartphones mostly capture 12- or 16-megapixel photos, which won\u2019t be affected, but some models already exceed that limit, as do many digital cameras.Both Amazon Prime Photos and Dropbox have their pros and cons, too. If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account.Dropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB).As the name implies, external hard drives, which range in price from $50 (one to two TB) to $350 and up (eight TB), are like the storage that\u2019s built into your computers, except they\u2019re connected externally. Most hook up via a USB connection, although there are other methods. (For instance, network attached storage, or NAS, drives, connect via an Ethernet line to your home or office network.) As with your internal drive, there are many ways to transfer, copy, or sync your photos. You can also automate your backup using your computer\u2019s operating system, the external hard-drive\u2019s software, or a third-party backup software app or service.Our personal library of images generally doesn\u2019t end with just our digital photos. Many of us also own precious prints, photo albums, slides and negatives, some of which can be decades old.Whatever backup system you eventually select, whether it\u2019s just an online solution or a combination of several services and hard drives, it\u2019s important to monitor the system. Be sure to periodically check it and make sure it\u2019s backing up your photos correctly.Consider these tips from Jill Duffy, Ami Vitale and myself, when backing up your images:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Sells A.I. for Building A.I. (Novices Welcome)", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has been using artificial intelligence to build other artificially intelligent systems for the last several months.Now the company plans to sell this kind of \u201cautomated machine learning\u201d technology to other businesses across the globe. On Wednesday, Google introduced a cloud-computing service that it bills as a way to build a so-called computer vision system that suits your particular needs \u2014 even if you have little or no experience with the concepts that drive it.If you are a radiologist, for example, you can use CT scans to automatically train a computer algorithm that identifies signs of lung cancer. If you run a real estate website, you can build an algorithm that distinguishes between living rooms and kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.At least that is the pitch. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a Ph.D. in machine learning,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing group. \u201cBut you can still build a highly accurate machine learning model.\u201dGoogle uses the technique while building systems that can recognize faces, products, landmarks and other objects in photos. In some cases, these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers.The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms.At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston\u2019s DataRobot and Silicon Valley\u2019s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future.\u201cThey aim to automate data science in general,\u201d said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore.The question is whether these new services will work as advertised and how rapidly they will evolve in the years to come.Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others already offer cloud-computing services that let businesses add existing machine learning algorithms to their own products. A company can take a Microsoft computer vision algorithm, for example, and slip it into a new smartphone app.But with its new service, Google goes a step further, providing an automated way for businesses to build new algorithms. Businesses can upload their own images, provide a list of objects pictured in these images and train their own computer vision systems, tackling tasks that aren\u2019t necessarily handled by existing technology, according to Google.Initially, Google will open this service only to a small group of businesses. A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price.Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google\u2019s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I.\u201cIt is really powerful technology,\u201d said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies.But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. \u201cThese services are only as good as their parts,\u201d said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. \u201cAnd humans still supply some of the parts.\u201dGoogle says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement. In a matter of minutes, it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer\u2019s images. Given more time, it can build a model from scratch, specifically for the problem at hand.If you are a zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist inside the Google cloud group, all you have to do is supply the right images. \u201cYou upload jaguars and giraffes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you are done.\u201dAll that remains is determining how well it works.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World\u2019s Computers", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201cWhat actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,\u201d said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability \u201chas existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.\u201d It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of A.W.S. and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers \u2014 and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers\u2019 data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability \u2014 at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel\u2019s business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.\u201cIntel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIntel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.\u201dThe researchers who discovered the flaws notified various affected companies. And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.For now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel\u2019s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is \u201cgoing to live with us for decades,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.\u201cWhereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve really screwed up,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThere\u2019s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.\u201dThe Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.The researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.The second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.\u201cThis will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It\u2019s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.\u201dFollow Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @nicoleperlothAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Disney Deal Looming, Murdoch\u2019s Empire Is Fractured", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In late summer, Verizon Communications came to Rupert Murdoch with a surprise acquisition offer.Verizon \u2014 locked in battle with AT&T, which was then finalizing its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner \u2014 wanted to buy pieces of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s television and film conglomerate. Representatives of the two companies secretly met at least once to discuss a merger.Mr. Murdoch, 86, shrugged off the talks as uninspiring, according to an associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to maintain his access to the media titan. Verizon declined to comment, but the overture prompted Mr. Murdoch to start to think seriously \u2014 for the first time \u2014 about selling his Hollywood treasures.Not only would a sale solve a business problem, it could solve a family one.Fox News, the company\u2019s financial engine and a hugely influential platform for Republican politics, has been the source of family friction. James, who holds some progressive views, has privately expressed embarrassment about some elements of Fox News, including its sometimes skeptical coverage of climate change, according to the three people who are friendly with him, a stance not shared by his more conservative brother and father.It was becoming increasingly clear to many analysts, investors and Hollywood agents that the three-pronged leadership structure Mr. Murdoch had put in place was not going to work over the long term.The Murdochs declined to be interviewed for this article.Disney\u2019s offer also provided Rupert Murdoch with the opportunity to establish the like-minded Lachlan as his clear heir, putting him in a position to eventually take over Fox News, which Disney was not buying, and the family\u2019s other company, the newspaper-focused News Corporation.At first, Lachlan was unenthusiastic about discarding such a large chunk of the family\u2019s holdings, according to the four people with knowledge of the sales process. Disney would take the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, cable networks like National Geographic and FX, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India.Lachlan understood the threat posed by the technology giants, but he saw less need to rush into Disney\u2019s arms. Most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses were doing quite well.He had also just gotten his family settled in Los Angeles as part of the 2015 management arrangement. The primary property Disney was leaving behind \u2014 Fox News \u2014 was based in New York.Although Lachlan has not yet made a decision, Rupert has made it clear that he wants his elder son to run what they are calling New Fox, which will house Fox News and the other businesses left behind by Disney, including the Fox broadcast network and a chain of TV stations.What James will do is more of a mystery.People close to him say he may try to strike out on his own. Unlike his brother, James has never worked outside the family businesses, other than the hip-hop record label he founded after dropping out of Harvard. His father bought it, bringing James into the corporate fold.A senior job at Disney is also a possibility, but there were \u201cno guarantees of any sort,\u201d Rupert said in the Sky News interview.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said on a call with investors after the deal was announced. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dBeyond the family dynamics, the deal may allow James to finally vanquish memories of his role in the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. He was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff, but a parliamentary committee accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.Moreover, James is likely to emerge with a stake in Disney worth at least $1 billion.\u201cThat\u2019s a good return for putting up with your father for 20 years,\u201d Ms. Enders said.It has been suggested that Rupert could look at buying stations in political swing states, where there is a lot of money to be made in political advertising during election years, to say nothing of potential influence.Some have also mused that Mr. Murdoch may try to combine New Fox with News Corporation, the owner of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. In his interview with Sky News, he brushed aside the immediate possibility. \u201cThere\u2019s logic to it, but we\u2019re not planning it at this stage,\u201d he said.In any case, Mario Gabelli, a longtime media investor whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in 21st Century Fox shares, predicted that Rupert would relish having a voice at Disney, even if the deal did not come with a board seat.\u201cHe now becomes Disney\u2019s largest single shareholder,\u201d Mr. Gabelli said, \u201cwith an ax to grind.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}

It has been a long time.So when was the last time the market fell 5 percent from a recent high? The aftermath of Brexit in June 2016.The statement is part of a legal settlement that Mr. Ford reached over the weekend with Morgan Stanley, according to a person who was briefed on the resolution but was not authorized to speak publicly. The broader contours of the settlement were unclear, including whether there was a financial component. Through a spokesman, Mr. Ford declined to comment.Before his firing last month, Mr. Ford had spent seven years at Morgan Stanley recruiting clients. He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006.Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014. At the time, Morgan Stanley said he had been fired \u201cfor conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.\u201d Some media reports of his firing said it had been triggered by the harassment allegation.Since Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point emerged as an investor in the Swiss food giant, Nestl\u00e9 has sold off its U.S. confectionary business, named new directors and bought Blue Bottle coffee.All of those have been great moves, according to the hedge fund. But there\u2019s more to be done, Third Point wrote in its latest letter to investors.From the investor letter:These actions are important steps in the right direction that make it clear that Nestle\u0301 is responding to calls for action. While we recognize that Nestle\u0301 has certain unique cultural and structural constraints, we hope now that Dr. Schneider has completed his first year and there is new blood on the Board, the company is able to move with greater alacrity.What Third Point wants\u2022 Better demonstrate that the company is focused on \u201cnutrition, health and wellness,\u201d with the implication being to divest products like ice cream and frozen pizza.\u2022 Buy back more shares.\u2022 Again consider selling the L\u2019Oreal stake, something Nestl\u00e9 has been loath to do historically.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMore from the article by Michael Kranish of the WaPo:\u201cAll I know is that we are not at all concerned, and we are cooperating,\u201d Kushner said in a half-hour interview at his headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue. \u201cAnd they can knock themselves out for the next 10 years reading those papers as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201dThe elder Mr. Kushner also lamented the amount of criticism that his son, a senior presidential adviser, has taken:\u201cI try not to focus in my life on the haters but it\u2019s just, I have never seen anything like this,\u201d Kushner said. \u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe transaction is expected to bolster the A.I.G.\u2019s general insurance business, by adding a reinsurance platform, an insurance-linked securities asset manager and \u201ca meaningful presence\u201d at the Lloyd\u2019s of London marketplace.Here\u2019s what Brian Duperreault, A.I.G.\u2019s chief executive, said:\u201cValidus is an excellent strategic fit for AIG, bringing new businesses and capabilities to our General Insurance operation, expanding the bench of our management team and deepening our underwriting expertise.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayRemember that earlier this month, Celgene agreed to pay up to $7 billion for Impact Biomedicines, which also makes a treatment for a kind of blood cancer.Celgene, which is based in Summit, N.J., already owns about 9.7 percent of Juno\u2019s shares.Here\u2019s what Mark Alles, Celgene\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayFrom a recent note by analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics:We would be astonished if Congress could not cobble together a majority of the sane in order to prevent a default. But astonishment has been quite common in response to events over the past couple of years, so investors would be well-advised to rule out nothing, however outlandish.Where things standElsewhere in WashingtonThe tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture.Improving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum.Yet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.So what gives? The tax law.Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201dExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.Two points of note:Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it\u2019s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.Mr. Chakrabarti added that while the company was slow to address Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s working to prevent it happening again.More news from FacebookThe tech flyaroundMore from the FT\u2019s Martin Arnold and Miles Johnson:Tiger Global appears to back Mr. Staley\u2019s view that the bank\u2019s 40 percent discount to book value is unjustified after it recently completed its multiyear restructuring and sold off most of its African operation to address longstanding concerns about its capital levels.UBS\u2019s turnaround hits a bumpMore from Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Matt Goldstein of the NYT:Officials from human resources interviewed as many as a dozen people who have worked with Mr. Malik. He left roughly two weeks before annual bonuses were to be handed out.The misconduct flyaroundHere\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, told Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:\u201cI would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus\u2019s worth of electricity consumption to global warming.\u201dSome, however, say an independent, decentralized monetary system is worth the cost.The virtual currency flyaround\u201cI truly believe I was put on this Earth to make money, but also to be generous with it.\u201dto tosaleAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ad Executive Often in the Vanguard Peers Into the Future", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe responses underscored Mr. Norman\u2019s reputation, built over more than three decades, as a clarifying voice in a cacophonous media landscape.Mr. Norman, 57, has had a front-row view of that shifting world through his roles at GroupM, which spends billions of dollars a year on behalf of a long roster of WPP advertisers, from Campbell Soup to Unilever. (GroupM, where Mr. Norman remains a consultant, claims it\u2019s responsible for one out of every three ads worldwide.)While television and newspapers were the dominant forces in his native England when Mr. Norman started his career, he began working with online advertising in the mid-1990s, taking on challenges like increasing listings on search engines like Excite and AltaVista.Later, he guided brands and colleagues through the heydays of MSN and Yahoo and the rise of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and streaming TV. Along the way, Mr. Norman became known for sharing his insights at industry events and in trade publications, always with a healthy dose of dry British wit.Mr. Norman recently spoke with The New York Times about where the media and advertising worlds are now and where he thinks they are going. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.There is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.The people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.At the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters. Then it was held by this display triumvirate of Yahoo, MSN and AOL and, separately, search by Google. And it took quite a long time to get here.If you asked anyone in 2009, \u2018Guess what the combined market shares of Google and Facebook will be in 2017,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure there would have been anyone that would have come close.How long do you think will they maintain that position? It kind of depends on what Google and Facebook allocate their resources to, and like everybody else, it depends on how they manage to navigate actual and potential regulatory environments going forward. I think if they were both worried about a thing today, it would be what regulators think about them, because they\u2019re not at the peak of their popularity with those folks at the moment, it would seem to me.I think that\u2019s why people are so interested in the Amazon story and were so interested in the Snap story and were so interested in Twitter\u2019s story \u2014 because everyone\u2019s looking for the next one to break through.What\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to look and feel completely different that disrupts how people interface with the world around them? My guess is that five to seven years from now, there will be at least one company that people will think of in the top five most important enterprises in advertising that simply doesn\u2019t exist now.Imagine a massively emboldened Hulu.If Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.You could have things like day-after episodes of new drama of the Hulu model and then the entire movie libraries of Universal, Fox, Disney, Pixar and all of the other stuff with it.Then what happens if that same group of people says to the broadcasters of the world: \u201cWhat we have here is a working business model of what the studio system plus the broadcast system can look like in a new world, with a tiered-option model based on some combination of live, day-after, on-demand, paid, ad-funded and so forth, and basically you could slice it whichever way you\u2019d like for your market. We\u2019ve got the content block and the technology license block so that everyone can build their own castle in all these markets.\u201dIt may not be owned 100 percent by one company, but it could be a new phenomenon that could be a kind of distributed monopoly, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really thought about.And this could potentially run ads?Because you\u2019re using the same underlying systems, you suddenly have a data pool that crosses all of that content, all of those users and potentially all of those markets. People are asking the question about what\u2019s the third force? That would probably be the answer.What\u2019s another way that could go?I think if I learned one thing over my career, it is that Newton was right: The objects that are in motion stay in motion, and that motion tends to accelerate, hit plateaus and reaccelerate.Given the asymmetry of certain enterprises in the world, you kind of wonder as to whether or not new Disney, with all of its IP, has in fact become the juiciest peach in the world to be consumed by Apple.If Apple was going to make a \u201cone bound and you\u2019re serious\u201d move into the video content business globally, and the provision of video service business globally, it could make sense. You then have most of Hulu and all of the IP in Pixar, Marvel and all of the other things that Bob Iger has been assembling over the years, and you have ESPN. That wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place to start, and they could do it for 30 percent of their market cap.You can on one hand take it at face value and say that Facebook is taking a step back to their roots. The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.The one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?What have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that? It seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news. I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big appetite for Facebook saying, \u201cWe would like 20 news organizations to provide news bulletin programming for Facebook Watch.\u201dWe know there are dozens and dozens of news organizations around the world, or at least a dozen or two that include The Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, the BBC and so on, who are, for the most part, the keepers of truth in news and the people who keep the public informed.And it seems odd to me that if you have aspirations to take up a very significant part of the media consumption time of the public that you do not have an overt policy for the dissemination of news and to participate in the funding of news for your audience.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Sales Lifted by Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has spent years adjusting its business to reflect a shift from traditional software sales to cloud computing services delivered over the internet.It is a bet that continues to pay off for the company \u2014 as was evident in its quarterly earnings released Wednesday.The portion of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business that involves selling to companies \u2014 called commercial cloud \u2014 grew 56 percent, to $5.3 billion, in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31. Like many legacy software companies that cater to the huge corporate computing market, Microsoft was caught off guard by the emergence of cloud computing in the form of online storage and computing services offered by the internet retailer Amazon.Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue last quarter rose to $28.92 billion, up 12 percent from the same period a year earlier, as everything from its Office applications business and Xbox gaming console \u2014 both buoyed by cloud computing services \u2014 showed growth.The company reported a net loss, including the tax charge, of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, down from net income of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Without the tax charge though, Microsoft said it earned 96 cents a share.Microsoft\u2019s shares dropped about 1 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results, though both revenue and the adjusted earnings figure were significantly better than Wall Street forecasts.One of the company\u2019s oldest businesses, Office, saw its commercial revenue grow 10 percent in the quarter. Even the number of consumers who subscribe to a cloud version of the application suite, called Office 365, rose to 29.2 million from 24.9 million during the same period a year earlier.The company\u2019s gaming revenue jumped 8 percent, primarily as a result of hardware sales resulting from the introduction of a new console, Xbox One X.Microsoft and other big tech companies like Intel and Apple have been struggling over the past several months to mitigate a critical security flaw \u2014 known as \u201cSpectre\u201d \u2014 which exists at the chip level and has no simple patch.Microsoft has attempted to mitigate the flaw without dinging performance, but security experts like Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered the flaw last year, say Microsoft\u2019s solutions still do not sufficiently address all the ways it could be used by an attacker.In a phone interview, Microsoft chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said Microsoft has not yet seen a financial impact from the recent critical security flaws.Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify Is Said to Be Going Public in Early 2018", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify is finally ready to go public.The streaming music giant filed a confidential registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late December, with the intention of listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of this year, according to two people briefed on the company\u2019s plans who were not authorized to discuss them.As expected, Spotify will pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued \u2014 and therefore no money is raised \u2014 but existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. Such a listing would bypass much of the bureaucracy of a standard initial public offering, saving the company time and potentially millions in underwriting fees.The move, if it goes forward as planned, would be the most prominent music-related listing since Pandora Media\u2019s initial public offering in 2011, and would recognize Spotify, which began its service 10 years ago, as a transformative force in the music industry. After some 15 years of decline, revenues of recorded music sales began to recover in 2015, largely thanks to streaming.A Spotify spokesman declined to comment.In the United States, streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music account for more than two-thirds of the business, according to Nielsen, and are still growing rapidly. According to BuzzAngle, another music data tracker, American listeners streamed 377 billion songs last year, up 50 percent from 2016.Spotify would be coming to the public stock markets at an auspicious time. Last year, 138 companies \u2014 including well-known ones like Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat \u2014 went public, up 45 percent from 2016, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Together they raised $30.6 billion, roughly double the amount raised in 2016.But last year\u2019s burst of activity remained well below the decade-high mark set in 2014, as the ease of raising money in private markets has dissuaded big start-ups from pursuing I.P.O.s. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have pushed off market debuts while amassing valuations that rival their publicly traded brethren.What Spotify is doing is different, however, and has few precedents. Most companies that have pursued direct listings have been much smaller, with the exception of Freddie Mac in 1989. Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary.A prospectus from Spotify, expected to be made public before the listing, would shine additional light on the company\u2019s finances and on the economics underlying streaming music.Spotify is hoping to avoid that fate with newly renegotiated licensing deals with the major record companies that lessened Spotify\u2019s royalty rates by a few percentage points, and by maintaining its growth around the world. The service is available in 61 territories, from Greece to Guatemala.But while streaming has lifted revenues at the major record companies, which have minority stakes in the company, musicians and songwriters remain skeptical of Spotify\u2019s model, and of their ability to earn livable wages from Spotify.Spotify had no comment on the lawsuit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Mr. Amazon, Steps Out", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "Mr. Bezos is the world\u2019s richest person and can afford virtually any luxury. But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age. He is 54, not 53.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "La f\u00e1brica de seguidores", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "\n  \n    Ilustraci\u00f3n fotogr\u00e1fica por Adam Ferriss\n  \nTodas esas cuentas pertenecen a clientes de una oscura empresa estadounidense llamada Devumi que ha recaudado millones de d\u00f3lares en el mercado global del fraude en las redes sociales. Devumi vende seguidores de Twitter y retuits a celebridades, negocios y cualquier persona que quiera ser m\u00e1s popular o ejercer influencia en internet. Usando un conjunto de al menos 3,5 millones de cuentas automatizadas \u2014cada una de ellas ha sido vendida muchas veces\u2014 la compa\u00f1\u00eda le ha proporcionado a sus clientes m\u00e1s de 200 millones de seguidores en Twitter, seg\u00fan revel\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n de The New York Times.Las cuentas que m\u00e1s se parecen a las personas reales, como la de Rychly, muestran el patr\u00f3n de una especie de robo de identidad social a gran escala. Al menos 55.000 cuentas de Devumi usan los nombres, fotos de perfil, lugares de origen y otros detalles personales de usuarios reales de Twitter, incluidos menores de edad, seg\u00fan un an\u00e1lisis de datos realizado por el Times.\u201cNo quiero que mi foto est\u00e9 relacionada a esa cuenta, ni mi nombre\u201d, dijo Rychly, quien ahora tiene 19 a\u00f1os. \u201cNo puedo creer que alguien pague por eso. Es simplemente horrible\u201d.En noviembre, Facebook revel\u00f3 a sus inversores que ten\u00eda al menos el doble de usuarios falsos que los estimados anteriormente, lo que indica que existen unas 60 millones de cuentas automatizadas en la plataforma de medios sociales m\u00e1s grande del mundo. Estas cuentas falsas, conocidas como bots, pueden ayudar a influenciar a las audiencias publicitarias y replantear los debates pol\u00edticos. Pueden afectar negocios y arruinar reputaciones. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista legal, su creaci\u00f3n y venta est\u00e1n en una zona gris.\u201cLa continua viabilidad de cuentas fraudulentas e interacciones en las plataformas de redes sociales, y la profesionalizaci\u00f3n de estos servicios fraudulentos, es muestra de que todav\u00eda hay mucho trabajo por hacer\u201d, dijo el senador dem\u00f3crata de Virginia Mark Warner, quien tambi\u00e9n es miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Inteligencia del Senado de Estados Unidos, que ha estado investigando la propagaci\u00f3n de cuentas falsas en Facebook, Twitter y otras plataformas.El fundador de Devumi, German Calas, neg\u00f3 que su compa\u00f1\u00eda vendiera seguidores falsos y dijo que no sab\u00eda nada sobre las identidades sociales robadas a los usuarios reales. \u201cLas acusaciones son falsas y no tenemos conocimiento de ninguna de esas actividades\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Calas en un intercambio de correos electr\u00f3nicos en noviembre.En momentos en que Facebook, Twitter y Google se enfrentan a una epidemia de manipulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y noticias falsas, los seguidores falsos de Devumi fungen como la infanter\u00eda de las batallas pol\u00edticas en l\u00ednea. Los clientes de esa empresa incluyen tanto a partidarios ac\u00e9rrimos de Donald Trump como a comentaristas liberales y conservadores de la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense.A diferencia de algunas empresas de redes sociales, Twitter no exige que sus cuentas est\u00e9n vinculadas a una persona real. Tambi\u00e9n permite un mayor acceso automatizado a su plataforma que otras compa\u00f1\u00edas, lo que facilita la creaci\u00f3n y el control de grandes cantidades de cuentas.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cLas redes sociales son un mundo virtual en el que la mitad son bots y el resto es gente real\u201d, dijo Rami Essaid, fundador de Distil Networks, una empresa de ciberseguridad que se especializa en erradicar redes de bots. \u201cNo puedes aceptar sin m\u00e1s lo que dice un tuit. Y no todo es lo que parece\u201d.Resulta que eso incluye a Devumi.El a\u00f1o pasado, tres mil millones de personas iniciaron sesi\u00f3n en redes como Facebook, WhatsApp o la china Sina Weibo. El anhelo colectivo del mundo por establecer una conexi\u00f3n no solo ha cambiado la composici\u00f3n de la lista de las 500 empresas con mayor valuaci\u00f3n de Fortune y reformulado el mundo de la publicidad, sino que ha creado un nuevo indicador de estatus: la cantidad de personas que te siguen, te dan me gusta o te agregan como \u201camigo\u201d. Para algunos artistas o empresarios, ese estatus virtual es un factor de influencia en el mundo real. Los conteos de seguidores en redes sociales pueden determinar qui\u00e9nes los contratan, cu\u00e1nto les pagan por patrocinios o compromisos e, incluso, c\u00f3mo los clientes potenciales eval\u00faan sus productos o negocios.Una cantidad alta de seguidores tambi\u00e9n es clave para los influenciadores que aspiran a marcar tendencia o para las estrellas de YouTube a quienes las empresas les dan miles de millones de d\u00f3lares al a\u00f1o para patrocinar sus productos. Mientras m\u00e1s alcance tengan esas personalidades, m\u00e1s dinero ganan. De acuerdo con datos de Captiv8, una empresa que vincula a los influenciadores con las marcas, alguien con 100.000 seguidores puede ganar hasta 2000 d\u00f3lares por un solo tuit promocionado, mientras que alguien con un mill\u00f3n de seguidores podr\u00eda cobrar hasta 20.000 d\u00f3lares.La fama genuina a veces conlleva una influencia real en redes sociales, con los fan\u00e1ticos que siguen a sus estrellas de cine favoritas, a cocineros c\u00e9lebres y modelos. Pero tambi\u00e9n hay atajos disponibles: en sitios como Social Envy y DIYLikes.com tan solo se requiere dar un n\u00famero de tarjeta para comprar un ej\u00e9rcito de seguidores en cualquier plataforma social en l\u00ednea.\u201cVes a un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s alto o una mayor cantidad de retuits y supones que esa persona es importante o que a ese tuit le fue bien\u201d, dijo Rand Fishkin, fundador de Moz, compa\u00f1\u00eda que desarrolla software de optimizaci\u00f3n y posicionamiento en motores de b\u00fasquedas. \u201cComo resultado, es m\u00e1s probable que t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n lo amplifiques, lo compartas o que sigas a esa persona\u201d.Twitter y Facebook pueden ser influenciadas de manera similar. \u201cLas plataformas sociales quieren recomendarte cosas y dicen: \u2018\u00bfLo que estamos recomendando es popular?\u2019\u201d, dijo Julian Tempelsman, cofundador de Smyte, firma de ciberseguridad que ayuda a empresas a combatir el fraude y abuso en l\u00ednea y a los bots. \u201cLa cantidad de seguidores es uno de los factores que toman en cuenta\u201d.Para entender mejor el negocio de Devumi, contratamos sus servicios. En abril, el Times cre\u00f3 una cuenta de prueba en Twitter y le pag\u00f3 a Devumi 225 d\u00f3lares por 25.000 seguidores; alrededor de un centavo de d\u00f3lar por cada uno. Como se promete, los primeros 10.000 parec\u00edan ser personas reales. Ten\u00edan fotograf\u00edas y nombres completos, la ciudad en la que se encontraban y biograf\u00edas que parec\u00edan ser aut\u00e9nticas. Una cuenta se asemejaba a la de Rychly, la joven de Minnesota.Pero vistas m\u00e1s de cerca hab\u00eda detalles extra\u00f1os. Los nombres de las cuentas ten\u00edan letras de m\u00e1s o usaban guion bajo o sustitu\u00edan letras tan similares que el cambio era casi imperceptible, como una ele min\u00fascula en vez de una i may\u00fascula.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusLos siguientes 15.000 seguidores de Devumi eran m\u00e1s claramente sospechosos: no ten\u00edan im\u00e1genes de perfil y en vez de nombres ten\u00edan una mezcla de letras, n\u00fameros y fragmentos de palabras.Pero los registros de la empresa revisados por el Times revelan mucho de lo que Devumi y sus clientes prefieren ocultar.La mayor\u00eda de los compradores mejor conocidos de Devumi venden productos, servicios o a s\u00ed mismos en las redes. En entrevistas dieron explicaciones variadas: compraron a los seguidores porque ten\u00edan curiosidad sobre c\u00f3mo funcionaba o se sintieron presionados para tener un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s altos para ellos mismos o para sus clientes. \u201cTodos lo hacen\u201d, dijo la actriz Deirdre Lovejoy, clienta de Devumi.Aunque algunos dijeron que cre\u00edan que Devumi les daba fan\u00e1ticos potenciales o clientes reales, otros admitieron que sab\u00edan o sospechaban que las cuentas eran falsas. Varios dijeron arrepentirse de haber hecho la compra.\u201cEs un fraude\u201d, dijo James Cracknell, remador brit\u00e1nico y medallista de oro ol\u00edmpico que le compr\u00f3 50.000 seguidores a Devumi. \u201cLa gente que juzga seg\u00fan cu\u00e1ntos me gusta o cu\u00e1ntos seguidores\u2026 no es algo saludable\u201d.Kathy Ireland tiene m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de seguidores en Twitter, que usa frecuentemente para promocionar empresas con las que tiene acuerdos de patrocinio. Pero en enero del a\u00f1o pasado Ireland solo ten\u00eda unos 160.000 seguidores. El mes siguiente, un empleado de su agencia de licencias de marca, Sterling/Winters, gast\u00f3 unos 2000 d\u00f3lares para conseguir 300.000 seguidores m\u00e1s, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi. El empleado despu\u00e9s hizo m\u00e1s adquisiciones, seg\u00fan reconoci\u00f3 en una entrevista. Un an\u00e1lisis del Times hall\u00f3 que la mayor\u00eda de los seguidores de Ireland parecen ser bots.Una portavoz dijo que ese empleado actu\u00f3 sin la autorizaci\u00f3n de Ireland y que hab\u00eda sido suspendido despu\u00e9s de que el Times pregunt\u00f3 al respecto. \u201cEstoy segura de que pens\u00f3 que estaba cumpliendo con sus responsabilidades, pero no es algo que deber\u00eda haber hecho\u201d, dijo la vocera, Rona Menashe.Varios clientes de Devumi o sus representantes contactados por el Times se negaron a hacer comentarios. Muchos otros no respondieron a intentos reiterados para contactarlos.Muchas de las celebridades, l\u00edderes empresariales, astros deportivos y otros usuarios de Twitter compraron a sus seguidores directamente, de acuerdo con registros. En otros casos, la compra fue hecha por agentes, familiares, empleados y otros asociados.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusHillary Rosen, consultora en relaciones p\u00fablicas y colaboradora de CNN, compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s de medio mill\u00f3n de seguidores falsos a Devumi en dos a\u00f1os. En una entrevista, dijo que esas compras fueron hechas \u201ccomo experimento\u201d para ver \u201cc\u00f3mo funcionaba\u201d. Hizo m\u00e1s de una decena de adquisiciones entre 2015 y 2017, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi.Otros clientes dijeron que se hab\u00edan sentido presionados por sus empleadores para tener m\u00e1s seguidores. Marcus Holmlund era el encargado de redes sociales de la agencia de modelaje Wilhemina. Poco despu\u00e9s de haber llegado al puesto, un supervisor le dijo que no estaba consiguiendo suficientes seguidores y que deb\u00eda o comprarlos o encontrar otro empleo. Holmlund termin\u00f3 pagando \u00e9l mismo por las cuentas a Devumi antes de dejar la empresa en 2015 (una portavoz de Wilhemina se neg\u00f3 a hacer comentarios).\u201cMe sent\u00ed pasmado por la amenaza de ser despedido o, lo que es peor, nunca poder volver a trabajar en la industria de la moda\u201d, dijo Holmlund. \u201cDesde entonces le digo a quienes me preguntan que es un enga\u00f1o\u201d.Varios clientes de Devumi reconocieron que hab\u00edan comprado bots porque sus carreras depend\u00edan, en parte, de aparentar tener influencia en redes sociales. \u201cNadie te toma en serio si no tienes una presencia notoria\u201d, dijo Jason Schenker, economista que se especializa en pron\u00f3sticos econ\u00f3micos y que ha comprado unos 260.000 seguidores.M\u00e1s de cien personas que se describen a s\u00ed mismas como influenciadores \u2013cuya val\u00eda en t\u00e9rminos monetarios est\u00e1 aun m\u00e1s vinculada a la cantidad de seguidores\u2013 han comprado las cuentas falsas de Devumi. Justin Blau, un popular DJ cuyo nombre art\u00edstico es 3LAU, adquiri\u00f3 50.000 seguidores y miles de retuits. En un correo electr\u00f3nico, Blau dijo que un exmiembro de su equipo de administraci\u00f3n los compr\u00f3 sin su aprobaci\u00f3n.Las cuentas de los hermanos, seg\u00fan los registros de Devumi, son potenciadas por miles de retuits que compr\u00f3 su madre y m\u00e1nager, Shadia Daho. (Quien no respondi\u00f3 a varios intentos de contactarla por correo y v\u00eda una empresa de relaciones p\u00fablicas).Al principio, Pallen neg\u00f3 haber adquirido esos seguidores. Despu\u00e9s de que el Times contact\u00f3 a Greiner, Pallen afirm\u00f3 que hab\u00eda \u201cexperimentado\u201d con la empresa pero que \u201cdej\u00f3 de hacerlo hace mucho tiempo\u201d. Un abogado de Greiner dijo que ella le pidi\u00f3 que dejara de hacerlo cuando se enter\u00f3 de las primeras compras. Sin embargo, los registros muestran que Pallen le compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s seguidores a Greiner en 2016.Los consultores de mercadotecnia tambi\u00e9n compran a seguidores para s\u00ed mismos, como si compraran la evidencia para respaldar su supuesta pericia. En el 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, exprofesor de la Universidad de California del Sur que se autodenomina \u201cla autoridad l\u00edder del mundo en marcas de celebridades\u201d, comenz\u00f3 a comprar cientos de miles de seguidores falsos a Devumi.La Rychly falsa tambi\u00e9n retuite\u00f3 por lo menos cinco cuentas vinculadas al porn\u00f3grafo estadounidense Dan Leal, quien vive en Hungr\u00eda y usa la cuenta @PornoDan. Leal ha comprado unos 150.000 seguidores a Devumi en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y es uno de al menos doce clientes de esa empresa que son parte de la industria del entretenimiento adulto.En un correo, Leal dijo que la compra de seguidores para su negocio le ha generado m\u00e1s que suficientes ganancias para compensar el gasto. A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que no le preocupa ser penalizado por Twitter. \u201cUn sinf\u00edn de figuras p\u00fablicas, empresas, bandas musicales, etc., compran seguidores\u201d, escribi\u00f3. \u201cSi Twitter tuviera que sacar a todos los que lo hacen no quedar\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente ninguno de ellos\u201d.Devumi ha vendido decenas de miles de bots de alta calidad que son similares, de acuerdo con un an\u00e1lisis del Times. En algunos casos un solo usuario real de Twitter fue transformado en cientos de diferentes bots; cada uno una variante con cambios m\u00ednimos respecto al original.Por Richard Harris y Mark HansenLas cuentas falsas utilizaron identidades sociales de usuarios de Twitter registrados en los cincuenta estados que componen Estados Unidos y en decenas de pa\u00edses que eran tanto adultos como menores de edad; replicaron la informaci\u00f3n de usuarios muy activos y de quienes no hab\u00edan iniciado sesi\u00f3n en meses o hasta en a\u00f1os.Esta no tuvo actividad sino hasta el a\u00f1o pasado, cuando comenz\u00f3 a retuitear de manera continua a clientes de Devumi.\u201cNo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 replicaron mi identidad; soy un estudiante universitario de 20 a\u00f1os\u201d, dijo Dodd. \u201cNo soy alguien conocido\u201d. Pero incluso as\u00ed la identidad social de Dodd tiene valor en la econom\u00eda de la influencia. De acuerdo con los precios publicados en diciembre, Duvemi vend\u00eda a seguidores de alta calidad por menos de dos centavos. Si la identidad social de Dodd es vendida a unos dos mil clientes \u2013el n\u00famero promedio que siguen las cuentas bots de Devumi\u2013 esta empresa se har\u00eda con unos 30 d\u00f3lares.Esas identidades sociales robadas son claves para la marca Devumi. Los bots de alta calidad son los que usualmente llegan primero a los clientes, seguidos por unos de baja calidad; como si entregaran queso parmesano rallado junto con aserr\u00edn.Algunos de los bots de alta calidad de Devumi de hecho remplazan a una cuenta inactiva \u2013alguien que dej\u00f3 de usar el servicio\u2013 con una falsa. Whitney Wolfe, asistente ejecutiva que vive en Florida, abri\u00f3 una cuenta de Twitter en 2008, cuando ayudaba en la planeaci\u00f3n de bodas. Para cuando dej\u00f3 de usarla en 2014 ya hab\u00eda sido creada una cuenta falsa con su informaci\u00f3n personal, que ha retuiteado las publicaciones de actrices de la industria pornogr\u00e1fica y a varios influenciadores.\u201cEse contenido \u2013de mujeres en tanga y fotograf\u00edas de los pechos de mujeres\u2013 no es para nada lo que quiero que se asocie a mi fe, a mi nombre o a donde vivo\u201d, dijo Wolfe, quien es parte de una congregaci\u00f3n baptista.Otras v\u00edctimas segu\u00edan siendo activas en Twitter cuando los bots de Devumi empezaron a suplantar su identidad. Salle Ingle, ingeniera de 40 a\u00f1os que vive en Colorado, dijo que le preocupaba que un posible empleador se topara con la versi\u00f3n falsa si revisaba su actividad en redes sociales como parte del proceso de contrataci\u00f3n. Cuando el Times le avis\u00f3 sobre la cuenta, ella contact\u00f3 a Twitter y logr\u00f3 que fuera desactivada.Despu\u00e9s de enviarle el correo a Calas el a\u00f1o pasado, un reportero del Times visit\u00f3 la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan que lista el sitio web de Devumi. En el edificio rentan decenas de oficinas, pero Devumi y su empresa matriz, Bytion, no parecen estar entre los arrendatarios. Un portavoz del due\u00f1o del edificio dijo que ni Devumi ni Bytion han rentado espacios ah\u00ed.Como los seguidores que vende, la oficina de Devumi es una ilusi\u00f3n.En la vida real, Devumi tiene su sede en un edificio de oficinas arriba de un restaurante de comida mexicana en West Palm Beach, Florida, y frente a un callej\u00f3n repleto de basureros. Calas vive cerca en un penthouse.Calas, quien tiene 27 a\u00f1os, creci\u00f3 en el sur de Florida. Cuando era adolescente aprendi\u00f3 dise\u00f1o web y construy\u00f3 los sitios de varias compa\u00f1\u00edas locales, de acuerdo con versiones anteriores de su p\u00e1gina web personal que est\u00e1n guardadas en el Internet Archive.Con el tiempo se autoense\u00f1\u00f3 t\u00e9cnicas de optimizaci\u00f3n de b\u00fasquedas: el arte de lograr que una p\u00e1gina web termine m\u00e1s arriba al usar Google u otro motor de b\u00fasqueda. En el colegio comenz\u00f3 a tomar clases en la universidad Palm Beach State, donde consigui\u00f3 un t\u00edtulo t\u00e9cnico en 2012, seg\u00fan una portavoz de la escuela. Pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Calas afirmaba haber construido decenas de empresas web con m\u00e1s de diez millones de clientes como parte de Bytion.\u201cInici\u00e9 esta compa\u00f1\u00eda con mil d\u00f3lares en el banco, sin inversores, y solo con una ardiente pasi\u00f3n por el \u00e9xito\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Calas en el sitio de listados laborales Glassdoor.Buena parte del personal de atenci\u00f3n al cliente de Devumi est\u00e1 basado en Filipinas, lo que quiz\u00e1 le haya ayudado a Calas a reducir costos, pero tambi\u00e9n lo expuso a \u00e9l mismo ser v\u00edctima del robo de su identidad social.Calas acus\u00f3 que Boado us\u00f3 un nombre muy similar, DevumiBoost, y el mismo dise\u00f1o del sitio web, con todo y la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan. Durante julio pasado, Boado \u2013haci\u00e9ndose pasar por un empleado de Devumi\u2013 le escribi\u00f3 a cientos de clientes de esta empresa para decirles que sus \u00f3rdenes iban a ser procesadas por DevumiBoost. Luego tambi\u00e9n se hizo pasar por los clientes enviando correos a Devumi con diversos alias para pedir cancelar \u00f3rdenes. (Boado no respondi\u00f3 a correos solicit\u00e1ndole respuesta a las acusaciones de Calas).La demanda de Calas tambi\u00e9n revel\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s: parece que Devumi no hace sus propios bots. En cambio, los compra al mayoreo como parte de un mercado global de cuentas falsas en redes sociales.Esparcidos por todo el internet hay diversos sitios web con los que fabricantes an\u00f3nimos de bots se conectan con minoristas como Devumi. Mientras que los clientes individuales llegan a comprar directo de estos sitios \u2013Peakerr, CheapPanel o YTbot, entre otros\u2013 son menos amigables para un usuario directo. Algunas, por ejemplo, no aceptan pagos con tarjeta, solo Bitcoin.Cada sitio vende seguidores, me gusta y compartir al por mayor para diversas redes sociales en diferentes idiomas. Las cuentas que venden llegan a cambiar de manos en varias ocasiones y a ser comercializadas por m\u00e1s de un vendedor.Devumi, seg\u00fan un exempleado, utilizaba bots de diferentes fabricantes seg\u00fan el precio, la calidad y la confiabilidad. En Peakerr, por ejemplo, mil bots en ingl\u00e9s de alta calidad con fotograf\u00edas de perfil cuestan poco m\u00e1s de un d\u00f3lar. Devumi cobra 17 d\u00f3lares por la misma cantidad.Ese margen de ganancia le ha permitido a Calas construir una peque\u00f1a fortuna, de acuerdo con los registros de la empresa. En tan solo unos a\u00f1os, Devumi vendi\u00f3 alrededor de 200 millones de seguidores de Twitter a por lo menos 39.000 clientes, lo que representa un tercio o m\u00e1s de los 6 millones de d\u00f3lares en ventas durante ese periodo.En diciembre, Calas pidi\u00f3 que el Times le diera ejemplos de bots que hab\u00edan copiado informaci\u00f3n de usuarios reales. Despu\u00e9s de recibir los nombres de diez cuentas, Calas, quien hab\u00eda aceptado dar una entrevista, pidi\u00f3 m\u00e1s tiempo para analizarlas y despu\u00e9s dej\u00f3 de responder a los correos.Binns, la portavoz de Twitter, dijo que la empresa no revisa de manera proactiva las cuentas para ver si son suplantaci\u00f3n de otros usuarios. En vez, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, los esfuerzos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda se enfocan en identificar y suspender cuentas que violan las pol\u00edticas de correo basura de Twitter. Binns dijo que en diciembre, por ejemplo, la compa\u00f1\u00eda identific\u00f3 en promedio unas 6,4 millones de cuentas sospechosas por semana.Leslie Miley, ingeniera que trabaj\u00f3 en la unidad de seguridad de la empresa y de sus usuarios hasta finales de 2015, dijo: \u201cTwitter, como red social, fue desarrollada pr\u00e1cticamente sin prever rendici\u00f3n de cuentas\u201d.Algunos cr\u00edticos creen que hay un incentivo de negocios para Twitter en contra de reprimir m\u00e1s agresivamente a los bots. Durante los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, la empresa ha batallado para generar el crecimiento de usuarios que han tenido rivales como Facebook o Snapchat e investigadores externos han puesto en tela de duda los estimados de la compa\u00f1\u00eda sobre cu\u00e1ntos de sus usuarios activos son en realidad bots.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cTrabajamos con ecosistemas no regulados y cerrados por completo que no reportan estas cosas. Tienen un incentivo perverso para dejar que pase esto\u201d, dijo Essaid, el experto en ciberseguridad. \u201cQuieren controlar esto hasta el punto en el que no sea tan obvio que existe pero que [Twitter] siga sacando dinero de ello\u201d.En enero, despu\u00e9s de unos dos a\u00f1os de promover cientos de cuentas de clientes de Devumi, la Jessica Rychly falsa por fin fue identificada por los algoritmos de seguridad de Twitter y la cuenta fue suspendida.Sin embargo, la verdadera Rychly ya planea salirse para siempre de esa red social.\u201cProbablemente voy a borrar mi cuenta de Twitter\u201d, dijo.Contribuyeron al reportaje Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa y Felipe Villamor.

{"Headline": "From Brooklyn to India, in Search of the Secret to Parenthood", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen my daughter\u2019s pediatrician in New York City weighs her, we have to take all of her clothes and diaper off and step away from the scale so it can be recalibrated. Then we put her on the scale, our hands hovering over her in case she picks that moment to become an expert roller. Her weight, down to exact ounces, flashes in red on the screen and gets recorded in the computer.We recently came to Mumbai for a few months and at our daughter\u2019s five-month introductory well visit here, the pediatrician placed her down, fully clothed, on his scale, looked at the weight, picked her back up and handed her to me. Two minutes later, he said, \u201cOh dear, I don\u2019t remember what the scale said, do you?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I panicked. \u201cSix kilos and either .68 or .78 but I don\u2019t remember exactly. Should we do it again? And shouldn\u2019t we remove her clothes and diaper?\u201dHe brushed me off and simply said, \u201cYes, I also thought it was over 6, so she\u2019s a good weight.\u201dFor the next few minutes, I wasn\u2019t really listening to what he was telling us about introducing solids. My mind was on her weight \u2014 how would I know exactly how much she had gained, whether everything was on track, what percentile she was now in, and how I was succeeding as a parent.\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job, don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dI could not worry too much? That was an option?I had my daughter while we were living in Brooklyn, the competitive parenting capital of the world. Parenting is hard enough without having one woman in a mothers\u2019 group suggest importing organic formula from Norway while another, baby clutched at her breast, gasps that we could even consider feeding our babies formula.When buying my baby\u2019s first bassinet before she was born, I made the mistake of asking my online mothers\u2019 group for recommendations. I got flooded with responses and links and Amazon reviews and my post quickly devolved into a fight between the co-sleepers and non-co-sleepers. I finally settled on an expensive bassinet (because when you get anxious about child-rearing, you can be tricked into assuming that more expensive means better) and then, once it arrived, spent days worried that I had made the wrong decision.The bassinet we got worked perfectly well but just as we were starting to get full nights of sleep and an occasional night out, we got on a plane and flew across the world to India and landed at the airport at 1 a.m. It was bustling with families waiting for loved ones and babies and children of all ages running around excitedly with no concept of a bedtime.From the minute we arrived in India, I had to let go. I had to stop worrying because I couldn\u2019t worry anymore \u2014 it is impossible to worry about everything I might need to worry about in India: contaminated water, mosquitoes that may carry dengue or malaria, traffic that often follows no rules. Against all of that, did it really matter if my daughter had gained three ounces or five?The next day, in Mumbai, I went to a fancy baby shop to buy cribs, ready to spend a few hours weighing the pros and cons of various options. With the baby strapped to me in a carrier and an iced coffee in my hand, I marched in to the shop and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see your options for cribs, please.\u201d\u201cThis one,\u201d the salesperson said. I ordered it and left the shop within 10 minutes.I myself was born in India and had a perfectly safe and sound upbringing here but, in the eternal battle of nature versus nurture, my surroundings in Brooklyn seemed to be affecting me more than my own childhood or my mother\u2019s suggestions that I calm down. Her advice was impossible for me to hear in my New York environment, surrounded by my fellow mothers whose days are ruled by feeding apps. When I showed my Indian grandmother the feeding app on my phone, instead of marveling at it and saying she wished she\u2019d had such a thing when she was a young mother, she just laughed at me and took a long sip of her coconut water.I had been nervous about making this big trip with our newborn daughter because to leave our little neighborhood of Brooklyn and travel across the world and set up a different life felt too daunting. Babies are challenging: In a cruel failure of evolution, adults require five hours of uninterrupted sleep in order to function and newborn babies need to feed every three hours.They say babies thrive on routine and I had just begun to find mine in Brooklyn, but it was a perfectly crafted rhythm with no space for deviation or change. I have the luxury of working from home so I was feeding her as soon as the baby-feeding app beeped and I put her down for naps at exactly the same time every day.My baby, who loved 22 out of the 24 hours it took us to get to Mumbai, doesn\u2019t seem to be too bothered about her routine being disrupted so far. She loves all the people in India and reaches for them faster than I can swoop in and force them to cover themselves with antibacterial gel.She\u2019s had a stomach upset already but didn\u2019t seem nearly as troubled by it as I was. We went out to dinner with friends who have a 7-month-old and both babies stayed awake for part of the dinner and then fell asleep in their strollers. When we got home we transferred her to her crib and she kept sleeping peacefully.Some nights she wakes up at 2 a.m. and needs a bit of attention and some nights she doesn\u2019t; there isn\u2019t any method to her madness, whether or not I\u2019ve followed the feeding app perfectly, whether or not we\u2019ve been at a boisterous restaurant.And so we\u2019re both learning \u2014 me to relax and her to not put everything in her mouth. I think we\u2019ll find a happy equilibrium. I\u2019m still worrying about the big things and some very small ones: No mosquito has come within two feet of my daughter and lived to tell the tale. But I\u2019ve found much more mental time for actual enjoyment now.I don\u2019t claim to have discovered the secret to parenting except, perhaps, just one: There is no secret to parenting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wary, Weary or Both, Southern Lawmakers Tone Down Culture Wars", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic and Republican officials, advocacy groups and researchers say that other, less contentious subjects are taking center stage, while fewer new hot-button social bills are being introduced and pending ones are languishing.\u201cI do think there\u2019s a recognition that we\u2019ve got some really big things to do,\u201d said Greg Snowden, a Republican state representative in Mississippi who serves as speaker pro tempore. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to war on everything all the time.\u201dCivil rights activists remain concerned, though, and see the waning of legislative activity on social issues as a temporary respite, not a lasting change in the political dynamics of the region. They say that troubling proposals could still surface this year, and that old proposals that died down could be fanned back to life in election campaigns this fall.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of time, and I would be very derelict in my duty if I said I wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, which helped organize opposition to many proposals seen as harmful to gay and transgender people, among others. \u201cWe as advocates, but also our allies, will be very sorry if we take our eyes off the ball,\u201d she said.Even so, many pending bills that are of the greatest concern to gay and transgender rights activists are stalled or have effectively been defeated.\u201cI think people are tempering, and I think they\u2019re thinking harder about what can be achieved, what needs to be achieved,\u201d said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois who has written extensively about the intersection of gay rights and religious freedom. \u201cThere\u2019s been a slow IV drip of common sense to legislators, and you have lots and lots of people speaking to them and saying, \u2018It\u2019s not viable to do an extreme thing.\u2019\u201dAnd in Texas, where some of the country\u2019s most contentious bills on gay and transgender rights have been brought up, the Legislature is not scheduled to meet at all in 2018. A \u201cbathroom bill\u201d failed twice there last year.Observers on all sides say it is too early to know with certainty whether more contentious social legislation will eventually emerge this year. But the evidence so far suggests that the pace has slowed markedly.There are also worries that lawmakers have been distracted for too long from practical issues like education and infrastructure. And some point to a creeping sense of rancor fatigue.\u201cAfter you have a bill come up two or three years in a row, or an issue, you sort of lose the fervor,\u201d said Steven Dickerson, a Republican state senator in Tennessee.Steven W. Long, a South Carolina Republican who sponsored the restroom bill that is mired in the Legislature there, said that he and people who share his views know they may not see swift action.\u201cIt\u2019s a war of attrition,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cPolitics is a long-term kind of game. We\u2019re not going to see the results that we want to see overnight. It\u2019s taken us years to get where are, and it\u2019s going to take years to get us where we want to be.\u201dOne factor that seems to loom large is that, though the bills have often been popular with conservative voters, they go down very poorly with another important constituency: big business. Officials in states hoping to attract major investments from out-of-state corporations \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s second headquarters \u2014 say they drew a lesson from the boycotts and cancellations that North Carolina suffered over its bathroom bill.(Those pleas may not be heeded as the campaign for governor heats up: All the major Republican contenders have vowed to support a \u201creligious freedom\u201d proposal like the one Mr. Deal blocked, under significant corporate pressure, and some lawmakers have promised to stir debate in the Legislature this year, however limited it may ultimately be.)In a recent speech near Georgia\u2019s gold-topped Capitol, Mr. Deal seemed to signal that the state ought to set aside legislative proposals that might spook the Seattle-based company or try to read its mind: \u201cWe cannot waste valuable time, energy and effort, when what we should be doing is focusing on enhancing those issues which have already made us an attractive candidate to Amazon.\u201dSupporters of bills to permit faith-based exemptions from discrimination laws protecting gay people dismiss Mr. Deal\u2019s arguments as convenient cover for a lame-duck governor. In Georgia and beyond, religious conservatives contend that they have not ceded any ground.\u201cWithin our organizations and groups and constituencies, I think there\u2019s still the same energy,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, the chairman of Liberty Counsel, which has litigated against same-sex marriage. \u201cThe battle is not just in the courts and in the legislatures; it\u2019s also in the corporate world.\u201dMr. Staver\u2019s opponents make no apologies for the evolution of their strategy, which now relies heavily on the public pressure that large companies and corporate executives can bring to bear.\u201cI think Amazon is very much part of this conversation that\u2019s happening with big business in the U.S.,\u201d said Ms. Oakley of the Human Rights Campaign. Companies, she added, are \u201csaying these bills are harmful to our ability to do business, to our employees, to the quality of life that we want our employees to be enjoying. With that voice, I think state legislatures have slowed down the momentum.\u201dTo be sure, the turmoil created by these legislative efforts could resurface at any moment and throw a state legislature into sudden chaos.\u201cThings kind of ebb and flow sometimes, and most things can catch you by surprise,\u201d Mr. Snowden, the Mississippi lawmaker, observed recently. \u201cBut right now, it seems to be a period of relative calm.\u201dThen he chuckled and added, \u201cThat\u2019s today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John S. Coleman, Weather Channel Co-Founder, Dies at 83", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn S. Coleman, a co-founder of the Weather Channel, the original meteorologist on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and, later in his career, a vocal climate change skeptic, died on Saturday at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas. He was 83.His death was confirmed by his family.Before it became possible to use mobile phones to check humidity levels and wind speeds by ZIP code on demand, Mr. Coleman pioneered the concept of round-the-clock weather reporting.He popularized the use of chroma key \u2014 better known as green screen \u2014 which allowed him to speak against a backdrop of ever-changing maps and images. Throughout his career his shows included warning systems to allow viewers to prepare for coming storms and incorporated lifestyle segments.Nearly half of American households now tune in each month to the Weather Channel, which Mr. Coleman helped launch with Frank Batten Sr. in 1982.\u201cThe weather is a unique story, because it impacts all of us very personally on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Dave Shull, chief executive of the Weather Channel, said in an interview. \u201cFor him to see that there was an opportunity, and to have the fortitude to go through the and downs to push an idea he had from scratch, that\u2019s remarkable.\u201dJohn Stewart Coleman was born on Oct. 15, 1934, in Champaign, Ill., the youngest of five children of Claude and Hazel Coleman. He spent his childhood in Alpine, Tex.While in high school, his family said, he helped host a radio show in Carbondale, Ill. By the time he graduated from the University of Illinois with a journalism degree in 1957, he had already delivered the early evening weather forecast and hosted a local \u201cAmerican Bandstand\u201d-type television show in Champaign.His career took him through broadcast positions in Omaha, Milwaukee and Peoria, Ill. He joined the fledgling \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in 1975 and stayed for seven years.\u201cHe was sort of a weather rock star at the time,\u201d said Joseph D\u2019Aleo, whom Mr. Coleman recruited out of academia to lend a hand at \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and to help him develop his idea for a 24-7 weather channel.\u201cHe was dedicated to everything he did; he\u2019d sometimes take off after the morning shows, get on an airplane, go halfway across the country and meet with venture capitalists to present his idea,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Aleo said in an interview.But after a year of false starts, Mr. D\u2019Aleo said, Mr. Coleman \u201cfelt a little bit like Sancho Panza behind Don Quixote and his impossible dream.\u201d\u201cIt suddenly happened,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Aleo said. \u201cCable was growing very quickly, and operators were realizing they needed more services to get people to pay for cable.\u201dThe American Meteorological Society named Mr. Coleman broadcast meteorologist of the year in 1983, citing his \u201cmany years of service in presenting weather reports of high informational, educational and professional quality.\u201dThat same year, he was pushed out of the Weather Channel.Mr. Shull described the ouster as a classic case of a visionary struggling with the operational demands of the business. Mr. D\u2019Aleo said that Mr. Coleman had lost a fight for financial control of the company.Mr. Coleman moved on, working in New York and Chicago before settling in Southern California. For 20 years he worked as a meteorologist for KUSI-TV in San Diego.By the time he retired in 2014, he had become a lightning rod for controversy over his views on climate change.\u201cHe came out pretty strongly, and we took a pretty public position counteracting what he was saying,\u201d Mr. Shull, of the Weather Channel, said. \u201cWe still honor him as the founder of the network, but we certainly don\u2019t ascribe to his opinions on climate.\u201dMr. Coleman and his wife, Linda, eventually moved to Las Vegas, where he could indulge his passion for poker. His family said he played several times a week.He is survived by his wife; his daughter, Susan Keim; his son, Scott; his brothers, Philip and Richard; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Coleman was also an avid writer. His self-published novel \u201cTrophy: Sex and Money Are the Most Powerful Forces on Earth\u201d is marketed on Amazon as partly a love story and partly a tale of \u201cbillion-dollar business deals between a movie studio and a television network,\u201d with \u201cmaybe even a murder thrown in.\u201dAnother book, \u201cWeather Channel Pioneers,\u201d is due out next month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Second Act: Big-Time Producer", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "From Oscar-winning actress to Emmy-winning producer: After taking charge of her career, she makes deals with HBO and Apple.Supported byA few months ago, Reese Witherspoon realized everything had changed.Not long after that night, she found herself in demand.\u201cIt opened a lot of doors for me,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview this past week. \u201cPeople wanted to be in business with me as a producer in the TV space. My mission was to create television for other women, for other female storytellers that are actresses, other directors and other writers. I think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds.\u201dSince then, Ms. Witherspoon has transformed herself from an actress increasingly frustrated with the roles she was being offered into a producer with a slate of projects that puts her in the company of series creators like Dick Wolf, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.Apple\u2019s top TV executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, said in a statement that Ms. Witherspoon had \u201can extraordinary knack for being a step ahead of the zeitgeist.\u201dThe rise of Hello Sunshine \u2014 with projects centered on strong, complicated women \u2014 syncs up perfectly with the #timesup movement, which counts Ms. Witherspoon as a major player, and gives evidence that the risk-averse Hollywood establishment may have learned something from the blockbuster success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d last year.\u201cPeople are desperate for this kind of storytelling about the female heroes that have always been in the shadows and now are coming into the light,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Ms. Witherspoon, 41, does not have the track record of super producers like Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, who have created hit shows for more than a decade, but she has already put a lot of distance between herself and the pack of actors who run production boutiques as a hobby.Ms. Rhimes, the hitmaker behind \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d who recently signed an deal with Netflix, called Ms. Witherspoon a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d producer.\u201cReese has been very smart about what she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cShe has leveraged her power in a very smart way to get big projects done. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201dCasey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO, said he was impressed by her willingness to get into the minutiae.\u201cReese is a movie star, she has a movie star\u2019s presence, she\u2019s a great actress \u2014 that all goes without saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat surprises people is I can call Reese on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 and have those conversations, saying, \u2018How do we get this deal closed?\u2019 \u2014 and she\u2019ll go off and get it closed.\u201dOne of her recent producing coups was to add Meryl Streep to the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d cast. Along with her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star (and fellow executive producer) Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon lobbied Ms. Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, to come aboard. She said yes in an email to Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman on the day \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was nominated for six Golden Globes. (The show went on to win four.)\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I got that email,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cI called Nicole, and I just started to cry.\u201dThat catharsis was a long time in coming, said Ms. Witherspoon, who had seen a number of her projects wilt. She grew weary of hearing that the industry had reached its quota of female-driven movies for the year. At the same time, she was starring in mostly forgettable movies \u2014 \u201cHow Do You Know\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Knot\u201d \u2014 and her box-office stock was dropping.She took control of her career by making a deeper commitment to producing. An avid reader who often posts photos of her favorites on Instagram, she started optioning book after book, partly motivated by a conversation she had with her husband, Jim Toth, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.\u201cI talked to my husband around that time, when the movies weren\u2019t working for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Are these movies you want to be making?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting for the scripts to come in.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who sits around and waits for the phone to ring. You read more books than anybody I know, so why don\u2019t you start making them into your own material?\u2019\u201cAnd I thought about my mom, who said, \u2018If you want something done, do it yourself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Witherspoon continued. \u201cYou can sit there and complain about it, or you can do something about it. Instead of having people make calls for me, I called every studio head myself: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Reese!\u2019 I\u2019ve known everybody for 27 years. They knew me when I was 14 years old, all of them. I\u2019ve made movies at pretty much every studio. It\u2019s still the same 200 people who are working in our business.\u201dMs. Witherspoon\u2019s previous production company, Pacific Standard, had hits with the 2014 movies \u201cWild\u201d (based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed and starring Ms. Witherspoon) and \u201cGone Girl.\u201d It came to an end in 2016 when Ms. Witherspoon split from her longtime producing partner, Bruna Papandrea.Ms. Witherspoon sought outside investment when she was ready to start Hello Sunshine, striking a deal with Otter Media, a company owned by the Chernin Group and AT&T, which bought a 30 percent stake in her new production house.In addition to the three Apple projects and \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Hello Sunshine has two potential series in the running at ABC and NBC. Several film projects are also in the works. Among them, Fox 2000 has picked up \u201cSomething in the Water,\u201d based on a thriller by Catherine Steadman about newlyweds whose Bora Bora honeymoon goes awry, and Sony\u2019s TriStar Pictures has given the green light to \u201cA White Lie,\u201d based on a 2016 novel \u201cThe Gilded Years,\u201d by Karin Tanabe, about the first black woman to attend Vassar College, in the 1890s.Hello Sunshine, which recently named Sarah Harden, formerly of Otter Media, as its chief executive, also has plans to create short bursts of digital-friendly content. At the moment, though, Ms. Witherspoon is making her name in the producer ranks because of her work in the hypercompetitive streaming market.Her planned Apple series with Ms. Aniston \u2014 the \u201cFriends\u201d star\u2019s return to a lead role in a television series \u2014 was inspired by \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a book by the CNN media reporter Brian Stelter on the so-called morning TV wars. For that one, Apple has pledged to make two 10-episode seasons, without so much as a script written. Two people familiar with the project said Apple would pay $12 million to $15 million an episode. (By comparison, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the costliest shows ever made, has a budget of $15 million an episode for its final season.)Unlike the stereotypical Hollywood producer or celebrity, Ms. Witherspoon is a deep reader \u2014 which has impressed the women who are working with her on Hello Sunshine\u2019s other Apple projects.Colleen McGuinness, a former \u201c30 Rock\u201d writer who is the show runner for the planned series based on a short-story collection by Curtis Sittenfeld, was surprised that Ms. Witherspoon had read the book before their first meeting. When Ms. McGuinness mentioned this, she said, she \u201cgot a look\u201d from Ms. Witherspoon.\u201cWe laughed about it, and I said, \u2018Yeah, most people don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Ms. McGuinness said.During a meeting about the project starring Ms. Spencer, the writer-producer Nichelle Tramble pointed out a book in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s office \u2014 \u201cThe Alice Network,\u201d a novel by Kate Quinn set in the 1940s. That led to a discussion of the lack of female leads in historical dramas.\u201cThat she was such an intense, true and avid reader was very exciting and a little bit shocking,\u201d Ms. Tramble said.Ms. Witherspoon marvels at how the business is changing. A few years ago, she said, prospects were dim for actresses over age 40. She hopes she can help change that in her new role.\u201cYou get older and the phone does stop ringing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, because the people who are writing the stories aren\u2019t 40-year-old women. You write what you know. Well, there were no 40-year-old female screenwriters, and now women of color are writing screenplays and getting them made at big studios.\u201cI\u2019m as incredulous as everybody else,\u201d she continued. \u201cI never thought this would happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Moreover, the issue implicates gender equality and gender diversity concerns more broadly, and boards that include a meaningful proportion of female directors should be better positioned to address sexual harassment and gender equality issues.Among the best ways to better address the issue at a company: having more women on corporate boards and in senior management positions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIf the rally persists, then the four biggest companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index could all soon be flirting with the $1 trillion mark.Bad enough that the embattled industrial giant had to announce that GE Capital would suspend dividends to the group, after a $6.2 billion charge tied to its reinsurance operations.Critics\u2019 cornerPoint 72 is on the verge of managing outside money and operating as a true hedge fund again.

Average hourly earnings rose just 2.5 percent last year, below the Fed\u2019s target and in line with recent years.But there has been some optimism that wage growth might pick up this year because: 1) The unemployment rate should continue to fall; 2) Companies are doling out one-time bonuses and pay raises in response to the new tax law; 3) Several cities and states raised the minimum wage on Jan. 1.The economists at BofA Merrill Lynch took a closer look these dynamics, and here\u2019s their take away:\u201cWage increases by companies and higher state and local minimum wages should provide a slight bump to wage growth in the next few months...Once the initial boost to wage growth fades, we think the trajectory for wage growth should be a function of the degree of tightening in the labor market. The descent in the unemployment rate should be able to boost wages to a high-2% pace by year-end and to 3% by the middle of 2019. The trajectory is still gradual, but clearly higher.\u201dSo far, the markets don\u2019t seem bothered.

{"Headline": "Can Amazon and Friends Handle Health Care? There\u2019s Reason for Doubt", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while the three companies bring successful management, technological expertise and substantial capital to the venture, many health industry experts expressed doubts about whether their results would match their ambition.Here are a few reasons that experts suggest we temper expectations.Over the years, faced with rising costs, employers have banded together to try novel approaches to health insurance benefits. Some have pioneered strategies like working directly with health systems or have achieved significant savings compared with competitors. But none have made a major dent in overall health care spending.\u201cThey contribute in the small wins,\u201d said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut those tend to be swamped by growth in health care, which is so high. They\u2019re not silver bullets.\u201dHealth care is very local, and companies have traditionally had a hard time preventing hospitals and doctors from raising prices or delivering mediocre care, because they don\u2019t have enough leverage to force health care providers to do things differently.\u201cThe part that is the most difficult is trying to influence the underlying system,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employer groups. \u201cAny single company, even broad coalitions, have a hard time.\u201dTechnology giants have attempted health care innovation before. Google and Microsoft started health ventures in recent years to a lot of fanfare, with little success.The three companies don\u2019t have much direct experience in providing health insurance or services. Chase has invested in the industry, and Berkshire Hathaway has owned insurance companies, but none have worked extensively in health benefits or in managing doctors, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies.\u201cJust because you know an industry is underperforming and you have a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean you have a successful strategy,\u201d said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, in an email. Ms. Dafny said she was excited to see such serious players take on this problem, but noted there were numerous examples of outsiders trying, and failing, to succeed in the health care system.Most disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That\u2019s the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don\u2019t usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper.Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called \u201clow-value services\u201d \u2014 health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options.But reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good value. Highly compensated employees, like those at Chase or at Amazon headquarters, may be particularly attracted to cutting-edge cancer treatments or the latest prescription drugs, he noted. A health plan that cut out such services might hurt the ability to recruit and retain workers needed to succeed in other parts of the business.\u201cIf there was pure inefficiency, I think it would be a lot easier to make progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that all of this stuff has some small benefit.\u201dThere are some ways that a smart company might seek to wring real inefficiencies out of health care. It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost.The three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services company, based in New York, with highly compensated employees. Berkshire Hathaway is a consortium of companies, spread throughout the country, in a variety of industries. And Amazon is a technology company with a hub of highly paid workers in Seattle, and with lower-wage workers spread in warehouses around the country. Will they all want or need the same sort of health plan?In general, companies with a lot of highly paid workers tend to offer generous benefits. Health insurance is not taxed in the same way as other forms of compensation, so an investment banker may prefer a health plan that covers everything instead of one with a big deductible that she has to pay out of her post-tax salary. A lower-wage worker in an Amazon warehouse, by contrast, may want a skimpier health plan and more wages.But savings on health care would accrue directly to the companies\u2019 bottom lines, allowing them to hire more workers or increase their profits relative to their competitors. That means selling such services to their competitors would need to be profitable enough to make up for giving competitors that business edge.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to transform the economy unless they then share all of those ideas and best practices with their competitors,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist who teaches corporate strategy at the Kellogg School at Northwestern. \u201cThat would not be good for long-term shareholder value for their firms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stampede of Tech Giants Gives Rebalancing New Appeal", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou own a balanced portfolio that should perform well in all sorts of market conditions.But do you really?If you think you\u2019re protected from market swings by holding index-based investments, think again.Over all, large growth stocks soared 25.4 percent in 2017. Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201dSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.The market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Thousands of tech and gadget enthusiasts flooded the Las Vegas Convention Center for the four-day event, which began on Tuesday, to see the newest electronics that are being introduced on the market.Yet the clear darling of this year\u2019s show was not a gadget but the growing amount of artificial intelligence software helping these products run. The race between Amazon and Google to be the go-to service for integration of consumer products was on full display. In many booths, signs prominently advertised that products worked with Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. The smart home, car and TV all seemed to have been touched by Amazon or Google.\u201cIt\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.Zipping along the convention floor were robots yielding a host of skills. One robot, Loomo, top, doubles as a hoverboard and a companion that can take photos. Another robot, iPal, above, serves as companion to older and younger users. Designed by AvatarMind, the $1,500 humanoid robot can remind elders to take medicine or greet children at the door.Sony\u2019s new robot dog, Aibo, also stopped conventiongoers who took time to rub their hands on its hard-surface head.Google\u2019s presence was easily identifiable with activation centers, games and presenters walking around the convention floor, but Amazon dominated the arena by the sheer volume of products that worked with the Alexa voice assistant, like robovacuums, light dimmers and even mosquito zappers.This year\u2019s event featured more than 4,000 exhibitors, including 800 start-ups, and covered more than 2.6 million square feet.Home appliances like coffee makers, vacuums, ovens and even the cat litter box also received an A.I. upgrade. Samsung\u2019s smart refrigerator, which was on display, allows consumers to control other home devices with their voice and a large touch screen.The Mercedes-Benz User Experience, known as MBUX, one of many vehicle systems showcasing connected car technology, was a crowd favorite. The in-vehicle system includes a touch screen and understands voice commands.On Wednesday, the power went out for a large portion of the convention center for more than an hour. Many attendees mocked the irony of a giant electronics show lacking electricity.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the robots on display at the CES trade show. It is Loomo, which doubles as a hoverboard and a companion that can take photos, not Nimbo, a different robot that works as an intelligent security system that can be programmed to patrol specific routes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Retail Trade Show, Technology Is the Star", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retail industry is doubling down on digital to keep its unexpectedly strong holiday performance from becoming a fluke.The floor of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual trade show in New York this week was crowded with alert systems primed to recognize heavy-spending customers, so-called smart shelves fitted with real-time inventory trackers and robots for every step of the supply chain.It was a conference about shopping that looked more like an expo for tech, as if the electronics trade show CES had decamped from Las Vegas and moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.At the three-day event \u2014 which drew more than 600 exhibitors and featured sessions with top executives from Walmart, Best Buy, Neiman Marcus and other major companies \u2014 discussions of artificial intelligence, big data and automation filled stages and meeting booths modeled after fitting rooms.E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.Embracing technologies, and quickly, is crucial to survival as consumers grow more demanding, according to a panel of venture capital professionals.\u201cThe consumer expectation of a frictionless shopping experience is here,\u201d said Scott Friend, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures.Digitally native companies are emerging and growing faster. Catching up can be difficult for large legacy chains, which have struggled to project enough cool factor to recruit in-demand employees.\u201cTalent is a major challenge for a lot of these retailers,\u201d said Janie Yu, a partner at Fung Capital. \u201cIf you are a top-notch, A+ data scientist, you probably want to work at Bonobos or Facebook or Google or Jet.\u201dMr. Friend said that companies like Walmart had tried to make cultural shifts to attract innovative employees, or folded them in through acquisitions.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s some magic that start-ups have that big companies don\u2019t,\u201d he said.All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?\u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201dShoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.Consumers are in control, as retailers scramble to tailor products to their liking, design more elaborate shopping experiences to hold their interest and deliver purchases on increasingly short deadlines.Customer behavior is getting harder to pin down. The boundaries between generations are disappearing, as so-called millennial and generation Z shoppers influence the buying habits of baby boomers, panelists said.As companies compile more detailed dossiers on their clientele, stuffed with data collected online and in stores, retailers could someday fine-tune their marketing and scheduling to each consumer, the panelists said.\u201cWe can microsegment as thin as we want in the future,\u201d Ms. Haziot said. \u201cEach individual is a segment in itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Netflix Is a Monster, and Apple\u2019s HomePod Arrives Soon", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGood morning! Let\u2019s talk tech.People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.The problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.Then, nothing.A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.It\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.That\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.There\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.It\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Peru Jungle, Francis Offers a Stirring Defense of Indigenous Peoples", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPUERTO MALDONADO, Peru \u2014 In this sweltering Amazonian city, Pope Francis on Friday gave a stirring defense of the region\u2019s indigenous people, whose lands and way of life are threatened by industry and government, leaving almost no institutions to protect them.It was a departure from an otherwise purely religious visit to Peru, where Francis arrived on Thursday from Chile, but it fit squarely within his advocacy for environmental preservation.Facing a crowded sports arena \u2014 where the main stage was neatly divided between clerics sitting on chairs and indigenous people in traditional garments sitting on the ground \u2014 Francis said he understood the local challenges.He deplored, on one hand, \u201cthe pressure being exerted by great business interests that want to lay hands on its petroleum, gas, lumber, gold and forms of agro-industrial monocultivation\u201d and, on the other hand, threats from policies that ostensibly aim to conserve land \u201cwithout taking into account\u201d its inhabitants.He also criticized those who call indigenous rights a \u201chindrance\u201d to economic development.\u201cThe fact is, your lives cry out against a style of life that is oblivious to its own real cost,\u201d he said.The speech resonated with indigenous leaders here, who have expressed hopes that the papal visit would finally cast a spotlight on their plight. But they also asked why indigenous leaders had been left to stand on the sidelines.Mr. Vasquez and Mr. Cusurichi, among the most prominent indigenous leaders here, said they had been denied, at the last minute, a chance to address the pope. (Mr. Cusurichi gave Francis a present, but did not speak.)\u201cWe\u2019re scared because people who are from other places want our people to disappear,\u201d said Luis Miguel Tayori, an indigenous man who spoke at the event.Small and remote, Puerto Maldonado seemed an unlikely candidate for a papal visit. Unlike Peru\u2019s bigger cities, its history does not trace to the Andean nation\u2019s colonial past, when Spaniards urbanized and evangelized at the same time.But Puerto Maldonado represents the gateway to two bluntly contradictory worlds that sit within Francis\u2019 interests. The city provides access to pristine rain forest, jungle lodges and biodiversity research stations, but it is also the entry point to a 21st century gold rush that has not only eroded trees and rivers but also the rule of law.From above, the mined areas look like orange scars piercing a green blanket made of trees. From the ground, the rise of illegal mining in the region has been accompanied by a rise in violent crime and human trafficking, which Francis called a \u201cdevastating assault on life.\u201d Mining also has threatened the territories where indigenous populations live. Tons of mercury, a byproduct of gold mining, have been poured into rivers.\u201cWe the indigenous people are the ones who drink water directly from the rivers and eat its fish,\u201d Mr. Cusurichi said. \u201cCity dwellers don\u2019t do that.\u201dIn his message, Francis seemed to agree.\u201cWe have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,\u201d he said.Others say mining is facing too much of a stigma in a city that has boomed in the past decade partly because of it. Maria Quispe Ccoca, from Huepetuhe, a town that has come to symbolize the region\u2019s gold rush, said she had hoped the pope would strike a conciliatory note without demonizing miners.\u201cWe need peace, reconciliation, especially in the far-flung towns of our Amazon jungle,\u201d said Ms. Quispe Ccoca, who traveled to Puerto Maldonado to see Francis.But indigenous leaders say they have had enough.\u201cWe need a proper indigenous economy that is based on a sustainable use of the rain forest,\u201d Mr. V\u00e1squez said. \u201cWe need an alternative to hell, and hell is mining.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Multiply That Disappointment by 218.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Hall, town manager of Scarborough, Me., had just returned from a meeting about the clam harvest when he heard the bad news from a reporter. He took it philosophically. The town\u2019s proposal to convert a 500-acre harness racing track in the center of Scarborough was, he knew, \u201cthe longest of long shots.\u201dIn Oklahoma, there were more regrets.\u201cI\u2019m certainly disappointed,\u201d said Scott Phillips, who ran a development team called Day 1 that promoted a proposal to build an entirely new 50-square-mile city for Amazon between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, equidistant from each.\u201cAmazon missed an opportunity to include more out-of-the-box thinking in their list of finalists from proposals like ours,\u201d he added.Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d twice in a brief interview, adding that the whole process was \u201cgreat publicity\u201d for Amazon.\u201cThis news is certainly disappointing,\u201d the team that promoted Buffalo and Rochester said in a statement.\u201cVery disappointed,\u201d said the Bay Area Council, which had submitted a bid on behalf of San Francisco and four neighboring cities.Amazon\u2019s obsessive desire to please its customers has created a fearsome retail juggernaut and made its founder, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new.Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up?\u201cThis new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,\u201d Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging.Mr. Hall said he had received \u201cno word whatsoever\u201d from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, \u201cAll the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls.\u201d (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.)Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk.Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus.The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon\u2019s public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos\u2019 growing wealth and power.For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process \u2014 which will continue for months \u2014 is \u201creality show\u201d theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said.Amazon, he said, \u201cwants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids.\u201d\u201cFrom a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,\u201d Mr. Rolnick added. \u201cFrom a national perspective, it makes no sense.\u201dSome elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done.\u201cIt was like \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u201d the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa\u2019s mayor, G. T. Bynum. \u201cI loved the process. Amazon, to their credit, made it a public and transparent one. Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don\u2019t even know what company is interested.\u201dNot all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that.One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point.However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something.\u201cSecond headquarters are the thing of the future \u2014 the companies are getting too big for a single market,\u201d said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation.\u201cIf Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba\u201d \u2014 the Chinese internet retailer \u2014 \u201cis willing,\u201d said Mr. Phillips. His efforts to build a corporate city, he said, will continue.There is, however, the problem of the name. \u201cDay 1\u201d is a pet expression of Mr. Bezos, symbolizing how his company\u2019s opportunities are always right in front of it.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably look for a better brand,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, and then reconsidered. \u201cIf someone wants to take on Amazon, maybe keeping it \u2018Day 1\u2019 will offer the added ability to mess with Bezos\u2019 head a little.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mr. Lincoln Goes to Hollywood (and Looks Like Henry Fonda)", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDThe movie, which has a script by Lamar Trotti (a Southerner who would win an Oscar for writing another presidential biopic, \u201cWilson\u201d), opens after a few bars of \u201cRally \u2019Round the Flag\u201d in 1832 in bucolic New Salem, Ill. There the future president is introduced as a gentle force of nature, rehearsing a political speech for a group of giggling kids, studying his law books beneath a tree and shyly courting Ann Rutledge (Pauline Moore, later to play opposite Roy Rogers in Republic Pictures B-westerns). Ann\u2019s death, handled with masterly tact, is the catalyst that sends Lincoln to practice law in Springfield.Both salty and sentimental, \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln\u201d establishes its subject as a folk hero. Fonda, a 20th Century Fox contract player known mainly for portraying juveniles, evidently hesitated to take the role. His diffidence blends well with his shambling characterization and Ford\u2019s unhurried tempo. Not unlike the political humorist Will Rogers, who appeared in three films for Ford, Fonda\u2019s homespun Lincoln uses reason and humor \u2014 as well as knowledge of Scripture \u2014 to make his case. (The climactic trial is loosely based on the Duff Armstrong case in which Lincoln, then a defense attorney, made strategic use of an almanac to discredit a witness.) He also persuades by asserting his physical strength and even employs sleight of hand, cheating to win a Fourth of July tug of war.Ford\u2019s youthful Lincoln is already a monument. To that end, \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln\u201d practices a selective form of predestination. Lincoln\u2019s future bride, Mary Todd, and eventual political rival, Stephen Douglas, are both on hand and Ford shot a scene, cut from the movie by the producer Darryl F. Zanuck, in which the presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth passes through Springfield. Lincoln does single-handedly prevent two white men from being lynched, but issues of race and slavery never arise.A different Lincoln is invoked as an honest prairie reformer in \u201cThe Washington Masquerade,\u201d a 1932 MGM political melodrama (newly available from Warner Archive), in which Jeff Keane (Lionel Barrymore), a novice politician running a good-government campaign for the Senate is ballyhooed as \u201cthe new Abraham Lincoln.\u201dKeane is elected on a progressive platform to establish federal stewardship of the nation\u2019s natural resources. But once in Washington, he sinks into a morass of lobbyists, conspiracies and corruption, ultimately taking a bribe to resign his seat. In the congressional inquiry that follows Keane wrings his hands, summons Valley Forge, and apparently suffers a nervous breakdown while denouncing all politicians save for the current occupant of the White House (Herbert Hoover, then running for re-election with the support of MGM\u2019s boss, Louis B. Mayer), \u201cwhose heart is broken because we\u2019re traitors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holiday Retail Sales Soared, With Biggest Increase Since Recession", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShoppers came out in force during the holidays, driven by a strengthening economy, high consumer confidence and rebuilding efforts after a season of natural disasters across the country.It was the largest increase in holiday sales since the recession of 2008, exceeding the federation\u2019s forecast of $682 billion, or growth of about 4 percent.The trade group said the strong numbers showed that the retail industry might not be as fundamentally troubled as many analysts perceived it to be.\u201cWe knew going in that retailers were going to have a good holiday season, but the results are even better than anything we could have hoped for, especially given the misleading headlines of the past year,\u201d Matthew Shay, the president and chief executive of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement.His rosy assessment, however, followed a tough year for traditional retailers, who have been struggling to adjust their business models to meet consumer preferences. Companies have closed thousands of stores, laid off workers and offered deep discounts, as Amazon continues to capture a larger share of the market.Online sales continued to soar. According to an analysis by First Data, the payments company, holiday e-commerce sales increased 10.4 percent, compared with growth of 4.0 percent in brick and mortar sales.But at least some of that online growth was captured by traditional retailers that have been building their e-commerce operations.\u201cWe have to knock down this false choice between retail and online,\u201d Mr. Shay said in an interview. \u201cOnline is just a channel of retail.\u201dNatural disasters appeared to contribute to the strong sales, as homeowners began rebuilding after the hurricanes in Texas and Florida and wildfires in California. While much of the destruction occurred before the holiday shopping season, it most likely took time before insurance money and disaster aid began to find its way into consumers\u2019 pockets.The strongest holiday sales occurred in Houston, which had been pummeled by a Hurricane Harvey, First Data analysis showed.\u201cClearly that had an impact in boosting the retail numbers in the affected areas,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm.Sales at stores offering building materials and supplies increased 8.1 percent in November and December from a year earlier, while home-furnishings and furniture sales increased 7.5 percent, according the retail federation, which draws its data from the Census Bureau. Those two categories showed the biggest gains in sales, followed by electronics and appliance stores, at 6.7 percent.While the storm may have helped in some areas, retail sales showed strength across a broad range of categories, economists at Morgan Stanley pointed out in a research note on Friday, prompting the bank to increase its estimate for economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.Even categories that have struggled the most showed signs of improvement. Sales by general merchandisers \u2014 which include department stores \u2014 increased 4.3 percent in November and December from a year earlier.Large traditional retailers such as Macy\u2019s, Target and Kohl\u2019s have reported sales gains during the holidays that have helped lift their investors\u2019 confidence.\u201cWe intend to close the fourth quarter in a good position and head into 2018 with momentum,\u201d the chief executive of Macy\u2019s, Jeff Gennette, said in a statement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sundance, Steeped in Weinstein Mystique, Enters a New Era", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 \u201cResist! Persist! Insist! Elect!\u201dGloria Allred, the feminist lawyer, seemed exactly in her element on Saturday morning in this ski town as she led hundreds of Sundance Film Festival attendees at a Women\u2019s March rally. It was only 22 degrees, and heavy snow was swirling around her. But Ms. Allred charged forth, determined to keep the heat on Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and other powerful men accused of sexual harassment and assault.The moment neatly summed up an evolving Sundance.This is no longer Mr. Weinstein\u2019s freewheeling festival, the one he blasted into the public consciousness with eye-popping deals to bring male-gaze entries like \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d and \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d to theaters. Sundance is now a prime showcase for women \u2014 films directed, produced and written by women; films with female protagonists; special events focused on female empowerment. And most of the distribution deals involve TV sets.But most longtime attendees will tell you that the festival feels no different because the Weinstein Company, with its theater-focused business model, long ago ceded the Sundance marketplace to Netflix and Amazon. Last year, those two streaming services, both official Sundance sponsors, snapped up at least 14 movies, including spending $12 million for \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and $12.5 million for \u201cMudbound,\u201d accounting for more than a third of total festival acquisitions. The Weinstein Company bought nothing.Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, is now the person who reporters for Hollywood trade publications track through the snow.\u201cHarvey was a moment in time,\u201d Robert Redford, who founded Sundance, said at the festival\u2019s opening-day news conference on Thursday.\u201cNobody on the ground here ever gave him a crown,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cHe was just the loudest and the media followed and built him up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as big of a marketplace for finished films as it was in the \u201990s and early 2000s,\u201d said Mr. Bernard of Sony Pictures Classics. \u201cBut it\u2019s still an enormous marketplace for talent: Casting people looking for actors, producers looking for directors and cinematographers.\u201d (One example from recent years: After gaining attention at Sundance for quirky films like \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople,\u201d Taika Waititi went on to direct \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d for Disney.)This year\u2019s primary festival lineup \u2014 122 feature-length films culled from 3,901 submissions \u2014 includes many movies that examine race. \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d starring Daveed Diggs, best known for winning a Tony for \u201cHamilton,\u201d is a raucous, hip-hop-infused story of racism, stereotypes and gentrification. (Mr. Cooper, Sundance\u2019s director, called it \u201cfun, to the point of being sassy\u201d as he introduced it. Reviews are mixed.)Mr. Cooper drew a connection between filmmakers wrestling with race and the #OscarsSoWhite outcry in 2015 and 2016. \u201cIt usually takes about two years for topics to permeate,\u201d he said.Even so, women are front and center at this year\u2019s festival, noted Trevor Groth, Sundance\u2019s director of programming.The actresses Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Laura Dern, Carey Mulligan, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Kathryn Hahn, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Rose Byrne, Daisy Ridley, Blythe Danner, Hilary Swank and Kelly Macdonald all anchor films. And 45 movies were directed by women, including indie stalwarts like Tamara Jenkins and Debra Granik.\u201cIt\u2019s a really plentiful year for women,\u201d Mr. Groth said, \u201cwhich makes us enormously excited.\u201dAll the better to vanquish memories of Mr. Weinstein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Minor Act of Redistribution", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWalmart will raise its hourly rate for starting staff to $11 in the United States, the third upward move in three years. Assuming a 40-hour workweek, the $300 million increase the company expects in its wage bill would suggest fewer than one in 10 workers in the United States will benefit directly. Put another way, the raise is equivalent to just 0.3 percent of the company\u2019s sales and administration costs.Moreover, the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent means that Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, in theory, had room to give away much more. The company is forecast to make $20.3 billion of pretax profit in 2018. Around three-quarters of that comes from the United States, which suggests a tax savings of $2.1 billion. Factor in the one-off bonuses the company is paying to some staff, at a total cost of $400 million, and Walmart is giving back only around one-third of what it could save in taxes.In fairness, there are other demands on Walmart\u2019s tax windfall. Competition from rivals and the online behemoth Amazon are going to call for investment in stores and lower prices. On the same day the company trumpeted its pay rise, it revealed the closure of some members-only Sam\u2019s Club stores. So competitive is the market that Morgan Stanley reckons in most cases only 50 percent of what retailers save in tax will make it back to investors.The wonder, even so, is that Walmart did not do more. It said in 2016 that it was investing $2.7 billion in staff over two years, well before a tax cut and such a low jobless rate. Now that unemployment is at its lowest since 2000, the company would probably have needed to raise wages anyway. Neither tax nor benevolence has much to do with this minor act of redistribution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Companies Have Newfound Freedom \u2026 to Fire", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The announcements came in a steady drumbeat. Around 1,300 job cuts at France\u2019s biggest automaker. At least 2,500 at France\u2019s largest supermarket chain. Over 200 sought at a major clothing retailer. And thousands more are on the way.Just weeks after France\u2019s labor overhaul went into effect, companies are readily taking advantage of new rules that make it easier to hire and fire. But the other changes, those designed to help cushion the blow like retraining programs, haven\u2019t been put into place yet, leaving workers vulnerable to a coming wave of downsizing.Unemployment, persistently stuck at more than 9 percent for nearly a decade, could rise in the coming months. Unions, already dubious of the overhaul, may grow impatient if the government doesn\u2019t follow through on its promises to workers.\u201cRight now it\u2019s flexibility, and no security,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economics professor at the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cCompanies will do everything they can under the new law to maximize flexibility and facilitate the firing of people.\u201dPerceptions of France, long derided as a difficult place to do business for its onerous labor rules, are changing.Growth has recently picked up after being stagnant for nearly five years. And there are signs that the changes, a major piece of the president\u2019s economic program, are drawing the interest of investors.Amazon will open a new distribution center south of Paris this year, creating over 1,000 jobs. Facebook and Google announced Monday they would invest in artificial intelligence development in France. Also Monday, Toyota announced it would invest 300 million euros, or $367 million, to increase capacity at a plant in northern France, creating up to 700 jobs through 2020.\u201cThe complex labor laws have historically been the No. 1 obstacle to the competitiveness and attractiveness of France,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France, a business consulting firm. The changes, together with other business-friendly measures such as a gradual reduction in the corporate tax, have \u201cdrastically changed investor perceptions,\u201d he said.The transition, though, is off to a halting start.Mr. Macron wants to invest more than \u20ac15 million in programs to improve public and private retraining that have had only mixed success in recent years at ushering the jobless back into employment. Lawmakers won\u2019t vote on the measures until the spring, and any improvements are expected to take months, if not years, to bear fruit.That layoffs are being announced before this crucial part is done has fueled suspicion among organized labor. And while new jobs will eventually be created, many unions worry the changes are a ploy to strip away worker protections \u2014 and their own power. In the last several weeks, the country\u2019s most ardent trade organizations have vigorously opposed such plans, with differing results.The new rules tip the balance of power from workers to employers. Businesses have been reluctant to hire because it was difficult to shed workers. Employers have turned en masse to precarious short-term contracts to fill the gaps.Now, companies will be able to negotiate job cuts and restructurings through voluntary departures directly with labor representatives inside the business, rather than under strict industrywide collective bargaining agreements. Multinationals can downsize loss-making French operations more easily, even if the overall business is profitable. Companies will face less risk of legal action over dismissals, and can hire new staff immediately, rather than waiting.Pierre-Olivier Salmon, the head of corporate information at PSA Group, said the carmaker is looking to bring in a new generation of workers with the digital and programming skills needed to develop projects like electric cars and future technology for the automotive industry.Yet most of the positions affected in this round are white-collar posts, such as administrative assistants, communications personnel and those in research and development.That is seen as hardly a positive by some of France\u2019s unions. They are concerned that the outcome at PSA will be replicated by other companies seeking to shed protected workers, and at most bring in a new generation of cheap labor.The new measures may also have the effect of pitting labor groups against one another \u2014 a development that could work in Mr. Macron\u2019s favor.His union hailed last week\u2019s agreement at PSA, saying it was \u201cnot a danger for employees,\u201d but \u201can opportunity for those who want it.\u201dYet there is also little doubt that the restructuring will benefit PSA Group\u2019s bottom line: Incoming young workers won\u2019t be paid nearly as much as those heading out the door.\u201cThe main point is not to reduce costs,\u201d Mr. Salmon of PSA insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s to meet new challenges.\u201dWhatever the case, last week\u2019s announcements of job cuts will likely be followed by others, providing a test for Mr. Macron. He campaigned for the presidency with pledges to make France more dynamic, but not at the cost of unraveling its social welfare model.The challenge is not lost on his rivals.\u201cThis labor law allows big companies to fire more quickly and easily,\u201d Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, wrote on Twitter. Ms. Le Pen, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Macron last year in the presidential runoff, added: \u201cThe human dramas will multiply.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted a statement from Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the General Confederation of Labor. He said, in part, \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of employees with seniority,\u201d not \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of low-cost employees with seniority.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple\u2019s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple\u2019s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.\u201cThis is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn\u2019t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple\u2019s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.Patricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

In New York, the two major airports stopped flights and cars slid off glazed roads. And in Virginia, more than 40,000 residents and businesses lost power.The storm, called a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d by some meteorologists for how quickly the barometric pressure fell, created winds that topped 75 miles per hour in Nantucket and 65 miles per hour on Long Island, tearing the roof off a gas station and making some crossings impassable for trucks.As treacherous as it was, elected officials warned that the storm was a prelude to worse misery, with days of subzero wind chills ahead that could freeze snowy roads and put homeless people in grave danger.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could feel like minus-20 degrees on Friday and Saturday nights. There were eight inches of snow in Central Park and more than nine inches coating sections of Queens.\u201cThis is a serious, serious storm,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. \u201cWe expect tough conditions for days to come, particularly in terms of cold.\u201dAt the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, often one of the coldest and most treacherous places in New England during a storm, the wind chill was expected to plummet as low as minus-95 degrees on Friday night, \u201cwhich could cause frostbite in a matter of minutes,\u201d said Caleb Meute, a staff meteorologist at the Mount Washington Observatory.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency for Westchester, New York City and Long Island, and state officials imposed speed restrictions on some bridges and banned trucks on others because of high winds.Utility companies hurried to restore electricity to tens of thousands of homes and businesses up and down the East Coast. Several public housing developments in New York City lost heat and hot water.In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said, two men died when a pickup truck overturned in an icy creek in Moore County, and a third death was reported in Beaufort County.And in Savannah, Ga., which recorded its first snowfall in years this week, several cars of an Amtrak train carrying more than 300 people from Miami to New York derailed, though it was not clear whether the storm was a factor. Officials said there were no reports of injuries.New York City schools, closed on Thursday, were expected to reopen on Friday.But Boston was recovering more slowly. School was canceled on Friday. The tides there were the highest in nearly 40 years, and meteorologists were working to determine whether they exceeded the tides that came in with the Blizzard of 1978.Waters from the Massachusetts Bay poured into a subway station near the New England Aquarium and brought flooding to an unusually broad swath of the city, including the Seaport District, which is full of glassy new construction; Charlestown; the North End; Dorchester; and East Boston.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Martin J. Walsh, the mayor of Boston, calling the storm a reminder of the damage expected as climate change drives stronger storms. \u201cIf anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are.\u201dFirefighters rescued someone from a car trapped in water nearly up to its door handles, said Joseph Finn, the commissioner of the Boston Fire Department.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the water come this high in the downtown area,\u201d Commissioner Finn said. Firefighters inspected flooded buildings to see which ones could pose a fire risk and made a small number of additional rescues in coastal areas of the city, helping people out of stranded cars in the icy water.In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority deployed an arsenal of equipment to keep the Long Island Rail Road running through the storm: switch heaters, third-rail heaters and antifreeze trains. That was little comfort for Ralph Girardi, who pulled a cellphone from his backpack inside the waiting area of the Bellmore station on Thursday morning. He was not going to take any chances.\u201cI\u2019m just about to call my boss and tell him I am turning around,\u201d Mr. Girardi, 60, said. \u201cI just don\u2019t trust the trains. My concern is that I\u2019m not going to be able to get out of the city later in the day.\u201dCars were stranded on the Long Island Expressway and others skidded and slipped off the road as conditions deteriorated, Mr. Cuomo said, creating a \u201csignificant issue of public safety.\u201dIn New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency, the winter storm created whiteout conditions on roadways, shut schools, delayed trains and even held up legislation. Winds tore the roof off a gas station in Garfield, N.J., on Thursday afternoon.The State Senate and Assembly both postponed votes that had been scheduled to cram key legislation into the final days of the lame-duck legislature, including a vote on $5 billion in potential tax credits to help lure Amazon to the state.On Long Island, snow drifts piled up on every corner. Drivers crawled through a wall of white on roads littered with cars that had gotten stuck or had pulled over. Plows cleared roadways only for new gusts of snow to cover their handiwork.Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said plow operators were struggling with whiteout conditions. If forecasts for frigid temperatures hold true, he said, \u201cthat snow and ice is going to be frozen in place.\u201dThe shelves of some New York City grocery stores quickly emptied of milk, eggs and kale as New Yorkers stocked up for the storm, and grocers worried whether the next produce trucks would ever arrive.The streets were largely empty at the height of the storm, with workers outside hotels and apartment buildings shoveling snow and then, as more fell, shoveling again.Cars inched along roads in Queens, with a number of side streets still waiting to be plowed by the morning rush hour. Commuters kept their eyes to the ground, fearful of being battered by the horizontal snow.On the aboveground subway platform at Astoria Boulevard, riders hid behind signs and advertisements to avoid the whipping winds. But on a morning like Thursday, commuters brave enough to face the storm welcomed the unexpected: The subways, at least for the moment, seemed to be running on time.Ruth Bashinsky, Jessica Bidgood, Nick Corasaniti, Arielle Dollinger, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed, Lisa Foderaro, Patrick McGeehan, William Neuman, Sean Piccoli, Irene Plagianos, Katharine Q.

Many have not made a significant mark in theaters. The gay romance \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d for instance, has only taken in $9.1 million.And don\u2019t forget Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d with its nuanced mother-daughter relationship and self-confident central character. Ms. Gerwig received nominations for her original screenplay and became the fifth woman ever nominated for best director. \u201cLady Bird\u201d also received best actress (Saoirse Ronan) and supporting actress (Laurie Metcalf) nods.\u201cIt feels like something has shifted,\u201d a jubilant Ms. Gerwig said by phone, describing herself as \u201csomewhere in the middle between crying and laughing.\u201d She added: \u201cThe academy recognized a new generation \u2014 authors, filmmakers, actors, storytellers \u2014 in such a beautiful way.

{"Headline": "Intel Faces Scrutiny as Questions Swirl Over Chip Security", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Intel faces an even bigger test: two serious security issues with its chips that could have implications for nearly everyone touched by computing. And so far \u2014 in something of a repeat of the 1994 incident \u2014 Intel has failed to quiet critics, putting it in an awkward position this week as its chief executive prepares to take the stage at one of the world\u2019s biggest tech trade shows.\u201cIt is a very big deal, because it\u2019s an area people haven\u2019t looked at before,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \u201cEverybody is going to start now.\u201dIntel was privately informed of the issues by security researchers in June. The company, which has rejected doing a chip recall or other costly remedies, said it has quietly marshaled a coalition of software, hardware and cloud services to develop and deploy programming tweaks that are designed to close most of the security gaps. Intel and its partners said the fixes should be largely in place this week.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten much more mature in our ability to respond,\u201d said Steven L. Smith, an Intel vice president who was closely involved in the Pentium crisis and is now overseeing its handling of the new security issues.Adding to Intel\u2019s image challenges is that Mr. Krzanich sold about $39 million in Intel shares in late November, after the company learned of the chip security problems. A company spokesman said the sale had been unrelated to the security issues and followed a prearranged annual trading plan. Mr. Krzanich, who reduced his holdings by about 50 percent, \u201ccontinues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines,\u201d Intel said.Meltdown and Spectre were identified by a team at Google, with their work augmented by researchers from other organizations. Meltdown affects only Intel chips. Spectre also affects chip designs from companies such Advanced Micro Devices and ARM Holdings, whose technology is used in most smartphones.Intel, largely by virtue of its success, has the most at stake. While the Pentium chip underpinned most PCs running Microsoft operating systems in 1994, Intel processors are now also used in all Apple Macintosh systems and more than 95 percent of the chips used by cloud services and data centers run by corporations. Its technological reach means that both Meltdown and Spectre could affect just about anyone who uses the internet.\u201cWe created a microprocessor monoculture,\u201d said Bryan Cantrill, chief technology officer at Joyent, a cloud service owned by Samsung. \u201cThere are dangers associated with that.\u201dIntel\u2019s situation is complicated by history and semantics. The Pentium problem was caused by a design error. But Meltdown and Spectre attacks exploit a common speed-boosting technique in chips called speculative execution that Intel\u2019s Mr. Smith insisted is working as it should. That approach to chip design emerged before researchers developed new ways to spy on such internal operations, using what they call \u201cside-channel\u201d analysis, Mr. Smith said.As a result, the security issues that were discovered were not flaws or bugs, he said. The features that hackers could exploit are a bit like a door or window in a house, which burglars can exploit but that builders would not consider leaving out.That hasn\u2019t stopped an uproar from security researchers and tech industry executives. One widely distributed barb came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, who posted a testy message last week advising Intel to \u201ctake a long hard look\u201d at its chips \u201cand actually admit that they have issues instead of writing P.R. blurbs that say that everything works as designed.\u201dMajor users of Intel chips \u2014 including Apple and the cloud computing arms of Google and Amazon \u2014 have said they deployed security fixes recommended by Intel and so far they have not reported the sharp performance slowdowns of the sort some experts projected.Many security professionals said they accepted the argument. \u201cThis is not a simple \u2018we found a bug, here\u2019s a patch and we are done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schneier said.Whether Intel\u2019s actions to address Meltdown and Spectre will be enough for the company to sidestep a sizable financial hit is unclear. At least one lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against Intel, and some industry executives expect more litigation to come. At a minimum, Intel engineers working on future microprocessors now face the additional labor of trying to make them less susceptible to the new kinds of attacks.Using the software fixes, \u201cwe already have the security improvement that we are seeking to get,\u201d Mr. Smith said. But making internal changes to the chips could handle those changes more efficiently, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Drones and Netflix in the Andes, but Sidestepping Google Maps", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief for The Times, based in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What are some of the most important tech tools you have relied on as our reporter covering parts of South America? Lately we\u2019ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with drones here, and not just for filming.It was no surprise to us, either, that drone technology was something that had never made it to the village we were working in. So the \u201cflying camera\u201d was quite an attraction when we arrived at our destination.What about the tools that you use could be better?Google Maps, for one. I mainly work in the Andes, and most anyone who lives in mountains can tell you that the shortest distance between two points isn\u2019t necessarily the route that you want to take. However, Google doesn\u2019t use local knowledge to calculate directions.Recently at a dinner party in La Paz, Bolivia, a friend told me about heading out of the canyon where the capital dwellers live and up to a concert on the plateau that sits above the city. The route his phone had calculated was on a dirt road that went straight up on a 45-degree angle that people generally walked or went up by mule.It reminded me of the stories that every correspondent had about using Google or Waze when I used to cover Israel and the Palestinian territories. Your phone would regularly take you in and out of each as if there weren\u2019t a conflict going on, through military checkpoints and down roads that often ended in a wall put up 10 years before. Even if impassable, it was always the shortest route, Google assured.A correspondent there warned me before I arrived to bring a Kindle \u2014 books were sometimes easier to download than to buy in Caracas, especially best-sellers or anything in English. You also lived in fear of losing things as basic and easy to get as a power cord. Venezuela is a country where people are having trouble finding tires when they get holes in them on the road, let alone Apple products. It is very unfortunate.It\u2019s not uncommon for Venezuelans to come back with a duffel bag filled with just the basics that aren\u2019t for sale in stores anymore: toilet paper, dish detergent, shampoo, sponges. It would get to the point where you were also adding phone chargers, batteries, USB cables, internet routers and anything else you could imagine that plugged into the wall.How has internet connectivity been in the Andes countries, and how do locals use apps or websites like Facebook or Twitter? How do governments use tech for surveillance in those places?That\u2019s a question everyone would like to know. Venezuelan spying can be surprisingly low-tech at times \u2014 opposition politicians regularly turn on the television to hear embarrassing conversations of their telephone calls being aired to the public. It seems a bit of a throwback to the Soviet Union in some ways, rather than Pegasus and the other recent spyware that governments usually reach for.It\u2019s effective, though. Many conversations just don\u2019t happen over the phone, and we find another place to communicate where there\u2019s encryption, like Telegram.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Netflix. There seem to be 10 times more offerings in Latin America than the United States, including many movies that are blocked back home and that I can only rent on iTunes. I would urge anyone who wants to spend days watching good films not available in America to set his or her VPN to Colombia and have a look.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa, What Happened to My Car?", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAmazon\u2019s Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant is the Chatty Cathy of the tech world, a digital darling that consumers can\u2019t get enough of. It can tell chicken jokes, order pizza and turn off the kitchen faucet. So it\u2019s not surprising that Alexa has made the leap from the home to the car.But just as Alexa promises added hands-free convenience for drivers, researchers and engineers warn that it also opens new avenues for hacking, tracking and sonic attacks. Depending on how voice-activated assistants are connected, such hacks could range from annoying pranks like opening a car\u2019s windows in the rain to dangerous attacks like remotely unlocking a house\u2019s doors for a robbery.\u201cAs we make everything smarter and more connected,\u201d said Nadir Izrael, chief technology officer of the internet security firm Armis, \u201cwe end up creating a huge attack surface on devices, like cars, that weren\u2019t intended.\u201dCars are a highly lucrative target, said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer at Argus Cyber Security, which the automotive systems supplier Continental recently acquired. \u201cPeople are inside these vehicles moving at high speeds, and cars cost a significant amount of money. So how many Bitcoins would you pay a ransomware hacker?\u201dBut in those cases, voice commands are limited. They can\u2019t remotely start a car or open its windows. Siri can\u2019t even change the radio station.Alexa, on the other hand, is intended \u2014 via specific, preprogrammed commands \u2014 to interact with thousands of connected devices, performing tasks like turning on lights, opening door locks, disabling home security systems or even ordering a year\u2019s supply of toilet paper. And it\u2019s already connecting living rooms to cars.Automakers ranging from BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Nissan to start-ups like Byton have tapped into Alexa\u2019s appeal. Although voice assistants are increasingly becoming intertwined with new models, including those from Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, most current Alexa car skills are strictly one-way, from the home to the car, and use existing automotive smartphone applications.\u201cAlexa piggybacks on our app,\u201d said Denise Barfuss, a senior manager for connected services at Nissan. \u201cSo if it\u2019s 25 degrees outside, you can just tell Alexa to start the car\u201d from inside your house to warm it up, she said.Simple Alexa commands can flash the lights or honk the horn, Ms. Barfuss said, but remote instructions that alter the state of the car \u2014 such as locking the doors and starting the engine \u2014 also require a spoken PIN code.And even though voice bots like Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant can be taught to recognize different voices \u2014 well enough to cater to each family member\u2019s favored Pandora stations, for example \u2014 they do not offer any sort of biometric security, such as voice print analysis. As a result, Alexa\u2019s voice-recognition capabilities are not discerning enough for security purposes, according to Amazon. (A company spokesman noted, however, that Amazon had special teams dedicated to continually reviewing and updating the security of its software.)Without such measures, anyone who eavesdropped on a spoken PIN command could use it to unlock and get into a vehicle, leaving a victim to ask, \u201cAlexa, what happened to my car?\u201dSecurity experts are also concerned about more sophisticated cyberattacks involving voice assistants.\u201cThere are synthetic voice sound clips,\u201d said Gang Wang, assistant professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering. \u201cIt sounds like random noise to us, but to the machine it sounds like a specific command.\u201d So a seemingly innocuous sound, like an explosion in a YouTube video played on a nearby TV or tablet, could contain secret instructions.Other hacks have included ultrasonic commands that are beyond the range of human hearing but understood by voice bots. And even if they do establish biometric security features, Mr. Wang said, regenerative machine learning could use a recording of a person\u2019s voice to synthesize new commands that could fool them.The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company\u2019s Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase.Such convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford\u2019s supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel.Ford\u2019s setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn\u2019t automatically be able to unlock a home\u2019s front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner\u2019s smartphone (which they\u2019d have to steal, too).Adding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly.\u201cWhat gets added with the car is your specific location,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cYou can track where the car goes and at what times.\u201dIf compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user\u2019s purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon\u2019s servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system\u2019s \u2014 and the car\u2019s \u2014 security vulnerabilities.Ultimately, the car will simply understand when it\u2019s being spoken to.\u201cPeople will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,\u201d said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. \u201cSo security is going to have to continue to evolve with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
