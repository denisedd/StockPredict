{"Headline": "Review: With \u2018False Flag,\u2019 Israel Exports Another Fine Thriller", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show plunges into action, with breathless TV reports that five Israeli citizens, presumably undercover Mossad agents, have been caught on video kidnapping an Iranian government minister from his Moscow hotel room. The suspects \u2014 including a chemist, a preschool teacher and a bride on her wedding day \u2014 watch the fuzzy footage in disbelief and insist they weren\u2019t in Russia and have no idea what\u2019s going on.The English title points to the truth that the plot dances with briefly but fairly quickly gives up: The five (or most of them, anyway) are indeed being framed. The show\u2019s salient questions, answered over eight fast-paced, highly entertaining episodes, are by whom and for what purpose?\u201cFalse Flag,\u201d created by Maria Feldman and Amit Cohen and written by Mr. Cohen, takes that scenario and fully exploits its melodramatic possibilities. The five may not be guilty of kidnapping but they\u2019re all guilty of something \u2014 an affair, a hidden criminal past, an insatiable appetite for attention \u2014 that complicates their attempts to prove their innocence and provides the show with five mysteries for the price of one.Like those predecessors, \u201cFalse Flag\u201d is less fancy and more naturalistic than its American counterparts, with a dry humor and a low-key efficiency in generating suspense. The tension is maintained through constant movement and the clash of personalities rather than bloodshed \u2014 there\u2019s violence, but the body count is lower than it would be in an American series, at least until an awkwardly handled shootout in the finale. (That scene is part of the heavy-handed setup for a second season that hasn\u2019t yet been made; the first season was shown in Israel in 2015.)As for the story, the United States doesn\u2019t figure at all, except for one throwaway line that answers an obvious question and sums up a worldview. \u201cThe kidnappers did a clean job,\u201d a Mossad operative says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stolen Vodka Bottle, Said to Be Worth $1.3 Million, Is Found Drained and Dented", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 It was meant to be a collector\u2019s secret, but someone knew the secret, stole the secret and, it seems, drank the secret: what the owner calls \u201cthe most expensive vodka bottle in the world.\u201dThe bottle was created by Dartz Motorz, a car manufacturer in Riga, Latvia, and fitted with an original 1912 leather ribbon from the company\u2019s first Monte Carlo rally car.The bottle is made of 6.6 pounds of gold and the equivalent amount of silver and has a diamond-encrusted cap fashioned to resemble a vintage car front.It had been borrowed and placed in a pub, Cafe 33, in central Copenhagen amid a collection of fine spirits assembled by Brian Ingberg, the bar\u2019s owner.The bottle was worth $1.3 million, according to the owner. The vodka: Russian.During the show, the bottle was said to be worth $750,000.On Tuesday, a masked thief sneaked into Cafe 33 with a flashlight, poked around and absconded with the bottle from Mr. Ingberg\u2019s collection of vodkas gathered over a quarter-century.The theft made headlines the world over. \u201cThe bottle used to be a secret,\u201d Mr. Ingberg lamented, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t any more.\u201dAnd empty.The vessel was found at the entrance to a building site in Charlottenlund, an affluent district north of the Danish capital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the thief got cold feet,\u201d Mr. Ingberg said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cHe placed it there because he wanted it to be found.\u201dThe Copenhagen police said in a Twitter post that the bottle was being examined for any leads and that no further information on the case would be released.Shortly before the vessel was found, Mr. Ingberg said he had been contacted by a man who said that he knew who had the bottle and that the thief wanted to return it to the collector.\u201cI got the feeling that he felt he was in trouble because of the police and Leon in Russia wanting to send people out to look for it,\u201d Mr. Ingberg said, referring to Leonard F. Yankelovich, Dartz\u2019s founder and the actual owner of the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most fun item to possess.\u201d\u201cHe said he felt this was the right place for the bottle to be,\u201d Mr. Ingberg said, adding that the bottle, more than its contents, was the reason for the theft\u2019s global headlines.\u201cI thought it was a New Year\u2019s joke, but it was not a joke,\u201d Mr. Yankelovich said on Saturday. But he said he had a strong feeling the bottle would come back: \u201cI trust the god of vodka.\u201dHe said the bottle had been made two to three years ago, and the price \u2014 what he called \u201cthe bottle\u2019s historical value\u201d \u2014 was based on the expensive materials used. \u201cIt is the most expensive vodka bottle in the world,\u201d he maintained, adding that other images of vodka bottles online claiming to be more expensive were fake.Mr. Ingberg described the vodka, made with melted snow from the French Alps, as \u201cvery tasty\u201d and \u201csmooth and round,\u201d but added, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to attribute a taste to wheat-based vodka.\u201dThe bottle\u2019s location in Copenhagen was known to only a few people, he said. But since the thief had a key, he suspects a copy had been made from an employee\u2019s key.But what about the contents of the lost-and-found bottle?\u201cLeon,\u201d he said, \u201chas promised to fill the bottle again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dave Chappelle Stumbles Into the #MeToo Moment", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyIn \u201cThe Bird Revelation,\u201d the first comedy special to focus on the #MeToo movement, Dave Chappelle, sitting on a stool at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles in November, pauses to give advice to some comedians in the back. \u201cYou have a responsibility to speak recklessly,\u201d he says.In that special and a second one, \u201cEquanimity,\u201d both released on Sunday by Netflix, he makes a show of hesitating before wading into controversial territory. It\u2019s an old tactic of his, building suspense by suggesting he is about to say something taboo. But it\u2019s worth asking: Just how reckless is Dave Chappelle being these days?Judging by Mr. Chappelle\u2019s stand-up output, however, there are few subjects he is more drawn to than the sexual misbehavior of famous men. He has joked about R. Kelly, Ray Rice, Michael Jackson, Nate Parker and Bill Cosby. Mr. Chappelle\u2019s approach varies, but generally speaking, he denounces the actions and minimizes or mitigates them. (\u201cHow old is 15, really?\u201d he asks in reference to Mr. Kelly\u2019s alleged misconduct.) These bits often have the feel of someone digging a hole to prove he can escape, but in this new special, for the first time, they also seem like tired shtick.Taking long pauses, sounding confessional without being so, Mr. Chappelle performs introspection while resorting to the same old tricks. They appear more clearly here than in the past because the set is so raw and unpolished. Mr. Chappelle didn\u2019t have months to refine his material, smooth his transitions, build the act.\u201cThe Bird Revelation\u201d is one of four specials he released in 2017, and in another of those, \u201cThe Age of Spin,\u201d he brings up a rumor that Bill Cosby paid for the microphone that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. used in his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. It was Mr. Chappelle\u2019s way of expressing how hard it is to give up the comic as one of his heroes. In \u201cBird,\u201d he again leans on the gravitas of King to pivot from the pain caused by sexual misconduct. Mr. Chappelle criticizes the \u201cbrittle spirit\u201d of the female comic who said Louis C.K. masturbating in front of her hurt her career, before imagining what would happen if Louis C.K. masturbated in front of the civil rights leader, prompting him to give up his movement.Mr. Chappelle opens this special by noting that sometimes the funniest thing to say is mean, and he\u2019s right. Comedy, to quote Steve Martin, is not pretty. But when Mr. Chappelle says some of the sexual assault victims speaking out are now experiencing \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d a particularly cruel turn of phrase, this is surely not the funniest thing he can think of. And it is expressed with as little empathy as possible.Much of his 2017 comedy had a professorial tone, weaving long pocket histories into his act. But in this paradigm-shifting moment, when victims are speaking out and revealing secrets long buried, Mr. Chappelle is ignoring the historical context, the systemic barriers preventing women from speaking up about abuse or succeeding in comedy. It\u2019s perhaps why an audience member off screen balks at one joke, to which he responds: \u201cI know you\u2019re right, baby. I was right once. Remember that?\u201dIn an abrupt pivot, he ends this unusually topical special by asking audience members if they want to know the real reason he left \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d a mystery that lost its urgency years ago and suggests a comic nostalgic for old glories. In a funny bit of self-awareness, Mr. Chappelle says he never wanted to be a hero but, rather like Paul Revere, to be known for a single heroic act.\u201cPaul Revere\u2019s ride was only one night, then 40 years of him being like: Remember that time when everyone was asleep and I was up, and the British was coming?\u201d Mr. Chappelle says, pausing. \u201cBoy, good thing I was awake.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What a $4,000 Treadmill Means for the Future of Gadgets", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe home fitness start-up Peloton might sound faddish, like another in the parade of bougie tech-lifestyle brands selling dubious-sounding \u201cdisruption!\u201d at millionaire prices. Its first product \u2014 an internet-connected, brushed-steel spin bicycle equipped with a 22-inch touch-screen \u2014 sells for $2,000, and you still have to pay $39 a month to get any content to fill the screen.Any company that wants to sell a $4,000 treadmill is obviously aiming for a high-flying audience. But before you click away in proletarian disgust, there is something deeper worth studying about Peloton, its fanatical fan base and what its unusual path to success might portend for the future of the gadget business.Peloton does not sell just a simple piece of hardware. Instead, the company spent tens of millions of dollars creating an inviting experience, complete with brand-ambassador celebrities and high-end retail locations. At the core of its business is a beguiling online service: Get on the bike, turn on the screen, and you are instantly connected with live fitness classes tailored to your preferences and athletic abilities. It\u2019s like having a personal trainer who comes to your house whenever you like.\u201cWe\u2019ve created an experience that people just love so deeply,\u201d said John Foley, Peloton\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.Peloton \u2014 which has raised nearly $450 million from several investors, including Wellington Management and Fidelity, at a valuation of $1.25 billion \u2014 surely faces hurdles in selling the Tread. The company plans to sell the treadmill on an installment plan, with a monthly price of $149, which makes it comparable to a high-end gym membership \u2014 and still pretty rich for many people. Peloton\u2019s treadmill is also bigger and louder than the bike, which might make it less palatable to apartment dwellers.And marketing the device could be tough. The company says the Tread is best suited for offering full-body \u201cboot camp\u201d-style exercises that you might do at a gym. That is, it\u2019s not just for running \u2014 which is an odd line to push about a treadmill.Yet consider how Peloton revolutionized the spin bike. People have been trying to reinvent home fitness machines forever. But from the NordicTrack to the Bowflex, most of these devices suffered the same fatal flaw \u2014 the novelty wore off, the guilt piled up, and soon you ended up with a very expensive laundry rack.Peloton solves the novelty problem in the same way Netflix does: It creates can\u2019t-miss programming. Its classes, which are streamed from a studio in Manhattan, faithfully recreate the moody, devotional atmospherics of a boutique spin class. The experience is communal and interactive \u2014 as you ride, you can see how you stack up against others in the class.\u201cWhen you have the endorphins flowing and you\u2019re in people\u2019s homes three to seven times a week, there\u2019s a real familiarity that builds up \u2014 and so, yeah, it\u2019s a little interesting when people stop me at the supermarket to say hi,\u201d said Robin Arzon, Peloton\u2019s vice president for fitness programming and its chief instructor.If this sounds over-the-top, you\u2019re right: The Peloton cult is real.That annoying friend who can\u2019t shut up about how SoulCycle is her church? Peloton groupies are kind of like that, only more insistent, because they also point out how convenient it is \u2014 you can Peloton at any time without prebooking, without commuting, in any clothes you want. They are also likely to argue they are saving money, too: If you ride three times a week for a year, you\u2019ll pay about $16 per Peloton workout in your first year, cheaper than classes at many fitness studios.\u201cOver 95 percent of the bikes we\u2019ve ever sold are still paying subscriptions,\u201d Mr. Foley said.And here\u2019s a confession: I\u2019m one of them. After hearing three different people in the tech industry sing the bike\u2019s praises last summer, I asked Peloton to send me a bike to review to see what the fuss was about. After three weeks, I couldn\u2019t give it up. I called up the company and handed over my credit card number. I\u2019ve been a committed rider ever since.The one problem with the spin bike is that it does not offer a complete workout. Spinning is by nature a lower-body, cardio-heavy exercise, but there is a far larger audience of people who want a full-body workout that combines weight training and cardio.This is the animating idea behind Peloton Tread.\u201cWe think only about half the workout will happen on the treadmill,\u201d Mr. Foley said. \u201cYou\u2019ll start with some jogging, perhaps sprints, then get off the treadmill, do curls, push-ups, planks, then get on the treadmill and start the cycle again. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have spent 40 minutes there and burned 700 calories, and every part of your body will feel energized.\u201dI stopped by Peloton\u2019s New York offices several times last fall to check on the development of the treadmill, which departs from tradition in several ways.Most treadmills are controlled with small buttons that are difficult to press while running at high speed. Peloton\u2019s uses two big knobs that look like the resistance knob on its bike \u2014 a control mechanism that doesn\u2019t require any close fiddling. The company also spent many months engineering the treadmill\u2019s running deck. Unlike most other treadmills, whose track effectively pauses each time you step on it, Peloton\u2019s uses a series of slats that sit on ball bearings \u2014 a mechanism that creates a springy, \u201cfrictionless\u201d track that it says offers a more comfortable run.I can\u2019t tell you if this amounts to a significantly better treadmill. The device is still only a near-final prototype, and it will be months before the company begins creating workouts.But remember, in the Peloton story, the gadget itself isn\u2019t as important as the service. Peloton\u2019s treadmill will be powered by the same irresistible content-machine that powers its bike. For many who are already in the growing club, that alone might be enough of a reason to commit to it.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the touch-screen on Peloton\u2019s spin bicycle. It is 22 inches, not 20.Advertisement"}

The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work.

{"Headline": "Medieval Times Goes Modern, Replacing Its Kings With Queens", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lerner\u2019s drive to work takes about seven minutes in her used Nissan Sentra which, like her condominium, she never would have been able to afford if she hadn\u2019t gotten lucky and landed what for now is her dream job.She works in a replica of an 11th-century castle off the Stemmons Freeway north of downtown. It can pack in 1,000 people who pay $60.95 (less for children or anyone with a coupon) to put on paper crowns, slide behind long counters and tear apart chicken with their hands while watching a low-tech, two-hour drama that wraps elements of professional wrestling inside a Renaissance fair.As the fog from dry ice floated out over the arena\u2019s sand pit and waiters set slabs of spongy garlic bread in front of the audience, Ms. Lerner adjusted her gold cape and rode out on an Andalusian stallion bred especially for the show. She was Do\u00f1a Maria Isabella, the sole ruler of a kingdom filled with battling knights.For the 34 years Medieval Times has been in business, that monarch has been a man. But the show, which draws an estimated 2.5 million customers each year, is replacing all of its kings with queens. And its peculiar brand of dinner theater \u2014 a sort of G-rated \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 is taking on an unlikely resonance amid the national jousting over gender equality provoked by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements.In the show\u2019s old plot, the king had to fight off a challenger from another realm using a knight who bested five others in a tournament. In the new script, the queen has taken over for her late father (presumably the king from the previous show). She presides over a tournament to find the best knight in the land; drama ensues when a knight who has been acting dishonorably challenges her authority.\u201cThe fact that a woman is sitting on the throne in our show at the same time the gender equality movement hit is a coincidence,\u201d he said. Mr. Cordner was simply responding to audience members who kept asking why women played nothing but princesses. (On the other hand, the show still refers to its waitresses as wenches.)The joust-and-eat prototype for Medieval Times was created in 1973 by an entrepreneur who wanted to capture the tourist trade in Majorca, Spain. Since the American version began in Orlando, Fla., in 1983, almost 66 million people have attended.Here in Dallas, the production runs Thursday through Sunday; on a busy Saturday, they\u2019ll run three shows, and go practically nonstop for the nine days during spring break.\u201cShe ate everything,\u201d said Gretchen Midkiff, the Dallas marketing and sales manager.A different queen was on the throne that night. Ms. Lerner, 27, shares the role with three other actors, including Quinn Coffman, 23, a close friend who was her roommate until Ms. Lerner saved enough money to rent the condo.Both see larger implications in their coronation. \u201cIf it can help empower women and we can be role models for these young women and men and show you need to respect women, then it is very fortuitous timing,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cIt gives you the chills.\u201dBut on a recent Sunday evening in the lobby of the Dallas castle, the #MeToo movement hadn\u2019t shown up. As guests wandered around with $17 souvenir schooners of beer and watched Ms. Lerner perform some preperformance knighting ($20 extra), questions about the social significance of the new show were largely met with blank stares.One Australian tourist allowed that it was a clever idea, but many audience members said they had no inkling \u2014 or didn\u2019t care \u2014 that the show had changed.By the time the performance ended, John Freeman, 38, had formed an opinion. He didn\u2019t like it one bit. He was there celebrating his sister\u2019s birthday. It was the family\u2019s fifth visit.\u201cThe king gives it a more powerful feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just feel the emotions better.\u201dHis son, John Jr., who is 16, said he was mainly there to watch the knights fight. His daughter, Miakoda, 13, just shrugged.His wife, Stacey Freeman, 34, thought the queen freshened things up. \u201cIn my everyday life, I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m treated any different than a man,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know it happens.\u201dMs. Freeman was more concerned when a reporter mentioned that Medieval Times is thinking of tinkering with the menu, which is exactly the same at every castle.Women in corsets and skirts, and men in tights and tunics (called serfs) pour every guest a metal bowl of tomato soup that tastes like Campbell\u2019s slightly more sophisticated sister. Next they hustle through their stations serving 24-ounce roasted chicken halves from deep sheet pans.Then come stubby ears of corn steamed with soy butter, sugar, paprika and a little cayenne pepper, and large russet potatoes, each cut in half and roasted in oil with a host of spices that include garlic powder.\u201cJust do not change the food,\u201d Ms. Freeman implored. \u201cDo not take my corn away. I love that corn.\u201dFrank Dameron, 60, is the director of food service for the company, which is headquartered in nearby Irving. He lost his job as chef for a hotel chain during the last recession. Medieval Times was a life saver.Even though the menu is formulaic, Mr. Dameron tries to innovate. Before the show, he was in the kitchen working on a recipe for roasted carrot and zucchini sticks. Guests aren\u2019t given cutlery, so every dish has to be easy to pick up with fingers. There is no saut\u00e9 station. Everything is cooked in ovens so big you could walk into them.Dessert is another potential area for experimentation. Everyone gets a slice of lemon poundcake, which arrives at the castle frozen, in cardboard boxes. Could they make the course in-house? Mr. Dameron is pondering a chocolate crepe.The menu has changed before. Cornish game hens were the original entree, but guests balked at how bony they were. The company has added some optional vegan dishes, a three-bean stew and hummus; it dropped the pork ribs after diners complained that the meal was too protein-heavy or had religious objections. Besides, the ribs were a bit of a pain: The racks varied too much in size.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be sitting next to somebody who\u2019s getting something bigger than you,\u201d Mr. Dameron said.The food is popular with the staff. If there are leftovers, crew members eat chicken on benches in the locker room or walk out with foil-lined bags containing the complete meal, minus the soup and cake.Ms. Lerner is allowed to eat while perched on her throne during the show, since the story line is built around a banquet. But on this night she was already full. She has been experimenting with a paleo diet, and had eaten some spaghetti squash with tomato sauce and garlic she made in her slow cooker.In the stables, a knight, Kyle Calloway, 24, was making do with a coffee-flavored Monster energy drink as he warmed up for his star turn.The switch to a queen hasn\u2019t made much difference, he said, except in the part of the show when she rebukes the sexist knight who defies her.\u201cYou do get a huge reaction from the females in the crowd,\u201d Mr. Calloway said. But he doesn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it. \u201cAll I do is eat, sleep, joust, repeat.\u201dAfter the show, Ms. Lerner drank some water, took off her microphone and found her Sharpie. She had to make one more trip to lobby to sign autographs and perform any last-minute knighting ceremonies in the same formal, vaguely English accent all the actors are encouraged to use.She gets paid by the hour, and doesn\u2019t mind having to do her own makeup at a sink near the toilet stalls in the locker room or to work the lobby before and after the performance. It\u2019s show business, and she has loved it as long as she can remember.Instead of attending a high school, she was home schooled so she could dedicate herself to acting and writing music. Her first credit was as a mean girl on \u201cThe Bernie Mac Show.\u201dThen her dad died of lung cancer. She was 18. Her career faltered. \u201cI just collapsed,\u201d she said.She had to get out of town. Friends had moved to Dallas. Why not join them?Ms. Lerner got a job as the manager of a gelato shop. Then she enrolled in acting school, and landed roles in some well-received local productions. She worked princess parties for kids. (She still teaches vocal technique and acting to children.)A year and a half ago, she saw a notice on a school bulletin board for a princess job at Medieval Times. She was hired in an instant.There weren\u2019t many guests left in the lobby on this night, so her shift ended early. She handed her dress and cloak to the woman in charge of cleaning costumes and pulled on an oversize Walmart T-shirt printed with an American flag superimposed over a white tiger.When she heard that some audience members didn\u2019t seem to grasp the larger social significance of replacing the king with a queen \u2014 and that some even wanted the king back \u2014 she seemed slightly crestfallen.\u201cWell, at least a seed has been planted,\u201d she said.Ms. Lerner grabbed the Medieval Times umbrella that management gave her as a holiday gift, punched out and said good night to the operations manager camped at a desk near the back door. She walked out into the damp Dallas night, a foil-lined bag of chicken and vegetables in her hand.Hoppy Joe was waiting.Advertisement"}

Dick laid down themes for decades of science fiction (and non-science fiction). As technology perfects virtual experiences, what does \u201creal\u201d mean? Is an original necessarily more authentic than its simulacrum?But this license and talent, plus the lavish scale of production, add up to little that feels freshly imagined or newly provocative.The alt-worlds in \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d \u2014 each episode has a different writer and director \u2014 range from the quasi-present to millenniums hence. But mostly, they play with familiar ideas in conventional high-tech settings: They\u2019re futures that seem oddly dated.The season opener, \u201cReal Life,\u201d written by the executive producer Ronald D. Moore (\u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d), has a quintessential Dick theme: A businessman (Terrence Howard) and a policewoman (Ms. Paquin) share a consciousness while leading separate lives \u2014 or are they separate? \u2014 in two different planes of reality. Which one is real, and which virtual? We\u2019ve seen numerous versions of that ontological shell game, and this one has no new moves.\u201cHuman Is,\u201d with Mr. Cranston as a sour military commander who is replaced by a more personable alien body-snatcher, moves double-time to an unsurprising conclusion. \u201cCrazy Diamond,\u201d starring Steve Buscemi, is a nigh-incomprehensible clearance sale of dystopian premises \u2014 human-animal chimeras, extreme climate change, consumerism as a tool of oppression.The advantage of a streaming anthology, though, is that you can simply skip to the good stuff. \u201cImpossible Planet,\u201d about an elderly woman booking a space cruise to visit a dead Earth, is moving if a smidge sentimental. In the noir \u201cThe Hood Maker,\u201d a detective (Richard Madden, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) partners with a telepath (Holliday Grainger) in an alt-reality where psychics serve the function of computers.

{"Headline": "Big Tech to Join Legal Fight Against Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its announcement, the group, the Internet Association, made clear for the first time that Facebook, Google, Netflix and other large tech firms would put their reputations and financial clout behind the challenge.Lawsuits seeking to block the commission\u2019s new policy, which was approved in December, are expected in the weeks ahead, once the rules take effect. The rules will let internet service providers block online content, or charge websites for faster delivery to consumers, by rolling back the protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.\u201cThe rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d Michael Beckerman, the association\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday.Netflix, whose data-heavy video streams could face extra charges by internet service providers, also said it would support a legal challenge.The issue of regulating internet service providers to maintain an open internet has wound through the courts and the commission for more than a decade. The repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, attracted strong opposition.Mr. Pai has said the new rules would encourage more investment and innovation by internet service providers. He has also argued that the change would withstand any legal challenge, as it essentially restores the rules to what they were before 2015.The commission declined to comment on Friday.Democratic lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the commission\u2019s action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous bills that could replace the agency\u2019s rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States lawmakers in California, New York and Washington are also considering bills that would recreate the 2015 net- neutrality rules in those states.Public interest groups are trying to make net neutrality an issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections. They have deployed text and email campaigns meant to pressure lawmakers to support a congressional reversal of the commission\u2019s action.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going to court soon to challenge the F.C.C. and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had \u201cawakened the public.\u201dThe strong response to the repeal has also led to some safety concerns. At the commission meeting where the new rules were approved, law enforcement officials briefly cleared the room to address an unspecified security issue.Mr. Pai canceled a scheduled appearance at the tech industry\u2019s CES trade show next week.

{"Headline": "TV Content Wars: Too Many Characters Chasing Not Enough Action", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC.That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle \u2014 and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2014 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murdoch\u2019s Bid for Full Control of Sky Is Dealt a Blow by U.K. Regulator", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Murdoch has made multiple attempts to acquire the part of Sky not already under his control, only to find himself thwarted by a phone-hacking scandal and the British authorities.The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said that Mr. Murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, would have too much control over Britain\u2019s media landscape if the deal for Sky were to go through. For that reason, it described the proposed $16.3 billion transaction as \u201cnot in the public interest.\u201dThe deal\u2019s fate is now in the hands of Britain\u2019s culture minister, Matt Hancock, who must rule by May 1 on whether to let the Murdoch deal proceed.For Mr. Murdoch, 86, the deal for complete control of Sky was part legacy-building, part competitive defense.Since starting the satellite broadcaster in 1989, he has become all too familiar with the regulatory issues affecting media markets across Europe. His latest attempt to acquire all of Sky was part of a push to burnish his company\u2019s global reach.The acquisition would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network, and broadcast rights for lucrative content like Premier League soccer matches in England and other European leagues\u2019 games.In moving to buy the rest of Sky, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company was also seeking to add muscle to compete against digital rivals like Amazon, Apple and Netflix.Full control of Sky would give 21st Century Fox not only a vast satellite network but also Now TV, the satellite broadcaster\u2019s online streaming service. Now TV is a minnow compared with behemoths like Netflix, which added more subscribers last year than Sky had over all. But Now TV and its sister services in Germany and Spain would provide a foundation from which to expand.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said that, in his view, the Fox-Sky bid was \u201cnot fully dead yet, but it will die a death at some point in the weeks ahead.\u201d As to whether Disney \u2014 after the expected approval in the United States of its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox \u2014 would try to buy the coveted 61 percent stake in Sky, he added, \u201cDisney very well may proceed with it, but in that case you could see other bidders for Sky.\u201dDisney\u2019s aspirations for Sky, Mr. Wieser said, could affect the role that James Murdoch \u2014 the younger of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s two sons and 21st Century Fox\u2019s chief executive \u2014 ultimately takes in an expanded Disney. \u201cOne could speculate that they won\u2019t announce any role for him until after any Sky deal,\u201d he said.Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, saw Disney\u2019s potential involvement as creating a more favorable scenario for a Sky deal to pass regulatory scrutiny.\u201cIf anything, it would seem that the U.K. regulators would encourage Disney to control Sky, as it increases the plurality of voices in the U.K. market,\u201d he said.Much has changed since Mr. Murdoch made his latest bid for Sky \u2014 in particular, his decision to sell most of 21st Century Fox to Disney in a move widely seen as an admission that traditional Hollywood companies had to grow significantly to compete in a shifting entertainment landscape.The announcement on Tuesday further complicates the path ahead for Mr. Murdoch.The Competition and Markets Authority expressed concern that allowing the takeover of Sky to proceed would give him too much control over the British media and, as a result, would give the Murdoch family \u201ctoo much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.\u201dThe regulator further noted that Murdoch-controlled outlets were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain\u2019s population. That is a substantially larger share than all but two organizations, one of which is the state broadcaster, the BBC.Notably, the competition authority said the sexual harassment allegations at Fox News were \u201cserious\u201d but did \u201cnot call into question\u201d 21st Century Fox\u2019s commitment to British broadcasting standards.The provisional decision was praised by longtime ideological foes of Mr. Murdoch, including Tom Watson, the deputy leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party. Mr. Watson called the announcement \u201ca victory for the thousands of people who joined the campaign and forced the government and the regulator to stand up to the Murdochs for once, instead of simply waving this bid through.\u201dClaire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, told the BBC that the decision did not mean that the proposed transaction was dead, given that the regulator had not blocked it on broadcast-standards grounds and had cited the single issue of media plurality. \u201cHad it blocked on both grounds, the transaction would have been stone dead,\u201d Ms. Enders said.She cited an increase in Sky\u2019s share price on Tuesday \u2014 it was up about 3.2 percent by day\u2019s end \u2014 as noteworthy.\u201cYou can see a market enthusiasm for a conclusion in which the original transaction is actually moving in the right direction, although far from being concluded,\u201d Ms. Enders said.Emily Steel contributed reporting from New York, and Stephen Castle from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018The Alienist\u2019 Finally Found a Screen", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf one were to itemize the distinguishing characteristics of the novel itself, the list might include gruesomely macabre, intellectually ambitious and historically vivid. Not to mention totally unfilmable.\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years of battling against really bad interpretations of this book,\u201d Mr. Carr said.But on Jan. 22, \u201cThe Alienist\u201d finally comes to screens on TNT, because of a fortuitous convergence of factors: a resurrected television studio looking to mine its rights library; a cable channel angling for more prestige; and an emerging program format \u2014 the limited series \u2014 that accommodates both ambitious, season-long narratives and actors who wouldn\u2019t sign on for television\u2019s usual multiyear commitments.The 10-episode season will present, from start to finish, the book\u2019s story of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a brilliant, prickly psychiatrist \u2014 or alienist, in the parlance of the day \u2014 and his team of cohorts tracking a killer who preys on boy prostitutes in the vice-ridden city. The German actor Daniel Br\u00fchl (\u201cRush\u201d) stars as the titular doctor, with Dakota Fanning (\u201cAmerican Pastoral\u201d) and Luke Evans (\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d) rounding out the leads.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get what the central dynamic of a book is, you\u2019re not going to be able to make a good movie out of it,\u201d Mr. Carr said. (\u201cI wish him well with the show,\u201d Mr. Rudin emailed in response.)\u201cIt seemed like a really futile struggle to continue the series when there was no interest in making a decent product out of the first book, much less the second book, much less a future book,\u201d Mr. Carr said.For TNT, still best known for procedurals and ampersands \u2014 \u201cRizzoli & Isles,\u201d \u201cFranklin & Bash,\u201d \u201cLaw & Order\u201d reruns \u2014 \u201cThe Alienist\u201d heralds a new focus on shows \u201cthat engage people more, that have a stronger, deeper pull on them,\u201d said Sarah Aubrey, TNT\u2019s executive vice president for original programming.Set mostly in 1896, the series was shot in Budapest on an elaborate ersatz fin de si\u00e8cle Manhattan set that was designed to allow 360-degree movement of the cameras and actors, where designers obsessed over not just cobblestone streets, costumes and gas lamps but also pocket watches, hairpins and shop windows.\u201cEvery detail matters,\u201d said Jakob Verbruggen (\u201cThe Fall\u201d), a director and executive producer of the series. \u201cWe could only sell this world if we made it 100 percent believable.\u201dSuch historical specificity was a big part of what captivated readers of \u201cThe Alienist,\u201d which unfolds in a grimy New York teeming with beleaguered immigrants, sordid brothels, crooked cops and uptown oligarchs, and included real-world figures like Theodore Roosevelt, then a police commissioner, and the financier J.P. Morgan. The philosophical question at its dark heart \u2014 is evil born or bred? \u2014 is debated throughout by the agreeably ragtag group pursuing the killer, which in addition to the alienist includes a crime reporter for The New York Times; a police secretary who was the department\u2019s first female employee; and two quirky detective brothers. Their innovative tactics include what we now recognize as criminal profiling, fingerprinting and forensic science.Though the series is faithful to the team dynamic that animates the novel, there are differences. The killer\u2019s perspective, absent from the book, is introduced early in the series. The reporter character, played by Mr. Evans, is now an illustrator. Sara Howard, the secretary played by Ms. Fanning, has been broadened into a fuller portrait of a young woman trying to be tough enough to thrive in a man\u2019s world without losing her femininity and sexuality, Ms. Fanning said.Ms. Powell said, \u201cWhen people see it, I think it will be even more relevant than we thought it was when we were working on it.\u201dAdditional modern resonance can be found in the book\u2019s story of forgotten refugees seeking better lives in a new country and in the economic chasm between its impoverished New Yorkers and privileged ones.\u201cYou can parallel it almost perfectly to certain societies we know today,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s very topical, and I think people will talk about it a lot and make the comparisons.\u201dBut what does the toughest critic of all say about \u201cThe Alienist\u201d?Mr. Carr also said he liked much of the pilot, the only episode he\u2019s watched, praising in particular the visuals and performances by Mr. Br\u00fchl and Mr. Evans. Finally seeing his most famous story onscreen, after decades of starts, stops and misfires, brought a sense of bifurcation, he said, as he separated his author self from his viewer one in an effort to assess the series\u2019s chances in an overstuffed TV universe. But it brought no relief, at least not yet.\u201cI\u2019ll feel a sense of relief if it succeeds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s just further frustration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And within minutes of arriving, I saw a familiar face walking toward me: Acuoth Achol.\u201cThings have been going really well,\u201d he said as we shook hands. Since the article was published, he said, more American scouts have been visiting, and support for the team has been rising.Shifting gears, I told him I was there to find out what new Australians, like him, thought about Australia Day.Is the holiday a benign celebration of national pride or a tone-deaf party that should be recast or moved from Jan. 26, which is the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of British ships?Is it a day when people of all backgrounds are made to feel that they belong or a day that celebrates colonization without regard for the colonized?His response was thoughtful and revealing. So were the responses of many others, from those who just arrived in Australia to those whose roots run deep.I was especially facinated by the young Australians I met who, despite being proud holders of Australian citizenship, said they didn\u2019t feel it was their right to discuss such a contentious issue.Those thoughts will find their way into another article at some point, but for now, I figured I\u2019d introduce all of you to Acuoth and a few of the other people I talked to.And don\u2019t forget to scroll down past the interviews for my roundup of New York Times articles that are must-reads this week, plus a recommendation for what might just be the darkest and most fascinating little show on Aussie Netflix.I got my citizenship on Australia Day in 2006. For me, it marked an era of inclusion. I\u2019d never felt a sense of belonging to a country I wasn\u2019t born in.But as I\u2019ve thought about it more, I\u2019ve started to question it. For the Aboriginal community, it hurts. I can sympathize with them. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t just be a day of celebration \u2014 a day of Aussie pride.Maybe it should be a day to reflect. There should be a national dialogue, where everyone can express their views instead of it just being about flag-waving and pride.\u2014 Acuoth Achol, a refugee resettlement coordinator, originally from South SudanMy family are all Wiradjuri elders, in Bathurst.

{"Headline": "How \u2018The Good Place\u2019 Became an Antihero Antidote", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIn its fantastic second season, NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place\u201d found empathy within the devil.Michael (Ted Danson), an immortal bureaucrat charged with torturing four souls in The Bad Place \u2014 a version of hell where his prisoners are meant to inflict their neuroses on one another \u2014 develops a conscience and helps them escape.While they argue their eternal cases in front of an omniscient judge (Maya Rudolph), Michael explains himself to his infernal supervisor. \u201cI was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, they helped each other. They were bad people. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be possible.\u201dPeople never learn, people don\u2019t get better: These are unsurprising beliefs from a minion of hell. But they\u2019ve also been the guiding principles of the last two decades of TV. From the dawn of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d through the rise of Netflix, acclaimed antihero dramas have focused on bad people getting worse or good people going bad. (In \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the concept is right in the title.)There are many delights to \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d which ends its too-short 13-episode season Thursday: its ingenious twists, its riffs on the banality of damnation. (Hell is stocked with Hawaiian pizza and plastered with movie posters for \u201cPirates of the Caribbean 6: The Haunted Crow\u2019s Nest or Something, Who Gives a Crap.\u201d)But the most refreshing thing about \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d in an era of artistic bleakness, is its optimism about human nature. It\u2019s made humane and sidesplittingly entertaining television out of the notion that people \u2014 and even the occasional immortal demon \u2014 are redeemable.For a generation now, the moral journeys of TV\u2019s best shows have mostly run in the other direction. Tony Soprano spent six seasons in therapy yet learned nothing except how to be a better criminal. The corrupt police officer Vic Mackey, in \u201cThe Shield,\u201d rationalized his brutality as what it took to bust gang members.Over time, antihero culture spread from premium cable to the mainstream. The bristly protagonists of Fox\u2019s \u201c24\u201d and \u201cHouse, M.D.\u201d broke rules to get the job done. Reality TV made stars of people who, in the credo of that genre, weren\u2019t there to make friends. Antiheroes are de rigueur in noirish streaming dramas like \u201cBloodline\u201d and \u201cOzark.\u201dNone of this is to say that antihero stories are necessarily amoral. Some, like \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d assumed moral universes of retribution and consequences. But they were a kind of rebellion against the pat moral lessons of earlier TV, in which you could count on the good guys to win simply because they were good.\u201cThe Good Place,\u201d on the other hand, avoided falling into easy moralizing by committing to the idea that becoming good is hard work.This was built into the structure of \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d For most of the first season, Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a selfish ne\u2019er-do-well, believes \u2014 as part of Michael\u2019s ruse \u2014 that she\u2019s in heaven and was placed there by mistake. So she gets her assigned \u201csoul mate,\u201d the moral-philosophy professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), to teach her to be a better person.To give the conundrum some oomph, Michael conjures up an actual trolley, forcing Chidi to live out his dilemma over and over, complete with copious blood spatter. The scene is slapstick, gross-out brilliance \u2014 and a clever illustration of how applying hypotheticals to real life (or a convincing illusion) becomes, er, messy.The characters of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d ended up in hell for relative misdemeanors. Eleanor is an oaf, but hardly a murderer. Tahani (Jameela Jamil) is a vain social climber with a jealous streak; Jason (Manny Jacinto) is a sweet dimwit. Chidi\u2019s sins are intellectual paralysis and self-flagellation. (When he learns he\u2019s in hell, he assumes it\u2019s for drinking almond milk: \u201cI knew it was bad for the environment, but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film.\u201d)In \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d morality is not something you have; it\u2019s something you do. It\u2019s a muscle that requires exercise. The show shares with dramas like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d the belief that being good is hard. But it doesn\u2019t believe that being good is futile.The series feels like part of a wider reaction against the dark TV view of human imperfection, something that was once groundbreaking but has become a commodity.But the upbeat sophistication of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d is still rare, in this world and, apparently, in the next. When Ms. Rudolph\u2019s judge agrees to hear the characters\u2019 case, she says that she\u2019s only doing it out of boredom. \u201cIt\u2019s either this,\u201d she says, \u201cor start \u2018Bloodline.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

Guillermo del Toro Has Some Recommendations", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ&AThe director of \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d wants visitors to explore Guadalajara, his hometown. He also recommends Merida and a Baja beach called Barriles.Guillermo del Toro, 52, who has best director and best screenplay Academy Award nominations for \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d (he won a Golden Globe Award for best director for the film), is well-known for his science-fiction and horror movies. (His other films include \u201cPacific Rim\u201d and \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth.\") But Mr. del Toro\u2019s talents go beyond film: he has also co-authored a trilogy of vampire novels and is the creator of the computer-animated Netflix series \u201cTrollhunters.\u201dIt\u2019s the jimadores who inspired Mr. del Toro\u2019s drawings, he said.And while Mr. Del Toro currently lives in Toronto and Los Angeles, he returns to Guadalajara every six weeks to visit his family and still sees the jimadores working in the fields.Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with him.Jalisco is where tequila is produced, but what does the state offer for tourists?There\u2019s plenty to see. First of all, whether you drink tequila or not, I do think it\u2019s worth visiting some tequila houses in the town of Tequila and in the Highlands region. By going to a house, you can learn about how the agave is extracted to produce the drink.What are some other destinations in Mexico that tourists tend to miss?Several places come to mind. M\u00e9rida, in the state of Yucat\u00e1n, is a beautiful colonial city where the people used to dress in all white from head to toe. The culture is very rich, especially the music \u2014 it\u2019s a limerick style called son where the phrases repeat again and again.Then you have Oaxaca, which is an incredibly mystical city with a lot of shamans. The cuisine is refined but spicy, and you find a lot of mole. And Campeche City, in the state of Campeche, is a vibrant port city with fantastic seafood which is also very nice to walk around in.Each of these places are in the same country but are so different culturally and cuisine-wise that they might as well be different countries.Compared with the cities you just named, Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas are much more popular with tourists. Do they give travelers an authentic sense of Mexico at all?I\u2019ve only been to Canc\u00fan once and didn\u2019t really like it so I can\u2019t offer any perspective there, but as for Cabo, you need to get away from the touristy parts to appreciate its beauty. For me, the hidden gem there is a beach called Barriles, near the city of La Paz. All the locals go there, and the swimming is fantastic. The beach also has food stands where you get the best lobster and fish.Do you have any recommendations for souvenirs that travelers to Mexico should buy?I\u2019m partial to candies called borrachitos. They\u2019re sugary and soft and come in different flavors. I also suggest buying alebrijes \u2014 they are these bright fantasy creatures handmade by local artists, and you can find them at craft markets all over the country. They\u2019re distinctly Mexican.

CBS is airing the latest spinoff, \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d only on CBS All Access, yet another paid video streaming service, in this case for $5.99 a month, or $9.99 without commercials. And I\u2019m not doing that.I\u2019ve got Netflix. I\u2019ve got Amazon. I\u2019ve got cable. I\u2019m done.For consumers, this is not going to get any easier. Disney has two streaming services in development, one for entertainment and another for sports. If Disney\u2019s acquisition of much of Fox goes through, that would further alter the landscape. And then there\u2019s net neutrality, which could take the whole picture and shake it up like a snow globe.Martin Kon, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, in the firm\u2019s technology, media and telecommunications practice, said that \u201cover time, all major content owners will have ways of presenting their content offerings\u201d in what he referred to as on-demand \u201cbouquets of content.\u201d\u201cIt will be onerous for consumers to have a couple dozen discrete relationships,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question then is how do they get re-aggregated back into a very compelling consumer proposition?\u201dBreaking the cable bundle is also changing how television is developed, because more companies have access to our data. McKinsey, the consulting firm, has been collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using artificial intelligence to help media companies make sense of the viewer data they collect. Among other things, they did a computer analysis of 1,500 short films from the website Vimeo, graphing their emotional peaks and valleys and correlating them to user comments.\u201cThe risk in the industry is spending large amounts of money for early-stage television series, most of which fail,\u201d said Jonathan Dunn, a McKinsey partner who co-authored the analysis, adding that the goal is to \u201ctake all of that information you\u2019ve learned about recommendation and discovery\u201d and \u201cget an edge on your production and greenlighting choices.\u201dThings used to be simpler. My father made a ritual of coming home from work, settling in a leather chair with a Scotch and soda and watching reruns of \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201d I stationed myself on a couch to his right.Now we have our own content corners. There\u2019s a 12-year-old in my house who watches YouTube videos of other kids playing video games. I\u2019m catching up on \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d the Netflix cartoon about a washed up, drunken actor who happens to be a horse. Hulu and Showtime haven\u2019t made the cut. As for HBO, get back to me in 2019, when \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d returns.Marc DeBevoise, president and chief operating officer of CBS Interactive, said \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d was in production when the company was looking for an anchor for its new streaming service, which now has more than two million subscribers.\u201cWe realized that building this into a multimillion-subscriber service was going to take a great base,\u201d he said, \u201cand we realized we were going to have our own exclusive content to differentiate it.\u201dI understand the business rationale. But I\u2019m done paying for more TV, even if it means turning my back on Star Trek. This is an absolute red line I will not cross until after Feb. 11 when the first season of the show ends and I can sign up for the free trial week they offer and binge-watch it all at once.Until then, the entertainment industry should remember we don\u2019t have to watch television. I read a novel recently, and I might read another one, if it\u2019s short enough. Really, I will.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Years After a Breakthrough at Sundance, Trying to Break Through Again", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year at the festival, which runs through Jan. 28, the program Women at Sundance is acknowledging Ms. Harris on the 25th anniversary of the movie. Ms. Harris has yet to make another feature, though not for lack of trying. In an interview mid-festival, the filmmaker (whose husband is a photographer for The New York Times) discussed how she got her small movie made, the current climate of independent filmmaking and why it has been so difficult to make a follow-up. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.In the end credits of \u201cJust Another Girl on the I.R.T.,\u201d you dubbed it \u201cA Film Hollywood Dared Not Do.\u201d Could you talk about what the filmmaking climate was like when you decided to make this?At the time, it was all about \u201cBoyz N the Hood,\u201d \u201cJuice,\u201d \u201cHangin\u2019 With the Homeboys.\u201d It was all male-centric. Those movies gave me the impetus to write a contemporary film from a black woman\u2019s point of view. But it\u2019s interesting because even now I have a fan base. Young people love the movie and I get tweets about it. They\u2019ve seen it on Amazon or Netflix.What are new fans responding to?They like that she was rocking the natural hair, the Senegalese twist. She was very political and stood up for herself and for injustice. She\u2019s not silent, she\u2019s not just the girlfriend, the mother, the daughter. I wanted her to have a full-fledged life herself.Did you feel like you were breaking ground when you made it?How does it feel to be back at Sundance? I feel like this is the place to be right now because there\u2019s change.Were there movies you had seen that represented your experience before you decided to make your film?I studied film in France and I\u2019m a big international film buff. I love Godard, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, Mizoguchi. These filmmakers often focused on a woman\u2019s story. Also Spike\u2019s film \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d I liked that it was about one woman\u2019s journey. But, it was from a male\u2019s point of view. Still good though.So you\u2019re saying that although Spike Lee\u2019s film stars a woman character, you feel the character is written more like how a man would see her?Yep.How did you get your movie made?I actually submitted my script to some of the mini majors [studio divisions]. One person said, \u201cWe love the script, we think it\u2019s great. But could you make her boyfriend, Tyrone, a drug dealer?\u201d I said no, I wouldn\u2019t change it. So I ended up starting a company and raising money myself through grants.But we ran out of money in post. I sent a script to the writer Terry McMillan. She sent a check to help. Also Michael Moore saw a rough cut of the film and he helped, too.And he said yes.You also asked him about what the mostly male, white Hollywood execs could do to help open doors for more people of color.What\u2019s happening with the film you said you\u2019d give Michael Moore a role in?We\u2019re still trying to get financing. It\u2019s still rare to have a black director, writer and producer making a film with a black lead female character. This one is about a cinema professor. It\u2019s called \u201cI Love Cinema.\u201dHas this been the case ever since \u201cJust Another Girl?\u201dHow do you think more change will happen?Well I think art really reflects our society. And maybe now with more women speaking up and having their voices be heard, we can see a shift. Maybe if we had more black executives, they would see the importance of these stories. I mean, how can you not do a film about Bessie Coleman?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On \u2018Black Lightning,\u2019 a Superhero Takes On Race, Justice and the Real World", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a disturbingly familiar scene: a black motorist standing outside his car on a rainy night, arguing with the white police officer who has pulled him over for seemingly no reason.Just when his roadside confrontation is about to cross a dangerous threshold, Pierce closes his eyes. When he reopens them, his pupils glow with angry electricity, the lights on the police car flicker out momentarily, and the cop lets Pierce go. Just a case of mistaken identity.But in Pierce\u2019s mind, he has decided that he must become Black Lightning again.The confrontation between Pierce and the police officer is not just a metaphor for the experience of black people in contemporary America; it is drawn from the real life of Salim Akil, the show runner and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Lightning.\u201dDescribing an incident in which he was halted just outside his office in Santa Monica, Calif., Mr. Akil said in a recent interview, \u201cI had been stopped by the police quite a few times, but my anger in being stopped again was about to get me killed. I stopped putting on the mask of, this is how I\u2019m supposed to act in these situations.\u201d\u201cAt a certain point,\u201d he added, \u201cI closed my eyes and took a moment. And I asked myself, is this really worth dying for?\u201dIn that situation, Mr. Akil could not call on any superhuman abilities. But he sees \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d and the platform it provides as a power in its own right.\u201cI\u2019ve been given a gift,\u201d Mr. Akil said of the show, \u201cand I have to use it the way I think I\u2019m intended to use it, to talk about the things I feel people need to talk about.\u201dMr. Akil\u2019s youthful fascination with costumed crime-fighters was more complicated. Though he loved comic books so much that he wore a Batman costume to school one Halloween, he drifted away from the medium.\u201cI never saw a true representation \u2014 an iconic hero \u2014 for myself,\u201d Mr. Akil said. \u201cIt just got boring, reading about all these really powerful and heroic white guys.\u201dIn 2015, when the Akils struck an overall TV deal with Warner Bros., the parent company of DC, they inquired about the Milestone characters. Those properties were unavailable, but Warner Bros. instead offered them Black Lightning.Mr. Akil added, \u201cTo me, Jefferson Pierce represented every side of me. I knew that I would be able to flesh him out.\u201dOf particular interest to the Akils was the idea that Black Lightning had set aside his superhero status and returned to it in middle age.\u201cIt echoes the idea that we can all get into this fight, at whatever place in our lives, at whatever age,\u201d Ms. Akil said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to fix, a lot to make right, and it\u2019s not going to solve itself.\u201dThat aspect of the character was also welcomed by Mr. Williams, the \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d star, who had nearly written off the possibility that he\u2019d get to play a superhero.When it instead went to Mike Colter, Mr. Williams said, \u201cThat was rough. I can be honest at this point. Everybody who knew me knew that I desperately wanted to do that. But when you don\u2019t get a role, you lick your wounds and move on.\u201dSeeing a dearth of black superheroes in film and TV, Mr. Williams said, \u201cI felt like I was quickly aging out of them.\u201d But after landing \u201cBlack Lightning,\u201d he said he connected to the concept of a hero who feels unsure if his powers are helping him win his battles or exacerbating the conflicts.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to draw the parallel of Jefferson Pierce being Martin Luther King and Black Lightning being Malcolm X,\u201d he said.Greg Berlanti, an executive producer of CW\u2019s many comic-book adaptations, including \u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cRiverdale,\u201d as well as \u201cBlack Lightning,\u201d said it was more important that Mr. Akil feel a sense of investment in his show than have it conform to other DC superhero shows.\u201cI think it\u2019s compatible,\u201d Mr. Berlanti said of \u201cBlack Lightning,\u201d \u201cbut I also think it\u2019s an evolution. These shows, whether we\u2019re a part of them or not, are only going to stay interesting, exciting and relevant for the audience if there are fresh voices behind them. New people with new stories to tell have to lead the charge. What\u2019s so exciting is that Salim is one of those people.\u201dMs. Akil emphasized that, for all of its moral ambitions, \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d was still, at its heart, an adventure series. In its first major story arc, where Pierce takes on a violent gang that has overtaken his city, there are also flashy costumes, fight scenes and special effects that are staples of superhero narratives.\u201cWhen entertainment is executed well, with a vision and from a personal place, it can break through,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can still be fun \u2014 the genre is supposed to be fun. It\u2019s supposed to let us think about good versus evil and where do we line up?\u201dIf \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d has worked the way he is hoping, Mr. Akil said he\u2019ll know at the end of October.\u201cIf I\u2019m walking down the street or taking my kids trick-or-treating,\u201d he said, \u201cand I see some young girls or boys who are dressed up like Black Lightning, that, to me would be success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watching Trump\u2019s Speech: They Cheered. They Groaned. They Ate a Cake.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "Around the country, people gathered at parties and in bars to hear President Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech. In some competitive Republican congressional districts, we went along.Supported byGone are the days when hearing directly from the president was a special event. Now President Trump is a regular, unfiltered presence on Twitter, often before Americans have had their first cup of coffee.Our national correspondents watched the speech to gauge the mood in competitive congressional districts in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, where Republicans are waiting to see if a wave of Democratic enthusiasm could be enough to cost them seats in 2018.PALATINE, Ill. \u2014 Bob Schmidt, 36, glanced up from his beer just in time to see President Trump pause from his State of the Union address and heartily applaud for himself.\u201cUgh,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, turning away from the flat-screen televisions hanging over the bar. \u201cI voted for him and he\u2019s the joke of the country. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019m happy with him and I\u2019m embarrassed by him at the same time.\u201dAt T.J. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Bar & Grill in this northwest suburb of Chicago, a mix of Democrats and Republicans lined the bar, downing after-work drinks just steps from the commuter train station.They were far from united in their political beliefs. But they agreed on one thing: They didn\u2019t care to pay attention to the speech.One woman eyed the television, promptly grabbed a remote control from behind the bar and cranked up \u201cRedneck Woman\u201d on the jukebox. A man grumbled about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and booed when the camera lingered on Representative Nancy Pelosi of California or Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, both Democrats, but otherwise talked throughout the address.In this pocket of Republican-leaning suburbia, Illinois\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, Representative Peter Roskam, the Republican, is seen as vulnerable to Democratic challengers in his re-election bid. One year into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the political landscape here feels especially unsettled.George Ramirez, 44, a senior analyst at a pharmaceutical company, said he identified as an independent and didn\u2019t vote for either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016.As Mr. Trump talked about immigration and terrorism, Mr. Ramirez said he hoped the president would focus on the big issues and try to unite the country.Mr. Ramirez said he would wait until the next day to actually watch the speech, though. \u201cI have no desire to watch it right now,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. \u201cI\u2019m recording it.\u201dAs Mr. Trump referenced young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, Mr. Schmidt sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re kids,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they should be allowed to stay.\u201dMr. Schmidt turned his back to the television screen.\u201cAt 5:30 a.m. tomorrow, I\u2019ll be back on the train going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it then.\u201dATLANTA \u2014 They cheered for the hero police officer and the hero soldier, for the North Korean dissident and for Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense.But the loudest responses from the Republicans who gathered at a neighborhood grill here to watch the State of the Union speech came when the cameras cut away to glowering Democratic lawmakers in attendance. They hooted at each scene. \u201cThe faces!\u201d someone yelled at one particularly glum tableau.It gave the entire scene here in Brookhaven \u2014 a northern Atlanta neighborhood in Georgia\u2019s competitive Sixth Congressional District \u2014 the mood of a televised basketball rout, with Washington\u2019s long-faced Democrats in the role of hated rivals sitting on the losing bench. At one point, the cameras showed African-American lawmakers sitting silently as President Trump spoke of low unemployment numbers for black people. A white man here, who appeared to be in his 30s, stood up with arms raised, as if a referee had blown a call.\u201cThat says it all,\u201d he yelled, \u201cif you\u2019re not even going to clap for that!\u201dThe watch party here was sponsored by the Atlanta Young Republicans and the Republican National Committee in a district where Karen Handel, a Republican member of Congress, fended off Jon Ossoff last year in a race that drew intense national attention.Averi Washington, a 42-year-old African-American real estate agent, was one of the few non-Trump supporters in the crowd of roughly 60. Mr. Washington said he had come to the watch party with a friend. In 2016, he said, he did not like either candidate, and did not vote.But he said he liked the way the economy was going under Mr. Trump. The real estate market is strong in Atlanta, and Mr. Washington said he was open to believing that Mr. Trump was taking the country in the right direction \u2014 despite all of his feuding on Twitter.After the speech, Mr. Washington said he appreciated Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetorical focus on results, from low unemployment numbers to tax reform. \u201cI mean, those are impressive, because that\u2019s how you strengthen the middle class,\u201d he said.Before the speech, Chelsea Magee, 32, a Trump supporter who works for a wealth management company, said she wanted the president to use the opportunity to show that he could rein in his antics. They were getting in the way of the good economic and policy news he should be getting credit for, she said.In the end, Ms. Magee gave Mr. Trump high marks for restraint. \u201cHe was very stoic, very mature,\u201d she said. \u201cHe threw out the meat that he needed to, but he wasn\u2019t excessive about it. He was perfect.\u201dHOUSTON \u2014 Even the cake was pro-Trump.A chocolate crumb cake with red, white and blue sprinkles was given a place of honor at Beaver\u2019s restaurant here. It sat on a table in a private dining room underneath a set of lights, a dig at a top Democrat that encapsulated the vibe at this Republican-heavy watch party.The cake was in honor of Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who had referred to the bonuses that some companies gave workers following the passage of the Republican tax plan as \u201ccrumbs.\u201dNo one touched the cake while the president appeared on several flat-screen TVs. People cheered, applauded and rose occasionally from their seats for ovations. They hung on the president\u2019s every word, quite literally, since they were playing \u201cState of the Union bingo,\u201d marking words like \u201cDACA,\u201d \u201cMelania,\u201d \u201cwall\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure.\u201dJeb Bashaw, the host of the party and the chief executive of an investment management and financial planning company, liked what he heard from President Trump on Tuesday, calling the speech inspirational and patriotic.\u201cHe\u2019s talking about opportunity for everyone, not just certain classes of people,\u201d said Mr. Bashaw, 55.Mr. Bashaw and his friends watched the speech in a place that Democrats view as a battleground \u2014 the district of Representative John Culberson, which has been comfortably held by Republicans since the late 1960s. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly won this congressional district, and a crowded field of Democrats has lined up to try to flip the seat in November.For those at this private party, there seemed no risk of flipped votes. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech reinvigorated them.Moments after Mr. Trump had finished, Mr. Bashaw called out: \u201cWho wants cake?\u201dENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 Lisa Carnahan didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump, but there she was on Tuesday night, in a pink sweater and rhinestone jeans, clapping mightily with the rest of the crowd at a Republican watch party in Colorado\u2019s Sixth District. A Republican, Mike Coffman, holds the congressional seat there, but the district has long been a tossup and Mr. Coffman faces challengers.On the wall, a flag featured the president on a war tank, wielding a golden machine gun. An American flag and a flurry of dollar bills billowed behind him. And Ms. Carnahan, a Republican who refused to vote for Mr. Trump, said she was pleasantly surprised. He seemed so presidential, she said.\u201cI always expect crazy talk from him,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess you feel a little more hopeful listening to this.\u201d Ms. Carnahan, 39, is a full-time Lyft driver.

{"Headline": "German Carmakers Criticized for Emissions Research on Monkeys", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Three major German carmakers that financed the researchers who used monkeys to test the health effects of diesel exhaust struggled to contain harsh criticism from animal rights activists and a wave of negative media coverage after details of the tests emerged.The research was intended to show that modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions linked to a range of lung ailments and blamed for tens of thousands of premature deaths. Instead, it has shed unwelcome light on the methods that the carmakers had used to influence political debate.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group that claims 6.5 million supporters, wrote a letter to Volkswagen protesting what it said was the cruel mistreatment of the cynomolgus macaque monkeys used in the tests.\u201cThere is nothing fair about condemning these complex, sensitive animals to suffer physical suffering and psychological torment in laboratories where they are caged and deprived of fresh air, sunshine, freedom of movement, the companionship of others, and just about everything else that makes any life worth living,\u201d Harald Ullmann, a PETA vice president, wrote in a letter dated Friday to Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen.The monkey experiments also provided another example of how Volkswagen used software to conceal emissions of nitrogen oxides that were far above limits allowed by law. The Beetle provided by Volkswagen for the tests had been fitted with software that caused it to produce far less pollution in the lab than the car would have produced on the road. In other words, the results were deliberately manipulated.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The experiments were commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T. The organization received all of its funding from Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. It contracted the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque to carry out the tests.The research group commissioned numerous studies on topics related to diesel, such as studies shedding doubt on whether restricting diesel vehicles in urban areas led to better air quality. The organization shut down last year amid controversy over its work, before the results of the Albuquerque study could be published.The carmakers said the research group was independent and overseen by reputable scientists. But the studies it commissioned invariably supported the industry\u2019s pro-diesel agenda. Diesel is particularly important to luxury carmakers like BMW, Daimler\u2019s Mercedes unit and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi division. It would be much harder to sell big cars in Europe without the fuel economy provided by diesel.Carmakers expressed contrition about the experiments.\u201cThe scientific methods used to conduct the study were wrong,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement. \u201cAnimal testing is completely inconsistent with our corporate standards. We apologize for the inappropriate behavior that occurred and for the poor judgment of individuals who were involved.\u201dDaimler distanced itself from the study and the E.U.G.T. \u201cWe will clarify how the L.R.R.I. study came about and have launched an investigation,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Albuquerque lab. \u201cDaimler does neither tolerate nor support unethical treatment of animals. The animal experiments in the study are superfluous and repulsive.\u201dBMW said in a statement on Sunday that it \u201cdoes not carry out any animal experiments,\u201d adding, \u201cThe BMW Group did not participate in the mentioned study and distances itself from this study.\u201dNews of the monkey experiments intensified criticism of how the auto industry has used its political clout to preserve tax breaks that make diesel fuel cheaper than gasoline in Europe.Advertisement"}

Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling.

By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.That client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports.\u201cThe borrowing entity pledged 628 million Steinhoff shares as collateral on the loan, according to a company statement at the time. After the share price collapse, however, that collateral has little value relative to the debt.\u201dHow often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong?That odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary.This obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below].The S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.\u2019s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case.Defendants argued the judges are not mere employees but \u201cofficers\u201d so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status.The S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution.The key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out.-- Peter J.

{"Headline": "With \u2018Electric Dreams,\u2019 Philip K. Dick Gets the TV Anthology Treatment", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen filmmakers and TV showrunners want to drop viewers into a paranoid but all-too-believable future, they return again and again to the same material: the dozens of novels and stories by the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.In the seven years since Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk created \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d with completely different story lines and characters each season, anthology shows have become home to some of the most ambitious and creative storytelling on TV. With \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d the format takes its next evolutionary step, with a new story and creative team for each episode.The approach is unlike that of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d or FX\u2019s other major anthology success, Noah Hawley\u2019s \u201cFargo,\u201d where stories unwind over an entire season. And it differs from shows like HBO\u2019s \u201cRoom 104,\u201d where the stories and cast change every episode but all are driven by the distinct auteur sensibility of the Duplass Brothers (the show\u2019s creators), which lends a tonal seamlessness from week to week.By contrast, the \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d creative teams, which include veterans of \u201cThe Night Manager,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the Harry Potter universe, were given free rein by the showrunner, Michael Dinner, to veer wildly from episode to episode, from satirical to earnest to deeply, psychedelically strange. \u201cEveryone is trying to do original things to stand out, so you\u2019re not boxed into a format anymore,\u201d said one of the executive producers, Ronald D. Moore, who is best known for creating the acclaimed 2004 \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d reboot.There are some clear advantages to the anthology format. For one, shows can be written in satisfying movie-like arcs, rather than the open-ended storytelling that traditional TV requires. And major stars are much more willing to sign on for a single season, or in the case of \u201cElectric Dreams,\u201d a single episode. \u201cWe had so many actors who were interested because of that,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, I can come in for five days and get it done?\u2019 That\u2019s a very appealing prospect.\u201dThe actors attracted to the series included Bryan Cranston of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (also one of the show\u2019s executive producers), Steve Buscemi, Maura Tierney and the avant-R&B singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e. And \u201cElectric Dreams\u201d attracted writers and directors like Dee Rees (\u201cMudbound\u201d), Peter Horton (\u201cAmerican Odyssey,\u201d \u201cThirtysomething\u201d) and Alan Taylor (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d).Dick\u2019s daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, whose production company Electric Shepherd oversees adaptations of her father\u2019s work, reached out in 2012 to Mr. Dinner, executive producer of FX\u2019s \u201cJustified,\u201d and invited him to look at the short stories. \u201cMichael really had the idea to do it as anthology,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a friend of Mr. Dinner\u2019s who was brought on soon after.Mr. Dinner, who had a deal with Sony, also recruited Mr. Cranston, who, like the others, is a major Philip K. Dick fan. All four brought in people they\u2019d worked with as well as reaching out to talent they admired. \u201cI sent Janelle Mon\u00e1e a letter and asked her if she\u2019d want to be a part of it,\u201d Ms. Hackett said. \u201cI knew that she was a big fan of my dad\u2019s.\u201dEpisodes include \u201cThe Commuter,\u201d starring Timothy Spall, about a mysterious British town that doesn\u2019t appear on any maps, and Mr. Cranston\u2019s \u201cHuman Is,\u201d which ponders whether it\u2019s better to be married to a to a total jerk or an attentive guy who happens to be bodysnatched by an alien. Mr. Moore wrote the episode \u201cReal Life,\u201d which stars Terrence Howard and Anna Paquin and deals with virtual reality. And Ms. Mon\u00e1e plays an android who falls in with a band of post-apocalyptic survivors in her episode, \u201cAutofac.\u201dBut the show\u2019s creative freedom came at a cost in terms of complexity and difficulty for the producers.

{"Headline": "Michael Eisner Sketches a Happy Ending for Portsmouth F.C.", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerJust like in any sports movie worth its salt, the montage told the story best.In early May 2017, Michael Eisner arrived at the Guildhall in Portsmouth, England, to face 1,500 fans of the city\u2019s soccer team. His task was a delicate one: to persuade at least 75 percent of them to sell their beloved club, Portsmouth F.C., to \u201can ancient Hollywood executive\u201d and his sons.There would be, he knew, a degree of skepticism. Portsmouth\u2019s previous experience with foreign owners suggested they brought nothing but trouble. First under Russian-Israeli, and then Emirati, Saudi and Nepali ownership, the century-old club had sunk all the way from the Premier League to League Two, English soccer\u2019s fourth tier. It had flirted with oblivion; only a consortium comprising some 3,000 local fans, reaching into their own pockets, had saved it from extinction.Facing those fan-owners, Eisner realized he had a tough sell. He knew it would not be enough to turn up to the Guildhall and \u201csit on a stool and pontificate.\u201d A naval base on England\u2019s south coast, Portsmouth is a tough, tight-knit sort of a place; being lectured by a mogul who had just jetted in from California with no prior knowledge of or investment in soccer would not go over well.Instead, he started with a 25-minute presentation \u2014 \u201cThe sort I have done all my life,\u201d Eisner said. He laid out his vision for what Portsmouth F.C. would be under the aegis of the Tornante Company, his investment firm. \u201cWe did not promise to spend hundreds of millions of pounds, to build up debt,\u201d Eisner said. \u201cI said, \u2018If that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m not the guy.\u2019\u201d Instead, he preached caution, continuity: \u201cSlow and steady.\u201dAnd then, just before he and his sons answered fans\u2019 questions for an hour, Eisner directed his audience to the short video montage he had made. \u201cWinning feels good, and it sure is fun,\u201d he said as he turned toward the screen at his back. \u201cThis should give you an idea of what I mean.\u201dThe montage took in Eisner\u2019s real-life sporting success during his two decades leading Disney \u2014 the Anaheim Angels winning baseball\u2019s World Series; the Anaheim Ducks lifting hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup \u2014 but also nodded to Portsmouth\u2019s winning the F.A. Cup in 2008, and its sealing promotion out of League Two only a couple of weeks before the gathering.No distinction was made, no line drawn, between the real and the imagined, the spontaneous and the scripted. There was no need to do that, in Eisner\u2019s eyes. The films all followed the same narrative: the triumph of the underdog.\u201cIf it\u2019s a good sports movie, it\u2019s to do with winning,\u201d Eisner said. Sports and movies, to Eisner, are the same thing at heart: They are both \u2014 they are all \u2014 stories. He has spent his career telling them, and Portsmouth is simply the latest.That is not to say that this is some whim. He is asked \u201call the time\u201d why he has, at age 75, chosen to get involved with the ownership of an English soccer team, particularly one so stripped of glamour and so deprived of investment as Portsmouth. Even his wife has ventured the question.\u201cThe only thing in the future, and today, that is appointment to view,\u201d he said of live sports. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in hockey: you skate to where the puck is going to be. This is a good place to be in the media.\u201dThen, inspired by his ownership of the Topps trading card company and encouraged by visits to Arsenal with his son, he decided that English soccer was a better bet. He discussed buying a Premier League team, but when a Chinese investor gazumped his offer on one club, he decided to alter his strategy.\u201cI thought about promotion and relegation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I paid a Premier League price to get into this exclusive club, and they got relegated, I would fall into a deep depression. But if I bought a club in League One or League Two, where the upside was big and the downside small, where you can build up, not fall off the floor, that would be better.\u201dBut it also may be what made Portsmouth so attractive to Eisner: the sense that there is a story here to be told, something to build, a team to take from the depths to the heights. That is the narrative arc of the sports movies he knows so well, after all \u2014 the small made mighty, the underdog rising from obscurity to greatness.It is a story into which Eisner has thrown himself. The little things hint at his commitment. He says \u201cpitch,\u201d not \u201cfield.\u201d He pronounces Portsmouth, as the British do, with the emphasis on the first syllable, not the last, as most outsiders might.So far, fans seem encouraged by what they have seen. Mark Catlin, a chief executive first installed by the Pompey Supporters\u2019 Trust, remains in place, running the club\u2019s day-to-day operations. \u201cIt is still early days, but there is a different competence level,\u201d said Colebrook, compared to what has gone before.Much will depend on what Eisner can do with Fratton Park, Portsmouth\u2019s evocative but crumbling home. In December, he invited the famed architect Robert A. M. Stern to a match to pick his brain on a potential redesign. \u201cThat is where he will be able to leave a legacy,\u201d Colebrook said.Eisner is not in a rush. He is preaching caution, the slow and steady progress he discussed on the stage at the Guildhall. He says he is not going to do something \u201ccrazy.\u201d Portsmouth has tried that before, that \u201ctemporary high and enormous low.\u201d It is a story the club, and city, knows all too well. It is not a story that ends in a montage, and it is not the story Eisner is here to tell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Flurry of Lawsuits Filed to Fight Repeal of Net Neutrality", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The legal fight against the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s recent repeal of so-called net neutrality regulations began on Tuesday, with a flurry of lawsuits filed to block the agency\u2019s action.One suit, filed by 21 state attorneys general, said the agency\u2019s actions broke federal law. The commission\u2019s rollback of net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d the attorneys general said, and a reversal of the agency\u2019s longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, said the new F.C.C. rules would harm internet entrepreneurs who could be forced to pay fees for faster delivery of their content and services to consumers. A similar argument was made by another group that filed a suit, the Open Technology Institute, a part of a liberal think tank, the New America Foundation.Suits were also filed on Tuesday by Free Press and Public Knowledge, two public interest groups. Four of the suits were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Free Press suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers \u2014 allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online,\u201d said Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the suit by the state officials.The lawsuits have long been expected. The filings on Tuesday, petitions to begin the suits, kick off what is expected to be an extended legal and political debate about the future of internet policy.Democrats have rallied to fight the F.C.C.\u2019s repeal of net neutrality, which was passed in a 3-to-2 party line vote in December. The agency is led by Ajit Pai, a Republican nominated by President Trump. All of the attorneys general involved in the suit filed on Tuesday are Democrats.The lawsuits have the support of the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech firms including Google and Netflix, giving the various legal challenges financial support and the clout of companies. The companies say internet service providers have the incentive to block and throttle their sites in order to garner extra fees.The F.C.C. declined to comment on the suits. But it did point to a part of its order that prohibits legal challenges until the new rules are submitted into the federal registry. The F.C.C. is expected to enter the new rules into the federal registry in the coming days or weeks.The states said they could file a petition to the United States Court of Appeals, starting the process to determine which court would hear the case. That is the action the attorneys general, as well as Mozilla and the Open Technology Institute, took on Tuesday.The states that signed onto the lawsuit include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said the decision to roll back the agency\u2019s declaration of broadband as a utility-like service will harm consumers.\u201cInternet access is a utility \u2014 just like water and electricity,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in a statement. \u201cAnd every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider.\u201dIn a release, Mr. Schneiderman said the agency\u2019s roll back disregarded a record of evidence that internet service providers\u2019 could harm consumers without rules. A similar argument was made by Mozilla.\u201cEnding net neutrality could end the internet as we know it,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla\u2019s chief business and legal officer in a blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are committed to fighting the order. In particular, we filed our petition today because we believe the recent F.C.C. decision violates both federal law as well as harms internet users and innovators.\u201dThe issue of net neutrality has been fought in court challenges twice before in the past decade. The rules adopted in 2015, which set rules that sites could not be blocked or throttled, were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals in 2016 after legal challenges by telecom companies. The F.C.C. vote in December was to roll back those 2015 rules.Success by members of Congress is unlikely, particularly in the House, where Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would have to agree to bring the resolution to a vote. The president will also have to agree to the resolutions, if they were passed, but the White House has expressed its support of the rollback of net neutrality rules.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "States Push Back After Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures.Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action.\u201cThere tends to be a follow-on effect, particularly when something happens in a big state like California,\u201d said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at nonprofit consumer group, Public Knowledge, which supports net neutrality efforts by the states.Bills have also been introduced in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Washington. The issue has also attracted some support in governor mansions. In Washington, for example, Gov. Jay Inslee reiterated his support for a state law in a speech this week.\u201cWhen Washington, D.C., takes away that protection, we must protect net neutrality for our people, for our businesses and for the virtues of free speech,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said.And any such state law could be challenged in courts. The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new order, which rolled back rules passed in 2015, blocks state and city governments from creating their own net neutrality laws. The commission said different state laws were too difficult for an internet service provider, like Verizon or Charter, to follow because the internet does not recognize state borders and transfers traffic between states.\u201cThe internet is the ultimate form of interstate commerce, which is clearly only within the authority of the F.C.C.,\u201d said Bret Swanson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in telecommunications policy.\u201cPeople should not be intimidated by the F.C.C. simply saying it has pre-emptive authority, and we need to dig into the sources of that claim, which are a lot weaker than the F.C.C. makes it out to be,\u201d said State Representative Drew Hansen, a Democrat who has introduced one of two net neutrality bills in Washington in recent weeks.The Federal Communications Commission declined to comment but pointed to the section of its order that pre-empts states from creating their own net neutrality rules.Supporters of net neutrality are attacking the agency\u2019s repeal of the 2015 rules in other ways as well. On Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced that he had enough support to force a vote on a congressional resolution to bring back the rules. He gained an important Republican supporter, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who said she would vote in favor of it. Such a measure is a long shot in the House, however, and would also need President Trump\u2019s signature.\u201cNet neutrality will be a major issue in the 2018 campaigns, and we are going to let everyone know where we stand and where they stand,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference, warning Republicans to vote in favor of the Democratic-led resolution.In addition, lawsuits against the commission are expected shortly after the policy becomes official. Last week, a lobbying group for big technology companies including Facebook, Google and Netflix announced that it planned to join the lawsuits, giving the opposition substantial new resources. More than a dozen state attorneys general have also announced plans to sue the commission.But state lawmakers say they cannot wait around to see what happens with those efforts.State Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who introduced the other bill in Washington, said net neutrality was an important safeguard for small businesses that might not be able to pay internet service companies for fast speeds. Even though Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the repeal, she said many Republicans in her state supported her bill.\u201cThis is not a partisan issue here,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cEveryone is concerned about equal access to the internet and being able to participate in the 21st-century economy.\u201d\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t protect consumers, the State of California will,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.In New York, Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat, said a few internet service providers already had too much power over the marketplace and should not be given the ability to charge websites more for faster delivery to users.This month, she introduced a bill that would hold back state telecom projects from broadband providers that blocked, throttled or gave priority to sites that paid for faster access. Legislators in Rhode Island and North Carolina have introduced or are considering similar bills that are more focused on government contracts than telecom law, they say.\u201cWe are threading a needle here,\u201d Ms. Fahy said, \u201cbut this is the best way to get at consumer protection, because state projects are huge and this will really affect the internet service providers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He does, though, have his limits on casual wear \u2014 more on that below. And you also have to be prepared to react to other people\u2019s actions, he said, which is where the sleep mask comes in. \u201cOn early a.m. flights there\u2019s always one jackass who still wants to watch the sun rise and then stare into it for the next five hours,\u201d Mr. Segura said. \u201cMeanwhile, everyone in the whole cabin has their window shade down and it\u2019s dark but there\u2019s that one guy. So now I just put on a sleep mask.\u201d \u201cTraveling with kids is tough. My best advice is don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Segura said. But if you have no choice, he has thoughts on that too and further observations on how to make travel more bearable. I\u2019m definitely a jaded traveler but you try to make the best of what you know about the experience. Like, I know how to pack a bag. I know that checking a bag is for rookies. I know that if you\u2019re in a high traffic time going into a major airport \u2014 I live in L.A., so at L.A.X. \u2014 you want to be dropped off at arrivals, not at departures. There\u2019s less traffic there and you can run over to departures quickly. So it\u2019s the little things that you pick up on the way.Begin with perhaps covering your torso. Have you seen photos of how people traveled on planes in the \u201960s? Coat and tie was the standard. I\u2019m not suggesting we all go back to that but for God\u2019s sake do you really need to wear a tank top? Put on some deodorant and add a shirt if you don\u2019t mind. I get that most people aren\u2019t going to be served food on a flight but the amount of people with zero regard for their fellow man is astounding. People bring all types of food onboard and by the smell of it, it wasn\u2019t meant to be consumed. Tuna melts, pastrami, curry and virtually all fast food has what can only be described as a stench in a confined space. It\u2019s mind-blowing how checked out and inconsiderate so many people are of the other passengers. Dude, eat that garbage before we board so the rest of us don\u2019t have to spend the next four hours nauseated because you can\u2019t plan out your meal times like an adult.It\u2019s all about getting great sleep. I\u2019ve even gone as far as asking them for duct tape and I\u2019ve taped that space, that gap that lets in light. In Canada one time, I told the guy, \u201cyeah man, you know, I keep trying to block out the light\u201d and they sent up the engineer and he\u2019s like, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cI want it to be blacked out, man, so I can sleep.\u201d And he goes, \u201coh I can staple it.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cyou want to staple it to your own walls?\u201d He was like, \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI think you\u2019re getting fired this week.\u201dSleep is important for a comic \u2014 like it is for a lot of people. But sometimes we\u2019re getting up at crazy hours. So I always ask for a hotel room not near the elevator. And I always ask for something not near the ground level. And depending on the class of hotel there\u2019s little tricks like if you tell them you have medicine they\u2019ll put a fridge in your room. Like, I don\u2019t have any medicine but I still want a fridge.If you ask somebody locally where a good spot is, they\u2019ll often take you to like a bar with chicken fingers. And you want to be like, \u201cwhat is wrong with you?\u201d But you realize it\u2019s just like what that person knows. So the way you find out the best restaurant in any city is go, \u201cwhere do rich people eat?,\u201d or, \u201cwhere do people go for graduations and anniversaries.\u201d It sucks that you have to phrase it that way because you sound pretentious but it\u2019s the only way.Advertisement"}

When you\u2019re not locked into 30 minutes with commercial breaks, what other conventions can you throw out?What is your advice for people who aspire to become reporters? What new digital tools should they start using today?Reporters of the future should master the building blocks of traditional journalism. The coin of the realm, no matter the medium, is the ability to find out new facts and to uncover things that someone doesn\u2019t want you to uncover. If you can get inside the room and explain to people what happened there, and if you can do it quickly and reliably, you\u2019ll become a strong reporter no matter how or where you tell your stories.You should start your own newsletter. You\u2019ll want to understand what makes for a good podcast, and what makes for a good video \u2014 all the better if you develop skills to make them yourself.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your personal life?What are some of your favorite podcasts other than The Daily?One of the Daily producers turned me on to an insane podcast called Dissect, where a guy analyzes, at very great length, every song on a Kanye West record. It\u2019s like going to Kanye School, which I didn\u2019t expect to do.I\u2019m enjoying Slow Burn, Slate\u2019s new podcast about what it was like to live through Watergate. I loved Ear Hustle, a sharp and humane series about prison life. And \u201cThis American Life,\u201d of course, still offers a master class in storytelling every week.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s boardroom in \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was like something out of a movie. Specifically, \u201cNetwork.\u201dThat\u2019s what reality TV does: It set-designs locations (a \u201cSurvivor\u201d island, a \u201cBachelor\u201d love nest) to look more convincing, more in line with our mental cartoons than the real thing.\u201cThe Confidence Man,\u201d a swift, brutal overview of Mr. Trump\u2019s business career, argues that he had been doing the same thing with his image for decades: He wasn\u2019t a business titan so much as he played one on TV.The film, directed by Fisher Stevens (\u201cBright Lights\u201d), is the last episode of a six-part anthology, \u201cDirty Money,\u201d from the filmmaker Alex Gibney (\u201cEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\u201d), arriving Friday. The installments range from an infuriating look at payday lending to an offbeat story about Canadian maple syrup cartels.The common thread is the abuse of trust. And \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d argues that the problem goes all the way to the top.Mr. Stevens\u2019s narrative starts with Trump Tower, the gleaming metonym Mr. Trump hung his name on in brass letters. The splashy project landed him on talk shows and magazine covers as the photogenic shorthand for Reagan-age materialism.That served his other big 1980s construction effort \u2014 his media image, for which he poured the foundation in the New York tabloids. The gossip columnist A. J. Benza recalls Mr. Trump as a regular source, offering juicy tips with only one condition: that he be referred to in print as a billionaire.TV reports picked up on the description and embellished it, and Mr. Trump smiled and let them.\u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d interviews old friends, like the music mogul Russell Simmons, and associates like Barbara Res, the executive in charge of the Trump Tower construction, who remember his mythmaking bemusedly. Compared with real estate families like the Zeckendorfs, Ms. Res says, \u201cWho was Trump? He was nobody.\u201dMaybe Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t the biggest developer. But he was the most visible, and he banked on people taking one for the other. (A later ad for Trump University declared, \u201cDonald Trump is, without question, the world\u2019s most famous businessman\u201d \u2014 trusting the audience to read that as \u201cmost successful.\u201d)When it all went bad by the early \u201990s, fame was his guarantor. His creditors, who needed the Trump brand to survive in order to get paid back, put him on an allowance to keep up a glitzy front.Mr. Trump, the film argues, has thrived by finding partners \u2014 in finance, reality TV, politics \u2014 who were as invested as he was in propping up his image.That made him a perfect host for \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d whose premise was that Mr. Trump was a legendary businessman and desirable boss.TV fame opened up other opportunities, and the last half of \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d detours into dark intimations about Mr. Trump\u2019s partnerships with businessmen from former Soviet republics and his alleged self-enrichment as president. It also re-examines the fraud case, later settled, against Trump University that his opponents tried to make stick to him in the 2016 campaign.But the film\u2019s larger case is against the reasoning that helped elect him: He was the most famous businessman, therefore he was the best businessman, therefore \u2014 following the logic of Mitt Romney and H. Ross Perot before him \u2014 he would be the best president. \u201cHe\u2019s managed businesses,\u201d one voter quoted in the film says, \u201cand I think he can manage this country.\u201dYou could, of course, argue that branding and the ability to leverage illusions are valuable skills themselves. You could agree with Arthur Jensen that the world is a business. But the forceful conclusion of \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d is that Mr. Trump\u2019s world is, and has always been, a stage.Advertisement"}

That was its best start to a year since 2006.Tech stocks surged 4.2 percent to begin the New Year.Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off next week with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock all reporting Friday. Here\u2019s what Wall Street analysts are expecting, courtesy of FactSet.\u2022 All 11 sectors are forecast to report earnings growth.\u2022 The index\u2019s energy companies are expected to show the biggest jump, up 132 percent. That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs\u2019s Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four.\u201cDecember\u2019s relatively weak jobs and wage growth figures give policymakers a breather. But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201dVia Recode:\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify.\u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201dThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales. Via CNBC:\u201cExplain to me where this market is rich? It\u2019s not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don\u2019t see the overvaluation. World growth is higher.\u201dFrom Mr. Schmidt\u2019s story:Legal experts said that of the two primary issues Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating \u2014 whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying the president to a possible crime of obstruction.But the experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case.So a steady drip of excerpts \u2014 from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians \u201ctreasonous\u201d to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing \u2014 is about to become a flood.The Washington flyaroundThe responseYes, corporations like Apple will have to repatriate overseas earnings under the new code.

Some rend the very fabric of a city that fancies itself, quite reasonably, the nation\u2019s cultural tastemaker. So there is reason to mourn the passing of two movie houses in Manhattan that believed in the capacity of films that aren\u2019t dominated by car explosions, light sabers and computer-generated gimcrackery to more faithfully reflect the human spirit.This Sunday brings the end to an older theater, Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, which has been around since 1981, in a worn area one flight below the street at Broadway and 62nd Street. The Lincoln Plaza faithful \u2014 who tend to be, shall we say, not young \u2014 aren\u2019t just hanging crepe these days. They are practically ready to call in grief counselors.Call it an art house if you must, a term bound to scare off some people. It\u2019s where devoted audiences have long flocked to see works of intelligence, many of them imports, because not all things great are American. On the final day at the theater, its six screens have films by Italian, Lebanese, Austrian, English and Scottish directors. There is also one film by a not-so-typical American named Woody Allen.What happened to this theater is a landlord-tenant story so familiar to New Yorkers that it\u2019s trite. The lease expired, and the building owner, Milstein Properties, didn\u2019t renew it. Structural work is needed around the building, Milstein said. It has promised that once the job is done, a new cinema will be birthed in the old Lincoln Plaza space. We\u2019ll see. For now, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to bear in mind an old line about verbal agreements and how they\u2019re not worth the paper they\u2019re written on.Places like Sunshine and Lincoln Plaza are among the small delights that give New York its fizz. One by one, they are fading. It doesn\u2019t mean the city has become a total cinema wasteland, not when it still has the likes of the Film Forum, Quad Cinema, Metrograph, Angelika Film Center, IFC Center and Film Society of Lincoln Center. But knowledgeable guides to inspiring, even transformative, cinema are being squeezed out in a town steadily succumbing to real estate cold-bloodedness and gentrified homogeneity.Mr. Talbot didn\u2019t live to see the last picture show.

I was a slave to HQ.Then there\u2019s the app itself, which is riddled with glitches and lags. Players are regularly booted from the game without explanation. The live host\u2019s face is frequently obscured by the wheel of death. Sometimes, the whole game is scrapped for mysterious technical reasons \u2014 including one high-stakes game scheduled for 11:45 p.m. EST on New Year\u2019s Eve, which was unceremoniously aborted, then rescheduled for 45 minutes later \u2014 the game I hopped into.And yet, as many as half a million people are tuning in for each session. It\u2019s maybe the only real appointment viewing across all of entertainment right now. Why?HQ\u2019s failures are, I believe, crucial to its appeal. Consider the warm sense of accomplishment you get from completing the crossword puzzle, which is meticulously crafted by professionals and is built on basically consistent branches of knowledge. HQ provides an even more beguiling sensation: the feeling of being aggrieved.The chat is itself a fascinating artifact. When hundreds of thousands of people attempt to communicate at once, the only messages that scan are brief flashes of identity: \u201cMAGA,\u201d \u201cOBAMA,\u201d \u201cBUSH DID 9/11,\u201d \u201cBUY DOGECOIN.\u201d In the chat, griping about HQ has become as popular a pastime as actually playing the game. The slightest glitch produces a flurry of complaints like \u201cLAG\u201d and \u201cNOT WORKING\u201d and \u201cWOW SCOTT.\u201d Many of the game\u2019s failings have crystallized into inside jokes. After incessant complaints of the app\u2019s video stalling, Scott acquired a new nickname: \u201cLag Daddy.\u201d The octopus question spawned its own in-game meme. Now the chat swims with octopus emoji.HQ\u2019s most impressive achievement lies in its re-establishment of appointment viewing in the Netflix age. You can now watch pretty much any TV show or movie whenever you want, but when your phone buzzes with an HQ notification, you have only a few minutes to enter the game. If you miss the window, you\u2019ll be forced to watch helplessly, tapping in vain, as it unfolds without you.HQ has the power to create bonds outside the app, too. I won that New Year\u2019s Eve game \u2014 I wrote this whole column so I could brag about that \u2014 but only because my dinner party happened to include representatives of the film industry (who knew that \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d was the second-largest-grossing movie of 2017), an actual rocket scientist (who knew that the technology used to peek inside the Great Pyramid of Giza involved subatomic muons), and me, a possessor of meaningless facts concerning Selena Gomez. We won $59.41, an unusually generous prize, and got digitally foisted onto the internet\u2019s shoulders: I heard from a colleague, a Twitter follower, my friend\u2019s mom.But when my phone buzzed the next day, summoning me to play again, it was as if a spell had been broken. I no longer feel the itch to play twice a day, at work and at dinner. I am free. Maybe I\u2019ll check in from time to time, though. Just to see how Scott\u2019s doing.Advertisement"}

And if you\u2019re a sexually active woman in the 21st century, chances are that you are, too.The headline primes the reader to gird for the very worst: \u201cI went on a date with Aziz Ansari. It turned into the worst night of my life.\u201d Like everyone else, I clicked.The victim in this 3,000-word article is called Grace \u2014 not her real name \u2014 and her experience with Mr. Ansari began at a 2017 Emmys after-party. As recounted by the woman to the reporter Katie Way, she approached him, and they bonded over their admiration of the same vintage camera.The woman was at the party with someone else, but she and Mr. Ansari exchanged numbers and soon arranged a date in Manhattan.After arriving at his TriBeCa apartment on the appointed evening \u2014 she was \u201cexcited,\u201d having carefully chosen her outfit after consulting with friends \u2014 they exchanged small talk and drank wine. \u201cIt was white,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to choose and I prefer red, but it was white wine.\u201d Yes, we are apparently meant to read the nonconsensual wine choice as foreboding.They went out to dinner nearby and then returned to Mr. Ansari\u2019s apartment. As she tells it, Mr. Ansari was far too eager to get back to his place after he paid for dinner: \u201cLike, he got the check and then it was bada-boom, bada-bing, we\u2019re out of there.\u201d Another sign of his apparent boorishness.She complimented Mr. Ansari\u2019s kitchen countertops. He then made a move, asking her to sit on top of them. They started kissing. He undressed her and then himself.In the 30 or so minutes that followed \u2014 recounted beat by cringe-inducing beat \u2014 they hooked up. Mr. Ansari persistently tried to have penetrative sex with her, and the woman says she was deeply uncomfortable throughout. At various points, she told the reporter, she attempted to voice her hesitation, but Mr. Ansari ignored her signals.At last, she uttered the word \u201cno\u201d for the first time during their encounter, to Mr. Ansari\u2019s suggestion that they have sex in front of a mirror. He responded, \u201c\u2018How about we just chill, but this time with our clothes on?\u2019\u201dThey dressed, sat on the couch and watched \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d She told him, \u201cYou guys are all the same.\u201d He called her an Uber. She cried on the way home. Fin.If you are wondering what about this evening constituted the \u201cworst night\u201d of this woman\u2019s life, or why it is being framed as a #MeToo story by a feminist website, you probably feel as confused as Mr. Ansari did the next day. \u201cIt was fun meeting you last night,\u201d he texted.\u201cLast night might\u2019ve been fun for you, but it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d she responded. \u201cYou ignored clear nonverbal cues; you kept going with advances. You had to have noticed I was uncomfortable.\u201d He replied with an apology.Read her text message again.Put in other words: I am angry that you weren\u2019t able to read my mind.It is worth carefully studying this story. Encoded in it are new yet deeply retrograde ideas about what constitutes consent \u2014 and what constitutes sexual violence.Yet Mr. Ansari, in a statement responding to the account, said that \u201cby all indications\u201d the encounter was \u201ccompletely consensual.\u201dI am a proud feminist, and this is what I thought while reading the article:If you are hanging out naked with a man, it\u2019s safe to assume he is going to try to have sex with you.If the failure to choose a pinot noir over a pinot grigio offends you, you can leave right then and there.If you don\u2019t like the way your date hustles through paying the check, you can say, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lovely evening and I\u2019m going home now.\u201dIf you go home with him and discover he\u2019s a terrible kisser, say, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201dIf you start to hook up and don\u2019t like the way he smells or the way he talks (or doesn\u2019t talk), end it.If he pressures you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, use a four-letter word, stand up on your two legs and walk out his door.Aziz Ansari sounds as if he were aggressive and selfish and obnoxious that night. Isn\u2019t it heartbreaking and depressing that men \u2014 especially ones who present themselves publicly as feminists \u2014 so often act this way in private? Shouldn\u2019t we try to change our broken sexual culture? And isn\u2019t it enraging that women are socialized to be docile and accommodating and to put men\u2019s desires before their own? Yes. Yes. Yes.But the solution to these problems does not begin with women torching men for failing to understand their \u201cnonverbal cues.\u201d It is for women to be more verbal. It\u2019s to say, \u201cThis is what turns me on.\u201d It\u2019s to say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d And, yes, sometimes it means saying goodbye.The single most distressing thing to me about this story is that the only person with any agency in the story seems to be Aziz Ansari. The woman is merely acted upon.Except, increasingly, they are.To judge from social media reaction, they also see a flagrant abuse of power in this sexual encounter. Yes, Mr. Ansari is a wealthy celebrity with a Netflix show. But he had no actual power over the woman \u2014 professionally or otherwise. And lumping him in with the same movement that brought down men who ran movie studios and forced themselves on actresses, or the factory-floor supervisors who demanded sex from female workers, trivializes what #MeToo first stood for.I\u2019m sorry this woman had this experience. I too have had lousy romantic encounters, as has every adult woman I know. I have regretted these encounters, and not said anything at all. I have regretted them and said so, as she did. And I know I am lucky that these unpleasant moments were far from being anything approaching assault or rape, or even the worst night of my life.But the response to her story makes me think that many of my fellow feminists might insist that my experience was just that, and for me to define it otherwise is nothing more than my internalized misogyny.There is a useful term for what this woman experienced on her night with Mr. Ansari. It\u2019s called \u201cbad sex.\u201d It sucks.The feminist answer is to push for a culture in which boys and young men are taught that sex does not have to be pursued as if they\u2019re in a pornographic film, and one in which girls and young women are empowered to be bolder, braver and louder about what they want. The insidious attempt by some women to criminalize awkward, gross and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts and fainting couches. That\u2019s somewhere I, for one, don\u2019t want to go.An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized a recent poll about sexual harassment. The poll reported that 25 percent of millennial-age men thought that asking to buy someone a drink was harassment, not 25 percent of millennial-age women.Advertisement"}

I wear them all day, switching between phone calls and music \u2014 and sometimes I just leave them in my ears during conversations (looking ridiculous). Still, the amount of time you\u2019ll save no longer untangling wires is real.As for information, I\u2019m on Twitter too much; it is still the best news feed out there. (I have two Twitter accounts; one that\u2019s very public and one under another name I use only to follow people for work. I find it works better than creating \u201clists.\u201d) I occasionally use Buffer to coordinate social media posts when we're launching something new or trying to push out a particular story.I sometimes use a service called Relationship Science, which is a fascinating way to understand the connections between the people I cover. Think Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, or in this case, Six Degrees of Jamie Dimon.Despite being an unabashed Apple aficionado \u2014 I also have an Apple Watch \u2014 I happen to use Google apps for much of my life since it\u2019s so easy to collaborate on documents with colleagues and coordinate calendars. (And yes, Google Maps is still better than Apple Maps.) I use Slack to communicate with everyone at work, especially when I\u2019m traveling and not in the office.I\u2019m on airplanes too much, so I\u2019m also a devotee of Bose noise-canceling headphones. Other key pieces of travel technology: Hearos Xtreme earplugs for overnight flights are the best on the market (trust me, I\u2019ve tried them all); if you need to block out light to sleep on a flight or you\u2019re stuck in a hotel room that has terrible shades, get yourself a Lonfrote sleep mask, which is so much better than the freebie on your flight. I carry a handful of extra portable power packs to charge devices on the road. And I always keep a stash of RxBars (blueberry, pumpkin or peanut) with me; they're about as healthy as you can get when it comes to packaged and packable food.What could be better?I still want a bigger, longer lasting battery on the iPhone. I can never get enough battery life \u2014 and I have battery anxiety looking at the percentage icon dwindle throughout the day if I haven\u2019t found a place to plug in. Same for the AirPods, though I\u2019ve found that\u2019s less of an issue for me.On my Apple Watch, I desperately want to be able to adjust the sensitivity that activates the screen when I turn my wrist to look at it. (Hey, Apple Watch team: I\u2019d make it a bit more sensitive so it turns on more frequently, even at the cost of battery life.)In your years of writing about deals, which tech merger do you think has had the most significant impact on people\u2019s lives?You also appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d How has technology changed live broadcasting and your experience as an anchor?It has probably changed the most on the production side of TV. It used to be that you needed a truck and satellite hookup wherever you\u2019d go. We\u2019d travel with an army of production and technical personnel. But these days you can use services like LiveU, which basically puts an entire satellite truck in a shoe box that connects to the internet or wirelessly using cellular towers. I was just in China and Saudi Arabia, and we broadcast entire three-hour live shows with only a handful of people and no satellite connection.What tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Sonos is pretty great. We have a handful of Sonos speakers in our home for music and TV. We also have an Echo and Google Home speaker. I\u2019m thinking about getting the Sonos One, which is supposed to incorporate Alexa, Google Assistant and ultimately access to Apple all in one device.I read magazines on an app I love called Texture; it\u2019s like Netflix for magazines. If you\u2019re a magazine junkie, it is so worth it.Apple has more than $250 billion in cash. Which companies do you think it should buy, and why?I used to think they should make a big deal, but these days I\u2019m less certain. The next big thing in computing is clearly going to be artificial intelligence and health care. I imagine I\u2019d be investing in those spaces aggressively \u2014 but the potential takeover targets are less obvious.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Powerful Hollywood Women Unveil Anti-Harassment Action Plan", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDriven by outrage and a resolve to correct a power imbalance that seemed intractable just months ago, 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives have formed an ambitious, sprawling initiative to fight systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide.The initiative includes:\u2014 A legal defense fund, backed by $13 million in donations, to help less privileged women \u2014 like janitors, nurses and workers at farms, factories, restaurants and hotels \u2014 protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the fallout from reporting it.\u2014 Legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.\u2014 A drive to reach gender parity at studios and talent agencies that has already begun making headway.\u2014 And a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black.\u201cThe struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time\u2019s up on this impenetrable monopoly,\u201d the letter says.The group is one answer to the question of how women in Hollywood would respond to cascading allegations that have upended the careers of powerful men in an industry where the prevalence of sexual predation has yielded the minimizing clich\u00e9 of the \u201ccasting couch,\u201d and where silence has been a condition of employment.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us to speak righteously about the rest of anything if we haven\u2019t cleaned our own house,\u201d said Shonda Rhimes, the executive producer of the television series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder,\u201d who has been closely involved with the group.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201d Ms. Rhimes continued.\u201cPeople were moved so viscerally,\u201d said Ms. Eitel, who helps moderate Time\u2019s Up meetings, which began in October. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come together because they wanted to whine, or complain, or tell a story or bemoan. They came together because they intended to act. There was almost a ferociousness to it, especially in the first meetings.\u201d\u201cWe just reached this conclusion in our heads that, damn it, everything is possible,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201dThere is also a group ensuring that minorities and gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people are heard. \u201cNo one wants to look back and say they stood at the sidelines,\u201d said Lena Waithe, a star of the Netflix series \u201cMaster of None\u201d and part of that working group.Another group is devising legislation to tackle abuses and address how nondisclosure agreements silence victims of sexual harassment. \u201cPeople settling out in advance of their rights is obviously something that can\u2019t continue,\u201d said Ms. Shaw, a prominent lawyer whose clients have included Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Ava DuVernay.Ms. Tchen is spearheading the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which is administered by the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s Legal Network for Gender Equity, and will connect female victims of sexual harassment with lawyers. Major donors include Ms. Witherspoon, Ms. Rhimes, Meryl Streep, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and the talent agencies ICM Partners, the Creative Artists Agency, William Morris Endeavor and United Talent Agency.Time\u2019s Up has also been urging women to wear black at the Golden Globes on Sunday, to use the red carpet to speak out against gender and racial inequality, and to raise awareness about their initiative and the legal fund.\u201cThis is a moment of solidarity, not a fashion moment,\u201d Ms. Longoria said. A vast majority of the women who had been contacted and planned to attend the ceremony pledged to participate, she said.\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve sold these awards shows as women, with our gowns and colors and our beautiful faces and our glamour,\u201d Ms. Longoria said. \u201cThis time the industry can\u2019t expect us to go up and twirl around. That\u2019s not what this moment is about.\u201dAs more women stepped forward, and more men were accused of abuse, a group of female talent agents met at Creative Artists to discuss the problem and explore solutions. The group soon expanded to dozens and, eventually, about 150 participants (it has since doubled as the actresses who joined expanded to New York and London), who meet weekly at the agency and in living rooms across Los Angeles, as well as for daylong workshops.Several of the women said their work with Time\u2019s Up presented a rare opportunity to meet regularly and pool efforts with other powerful women. In an industry overwhelmingly dominated by men, they said, they were usually one of the few actresses on set, or one of the few female writers or producers in a room.\u201cWe have been siloed off from each other,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally hearing each other, and seeing each other, and now locking arms in solidarity with each other, and in solidarity for every woman who doesn\u2019t feel seen, to be finally heard.\u201dNo one can predict whether this burst of energy will lead to lasting changes. Time\u2019s Up members said the meetings had brought disagreements and frustrations as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not as satisfying as finding a silver bullet,\u201d Ms. Ferrera said. \u201cWe all recognize there\u2019s no such thing.\u201d But, she added, \u201cnot taking action is no longer an option.\u201dMs. Rhimes said working with the group of women reminded her of a feeling she got as a child, when her mother took her around the neighborhood in a wagon to register black women to vote. \u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of women used to getting stuff done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re getting stuff done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 2018, it follows many dramas that have interrogated our romantic ideas of the past (\u201cDeadwood,\u201d \u201cThe Knick\u201d), delved into historical crime (\u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d) and followed eccentric investigators\u2019 descents into the dank basements of the criminal mind (\u201cTrue Detective,\u201d \u201cMindhunter\u201d).This is hardly the mini-series\u2019s fault. But it is its problem. Today, \u201cThe Alienist\u201d needs to be assessed for its execution of already familiar genres. Judging from the early episodes, it\u2019s fine: lush, moody, a bit stiff. But it\u2019s nothing to clear your calendar for.Kreizler is called in by the police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Geraghty) as the mutilated corpses of boy prostitutes begin turning up in Lower Manhattan. Investigating the murders at all is something of a radical act. The sex trade involves the interests of powerful men, and the rank-and-file police can hardly be troubled to care about dead urchins.Instead, Kreizler enlists a New York Times illustrator, John Moore (Luke Evans), and Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning), a police secretary whose ambitions of becoming a detective meet with the contempt of her male colleagues.They form a kind of turn-of-the-century geek squad, employing criminal psychology \u2014 a field still separating itself from quackery \u2014 and such newfangled techniques as fingerprint collection, which the police eschew in favor of old-fashioned beatings.Arguably the most compelling crime in \u201cThe Alienist\u201d is in plain sight: the exploitation of poor children, who are seen as expendable precisely because of how they\u2019re exploited. A police officer refers to one of the victims as \u201cit,\u201d because \u201cwhat else would you call a degenerate who dresses himself as a girl for the pleasure of grown men?\u201dMr. Br\u00fchl puts a peculiar, intense spin on a now-familiar figure: the investigator who has to mind-meld with a monster. \u201cOnly if I become him,\u201d he says, \u201cif I cut the child\u2019s throat myself, if I run my knife through the helpless body and pluck the innocent eyes from a horrified face, only then will I come to truly understand what I am.\u201dThat speech is played for creeps, and like much of \u201cThe Alienist,\u201d it would be twice as good with half as much lurid, Grand Guignol underlining.Still, the attention to detail makes for a vivid picture of city life at a time of staggering wealth and shocking poverty. And \u201cThe Alienist\u201d can be a captivating forensic history, if you\u2019re not put off by, say, researchers testing the damage a certain knife can do to a cow\u2019s orbital socket. Just don\u2019t expect it to show you the serial-killer drama through new eyes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Race in America, College Amenities and Loneliness: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events Conversation_________I don\u2019t think that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d - I think that America has always had a dark underbelly. Beneath apple pie, baseball, and the glitz and glamour of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d, there has always been a side that most Americans have the decency to be ashamed of.America was built on slavery and racism, but the credit was taken by Europeans.In school, we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. We read speeches by Lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. In present-day America, we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.Racism has been ingrained into American society. Beyonce\u2019s quote sums it up best. In a speech she gave when presenting Colin Kaepernick with the Muhammed Ali Legacy Award, she said, \u201c...racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.\u201d She is right. America\u2019s dark underbelly should be shamed, it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards, the thing that we apologize for and work to end. It should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. I see the uprisings of racism in high school, unfortunately - it\u2019s not my classmates\u2019 fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. It is America\u2019s fault, it is society, it is generations and generations who failed us.Is America backsliding on race? No. Are individuals backsliding on race? Now that is a different story. I think as a whole, America has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the America we live in today is slightly comparable to the \u201cearlier, uglier\u201d version. I agree with Sterling Tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. Everything needs to be politically correct. Some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. Who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. Do I feel as if America is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? No, I do not. I think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. All over social media whether the person is young or old, white or black, they have something political to say. Racism is a two way street. One race should not be at fault for being more \u201cracist\u201d than the other because wouldn\u2019t that be considered racist too? Ever since Donald Trump has been elected, racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. In my opinion, I think racism is on the rise, and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism.I feel as if racism is on the rise we\u2019ve had plenty of killings in the United States on the account of another race not liking African Americans and it\u2019s not fair. Being a young African American lady I have experienced a lot of racism as I\u2019ve gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. I get on social media and run across racism. But its going to continue to be on the rise because Americans let this be acceptable.Do I believe that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d? No. America has always been ugly, it\u2019s just covered up. America has a foundation of prejudice, and many minorities suffer from this today. The fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly.Since the election of Trump, more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. I have certainly heard racial slurs in person, but where I see the most insensitive comments is on social media. I see people responding to Trump\u2019s barbaric tweets about immigrants, people say that \u201cOnly REAL Americans should be here\u201d. My response to that is that any of us who are black, white, or asian are not \u201creal Americans\u201d, we trace back to elsewhere. The only true Americans race was nearly decimated. In fact, the people who are often told to \u201cgo back to their country\u201d are Mexicans and people from Central and South America. What many don\u2019t understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount Native American ancestry.Therefore, this is their country. They\u2019re the \u201creal Americans\u201d.I believe that America is turning back \u201cinto an uglier version of itself\u201d because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. This idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. This is not fair because everyone is born equal, and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. Donald Trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the \u2018way to make America great again\u2019 and to get rid of the people that don\u2019t belong. The people that don\u2019t belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. In this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief._________What London is doing is a great need of society today. Neighbors don\u2019t talk to each and people just don\u2019t care about each.Yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? How many people here in the last year or so have1. Picked up medicines for a sick person 2. Consoled a grieving soul. 3. Sat with an elderly person 4. Sat with a friend and lent them an ear.We talk about all the big issues in the world but don\u2019t we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with.Anxiety, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. We all face it, whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time, loneliness never seems to go away. Young or old, friendly or shy, confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous, illness creator, so why not arm ourselves against? In the U.K, they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness, and how more than 200,000 Britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! The fight against this battle starts in the U.K with a minister for loneliness, but in the U.S, no action has been made. We have almost 5X as many residents as the U.K, and I will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness, and still no action. We arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer, so why not try and fight loneliness. Just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. Just one group \u2026 one difference maker._________I don\u2019t plan on going to college so I can lounge around and sit in a lazy river, especially one that my friends and I paid 85 million dollars for. According to the article, tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. Now if that\u2019s true; then I want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students\u2019 money, but this time, for completely useless renovation projects. How could anyone in good faith, knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. I truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that I\u2019m just going to be in debt for even longer after I get out of college.I completely agree with the author of this article. Student debt is a huge problem in the US, and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. College is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in, and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in, and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. Colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics aren\u2019t helping. While it is true that students need to relax, having expensive amenities won\u2019t make or break that\u2013there\u2019s plenty to do on campuses alreadyAfter perusing the article about the \u201ctop 25\u201d in the nation, I believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. There are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. In the beginning of this article, amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. As I looked through the attached top 25 article, my opinion changed. Some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance, such as a lazy river or bowling alley. On the other hand, if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus, then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. Having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science, or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college, where you get to study what you want and find your true self. Going to a college with amazing classrooms, labs, and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there.Watch out \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re falling into the same trap that the author warns about. When you use language like \u201cfind your true self\u201d and \u201cunforgettable experiences\u201d, you\u2019re falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. If you take both your coursework and your education seriously, your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. College can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration, but don\u2019t idealize it too much.College will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply, and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value, and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. But \u201cfinding your true self\u201d is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.You\u2019re right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new, upgraded laboratories. If you want to study sciences, that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities, and if you want to study art, a new art gallery on campus may provide value. If your dream is to study history, though, you\u2019re much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access, though \u2014 not a fancy new humanities building. Be very discerning about what resources you actually need, and be realistic about what resources you\u2019re likely to take advantage of.There is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. They may be nice to use, but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. At L.S.U., the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. This is not something they should have to use fees for when they\u2019re already on a tight budget. Textbooks, tuition, and food costs add up.Adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions, but that shouldn\u2019t be their number one priority. They should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. A student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool, they should go there because the school offers amazing classes, fits what they want to major in, and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful.Lavish amenities attract students. But they also harden people against forgiving student loans.I think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. College students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum, and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. These amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. Studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful.Water parks are nice, but students, parents, alumni, and\u2014yes, members of the school\u2019s oversight board\u2014should have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. Students, why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach, or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? Campus leaders, why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (Outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the school\u2019s liability should a student get hurt\u2014admins, are you listening?) If I were a college student today, then the last thing I\u2019d want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus that\u2019s causing me stress!_________My family has many cooking traditions, some new and some old. Spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, my mother\u2019s homemade green chili, and my father\u2019s famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my family\u2019s diverse food catalog. No matter what happens earlier that day, I can always count on my parents to make a delicious, home-cooked dinner. New recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with.Just the other night, my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas, chicken, rice, mushrooms, and spices in it. I am very open to trying new foods. This is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and I were younger: Two bites of everything. No exceptions. Full, complete bites. This rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether it\u2019s escargot, alligator, calamari, sushi, or just a simple steak.My family and I don\u2019t really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions, but we have made some of our own that I\u2019m sure will be passed down. These traditions are usually held on the holidays. On Superbowl Sunday, if that\u2019s considered a holiday, my sister and I have a dessert cook-off. We don\u2019t really pick who wins or losses(even though I\u2019m the obvious winner), instead, we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game.Another tradition we have falls on Christmas. It is called the Kong Fu Panda Pizza. I believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the Kong Fu Panda after eating it. It is rolled out croissant bread with eggs, cheese, and bacon bits on top. A couple days later, New Year\u2019s Eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own, homemade Coke Floats.Lastly, there\u2019s a tradition that has died out that I wish we would decide to continue. It would happen on Sunday after church. My family and my cousin\u2019s family would all go to my grandma\u2019s for a big, home-cooked lunch. We would have green beans, peas, fried chicken, barbeque, slaw, biscuits, and potatoes; finished off with a nice, cold glass of sweet tea. Later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.I thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have, but I wish we had more. I love food and it\u2019s something that everybody can relate to. It also brings people together.My family and I have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. For example - for all holidays, we cook a variety of German food - Kebassi, Spaetzel, etc. We also make Slovakian food, such as a really good recipe for Bondukis. When I personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen, it makes me feel like I\u2019m really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. I can celebrate my German and Slovakian culture, and learn more about it, while I help cook. My parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake, so, it helps me to feel more informed.In the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. We top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. In the winter time my family eats Ukrainian perogies and soup. These are an everyday meal. My favorite time is summertime because I get to spend time with my family outdoors. Participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people I love eating what I love.My parents were both raised in lower middle class households with Northern European lineages; essentially, meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word.They were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up, turning to more exotic fare. They raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. My mom loves to reminisce about the time that I asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. I grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. My parents\u2019 refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual, ready to try almost anything you put in front of me!_________I think this political cartoon relates to President Trump\u2019s recent comments about certain countries. Many of you may know the inappropriate things our President said, in spite of our country\u2019s reputation of acceptance of many cultures, whether they are wealthy or not. The statue of liberty now reads: Give Me Your Norwegians. People should be able to come from anywhere, by choice. The statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag, symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by President Trump\u2019s actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process.President Trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. He says it is because of terrorism, or because they are not wealthy countries, but in reality it is just people who are not like him. President Trump is shutting out the rest of the world, isolating our country. Multiple countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, Chad, and predominantly Muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time Trump\u2019s presidency is over. This will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. Immigrants do not steal our jobs, they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. Immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our \u201cfree\u201d nation.The cartoonist is using the comment on the Statue of Liberty to send the message that President Trump\u2019s recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. The cartoonist is implying that America only wants to have white, law abiding immigrants come to our country. This is the complete opposite position the US had in late 1800\u2019s/early 1900\u2019s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the US for a better and brighter future. But the other implied message is that the US has a big immigration problem, which needs to be handled very carefully. Unfortunately, I do not think that the US will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. I also feel that President Trump should really think before he speaks or Tweets, because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously.The original inscription on the Statue of Liberty is well know for the phrase, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019 s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what America is supposed to represent. This political cartoon In is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. The Statue of Liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable._________I feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO\u2019s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will \u201cstop significant touch-ups of images\u201d.Every weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world.The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don\u2019t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone.The world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the \u201cgive me this, give me that\u201d norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. \u201cWhere does this product come from?\u201d, \u201cIs this brand cruelty-free?\u201d, \u201cDoes this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?\u201d, and \u201cHow does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?\u201d are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed.Even if a company isn\u2019t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us.I think in the past, companies didn\u2019t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities.One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company\u2019s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create \u201ca new capitalism\u201d by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don\u2019t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate.When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years.When it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it\u2019s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase.For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no \u2018Our Story\u2019 page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That\u2019s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren\u2019t as fortunate as me.Milton Friedman said \u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities\u201d, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative.It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called \u201cGen X\u201d, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn\u2019t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it.The extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that \u201cmake short term sense\u201d but eventually threaten their \u201clong term viability,\u201d as said by Jana in the article.Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock\u2019s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, \u201cWe know that we\u2019re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!\u201d, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I\u2019ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it.I think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap?_________What do you do when there\u2019s nothing to do? You take out your phone. What do you do when there\u2019s something to do? You take out your phone. Replace \u2018phone\u2019 with \u2018cigarette\u2019, and we\u2019re back in the 50s. Unlike cigarettes, though, phones don\u2019t have addiction warnings. Like cigarettes, they should. In German, there\u2019s one word for both \u2018addiction\u2019 and \u2018dependence\u2019. When we\u2019re addicted to something, it\u2019s synonymous to being dependent on it. Instead of asking yourself if you\u2019re addicted, ask the following: \u201cDo I take out my phone when I\u2019m in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being?\u201d If the answer is yes, you\u2019re dependent, ergo, addicted. \u201cDo I take out my phone the moment I feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air?\u201d Yes? Addicted. Dependent. Obsessed. Possessed. You name it.Phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. It is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. I think of it as like eating junk food. You need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. Fast food companies don\u2019t go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc. It is up to us to make that choice for ourselves.I think phones should not come with addiction warnings. Tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. It is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. I feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings, the overall outcome wouldn\u2019t change. Yes, there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage, like phones giving a report on how you spent your time, but in the end it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary. People know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. It is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not.It is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device, the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. People use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance, people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. Now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company.The most I would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because it\u2019s like buying Netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people don\u2019t get addicted to it and slack off on their work.With the addition of smartphones, Smart speakers(Alexa and Google Home), and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore, were always connected.The threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. If Apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then I believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. Because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: The Euphoria of \u2018One Day at a Time\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine a Netflix show about a divorced Latina veteran with PTSD. Her ex-husband has rejected their lesbian teenage daughter. Her best friend is in recovery and active in AA. Her mother can be overbearing and has also secretly stashed a gun in their shared apartment.This should probably be a gritty drama, or maybe a sour-smart single-camera auteurish dramedy. Instead it\u2019s the beautiful, improbable \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a multicamera family comedy.The show debuted last year to positive reviews but still displayed some freshman awkwardness. In its second season, available Friday, it\u2019s closer to its ideal state of flow, putting character ahead of plot and trusting itself and its moments a little more.Justina Machado stars as Penelope \u2014 sometimes Lupe, sometimes Lupita \u2014 a single mom, nurse and veteran raising two children with the help of her widowed, immigrant mother, Lydia (Rita Moreno, the brightest star in our solar system). This season Penelope gets a viable love interest, the almost unbearably hunky Max (Ed Quinn), a veteran himself and an EMT. He towers over the rest of the cast, and the moment he\u2019s on screen opposite Lydia, it\u2019s impossible not to think \u201cI hope that giant man picks up Rita Moreno.\u201d He does \u2014 it takes a few episodes, but it is worth the wait.Season 1 had a more urgent through-line about the teenage daughter Elena (Isabella Gomez) eventually coming out to her family in the lead-up to her quincea\u00f1era. This season doesn\u2019t have one central story, and that lack of a to-do list is a blessing and a curse: The show is looser and funnier than before, but it also sputters a little toward the end of the season, before an emotional finale that walks right up to but does not cross the corniness barrier.Lines like that really only work in a multicamera format, a structure that relies on present laughter as part of its punctuation. Studio audiences make shows feel bigger, and \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d is a show that\u2019s big \u2014 maybe even broad \u2014 with its line deliveries, its staging, even in its sad moments. CBS\u2019s \u201cMom,\u201d about a formerly estranged mother-daughter duo, is another current multicamera show with edge and depth (and that network\u2019s \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d remains wildly popular). But otherwise this is a style that\u2019s become unfashionable, something comedy nerds sneered at; \u201claugh track\u201d is shorthand for not merely unfunny but also worthy of scorn.If any show could re-establish the format as a place for innovative, modern comedy, it\u2019s \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d energetically political and progressive. Partially that\u2019s because the show hails from the executive producer Norman Lear, alongside the creators Gloria Calderon Kellett and Mike Royce. Mr. Lear helped popularize the modern incarnation of the multicam comedy, with shows like \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and \u201cThe Jeffersons.\u201d That rhythm became the standard for family comedies right on up through, say, \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond.\u201d Then the tides turned, and single-camera shows like \u201cModern Family\u201d or \u201cblack-ish\u201d are now the standard bearers.So despite its retro vibe, \u201cDay\u201d feels almost daring. Its lack of cynicism makes it easy to marathon and also sets it apart from the revered comedies of the moment, like \u201cVeep\u201d or \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d Its devotion to that straightforward sitcom setup makes it more accessible than shows like the highly serialized \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d or the structurally inventive \u201cAtlanta.\u201d It\u2019s suitable for most ages, but without the crushing inanity of a \u201cFuller House.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "487 Original Programs Aired in 2017. Bet You Didn\u2019t Watch Them All.", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Too many TV shows to choose from?You\u2019re not alone.At least 487 original scripted programs aired in 2017, the latest record-breaking figure for the TV industry, according to data released Friday by the cable network FX.That was more than the 455 shows that broadcast in 2016, more than the 288 in 2012 and far more than the 182 from 15 years ago.In 2013, the year that Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d premiered, online services distributed only 24 original programs. In 2017, that number skyrocketed to 117.Others are responsible, too, though. In the last five years, premium cable has seen 45 percent growth in the number of original programs and basic cable networks a 40 percent rise, and even the broadcast networks have grown by 29 percent, according to FX. This doesn\u2019t even include the large number of non-scripted reality or documentary series.Even lesser-known shows are plugging along. \u201cFuller House,\u201d a Netflix revival of the old ABC family sitcom, released its third season, to little fanfare, last year.\u201cSomeone will tweet me, and they will be, like, \u2018I watched all four seasons in two days,\u2019\u201d the Australian comedian Josh Thomas said last year about his show, \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d \u201cThat took me five years to fill that two days,\u201d he added, with an expletive for emphasis.Still, the freewheeling spending of the streaming services has prompted more networks to spend more than they usually would. (A respectable drama costs at least $3 million an episode to make.) It is not clear just how many players will be able to sustain that pace.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the streaming services are putting an enormous amount of pressure on the business model,\u201d John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, said at a news media event on Friday.But cancellations have done little to stop the glut of programming.With all of this content, there remain three players that make what are perceived to be the best TV shows, at least in the past year.FX, HBO and Netflix accounted for 55 percent of the shows on critics\u2019 best-of-2017 lists, according to FX. Netflix had 24 percent, HBO 21 percent and FX 10 percent. The rest were distributed by dozens of other TV networks, like NBC, Showtime, Hulu and AMC.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hollywood on the Brink", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou could get whiplash following the news in 2017, and that\u2019s just in the movie world. Was it really less than a year ago that Barry Jenkins accepted the Oscar for best picture for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d but only after the mix-up that seemed to give the award to \u201cLa La Land\u201d? That was a mistake that read like a metaphor for an industry that remains intransigently, at times cluelessly, white.The Times\u2019s chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discuss some of the high and low points of an extraordinary year.We \u2014 as writers and critics, as consumers of popular art, as a culture \u2014 have a lot of rethinking to do. One of the mantras of the moment is that \u201ceverybody knew\u201d about what the predators, rapists and gropers were doing, and that the ubiquity of such behavior was an open secret. That\u2019s a tricky phrase, of course, and it invites observers of the industry to assess our own complicity. Is the open secret that men in power frequently behave despicably and with impunity? Or does it involve the particular things Mr. Weinstein, Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, Mr. Lasseter, Mr. Ratner, Dustin Hoffman and others (so many others!) are alleged to have done? What did we know, and how did we know it?I\u2019ve liked and loved some of Mr. Allen\u2019s movies, and loathed others, but I\u2019ve always put the allegations against him aside because he wasn\u2019t charged and I wanted to review the work, not the man. Even so, Mr. Allen\u2019s movies can be hard to take if you\u2019re a woman. He has written great female characters \u2014 given humanity by brilliant performers \u2014 but too many are ditzes, shrews and dewy young things gaga over uncomfortably older men and Allen stand-ins. \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d manifests some of his worst tendencies; the sexism is overt and his blurring of life and art is repellent. In my review, I cited his marriage to Ms. Previn and Dylan Farrow\u2019s allegations, a history I\u2019ve seen as a malignant cloud. I had never referred to that history before because I hadn\u2019t seen it in the work. Now I did.Mr. Weinstein was fouling up the air when I wrote my review, so sexual assault was certainly on my mind. But as you said to me when we later talked about the movie, it also felt as if Mr. Allen were trolling his critics.But the idea that you could separate the art from the life, a conceptually and practically incoherent notion in any case, is as ludicrous for him as it is for Louis C.K. The principal subject of Woody Allen\u2019s work has always been Woody Allen, and his insistence on putting himself into the picture leaves his defenders in the distasteful position of having to choose between denial and apology: Either \u201cbecause I like his movies, I can\u2019t bring myself to believe he molested his daughter,\u201d or \u201cbecause I like his movies, I have decided not to care if he molested his daughter.\u201dNot that I can exactly let myself off the hook. Long before I became a film critic, I was a Woody Allen obsessive. I\u2019m hardly unusual among men of my generation for having learned a lot of what I know (but was afraid to ask) from him. About sex, Jewishness, literature, New York and a whole lot more \u2014 about myself, in sum. I kept his books by my bedside for most of my adolescence, and saw his movies over and over. It\u2019s not possible for me to separate art from life \u2014 his life or mine.This isn\u2019t just a matter of individual behavior. The boundaries of complicity have not yet been mapped, and the purging of the bad guys has an air of corporate damage control. If the creeps can be expunged, maybe the system can survive. It shouldn\u2019t. The stories that continue to emerge, in every industry, add up to more than just a catalog of crimes. They constitute a case for reparations.The movie business might start by designating a pool of money \u2014 maybe equivalent to the value of the Miramax and Weinstein Company libraries, and the budgets of every Brett Ratner film and some fraction of Pixar\u2019s worldwide revenues \u2014 to fund movies written and directed by women. Some people might see that as a threat to meritocracy. I would challenge those people to use the words \u201cBrett Ratner\u201d and \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in the same sentence. The idea that Hollywood functions by rewarding excellence is laughable on its face.At the same time, the end of the old Fox and the Disneyfication of the entire movie mainstream are bleak.Advertisement"}

Our results, over the past several years, including 2017 and the insurance charge, only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape GE.\u201dIt\u2019s more likely that Mr. Flannery and his team will consider unique ways of separating G.E.\u2019s core business units without actually splitting them completely apart. But it\u2019s all somewhat speculative at the moment.It is now abundantly apparent that the previous management team led by Jeff Immelt had little handle on the comings and goings of all the pieces of this sprawling conglomerate. The reasons for keeping GE together \u2014 shared resources and technology \u2014 look increasingly tenuous. If you ask employees, they don\u2019t really see the benefit of having both a power and an aviation business, for example.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Michael J. de la MercedThe attorneys general said the rollback of so-called net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and a reversal of a longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.The petition to begin the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court of Appeals in Washington, is the first legal challenge against the F.C.C.\u2019s order in December. Several others are expected, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and Free Press, which argue that the F.C.C.\u2019s order was harmful to consumers and was done hastily and without proper public input.The numbers\u201cWith Ferrero we have found an exceptional home for our U.S. confectionery business where it will thrive. At the same time, this move allows Nestl\u00e9 to invest and innovate across a range of categories where we see strong future growth and hold leadership positions, such as pet care, bottled water, coffee, frozen meals and infant nutrition.\u201dThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOne of Elliott\u2019s first campaigns of 2018 sees the activist hedge fund going even further abroad: Its latest target is Bezeq, the once-government-owned Israeli telecom company. The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.The context Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.What Elliott wants\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the companyAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.What could lie aheadBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release. (More on that below.)The backstoryThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firstQualcomm unveiled its first official \u201cfight letter\u201d in its campaign to beat back Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for the chip maker.Among the highlights of the letter:\u2022 Qualcomm says that it will deliver between $6.75 and $7.50 in pro forma earnings per share for its 2019 fiscal year.\u2022 A pledge to continue the company\u2019s its cost-savings program.\u2022 A reiteration that Broadcom\u2019s offer ignores the upswing that the emerging 5G wireless standard will bring for Qualcomm\u2019s stock.Broadcom is asking Qualcomm stockholders to voluntarily transfer to a hostile acquirer the considerable near- and long-term value creation Qualcomm has in front of it. It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.The secondRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done \u2014 but at a higher price.Should Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s a look at its results by the numbers:\u2014 Stephen GrocerGoldman\u2019s commodities unit has been under scrutiny both within the bank and among investors since it revealed its second-quarter performance was the worst in its post-IPO history. That triggered an informal review of the unit and several high-profile departures, including global commodities head Gregory Agran.The bank\u2019s commodities earnings in the final three months of 2017 were better than the previous two quarters as losing natural gas trades were closed. Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.Goldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time.It took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.And it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\u2014 Stephen GrocerVia ValueWalk:Despite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.More in corporate social activism \u201cThese guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures.\u201dIn other media deals:A few years ago I met with a very successful entrepreneur who built his company outside of the tech sector. When I asked him about equity compensation he said to me \u201cYou people in tech are crazy. I pay my employees handsomely in cash and I keep all of the equity for myself.\u201dHe adds:We should be confronting the true cost of this practice and asking ourselves if it is best for our employees, and if so, which ones, and if it is best for our companies and our shareholders.The tech and telecom flyaround\u201cWe talk to everybody, and we are continuously learning and making selections on the basis of the best available technology.\u201dMr. Marchionne also confirmed that this will be his last year leading Fiat Chrysler, with a successor to be named in March.The Detroit Auto Show flyaroundThat\u2019s an actual question posed in a private forum that was sent to us by a reader this weekend.Investors \u201cshould be prepared to lose all their money\u201d in Bitcoin, said Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong.The digital money flyarounddamageAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Can Hit a Wall Riding at Home", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMe TimeBetween living alone and working at home, and food delivery, Netflix and FaceTime, I sometimes feel like a particularly luxe and cheerful agoraphobe. But exercising remains something I have to leave the house for.Maybe not for long, though. There\u2019s no excuse that applies to trekking to the gym if it\u2019s a few yards from your bed. The exercise world seems to be banking on at-home workouts as the next big thing. Exercise classes at home have long been around \u2014 I have a visceral memory of the Jane Fonda VHS tapes my mother had when I was a kid \u2014 but this is a new world of fitness brand names and variety.Indoor cycling classes like SoulCycle and Flywheel are my cardio of choice. You\u2019re in and out in 45 minutes, you sweat, and it\u2019s usually so dark that no one can see me trying to cycle and dance to French Montana at the same time. But if you add the $30-something for a class in New York, plus the subway or taxi home, it\u2019s an expensive habit, even if I justify it as healthy. As my father pointed out after I did a 90-minute SoulCycle class on Thanksgiving that cost almost $70, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you just run outside?\u201dI like the idea of being someone who works up a sweat every day, so I decided to try out the Flywheel program. For $1,699, Flywheel will deliver you a bike. For the purpose of testing, I rented mine from the company for two weeks. The bike doesn\u2019t take up a great deal of space \u2014 it sits on a mat the size of a large beach towel \u2014 but if you don\u2019t have a sprawling home, there\u2019s the matter of where to put it.I live in a one-bedroom apartment and kept it between my sofa and a bookshelf, so close that I could reach out with my left hand and touch the Bible in French or a biography of Judy Chicago if I need inspiration. When not in use, the bike was always there, a bit of an eyesore that sometimes served as a laundry rack.I connected my iPad to the Flyweel app (there is a bike with a built-in screen) and browsed. There are live classes where you can ride along in real time with the New York studio or you can choose an on-demand class, which range from 20 to 60 minutes. There are classic Method classes with cycling and the signature pipe-shaped weights (a two-pound and a four-pound come with the bike). Power is a more intense ride; Beats is rhythm based. You can also take the off-bike workouts like FlyBarre and Stretch & Recover.What makes Flywheel particularly precise and beloved by a certain Type A fitness freak is the TorqBoard, a screen that shows how hard you\u2019re working in relationship to everyone else in class. You can opt out if you prefer not to know or share, but because of masochistic tendencies, I always keep mine on. It displays real time data, including your speed and exertion and power.I put on a 30-minute class and started riding. The first song was \u201cTwo Princes\u201d by the Spin Doctors. Normally this would be the part of class where I begin a long internal monologue about how no one should be spinning to bands that played at the Wetlands in the \u201990s and why aren\u2019t we listening to Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 but then I remembered that I could turn off the music. Or at least turn it way down. You can modulate how much of the instructor or music you hear, so if it\u2019s a class you\u2019ve taken before, you can adjust toward music; if you hate the music, you can adjust for the instructor and put on your own, as I did.\u201cI don\u2019t know your life,\u201d she was fond of saying. Or, \u201cWhat if this was your best ride ever?\u201d Alas, it never was. I reliably ended most classes second to last on the TorqBoard.At home, distractions are unavoidable. One morning I paused a class 10 minutes in to investigate a strange noise and ended up getting locked out on my fire escape wearing nothing but a sports bra, leggings and socks in 23-degree weather. After one of my neighbors came home and managed to unlock me, I changed my socks and got right back on the bike. If there\u2019s one thing at-home exercise can do, it\u2019s keep you loyal to a routine.Midway through, I cheated and went to SoulCycle. I missed the energy of other people in the room and the smell of the grapefruit candles, which made the workout seem somehow more fulfilling. A week exercising at home taught me that I really prefer to leave the comforts of my apartment. Plus I ran into an acquaintance who told me an uplifting anecdote about the great sex she was having with her new boyfriend. That doesn\u2019t happen at home.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s no shortage of alternatives in this streaming age of Peak TV, and a mainstream network with advertising will be hard-pressed to compete with the commercial-free HBO and Netflix, which Kevin Kay, the network president, said are two of the Paramount Network\u2019s main competitors. Also, enticing big-name talent to a fledgling network with no track record is hard enough, let alone one that began life airing WWE bouts, \u201cBaywatch\u201d reruns and specials with names like \u201cThe 100 Most Irresistible Women.\u201dParamount Network, which bills itself as \u201ctelevision\u2019s destination for premium entertainment and storytelling,\u201d will showcase original programming (about a third of the schedule), supplemented by TV series and feature films culled from the Viacom and Paramount vaults (\u201cPitch Perfect,\u201d \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d). There will also be many fewer showings of \u201cCops.\u201dThe network was set to begin its new life with a live episode of \u201cLip Sync Battle\u201d on Thursday, Jan. 18, followed on Wednesday, Jan. 24, with its first big offering, \u201cWaco,\u201d a mini-series about the botched siege of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. The show epitomizes the network\u2019s chase for the cinematic, with grand vistas; a fully reconstructed Texas compound; and name actors, including Taylor Kitsch (\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d) as David Koresh, and Mr. Shannon as the F.B.I. hostage negotiator tasked with bringing him in.Inhabiting the role of that embattled cult leader, accused pedophile and wannabe rocker took its toll, Mr. Kitsch admitted. \u201cIt took two months to come out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, and counseling.\u201dThe new name of the network probably helped lure Mr. Costner, too. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he shows up for Spike,\u201d Mr. Kay said.One of the biggest departures for former Spike lovers will be \u201cHeathers,\u201d which veers wildly from the original. In the new series, Ms. Doherty\u2019s character, Heather Duke, is a gay male, while Heather NcNamara is now African-American. And the leader of the crew, Heather Chandler, is no longer a svelte blonde but a brunette self-described \u201cplus-sized girl.\u201d\u201cIt was so nice to read a character who\u2019s described as a big girl, someone who would be the teased, bullied person in the original movie,\u201d said the new alpha bully, Melanie Field, a veteran of Broadway musicals (\u201cEvita,\u201d \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d). \u201cAnd then to see her in a position of power, to see her saying, \u2018This is who I am, I\u2019m going to claim my power,\u2019 I just found it really liberating and exciting.\u201dDespite the changes, there will still be frequent nods to the 1989 movie for the fiercely loyal \u201csuperfans\u201d of the original, said Jason Micallef, the series creator and showrunner.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we taped over the original,\u201d he said.To ensure Paramount Network had a decent stable of original shows in its first months, Viacom also transferred some properties from TV Land. \u201cNobodies,\u201d a comedy produced by Melissa McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, about the hangers-on of the show-business world, begins its second season in the spring. And both \u201cHeathers\u201d and \u201cAmerican Woman,\u201d a forthcoming comedy starring Alicia Silverstone and Mena Suvari set amid the sexual revolution of the 1970s, were originally slated for TV Land.Paramount Network is also holding on to Spike favorites like \u201cInk Master\u201d and \u201cBar Rescue,\u201d as well as \u201cLip Sync Battle,\u201d that dying network\u2019s biggest ratings hit.Further down the line, the screenwriter Tracy Oliver (\u201cGirls Trip\u201d) and the producer Karen Rosenfelt (\u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d) are working together on a serial version of the 1996 film \u201cThe First Wives Club,\u201d while David Shore (\u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d) is developing an adaptation of \u201cAccused,\u201d the award-winning BBC series.\u201cI went in hard,\u201d Mr. Cox said, \u201cbut we were told no matter what, the two of them didn\u2019t want to be anywhere with commercials.\u201dBut what Mr. Cox and other executives say they can offer the creators of TV shows is a lot more attention and care than, say, Netflix. The hope is to form a stable of show creators who will return for future projects and to secure those elusive hits that can define a network.\u201cWe\u2019re going to curate our shows like a museum,\u201d Mr. Cox added. \u201cWe are going to pick really beautiful pieces, but we\u2019re not going to just pile all kinds of stuff in here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re talking about the sort of heartland populated by average-looking people meant to be made poetically interesting by their exotic brides (from Australia!), dying words (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d) and symbolically sadistic late-night film taste (one vindictive woman who isn\u2019t Mildred is glued to \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now\u201d). Individually, not one of these choices qualifies as a disaster. But they\u2019re conflated here in a way that achieves a grating otherworldliness.This is a revenge movie that\u2019s also a dead-child tragedy that\u2019s also a local-law-enforcement comedy that leaves room for physical comedy, cancer and a bad date. Someone is thrown from a window. Somebody else smashes through one while on fire. And Mildred seems desperate to believe in the power of the billboards as a shaming vehicle for justice. Meanwhile, the issues of the day come and go: brutal police, sexual predators, targeted advertising. It\u2019s like a set of postcards from a Martian lured to America by a cable news ticker and by rumors of how easily flattered and provoked we are.The Martian is actually Martin McDonagh, a playwright from the U.K. \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is his third movie (\u201cIn Bruges\u201d and \u201cSeven Psychopaths\u201d precede this one), and the second set in the United States. He\u2019s a dramatist and a linguist who can be glorious about the ordinariness and misery of duty and work. His plays \u2014 like \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane\u201d or \u201cThe Cripple of Inishmaan\u201d \u2014 tether behavior to state of mind. You believe what people do because they appear to be making the choices \u2014 ugly ones \u2014 as opposed to an author you can picture yanking the strings.But his movies are all strings. Often they feel as if other filmmakers are doing the pulling. \u201cIn Bruges\u201d featured two hit men on a chatty stroll in Belgium, and certain people\u2019s passion for it is fit for Valentine\u2019s Day. But it was Tupperware Tarantino to me.To \u201cThree Billboards\u201d admirers and to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the outfit that hands out the Golden Globes, something about the movie rings true or feels timely. That presumption of truth is driving some of the annoyance over this movie. My favorite bad thing about \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is its ambition to play around with America\u2019s ideological and geographical toys.One of the toys is the word \u201cnigger.\u201d Another is the concept of political correctness. There\u2019s a scene between Mildred and a hotheaded dimwit cop \u2014 the racist \u2014 named Jason (Sam Rockwell), in which she baits his racism by calling him a \u201cnigger torturer.\u201d He hits the roof. \u201cPerson-of-color-torturing\u201d is what Jason says you must call it now, with exasperated lament. They volley the word and poke fun at its impropriety. You can tell that Mr. McDonagh relished the application of absurdism to the political correction (he knows \u201cperson-of-color-torturing\u201d really is linguistic torture, maybe even for a person of color). But he also seems to like the loaded nonsense in the sound of the word \u201cnigger.\u201d What you hear in a scene like this is a kind of careless virtuosity. It\u2019s a fun scene that\u2019s sunk by how much fun it\u2019s having with things you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with. The whole movie is like that \u2014 it\u2019s like Mildred \u2014 rude for sport and proud of it.There\u2019s certainly a place for a white artist to poke, laughingly, at our racial and class messes. (Mel Brooks, for instance, excelled at it.) But Mr. McDonagh doesn\u2019t want to do more than poke. The Danish director Lars von Trier tried a more explicit damnation of the United States with \u201cDogville\u201d (2003) and \u201cManderlay\u201d (2005). But I liked the nihilism in Mr. von Trier\u2019s respective approximations of racism and slavery, even if he followed a European habit, especially in documentaries, of diagnosing America\u2019s ills in the least surprising and most patronizing way.For a movie that asks you to behold so much violence \u2014 defenestration and talk of rape, a bludgeoning, a suicide, charred skin, a dental drill that treats a thumb like drywall \u2014 \u201cThree Billboards\u201d feels weirdly benign. Its black comedy doesn\u2019t leave a bruise. The violence curdles into the cartoonish. The movie could be about grace and vengeance, but they\u2019re presented as hoary lessons and hokey contrivances \u2014 happening upon a deer, sharing your orange juice with the madman who tried to murder you, juxtaposing the reading of an inspirational letter with an inferno. There\u2019s no reckoning with anything, no introspection, just escalating mayhem. The mix of the silly and the serious puts the movie in Coen brothers territory. But they can adjust the settings for their cynicism. Even at their worst, they\u2019ve got their finesse. Mr. McDonagh just keeps bashing away.This really is an action movie whose action is played for laughs. Mildred beats up teenagers and tells off priests. Her precision with a Molotov cocktail should land her in the Super Bowl. Ms. McDormand certainly makes the most of the tirade machine Mr. McDonagh has built for her. (Not since \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d has anybody gotten to tell off this many people with this much gusto.) You feel for Mildred, but you fear her more. When she approaches a table in a restaurant carrying a wine bottle, the audience practically begs her not to use it. By this point, Mildred is way past being a mad mommy. She\u2019s Charles Bronson.But she\u2019s not the only bereft mother fueled by vengeance. The foreign language Golden Globe went, in a surprise, to Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cIn the Fade,\u201d which has Diane Kruger as a white German who must endure the legal trial of the neo-Nazi terrorists who killed her Turkish-German husband and their young son. It doesn\u2019t rank up there with \u201cHead-On\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d (2007), Mr. Akin\u2019s masterwork melodramas. It\u2019s too well oiled a machine, too morally simple to be completely satisfying. But it\u2019s more clear-eyed and serious than \u201cThree Billboards\u201d about what it means to inflict pain. Maybe there\u2019s a way to laugh through rage, but Mr. Akin doesn\u2019t know what way that would be. Neither, I would argue, does Mr. McDonagh.Frances McDormand\u2019s leading turn in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d is being praised as one of the finest of her career. But that\u2019s no small claim, considering the variety and power of her filmography thus far.I thought a lot about this movie watching \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d an eight-part, sitcom-length show created by Dan Perrault and Tony Yacenda, on Netflix. It parodies the true-crime boomlet epitomized by \u201cThe Jinx\u201d on HBO, \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d on Netflix and podcasts like \u201cSerial.\u201d And, like \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d the series revolves around jerks. Someone spray-painted 27 penises on 27 cars in the staff parking lot of a high school in Oceanside, Calif. And two student reporters investigate. The prime suspect \u2014 a stoner-skate punk senior named Dylan Maxwell \u2014 has been expelled. The two reporters poke holes in the case against him and explore a gamut of alternative culprits.Like Mr. McDonagh\u2019s movie, \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d takes a circuitous route to earnestly asked philosophical questions about human nature. The show has a breezy confidence that never tips all the way into mockery. But it\u2019s a lot less impressed with itself. It undermines the piety and ethical lapses in nonfiction mystery shows, while sharing with \u201cThree Billboards\u201d a belief in semaphores and that people aren\u2019t any one thing. Also \u2014 and this feels important \u2014 it feels like the people who made this show understand their setting and the people who live there. I\u2019ve never been to Oceanside, but I believe this show\u2019s rendition of it.Even in a setting as generic as an American high school, the show has a sense of place. And it\u2019s a white show whose nonwhite characters don\u2019t feel like objects. I\u2019m not sure what Ebbing is. You can feel that uncertainty in the movie\u2019s cop-out of a finale, in its bewildering loftiness (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d as a character\u2019s last words) and in the coveralls Mildred spends most of the movie wearing. Her job is at a rustic gift shop, but the coveralls point to the harder blue-collar work we\u2019ve seen Ms. McDormand do in movies like \u201cNorth Country.\u201d Here, these clothes signify emotional work, yet they feel like a put-on, too. Three billboards, sure \u2014 but outside a coffee shop in Portland, Ore.The movie isn\u2019t an explicit work of politics, but it reaches something political in certain people in the same way it touches something emotional in others. And yet in arguing about this movie what I don\u2019t want, but where I\u2019m afraid we are \u2014 with lots of film this time every year \u2014 is in another fight over a movie\u2019s politics that manages to leave the movie itself behind.Whose fault is that? We\u2019ve been seduced and bullied into thinking of the awards season as a process of politics. The people who make the movies also run or finance \u201ccampaigns.\u201d There is opposition research, and, in the form of other award shows, primaries, so to speak. And it all culminates with the election night we call the Academy Awards broadcast. So it\u2019s only natural that we tend to think of best picture (and a few of the major, ancillary categories) as a kind of vote in which, while average people have no say, we\u2019re all invested in the symbolism and catharsis of the outcome.\u201cThree Billboards,\u201d which is not based on a true story but does have some reality flavoring, must appear worthy of elected office, in some way. This was at first the illusion presented by the people running the campaigns, and in turn over the years, has become the custom for lots of us.The movie can\u2019t be just the misfire that it is. The enthusiasm for it has to represent the injustice the movie believes it\u2019s aware of \u2014 against young murdered women, their suffering dysfunctional families and black torture victims we never see \u2014 but fails to sufficiently poeticize or dramatize what Mr. McDonagh is up to here: a search for grace that carries a whiff of American vandalism. Of course, few movies can predict their moment, but \u201cThree Billboards\u201d might be inadequately built for this one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Disney Deal Looming, Murdoch\u2019s Empire Is Fractured", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In late summer, Verizon Communications came to Rupert Murdoch with a surprise acquisition offer.Verizon \u2014 locked in battle with AT&T, which was then finalizing its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner \u2014 wanted to buy pieces of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s television and film conglomerate. Representatives of the two companies secretly met at least once to discuss a merger.Mr. Murdoch, 86, shrugged off the talks as uninspiring, according to an associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to maintain his access to the media titan. Verizon declined to comment, but the overture prompted Mr. Murdoch to start to think seriously \u2014 for the first time \u2014 about selling his Hollywood treasures.Not only would a sale solve a business problem, it could solve a family one.Fox News, the company\u2019s financial engine and a hugely influential platform for Republican politics, has been the source of family friction. James, who holds some progressive views, has privately expressed embarrassment about some elements of Fox News, including its sometimes skeptical coverage of climate change, according to the three people who are friendly with him, a stance not shared by his more conservative brother and father.It was becoming increasingly clear to many analysts, investors and Hollywood agents that the three-pronged leadership structure Mr. Murdoch had put in place was not going to work over the long term.The Murdochs declined to be interviewed for this article.Disney\u2019s offer also provided Rupert Murdoch with the opportunity to establish the like-minded Lachlan as his clear heir, putting him in a position to eventually take over Fox News, which Disney was not buying, and the family\u2019s other company, the newspaper-focused News Corporation.At first, Lachlan was unenthusiastic about discarding such a large chunk of the family\u2019s holdings, according to the four people with knowledge of the sales process. Disney would take the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, cable networks like National Geographic and FX, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India.Lachlan understood the threat posed by the technology giants, but he saw less need to rush into Disney\u2019s arms. Most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses were doing quite well.He had also just gotten his family settled in Los Angeles as part of the 2015 management arrangement. The primary property Disney was leaving behind \u2014 Fox News \u2014 was based in New York.Although Lachlan has not yet made a decision, Rupert has made it clear that he wants his elder son to run what they are calling New Fox, which will house Fox News and the other businesses left behind by Disney, including the Fox broadcast network and a chain of TV stations.What James will do is more of a mystery.People close to him say he may try to strike out on his own. Unlike his brother, James has never worked outside the family businesses, other than the hip-hop record label he founded after dropping out of Harvard. His father bought it, bringing James into the corporate fold.A senior job at Disney is also a possibility, but there were \u201cno guarantees of any sort,\u201d Rupert said in the Sky News interview.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said on a call with investors after the deal was announced. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dBeyond the family dynamics, the deal may allow James to finally vanquish memories of his role in the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. He was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff, but a parliamentary committee accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.Moreover, James is likely to emerge with a stake in Disney worth at least $1 billion.\u201cThat\u2019s a good return for putting up with your father for 20 years,\u201d Ms. Enders said.It has been suggested that Rupert could look at buying stations in political swing states, where there is a lot of money to be made in political advertising during election years, to say nothing of potential influence.Some have also mused that Mr. Murdoch may try to combine New Fox with News Corporation, the owner of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. In his interview with Sky News, he brushed aside the immediate possibility. \u201cThere\u2019s logic to it, but we\u2019re not planning it at this stage,\u201d he said.In any case, Mario Gabelli, a longtime media investor whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in 21st Century Fox shares, predicted that Rupert would relish having a voice at Disney, even if the deal did not come with a board seat.\u201cHe now becomes Disney\u2019s largest single shareholder,\u201d Mr. Gabelli said, \u201cwith an ax to grind.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Am I Going to Have to Put Mickey Mouse in \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d?\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow that Rupert Murdoch has agreed to sell much of 21st Century Fox to Disney, there are many questions about what the fallout will be for Fox\u2019s vast and lucrative television properties.On Thursday, at a Television Critics Association news media event, top Fox executives tried to emphasize that it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d \u2014 at least over the next year \u2014 at both the TV studio and the broadcast network.\u201cWe have to operate as if this deal might not go through,\u201d said Gary Newman, co-chairman of the Fox Television group.But if regulators approve the deal \u2014 which Mr. Newman said he expected to happen \u2014 it will disrupt the television industry, consolidating key properties within the Disney fold and potentially sending important producers and executives running for the gates.Mr. Murphy, the creator of hit shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d has a deal with Fox\u2019s television studio, which produces shows for the Fox broadcast network, FX and other channels. Now, he could become one of the biggest free agents in Hollywood.\u201cThree months ago, I thought I would be literally buried on the Fox lot,\u201d he said.Mr. Murphy initially had concerns about the deal, he said, because he has worked so closely with Fox executives for years, and his edgier content is not exactly in keeping with Disney\u2019s brand.\u201cAm I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story\u2019?\u201d he said. (He added that Disney executives had assured him that he would not.)Mr. Murphy said he was reassured by Disney\u2019s successful attempts at integrating companies like Marvel and Lucasfilm and by a phone call with the company\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger.\u201cI\u2019m sort of interested to see what that company is going to look like before I make any decisions,\u201d he said.Another key is the future of the Fox broadcast network. While Fox\u2019s TV studio would become a Disney property, the broadcast network would join the Murdoch-controlled company New Fox, which would also include Fox Sports and Fox News.But without an accompanying TV studio making programs, there\u2019s a strong belief among TV executives that the broadcast network \u2014 responsible for hits like \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201c24\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d \u2014 would be a significantly less ambitious home for TV. With live ratings dwindling for all the broadcast networks, there has been an increased emphasis to buy shows from an in-house studio to keep revenue streams high.Fox executives said Disney management had reassured them that they would not have to soften any of Fox\u2019s edgier content.\u201cThey are not acquiring Fox to somehow turn it into some form of P.G. company,\u201d Mr. Newman said.Dana Walden, co-chief executive of Fox\u2019s television group, said any existing shows on Fox would remain on Fox and not transfer to Disney\u2019s ABC. She also emphasized that space on a broadcast network calendar remained a lucrative property, and that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s new company could ask for an ownership stake in any new TV show that it bought from an outside studio.Still, Ms. Walden, a veteran of the network for more than two decades and one of the most prominent female executives in television, conceded that she had not seen the deal coming.\u201cIt was a little stunning, having worked there for such a long time and having worked so closely with the Murdochs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem to me like that was on the table.\u201dMs. Walden, whose contract is set to expire in the summer, said she did not know what the future would hold for her, either.\u201cI\u2019m going to have a decision to make,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hidden Gems of 2017 Movies Are on ... Netflix?", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIt is a truth universally acknowledged that the first two months of the year are desolate times for movie lovers who prefer to gorge on new releases. Once the holiday season\u2019s tidal wave of blockbusters and prestige pictures has receded there\u2019s not much action beyond the awards season itself. Releasing only chaff during the first two months of the year has been a studio tradition so longstanding that nobody seems to remember the rationale. But even for awards mavens, now is a good time to catch up and explore.During the last week of 2017 I was out of New York, visiting relatives, and one evening circumstances left me alone in their house with a few hours to kill. I ended up using my phone to watch \u201cS\u00e9rie Noire,\u201d a grimy 1979 French crime thriller that I saw maybe 20 years ago, via a pretty grimy-in-itself 16 -millimeter print, and had no expectation to see again. Directed by Alain Corneau, the movie is an adaptation of the novel \u201cA Hell of a Woman,\u201d by the American genre writer Jim Thompson. (Mr. Corneau wrote the screenplay with Georges Perec, the French literary genius who wrote \u201cLife: A User\u2019s Manual.\u201d)The story line of \u201cS\u00e9rie Noire\u201d is jaw-droppingly squalid \u2014 less than 10 minutes into the movie an abusive aunt is pimping her young niece (Marie Trintignant) to a feckless traveling salesman (Patrick Dewaere) \u2014 and the movie\u2019s setting, an impoverished Paris suburb in the depths of a drippy winter, is depicted with such rigor that you suspect the film stock itself of carrying mold. Not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, obviously, and not to make light of trigger warnings, but this movie could conceivably be eligible for at least a dozen of them. But I\u2019ve long found it unnerving and fascinating, and when a friend on social media mentioned that it was available on FilmStruck, I was genuinely surprised.One comes to expect at least a certain amount of the unexpected on a carefully curated site like FilmStruck. That\u2019s less true of Netflix. Still, I\u2019ve always thought the commonly propagated complaint about the dearth of \u201cclassic\u201d films on Netflix something of a straw man. The streaming service has never advertised itself as a curated haven of greatness. People perhaps confuse Netflix\u2019s DVD rental service, which offers a wide variety of older and critically elevated films, with the streaming service, on which you cannot watch \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d or \u201cCasablanca.\u201dTelevision has changed remarkably over the past few years. It might be time for your viewing habits to change as well.My own complaint about the service is more about the presentation of the movies they have than the quality of the movies themselves. It\u2019s no secret that Netflix doesn\u2019t do a great job letting consumers know what more recent critical favorites are available, so if you\u2019re on that site and looking for hidden gems, you\u2019re not going to find them gathered under a category. Nor is it a sure thing that the site\u2019s algorithm is going to recommend them to you.Advertisement"}

The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.There is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.The people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.At the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters. Then it was held by this display triumvirate of Yahoo, MSN and AOL and, separately, search by Google. And it took quite a long time to get here.If you asked anyone in 2009, \u2018Guess what the combined market shares of Google and Facebook will be in 2017,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure there would have been anyone that would have come close.How long do you think will they maintain that position? It kind of depends on what Google and Facebook allocate their resources to, and like everybody else, it depends on how they manage to navigate actual and potential regulatory environments going forward. I think if they were both worried about a thing today, it would be what regulators think about them, because they\u2019re not at the peak of their popularity with those folks at the moment, it would seem to me.I think that\u2019s why people are so interested in the Amazon story and were so interested in the Snap story and were so interested in Twitter\u2019s story \u2014 because everyone\u2019s looking for the next one to break through.What\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to look and feel completely different that disrupts how people interface with the world around them? My guess is that five to seven years from now, there will be at least one company that people will think of in the top five most important enterprises in advertising that simply doesn\u2019t exist now.Imagine a massively emboldened Hulu.If Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.You could have things like day-after episodes of new drama of the Hulu model and then the entire movie libraries of Universal, Fox, Disney, Pixar and all of the other stuff with it.Then what happens if that same group of people says to the broadcasters of the world: \u201cWhat we have here is a working business model of what the studio system plus the broadcast system can look like in a new world, with a tiered-option model based on some combination of live, day-after, on-demand, paid, ad-funded and so forth, and basically you could slice it whichever way you\u2019d like for your market. We\u2019ve got the content block and the technology license block so that everyone can build their own castle in all these markets.\u201dIt may not be owned 100 percent by one company, but it could be a new phenomenon that could be a kind of distributed monopoly, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really thought about.And this could potentially run ads?Because you\u2019re using the same underlying systems, you suddenly have a data pool that crosses all of that content, all of those users and potentially all of those markets. People are asking the question about what\u2019s the third force? That would probably be the answer.What\u2019s another way that could go?I think if I learned one thing over my career, it is that Newton was right: The objects that are in motion stay in motion, and that motion tends to accelerate, hit plateaus and reaccelerate.Given the asymmetry of certain enterprises in the world, you kind of wonder as to whether or not new Disney, with all of its IP, has in fact become the juiciest peach in the world to be consumed by Apple.If Apple was going to make a \u201cone bound and you\u2019re serious\u201d move into the video content business globally, and the provision of video service business globally, it could make sense. You then have most of Hulu and all of the IP in Pixar, Marvel and all of the other things that Bob Iger has been assembling over the years, and you have ESPN. That wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place to start, and they could do it for 30 percent of their market cap.You can on one hand take it at face value and say that Facebook is taking a step back to their roots. The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.The one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?What have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that? It seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news. I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big appetite for Facebook saying, \u201cWe would like 20 news organizations to provide news bulletin programming for Facebook Watch.\u201dWe know there are dozens and dozens of news organizations around the world, or at least a dozen or two that include The Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, the BBC and so on, who are, for the most part, the keepers of truth in news and the people who keep the public informed.And it seems odd to me that if you have aspirations to take up a very significant part of the media consumption time of the public that you do not have an overt policy for the dissemination of news and to participate in the funding of news for your audience.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Second Act: Big-Time Producer", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "From Oscar-winning actress to Emmy-winning producer: After taking charge of her career, she makes deals with HBO and Apple.Supported byA few months ago, Reese Witherspoon realized everything had changed.Not long after that night, she found herself in demand.\u201cIt opened a lot of doors for me,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview this past week. \u201cPeople wanted to be in business with me as a producer in the TV space. My mission was to create television for other women, for other female storytellers that are actresses, other directors and other writers. I think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds.\u201dSince then, Ms. Witherspoon has transformed herself from an actress increasingly frustrated with the roles she was being offered into a producer with a slate of projects that puts her in the company of series creators like Dick Wolf, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.Apple\u2019s top TV executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, said in a statement that Ms. Witherspoon had \u201can extraordinary knack for being a step ahead of the zeitgeist.\u201dThe rise of Hello Sunshine \u2014 with projects centered on strong, complicated women \u2014 syncs up perfectly with the #timesup movement, which counts Ms. Witherspoon as a major player, and gives evidence that the risk-averse Hollywood establishment may have learned something from the blockbuster success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d last year.\u201cPeople are desperate for this kind of storytelling about the female heroes that have always been in the shadows and now are coming into the light,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Ms. Witherspoon, 41, does not have the track record of super producers like Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, who have created hit shows for more than a decade, but she has already put a lot of distance between herself and the pack of actors who run production boutiques as a hobby.Ms. Rhimes, the hitmaker behind \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d who recently signed an deal with Netflix, called Ms. Witherspoon a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d producer.\u201cReese has been very smart about what she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cShe has leveraged her power in a very smart way to get big projects done. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201dCasey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO, said he was impressed by her willingness to get into the minutiae.\u201cReese is a movie star, she has a movie star\u2019s presence, she\u2019s a great actress \u2014 that all goes without saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat surprises people is I can call Reese on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 and have those conversations, saying, \u2018How do we get this deal closed?\u2019 \u2014 and she\u2019ll go off and get it closed.\u201dOne of her recent producing coups was to add Meryl Streep to the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d cast. Along with her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star (and fellow executive producer) Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon lobbied Ms. Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, to come aboard. She said yes in an email to Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman on the day \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was nominated for six Golden Globes. (The show went on to win four.)\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I got that email,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cI called Nicole, and I just started to cry.\u201dThat catharsis was a long time in coming, said Ms. Witherspoon, who had seen a number of her projects wilt. She grew weary of hearing that the industry had reached its quota of female-driven movies for the year. At the same time, she was starring in mostly forgettable movies \u2014 \u201cHow Do You Know\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Knot\u201d \u2014 and her box-office stock was dropping.She took control of her career by making a deeper commitment to producing. An avid reader who often posts photos of her favorites on Instagram, she started optioning book after book, partly motivated by a conversation she had with her husband, Jim Toth, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.\u201cI talked to my husband around that time, when the movies weren\u2019t working for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Are these movies you want to be making?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting for the scripts to come in.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who sits around and waits for the phone to ring. You read more books than anybody I know, so why don\u2019t you start making them into your own material?\u2019\u201cAnd I thought about my mom, who said, \u2018If you want something done, do it yourself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Witherspoon continued. \u201cYou can sit there and complain about it, or you can do something about it. Instead of having people make calls for me, I called every studio head myself: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Reese!\u2019 I\u2019ve known everybody for 27 years. They knew me when I was 14 years old, all of them. I\u2019ve made movies at pretty much every studio. It\u2019s still the same 200 people who are working in our business.\u201dMs. Witherspoon\u2019s previous production company, Pacific Standard, had hits with the 2014 movies \u201cWild\u201d (based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed and starring Ms. Witherspoon) and \u201cGone Girl.\u201d It came to an end in 2016 when Ms. Witherspoon split from her longtime producing partner, Bruna Papandrea.Ms. Witherspoon sought outside investment when she was ready to start Hello Sunshine, striking a deal with Otter Media, a company owned by the Chernin Group and AT&T, which bought a 30 percent stake in her new production house.In addition to the three Apple projects and \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Hello Sunshine has two potential series in the running at ABC and NBC. Several film projects are also in the works. Among them, Fox 2000 has picked up \u201cSomething in the Water,\u201d based on a thriller by Catherine Steadman about newlyweds whose Bora Bora honeymoon goes awry, and Sony\u2019s TriStar Pictures has given the green light to \u201cA White Lie,\u201d based on a 2016 novel \u201cThe Gilded Years,\u201d by Karin Tanabe, about the first black woman to attend Vassar College, in the 1890s.Hello Sunshine, which recently named Sarah Harden, formerly of Otter Media, as its chief executive, also has plans to create short bursts of digital-friendly content. At the moment, though, Ms. Witherspoon is making her name in the producer ranks because of her work in the hypercompetitive streaming market.Her planned Apple series with Ms. Aniston \u2014 the \u201cFriends\u201d star\u2019s return to a lead role in a television series \u2014 was inspired by \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a book by the CNN media reporter Brian Stelter on the so-called morning TV wars. For that one, Apple has pledged to make two 10-episode seasons, without so much as a script written. Two people familiar with the project said Apple would pay $12 million to $15 million an episode. (By comparison, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the costliest shows ever made, has a budget of $15 million an episode for its final season.)Unlike the stereotypical Hollywood producer or celebrity, Ms. Witherspoon is a deep reader \u2014 which has impressed the women who are working with her on Hello Sunshine\u2019s other Apple projects.Colleen McGuinness, a former \u201c30 Rock\u201d writer who is the show runner for the planned series based on a short-story collection by Curtis Sittenfeld, was surprised that Ms. Witherspoon had read the book before their first meeting. When Ms. McGuinness mentioned this, she said, she \u201cgot a look\u201d from Ms. Witherspoon.\u201cWe laughed about it, and I said, \u2018Yeah, most people don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Ms. McGuinness said.During a meeting about the project starring Ms. Spencer, the writer-producer Nichelle Tramble pointed out a book in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s office \u2014 \u201cThe Alice Network,\u201d a novel by Kate Quinn set in the 1940s. That led to a discussion of the lack of female leads in historical dramas.\u201cThat she was such an intense, true and avid reader was very exciting and a little bit shocking,\u201d Ms. Tramble said.Ms. Witherspoon marvels at how the business is changing. A few years ago, she said, prospects were dim for actresses over age 40. She hopes she can help change that in her new role.\u201cYou get older and the phone does stop ringing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, because the people who are writing the stories aren\u2019t 40-year-old women. You write what you know. Well, there were no 40-year-old female screenwriters, and now women of color are writing screenplays and getting them made at big studios.\u201cI\u2019m as incredulous as everybody else,\u201d she continued. \u201cI never thought this would happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201dSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.The market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Netflix Is a Monster, and Apple\u2019s HomePod Arrives Soon", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGood morning! Let\u2019s talk tech.People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.The problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.Then, nothing.A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.It\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.That\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.There\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.It\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 Movies Cause a Rise in Speeding?", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvidence suggests you may want to be more cautious near theaters in April 2020, when \u201cFast and Furious 9\u201d is expected to arrive. Does bad behavior in movies or other media lead people to behave badly? But causality issues plague most studies in this area: People who engage in risky behaviors may prefer to consume risk-glorifying media. These studies also tend to measure attitudes in controlled lab settings rather than in real life.A more promising approach is to analyze natural experiments that show how people actually behave after being exposed to risk-glorifying media.But what does the data show?We also found that rates of extreme speeding increased. For example, the percentage of drivers charged with driving more than 40 miles per hour above the speed limit nearly doubled (though it remained a tiny proportion of the total), to 2 percent of all violations. Additionally, using data on latitude and longitude reported in the tickets, we found that increases in this extreme speeding were concentrated in areas close to movie theaters (often within two miles), consistent with speeding behavior induced by moviegoing.During the three weekends before movie releases, extreme speeding violations were not only less common but were also, on average, farther from the movie theaters (and Route 270).Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that watching Dom Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and crew streak across movie screens can inspire moviegoers to do some dangerously fast and furious driving themselves.

{"Headline": "How Astrology Took Over the Internet", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookBut I think the astrology boomlet owes as much to the dynamics of the modern internet as it does to any sort of cosmic significance about the millennial\u2019s place in the universe. Astrology checks several boxes for viral-happy content: It provides an easy framework for endlessly personalized material, targets women and accesses \u201990s nostalgia. It\u2019s the cosmic BuzzFeed quiz.A lot of the updated signals are aesthetic ones. Old-school astrological images of constellations and line-drawn star signs have been replaced by pastel illustrations and mixed media collages. The dominant look is nostalgic but not staid. (Broadly has called the Co-Star interface, which features high-contrast black-and-white images of rocks and disembodied hands, \u201cchic as hell.\u201d) The rise of astrology, Instagrammable crystals and generalized coven-talk all evokes a throwback for \u201990s kids, who grew up watching \u201cThe Craft\u201d and playing with cardboard Hasbro Ouija boards at slumber parties.The Daily Hunch addresses the issue head-on. A tab on its website, \u201cAstrology Is Nonsense,\u201d explains, \u201cPhysics isn\u2019t happy with the idea that planets are meddling in our love affairs, and confirmation bias keeps us from being dissuaded when horoscopes miss the mark.\u201d Instead, its founder, Ms. Koyfman, presents astrology as a way of filtering the world through a specific narrative. \u201cThis book deals primarily in archetypes. Those are literary devices, not scientific instruments,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe story is cyclical like the seasons, and life, and your Netflix shame spirals.\u201dCrucially, the \u201cstory\u201d astrologists are telling is now capable of unfolding at the pace of the internet. Twitter allows astrologers to push out updates to fans that keep pace with the news, and A.I. and machine learning can churn out predictions at speeds unmatched by flesh-and-blood astrologers. When I plugged my information into Co-Star, it came already stacked with two dozen \u201cupdates\u201d charting my position relative to the stars.

{"Headline": "Sunshine Cinema, a Beloved Manhattan Theater, Goes Dark", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor over a century, the building was a neighborhood cornerstone, first as a church, then as an athletic club, and later as a nickelodeon that drew hundreds of attendees a day to its Yiddish vaudeville performances.On Sunday afternoon, Jackie Colgan, 55, traveled from Brooklyn to the Sunshine to watch \u201cDarkest Hour.\u201d A hodgepodge of graffiti covered the theater\u2019s side doors behind her.\u201cI just love the architecture and the inside,\u201d Ms. Colgan, a teacher, said. \u201cI always feel so special when I\u2019m in there.\u201dThe building was originally a Dutch Reformed Church that was leased to the German Evangelical Mission Church in 1844, according to Judith Thissen, a cinema historian at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.In 1909, the church was bought for $96,000 (or about $2 million in today\u2019s money) and transformed into a theater run by Charles Steiner and Abraham Minsky, one of the Minsky burlesque brothers, Ms. Thissen said. They named the entertainment hall the Houston Hippodrome and it quickly flourished, drawing flocks of Jewish immigrants settling north of Houston Street.\u201cWhat was new when it opened is that for a cheap price, five to 10 cents, it would not only offer moving pictures but also Yiddish vaudeville shows,\u201d Ms. Thissen said.The theater could fit up to 450 people on the old wooden pews, she said.In 1917, the theater was renovated and renamed the Sunshine Theater, Ms. Thissen said.New York City had more than 1,000 theaters in the 1920s, but the Great Depression halted the boom of grand movie palaces and by the 1950s, television became the principal form of entertainment.\u201cThey thought it was going to turn into a horrible nightclub, which it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Nye said.\u201cIt\u2019s very, very rare that movie theaters would spring back to life,\u201d said Brett Leitner, a longtime resident of the Lower East Side and a self-described cinema history buff.\u201cIt was a triumphant story to take this old movie theater and take it back to life as the newest neighborhood theater in decades.\u201dMr. Leitner, a former member of the local community board, was part of a group that petitioned the city to give the theater landmark status in 2016. The petition was rejected because the interior of the cinema had been significantly altered, he said.The building went on the market three years ago.Mr. Nye said the theater \u201cwas doing incredible\u201d financially. But they were paying $8,000 in monthly rent, which they expected would skyrocket at the end of their 25-year lease on Jan. 31.\u201cIt\u2019s the economics. We cannot pay market rent,\u201d Mr. Nye said. \u201cBut we knew this day was coming from Day 1. It was a good run.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re big fans of the Lower East Side,\u201d Mr. Yormak said. \u201cIt really needs more 9-to-5 activity and it tends to be very active, obviously, on a night life basis. We believe there is a real demand for office space and for people to work there during the day.\u201dThe new 65,000-square-foot building will be designed by Roger Ferris and feature retail space on the ground floor. Demolition will begin by March and the new building, which is being branded as 141 E. Houston Street, will be completed in late 2019, Mr. Yormak said.But for many, the cinema\u2019s demolition is yet another example of old New York being steadily superseded.\u201cTo see the revitalization that the Sunshine brought to the Lower East Side turned into another example of hyper-gentrification in the Lower East Side, it\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Mr. Leitner said.On Sunday, Beth and Paul Lieberman arrived early to watch \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201dMs. Lieberman, 63, said she enjoyed the Sunshine for \u201cits different types of movies,\u201d like \u201cPrincess Mononoke,\u201d a Japanese animated movie she took her son to years ago.\u201cYou would only be able to see them here. Here, or the Angelika or the IFC Center,\u201d said Ms. Lieberman, referring to two other cinemas in the area.The theater was to officially close for good after a 10:15 p.m. Sunday showing of \u201cDarkest Hour.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

Elect!\u201dGloria Allred, the feminist lawyer, seemed exactly in her element on Saturday morning in this ski town as she led hundreds of Sundance Film Festival attendees at a Women\u2019s March rally. It was only 22 degrees, and heavy snow was swirling around her. But Ms. Allred charged forth, determined to keep the heat on Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and other powerful men accused of sexual harassment and assault.The moment neatly summed up an evolving Sundance.This is no longer Mr. Weinstein\u2019s freewheeling festival, the one he blasted into the public consciousness with eye-popping deals to bring male-gaze entries like \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d and \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d to theaters. Sundance is now a prime showcase for women \u2014 films directed, produced and written by women; films with female protagonists; special events focused on female empowerment. And most of the distribution deals involve TV sets.But most longtime attendees will tell you that the festival feels no different because the Weinstein Company, with its theater-focused business model, long ago ceded the Sundance marketplace to Netflix and Amazon. Last year, those two streaming services, both official Sundance sponsors, snapped up at least 14 movies, including spending $12 million for \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and $12.5 million for \u201cMudbound,\u201d accounting for more than a third of total festival acquisitions. The Weinstein Company bought nothing.Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, is now the person who reporters for Hollywood trade publications track through the snow.\u201cHarvey was a moment in time,\u201d Robert Redford, who founded Sundance, said at the festival\u2019s opening-day news conference on Thursday.\u201cNobody on the ground here ever gave him a crown,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cHe was just the loudest and the media followed and built him up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as big of a marketplace for finished films as it was in the \u201990s and early 2000s,\u201d said Mr. Bernard of Sony Pictures Classics. \u201cBut it\u2019s still an enormous marketplace for talent: Casting people looking for actors, producers looking for directors and cinematographers.\u201d (One example from recent years: After gaining attention at Sundance for quirky films like \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople,\u201d Taika Waititi went on to direct \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d for Disney.)This year\u2019s primary festival lineup \u2014 122 feature-length films culled from 3,901 submissions \u2014 includes many movies that examine race. \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d starring Daveed Diggs, best known for winning a Tony for \u201cHamilton,\u201d is a raucous, hip-hop-infused story of racism, stereotypes and gentrification. (Mr. Cooper, Sundance\u2019s director, called it \u201cfun, to the point of being sassy\u201d as he introduced it. Reviews are mixed.)Mr. Cooper drew a connection between filmmakers wrestling with race and the #OscarsSoWhite outcry in 2015 and 2016. \u201cIt usually takes about two years for topics to permeate,\u201d he said.Even so, women are front and center at this year\u2019s festival, noted Trevor Groth, Sundance\u2019s director of programming.The actresses Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Laura Dern, Carey Mulligan, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Kathryn Hahn, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Rose Byrne, Daisy Ridley, Blythe Danner, Hilary Swank and Kelly Macdonald all anchor films. And 45 movies were directed by women, including indie stalwarts like Tamara Jenkins and Debra Granik.\u201cIt\u2019s a really plentiful year for women,\u201d Mr. Groth said, \u201cwhich makes us enormously excited.\u201dAll the better to vanquish memories of Mr. Weinstein.Advertisement"}

Each has filmed two seasons with a third on the way. Each features a heroine who feels trapped in her royal role but accomplishes more than is expected of her, while massaging the bruised ego of her husband and consort. Each hopscotches through history, cherry-picking crises and triumphs that fit the demands of episodic storytelling.Where they differ is in how seriously they\u2019re taken. \u201cVictoria,\u201d created and mostly written by the relatively unknown Daisy Goodwin, has received a handful of Emmy and Bafta nominations for music and makeup. \u201cThe Crown,\u201d created and mostly written by the highly credentialed Peter Morgan, has harvested nominations and awards, including a Golden Globe for best drama.So call me shallow, or just contrary, for preferring the breezy, full-blooded pleasures of \u201cVictoria\u201d to the more finely wrought, stiffer virtues of \u201cThe Crown.\u201d Who would have thought that the person for whom the Victorian Era was named would be this much fun?Ms. Goodwin stays true to her conception of Victoria as a combination of coquettish flibbertigibbet, tough proto-feminist and compassionate, perhaps too-good-to-be-true liberal humanist. She recoils when labeled \u201cpleasingly fecund,\u201d suffers through a bout of postpartum depression, is forgiving of the staff\u2019s peccadilloes and shakes hands with the black American actor Ira Aldridge (Ashley Zhangazha) \u2014 an audacious move in that era \u2014 when he comes to the palace to declaim lines from \u201cOthello.\u201dLike a Disney princess, the queen has an almost unerring instinct for the right choice, though the script often stacks the deck in such a way that the choices make themselves. (Victoria\u2019s compassion for the starving Irish is helped along when one of her ministers calls the famine \u201can inevitable period of self-regulation\u201d of what he regards as a shiftless population.)Ms. Goodwin is not immune to clich\u00e9s and on-the-nose metaphors (the constrictiveness of the corset, the sleight-of-hand of French cooking). A too-familiar sickbed scene should not end with the doctor saying, \u201cThe fever has broken,\u201d and yet it does. The need to compress history leads to moments that are maudlin or heavy-handed.But she has a Julian Fellowes-like ability to keep a story moving and fill it with interesting, engaging characters. Diana Rigg, no longer needed in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d joins the cast in high curmudgeon mode as a lady in waiting, a harrumphing embodiment of British propriety and narrow-mindedness. Mr. Sewell briefly reprises his touching portrayal of Melbourne, and Tom Hughes is still fine as the broody but well-meaning Prince Albert (a marked contrast to the conceited simp Matt Smith makes out of Prince Philip in \u201cThe Crown.\u201d)\u201cVictoria\u201d is at heart a love story, or collection of love stories, and while Ms. Goodwin occasionally bogs down in history, she can always get back on solid ground with romance. In Season 2 she introduces, as a counterpoint to Victoria and Albert, an unspoken attraction between a courtier and a civil servant (Jordan Waller and Leo Suter) that\u2019s an unusually complex and moving depiction of a gay relationship.But every episode comes back, one way or another, to Victoria and Albert, and Ms. Coleman and Mr. Hughes make us believe in their tender (but highly physical) attraction to each other, and root for their success. If the lasting image of \u201cThe Crown\u201d is Elizabeth and Philip retreating to separate beds, \u201cVictoria\u201d gives us Little Vicky and her prince, their beautiful heads of hair impeccably tousled, walking hand in hand in the Scottish Highlands. There\u2019s no wrong choice there, but there\u2019s a more immediately gratifying one.Advertisement"}

Barnum, was dismissed by many critics when it arrived in theaters just before Christmas. Uncool. Old-fashioned. Mawkish. And when initial ticket sales were poor, most box office analysts decided \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d was a prime example of Hollywood being unable to pry people away from their Netflix accounts. Better stick to the superheroes and sequels.Similarly underappreciated movies dominated the weekend box office, with \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d (Sony) leading the charge. Derided by most of Hollywood before its release as an act of desperation by a franchise-starved Sony, \u201cJumanji\u201d was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend, collecting about $20 million, for a new domestic total of $317 million. That astounding result is roughly in line with \u201cSkyfall,\u201d the 2012 James Bond hit, after adjusting for inflation.\u201cJumanji\u201d is now closing in on $770 million worldwide.Next came two new dramas \u2014 critical duds both \u2014 aimed at older men, a fickle group that studios rarely focus on anymore. (It\u2019s easier for studios to concentrate on family-oriented mega-movies because they are more likely to attract a global audience.)

It was produced for roughly $30 million by Alcon and Black Label Media, two companies backed by the FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith. Jerry Bruckheimer was also a producer.\u201cDen of Thieves\u201d (STXfilms and Diamond Film Productions), which was independently financed for roughly $30 million, according to the trade news website Deadline.com, took in an estimated $15.3 million. Starring Gerard Butler and Jordan Bridges, \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d is about a grizzled Los Angeles cop who tracks a group of bank robbers.Ahead of the announcement of Oscar nominations on Tuesday, several prestige-minded movies expanded into semi-wide release. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d (Focus Features), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as a British dressmaker in the 1950s, did the best. It sold roughly $3.4 million in tickets at 896 theaters, for a new total of $6.2 million.The darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic \u201cI, Tonya\u201d (Neon) was close behind, collecting about $3 million in 799 theaters, for a total since arriving in limited release on Dec. 8 of $14.7 million.And the gay romance \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d (Sony Pictures Classics) took in $1.5 million from 815 theaters, for a per-screen average of $1,847 and a total since arriving on Nov. 24 of $9.2 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "15-Minute Stand-Up Specials? Netflix Is Trying a New Format", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a move that could have major ramifications for the art and business of stand-up, Netflix announced Monday that it will start releasing 15-minute-long comedy specials.These sets will be filmed live in Atlanta later this year and will focus on respected veterans and young up-and-comers, none of whom are the A-list stars who have typically received the most attention on the streaming giant.The first comics include Aisling Bea, Michelle Buteau, JR De Guzman, Tim Dillon, Sabrina Jalees, Janelle James, Sam Jay, Josh Johnson, Ian Karmel, Jak Knight, Matteo Lane, Max Silvestri, Taylor Tomlinson, Phil Wang, Kate Willett and Emma Willmann.As Netflix has become the most powerful platform in stand-up, this news raises the question of whether the 15-minute set could become a new industry standard in an age of shrinking attention spans. It\u2019s already common for club sets to run around 15 minutes. At the same time, this experiment also may suggest that at a time when podcasts can run for hours and Dave Chappelle releases a 48-minute special taped the previous month, the idea of an industry standard may itself be fading away.Advertisement"}

(It was created by the brothers John Erick and Drew Dowdle, best known for genre thrillers like \u201cNo Escape\u201d and \u201cAs Above/So Below.\u201d) The historical record is clear that the A.T.F. and the F.B.I. severely mishandled both the Ruby Ridge and Waco situations, and in the show\u2019s simplistic account, most depictions of the agencies involve arrogance and incompetence. The major exception to this, not surprisingly, is the portrayal of Mr. Noesner (a typically intense Michael Shannon).The visuals also tend to be stacked against the government \u2014 flak jackets and Humvees versus moms in jeans shielding their screaming children. The Branch Davidians are generally shown as an amiable, levelheaded, fun-loving bunch, who stockpile guns in preparation for the end times but also play a credible cover of \u201cMy Sharona\u201d at a local bar.The Waco timeline \u2014 a bloody, startling shootout leading to a 51-day siege \u2014 is the reverse of a conventional Hollywood tragedy, and it remains to be seen how the Dowdles will handle that challenge. (Episode 3 ends as the siege is beginning in earnest.) In the meantime, if you\u2019d like to re-examine the rise of the anti-government movement in the early 1990s, there are better sources out there, beginning with the PBS documentaries \u201cRuby Ridge\u201d and \u201cOklahoma City,\u201d both available on Netflix.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Drones and Netflix in the Andes, but Sidestepping Google Maps", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief for The Times, based in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What are some of the most important tech tools you have relied on as our reporter covering parts of South America? Lately we\u2019ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with drones here, and not just for filming.It was no surprise to us, either, that drone technology was something that had never made it to the village we were working in. So the \u201cflying camera\u201d was quite an attraction when we arrived at our destination.What about the tools that you use could be better?Google Maps, for one. I mainly work in the Andes, and most anyone who lives in mountains can tell you that the shortest distance between two points isn\u2019t necessarily the route that you want to take. However, Google doesn\u2019t use local knowledge to calculate directions.Recently at a dinner party in La Paz, Bolivia, a friend told me about heading out of the canyon where the capital dwellers live and up to a concert on the plateau that sits above the city. The route his phone had calculated was on a dirt road that went straight up on a 45-degree angle that people generally walked or went up by mule.It reminded me of the stories that every correspondent had about using Google or Waze when I used to cover Israel and the Palestinian territories. Your phone would regularly take you in and out of each as if there weren\u2019t a conflict going on, through military checkpoints and down roads that often ended in a wall put up 10 years before. Even if impassable, it was always the shortest route, Google assured.A correspondent there warned me before I arrived to bring a Kindle \u2014 books were sometimes easier to download than to buy in Caracas, especially best-sellers or anything in English. You also lived in fear of losing things as basic and easy to get as a power cord. Venezuela is a country where people are having trouble finding tires when they get holes in them on the road, let alone Apple products. It is very unfortunate.It\u2019s not uncommon for Venezuelans to come back with a duffel bag filled with just the basics that aren\u2019t for sale in stores anymore: toilet paper, dish detergent, shampoo, sponges. It would get to the point where you were also adding phone chargers, batteries, USB cables, internet routers and anything else you could imagine that plugged into the wall.How has internet connectivity been in the Andes countries, and how do locals use apps or websites like Facebook or Twitter? How do governments use tech for surveillance in those places?That\u2019s a question everyone would like to know. Venezuelan spying can be surprisingly low-tech at times \u2014 opposition politicians regularly turn on the television to hear embarrassing conversations of their telephone calls being aired to the public. It seems a bit of a throwback to the Soviet Union in some ways, rather than Pegasus and the other recent spyware that governments usually reach for.It\u2019s effective, though. Many conversations just don\u2019t happen over the phone, and we find another place to communicate where there\u2019s encryption, like Telegram.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Netflix. There seem to be 10 times more offerings in Latin America than the United States, including many movies that are blocked back home and that I can only rent on iTunes. I would urge anyone who wants to spend days watching good films not available in America to set his or her VPN to Colombia and have a look.Advertisement"}
