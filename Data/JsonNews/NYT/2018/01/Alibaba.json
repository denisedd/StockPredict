{"Headline": "India Clings to Cash, Even as Tech Firms Push Digital Money", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALIGARH, India \u2014 Signs and banners for Paytm, India\u2019s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh\u2019s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads.\u201cPeople recharge in cash,\u201d Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother\u2019s phone.The scene in Mr. Singh\u2019s shop underscores a persistent reality of India\u2019s economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms.\u201cCash is convenient,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google\u2019s products for emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous. You can use it everywhere.\u201dOne reason for tech companies\u2019 optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month.Leading India\u2019s budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India\u2019s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians\u2019 financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.\u201cOur truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,\u201d he said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm\u2019s plans.The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.Mr. Singh\u2019s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm\u2019s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.\u201cWe really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,\u201d said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.Still, the country\u2019s cash economy has endured.Only one-third of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.\u201cPeople feel scared to use these apps,\u201d Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce \u2014 and collect more taxes.Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.\u201cWe have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,\u201d said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. \u201cThat\u2019s our daily job.\u201dThe job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm\u2019s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. \u201cPeople like to spend money on more than just needs,\u201d he said.Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm\u2019s progress because it\u2019s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company\u2019s chief executive, grew up nearby.On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.The problem? Paytm\u2019s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.\u201cThe only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a culturally different country being built.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed research from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.More misconduct newsAndrew\u2019s take:\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them.

A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.The bigger pictureAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown?

The picture provoked a national conversation about the tens of millions of children who live without adequate food, clothing and shelter in the Chinese countryside.Now the government is turning Fuman\u2019s story into a rallying cry for a robust, resilient China.A Communist Party website invited Fuman to the capital over the weekend and celebrated him as a patriotic hero. He waved a Chinese flag in Tiananmen Square, tried on riot gear at a public security bureau and swore an oath to be loyal to China and the ruling Communist Party.\u201cI\u2019ll leave the mountains for sure,\u201d he said during one appearance, according to news reports. \u201cI\u2019ll study hard and become a police officer.\u201dSocial media users circulated memes showing Fuman dressed as a police officer and holding a rifle. Some drew comparisons between the young boy and soldiers who endure harsh conditions protecting China\u2019s border.\u201cMy eyes welled up with tears,\u201d one user wrote of Fuman\u2019s visit on Weibo, a microblogging site.China has a long tradition of lionizing figures who have suffered hardship but kept faith in their country and the Communist Party.Many people were critical of the rush to idolize the boy, though, saying officials were using Fuman as a prop and neglecting the broader issue of rural poverty.\u201cA salute under the national flag is not going to solve anything,\u201d wrote Zhishang Suping, the pen name of one commentator.Others were concerned about the effect of the media hype on Fuman\u2019s well-being.\u201cIn this age of consumerism and amusing ourselves to death,\u201d said a commentary published by China News Service, \u201cit seems everything can be hyped \u2014 fortune, family, charity and even misery.\u201dDavid Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, said the government was using Fuman as an \u201cantidote\u201d to criticism of its treatment of impoverished citizens. He noted that Fuman\u2019s struggle was depicted as one against the harshness of winter, rather than the \u201csocial and political roots of his condition.\u201d\u201cThe invitation to Beijing essentially fuses this narrative of personal struggle with the ruling party\u2019s narrative of national struggle,\u201d Mr. Bandurski wrote in an email.The focus on Fuman\u2019s story helped the authorities \u201ctemporarily avoid painful policy discussions and potential public blame,\u201d said Haifeng Huang, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Merced.\u201cA worthy story has been trivialized,\u201d Professor Huang added.Fuman returned to his hometown on Monday. The family has received about $1,200 in donations, according to news reports, and local youth charities have gotten hundreds of thousands more.In response to Fuman\u2019s story, Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, recently vowed to help finance boarding schools for children who live in isolated rural areas.During his visit to Beijing, Fuman spoke about missing his mother, who left the family two years ago, and wanting to help catch thieves.

{"Headline": "Amazon Wants to Disrupt Health Care in America. In China, Tech Giants Already Have.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology companies like Alibaba and Tencent have made health care a priority for years, and are using China as their laboratory. After testing online medical advice and drug tracking systems, they are now focused on a more advanced tool: artificial intelligence.Their aggressive push underscores the differences between the health care systems in China and the United States.Chinese hospitals are overburdened, with just 1.5 doctors for every 1,000 people \u2014 barely half the figure in the United States. Along with a rapidly aging population, China also has the largest number of obese children in the world, as well as more diabetes patients than anywhere else.Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China\u2019s e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,\u201d said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.\u201cFew of them have made moves as big as in China,\u201d Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s American rivals.Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.Advances in artificial intelligence have already been transformative for China\u2019s overworked doctors.Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient\u2019s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.\u201cNow, you don\u2019t even need a minute,\u201d she said.The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China\u2019s working-age population.There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country\u2019s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for one person to read that many images,\u201d said Dr. Yu.Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China\u2019s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.Yunfeng, the personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invested in one company, Yitu, that hopes to address the shortfall of resources. Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.\u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201dTrying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital\u2019s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.\u201cWe have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.\u201dSui-Lee Wee reported from Beijing and Paul Mozur from Hangzhou.

{"Headline": "MoneyGram and Ant Financial Call Off Merger, Citing Regulatory Concerns", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 United States officials have effectively killed a Chinese company\u2019s $1.2 billion plan to buy MoneyGram, the money transfer company, signaling the Trump administration\u2019s growing skepticism of Chinese purchases of American companies and of broader business ties between the two economic powers.MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, said Tuesday that they had canceled the deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies.The move comes amid a shifting relationship between the two countries. The MoneyGram-Ant Financial deal collapsed as tensions have grown over who will control the technologies of the future. As the scotched deal shows, China and America are also increasingly at loggerheads over whether private data will be kept safe as money and corporate ownership cross borders.\u201cThe geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,\u201d the chief executive of MoneyGram, Alex Holmes, said.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon who controls Ant Financial. Shortly after Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.That push apparently could not compete with Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about Chinese money and deal makers, and with his administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisitions of American know-how. The administration is finishing an investigation into Chinese theft of intellectual property owned by American companies, which could result in tariffs on Chinese imports or further restrictions on Chinese investment.At a daily news conference on Wednesday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said that the government hopes the United States could create a level playing field for Chinese companies.Other deals under review include the sale of SkyBridge Capital \u2014 an investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of Mr. Trump \u2014 to an arm of HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate.The collapse of the deal offers the latest sign of a shift \u2014 one that began during the end of the Obama administration \u2014 over how Washington treats Chinese acquisitions of American assets.That has led to calls to tighten reviews of Chinese purchases of American assets. Chinese investment surged to more than $130 billion in 2017 from just $21.5 billion in 2012, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm. In 2018, bankers say they expect another big year of investment, targeted more at sectors considered important to future economic growth like high technology and renewable energy.The deal\u2019s demise also illustrates rising concerns in both the United States and China over sensitive personal data. In buying a large-scale money-transfer company like MoneyGram, Ant Financial would have had access to a large number of records of financial flows within the United States. That fact, combined with close ties to China\u2019s government, could have created security problems. For example, the flow of funds could point to possible espionage targets in the United States military who face financial difficulties.Ant Financial has disputed such claims, saying that consumer data would continue to be stored in the United States.\u201cThis deal fell apart because Ant Financial is from China, a country that has little credibility when it comes to protecting personal data,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAdd to that the lack of reciprocity \u2014 China would never countenance such a deal in reverse \u2014 and one could ask why Alibaba would expect to find a sympathetic hearing in Washington.\u201dCritics of the deal also asked whether Ant Financial would be able to properly police transactions linked to money laundering or terrorism. Ant Financial had said the deal would give MoneyGram greater resources to toughen its efforts to prevent money laundering.China, as well, has taken steps to stanch American company access to data. A new cybersecurity law there forces American companies to keep data on Chinese citizens stored within China, while Chinese state-media have run public service announcements warning about private data collected by Apple\u2019s iPhones.\u201cData flows out of and into China are an increasing source of suspicion in the bilateral relationship,\u201d said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He said Washington was in the \u201cparadoxical position\u201d of criticizing the new Chinese law while opposing deals like MoneyGram because of national security concerns.For Ant Financial, the decision is a setback to its efforts to extend its strong position in online payments abroad. Ant Financial, which grew out of the Chinese payment service Alipay, wanted to buy MoneyGram to accelerate its global expansion. In the past several years, the company has pushed into India, South Korea and Thailand.Mr. Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon, has worked hard to put a positive face on his companies in the United States. He also controls the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s largest internet company, and last year he hosted a conference in Detroit aimed at helping American businesses sell on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites.Amid the heightened sensitivity to overseas purchases, MoneyGram and Ant Financial said it was clear that Cfius would not approve the deal, despite their efforts to quell concerns.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Paul Mozur from Taipei, Taiwan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bargain Hunters Turn to Emerging Market Stocks", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBargain hunters have begun to pay close attention to emerging market stocks.They are a little late to the game. After all, momentum-driven investors have already noticed that shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like China and India came roaring back to life over the last year. Led by hot tech names such as Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group, many of them doubled in value in 2017.But now value-minded mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are rummaging in the parts of the emerging markets that many have ignored \u2014 staid sectors like manufacturing, mining and finance. Even these parts of the emerging markets posted sizable returns over the last year as global economic growth started to reaccelerate.But while the fast-growing segments of the emerging markets returned around 40 percent in 2017, the so-called value stocks rose about half as much.The more muted returns, coupled with the five-year bear market in emerging market equities before this surge, mean emerging market value stocks are still trading at relatively attractive prices. Some bargain hunters say emerging market value stocks are the only truly undervalued part of the global equity market.While the price-to-earnings ratio for the fastest-growing segments of the developing markets stands around 16, emerging market value stocks are trading at a P/E of just below 10.\u201cIf you can buy a well-diversified equity portfolio with a P/E of 10, you\u2019re getting an awful lot of earnings for each dollar of price you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Research Affiliates.There are risks, though, to the strategy of emphasizing value stocks in emerging markets. \u201cWhen most people think about the demographic trends driving the emerging markets and the high growth rates of India and parts of China, these things are all favorable to growth\u201d stocks, Mr. Jayaraman said \u2014 but not necessarily to value-oriented shares.But, he says, \u201cThe rubber band can only stretch so far\u201d when it comes to the rising prices of growth stocks.Ernest C. Yeung, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund, notes that in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate that much of the emerging markets have been mired in recently \u2014 where investors worry that growth will be hard to come by \u2014 \u201cpeople are willing to pay up for future growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why in this environment, high-quality growth stocks \u2014 names like Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 have done so well,\u201d he said. But that should start to shift, he said. \u201cWhen the macroeconomy recovers, value stocks normally begin to work.\u201dIn particular, value stocks in the financial industry stand to benefit.\u201cFinancials are a driven by the health of the macroeconomy and the direction of interest rates,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. And they\u2019re cheap.As a result, the stock now trades at just 0.7 times the bank\u2019s book value, which represents the net asset value of the company, compared with a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.5 to 2 before the global financial crisis. \u201cSo we are nowhere back to historical norms,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.The steel industry is another place that should thrive as the economy improves.\u201cThe common perception is that China keeps dumping cheap steel into the global markets,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. That may have been true several years ago, but the Chinese government recently carried out supply-side reforms that have reduced China\u2019s steel supply more than 20 percent, he said.As a result, Chinese exports have fallen more than 40 percent, creating breathing room \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for other emerging market steel producers.Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, notes that investors need not limit themselves to staid industries to gain exposure to attractively priced emerging market stocks.\u201cThink information tech based in Taiwan instead of China,\u201d she said.Why? A number of Taiwanese tech companies are regarded as old tech because they are involved in the manufacturing and supply chain that propels new economy tech products and services.Partly because Hon Hai is not regarded as a new economy name, the stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, compared with around 60 for Tencent Holdings, one of China\u2019s largest internet and social media companies.But Mr. Jayaram says that \u201cif we see better sales for iPhones in the first quarter, that could be a big catalyst\u201d to move Hon Hai\u2019s stock, too. And that creates a buying opportunity for bargain hunters right now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Users in China Expect to Be Tracked. Now, They Want Privacy.", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s biggest online payment company offers its hundreds of millions of users a breakdown on their spending each year, showing everything from their environmental impact to their ranking among shoppers in their area. Many spenders \u2014 not shy, and occasionally even a bit boastful about their personal finances \u2014 in turn share the details on social media.This year, the marketing stunt has run into a problem: China\u2019s growing sense of personal privacy.Ant Financial, an affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, apologized to users on Thursday after prompting an outcry by automatically enrolling in its social credit program those who wanted to see the breakdown. The program, called Sesame Credit, tracks personal relationships and behavior patterns to help determine lending decisions.The episode was a rare, public rebuttal of a prevailing trend in China. The country\u2019s largest internet companies, and the government itself, have gathered ever more data on internet users. While Chinese culture does not emphasize personal privacy and Chinese internet users have grown accustomed to surveillance and censorship, the anger represents a nascent, but growing, demand for increased privacy and data protections online.Fueled in part by widespread internet fraud and personal information theft, the call for privacy, if it continues, could become a major challenge to China\u2019s internet titans, and eventually to the cyber-authoritarian aspirations of the Chinese government itself.For now, it is far from clear that this rising discomfort will give way to policy changes. Many Chinese people, even as they express concerns about how companies use their data online, offer little criticism of Beijing\u2019s desire to use that data to help compile a broad social tracking system that rewards what it regards as good citizens and punishes others.Still, recent signs indicate Chinese consumers are beginning to express some of the same privacy concerns long found in the United States and elsewhere.\u201cPony Ma must be reading our WeChat messages every single day,\u201d he added, referring to the founder of Tencent, the Chinese internet giant that runs the social media and chat app, which has almost one billion users.In a statement, Tencent said that the company did not store the chat history of users and that it would never use chat history for big data analytics. The comments were met with widespread disbelief: WeChat users have been arrested over what they\u2019ve said on the app, conversations have turned up as evidence in court proceedings, and activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations.\u201cIt has become a default setting for me now to assume that we have no privacy in the face of Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d said Li Luyao, a college student in Beijing.Mr. Li said he did not believe Tencent\u2019s assurances that it was not storing chat logs, and he expressed anger at Ant Financial for resorting to what he called \u201cold tricks.\u201dIn its end-of-year feature, Ant Financial had customers click through a screen with a line in small font saying the user agreed to the terms of service, which were hidden. A toggle was on by default to indicate that the user agreed, and enrolled them in the Sesame Credit program.Ant Financial said in the terms of service that it reserved the right to share the data it collected with third parties \u2014 including government agencies assembling a state-sanctioned social credit system \u2014 and could not be held responsible for what happened after it shared the information.In its statement, Ant Financial said users should have had to actively change the toggle to indicate they agreed, and added that it would remove all of those who had been inadvertently added to the credit system.User complaints went beyond the narrow concern over how they joined, to broader questions regarding what they were asked to join.\u201cThe tone of the agreement makes me feel so uncomfortable because every sentence literally goes, \u2018If this happens, we are not responsible, if that happens, we are not responsible,\u2019\u201d said Zhou Yang, a 25-year old investment professional in Shanghai. \u201cThey sound like sneaky unscrupulous merchants who will sell your data and don\u2019t want to be responsible for anything, and you have to agree to all of it.\u201dMs. Zhou\u2019s fears about data sales underscore more widespread worries about controlling personal information. China\u2019s official media have reported an increasing number of cases of internet fraud, and personal data is widely available for sale through online marketplaces. A 2017 survey by China\u2019s state-run Beijing Youth Daily found that leaking personal data was the No. 1 concern among consumers.In part, the Sesame Credit moves by Ant Financial might have been trying to get around newer, stricter laws that would prevent them from sharing user data unless they had explicit permission, said Zhai Zhenyi, a lawyer at Yingke, a China-based law firm.\u201cProblems like telecom fraud and malicious marketing have severely vexed the general public, so people\u2019s consciousness about their rights is awakening,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very good thing to see.\u201dThat consciousness may not extend to government collection of data, even though China\u2019s biggest internet companies often provide user information to Beijing.Ant Financial\u2019s credit system resembles one the government itself plans to soon implement.Beijing has said it will introduce in 2020 its own social credit system that is expected to give and take away privileges based on spending habits, online and real-world behavior, and social relationships. Foreign travel, speedy internet, school access, and social benefits could all be granted or denied based on a person\u2019s score. The government system will most likely be at least partly dependent on data collected by companies like Alibaba and Tencent.It is unclear how many Chinese are truly against such programs.Mr. Li, the Beijing college student, said that many of his friends still shared the shopping breakdowns \u2014 which now include a number indicating a user\u2019s Sesame Credit score.Such is the power and ubiquity of Alibaba and Tencent in China, he added, that customers would find voting with their feet and quitting the services difficult.\u201cBeing angry doesn\u2019t do us any good,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you can stop using Alipay if you are angry, but there\u2019s no way you could stop using WeChat.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Retail Trade Show, Technology Is the Star", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retail industry is doubling down on digital to keep its unexpectedly strong holiday performance from becoming a fluke.The floor of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual trade show in New York this week was crowded with alert systems primed to recognize heavy-spending customers, so-called smart shelves fitted with real-time inventory trackers and robots for every step of the supply chain.It was a conference about shopping that looked more like an expo for tech, as if the electronics trade show CES had decamped from Las Vegas and moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.At the three-day event \u2014 which drew more than 600 exhibitors and featured sessions with top executives from Walmart, Best Buy, Neiman Marcus and other major companies \u2014 discussions of artificial intelligence, big data and automation filled stages and meeting booths modeled after fitting rooms.E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.Embracing technologies, and quickly, is crucial to survival as consumers grow more demanding, according to a panel of venture capital professionals.\u201cThe consumer expectation of a frictionless shopping experience is here,\u201d said Scott Friend, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures.Digitally native companies are emerging and growing faster. Catching up can be difficult for large legacy chains, which have struggled to project enough cool factor to recruit in-demand employees.\u201cTalent is a major challenge for a lot of these retailers,\u201d said Janie Yu, a partner at Fung Capital. \u201cIf you are a top-notch, A+ data scientist, you probably want to work at Bonobos or Facebook or Google or Jet.\u201dMr. Friend said that companies like Walmart had tried to make cultural shifts to attract innovative employees, or folded them in through acquisitions.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s some magic that start-ups have that big companies don\u2019t,\u201d he said.All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?\u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201dShoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.Consumers are in control, as retailers scramble to tailor products to their liking, design more elaborate shopping experiences to hold their interest and deliver purchases on increasingly short deadlines.Customer behavior is getting harder to pin down. The boundaries between generations are disappearing, as so-called millennial and generation Z shoppers influence the buying habits of baby boomers, panelists said.As companies compile more detailed dossiers on their clientele, stuffed with data collected online and in stores, retailers could someday fine-tune their marketing and scheduling to each consumer, the panelists said.\u201cWe can microsegment as thin as we want in the future,\u201d Ms. Haziot said. \u201cEach individual is a segment in itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Maine Racetrack Didn\u2019t Lure Amazon. Multiply That Disappointment by 218.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Hall, town manager of Scarborough, Me., had just returned from a meeting about the clam harvest when he heard the bad news from a reporter. He took it philosophically. The town\u2019s proposal to convert a 500-acre harness racing track in the center of Scarborough was, he knew, \u201cthe longest of long shots.\u201dIn Oklahoma, there were more regrets.\u201cI\u2019m certainly disappointed,\u201d said Scott Phillips, who ran a development team called Day 1 that promoted a proposal to build an entirely new 50-square-mile city for Amazon between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, equidistant from each.\u201cAmazon missed an opportunity to include more out-of-the-box thinking in their list of finalists from proposals like ours,\u201d he added.Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d twice in a brief interview, adding that the whole process was \u201cgreat publicity\u201d for Amazon.\u201cThis news is certainly disappointing,\u201d the team that promoted Buffalo and Rochester said in a statement.\u201cVery disappointed,\u201d said the Bay Area Council, which had submitted a bid on behalf of San Francisco and four neighboring cities.Amazon\u2019s obsessive desire to please its customers has created a fearsome retail juggernaut and made its founder, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new.Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up?\u201cThis new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,\u201d Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging.Mr. Hall said he had received \u201cno word whatsoever\u201d from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, \u201cAll the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls.\u201d (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.)Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk.Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus.The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon\u2019s public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos\u2019 growing wealth and power.For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process \u2014 which will continue for months \u2014 is \u201creality show\u201d theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said.Amazon, he said, \u201cwants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids.\u201d\u201cFrom a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,\u201d Mr. Rolnick added. \u201cFrom a national perspective, it makes no sense.\u201dSome elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done.\u201cIt was like \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u201d the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa\u2019s mayor, G. T. Bynum. \u201cI loved the process. Amazon, to their credit, made it a public and transparent one. Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don\u2019t even know what company is interested.\u201dNot all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that.One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point.However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something.\u201cSecond headquarters are the thing of the future \u2014 the companies are getting too big for a single market,\u201d said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation.\u201cIf Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba\u201d \u2014 the Chinese internet retailer \u2014 \u201cis willing,\u201d said Mr. Phillips. His efforts to build a corporate city, he said, will continue.There is, however, the problem of the name. \u201cDay 1\u201d is a pet expression of Mr. Bezos, symbolizing how his company\u2019s opportunities are always right in front of it.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably look for a better brand,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, and then reconsidered. \u201cIf someone wants to take on Amazon, maybe keeping it \u2018Day 1\u2019 will offer the added ability to mess with Bezos\u2019 head a little.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Stock Market Too Quiet for Its Own Good?", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rare calm has settled over the stock market. Whether it turns out to be the one before the storm is a compelling question after a year of conditions so placid that investing has begun to look deceptively simple.The peaceful trading backdrop helped the S.&.P 500 rise 19.4 percent on the year and 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Factoring in dividend payments and additional appreciation from the reinvestment of those dividends in the constituent companies\u2019 stocks, the index returned 6.6 percent in the quarter and 21.7 percent throughout 2017. And, despite some rumblings in the bond market, stocks moved even higher in the early days of 2018.But the drastically reduced trading volatility, a condition sometimes called metastability, worries some Wall Street strategists.It\u2019s not just that persistent buying has sent stocks to valuations exceeded only on a few occasions that preceded spectacular plunges. Billions of dollars have been committed to vehicles that seek to profit from the extraordinary degree of stability and depend on it persisting. If and when things change, the storm after the calm could be sudden and violent.\u201cIncreasingly, people of a certain age who have seen enough cycles say, \u2018We\u2019ve been here before. We know the party\u2019s going to end,\u2019\u201d said Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cIt won\u2019t end well.\u201dThe year ended well for domestic stock funds, with the average one in Morningstar\u2019s database gaining 5 percent in the fourth quarter and 18.3 percent on the year. Portfolios that focus on technology, natural resources and economically sensitive consumer issues were especially strong in the quarter. Health care and real estate funds were noticeably weaker.A stock market that never goes down except by a negligible amount \u2014 at least lately \u2014 has been widely perceived as less risky. Vehicles known as risk-parity funds seek to capitalize on the lack of price swings by allocating more money to stocks as volatility diminishes. Mutual funds that employ risk-parity strategies held about $8.6 billion at the end of 2017, according to Morningstar.But nothing lasts forever. When the metastability ends and volatility returns to more normal levels, risk-parity funds will view stocks as riskier and begin to take their bets off the table. The more sudden the return of volatility, the faster the funds will sell. If it happens quickly enough, the market could go from metastable to not at all stable, turning a virtuous circle vicious.\u201cThe whole thing could unravel very quickly,\u201d Ms. Patterson said, although she is merely concerned, not alarmed.\u201cWe don\u2019t see enough red flashing lights to get out,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we see yellow caution lights.\u201dFor Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, the hue is more crimson.\u201cI see risk preference shifting significantly to risk taking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe low-volatility trade is characteristic of a euphoric market.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cThere are uncertainties present in global markets, and investors are also ignoring how highly valued equities are. They don\u2019t seem to care. In terms of what the equity market is telling you, they have no concern that a problem or a massive correction lies ahead. They think central banks will save them.\u201dThe bond market is sending a more unsettling message, Mr. Sri-Kumar warned. Despite steady and stronger economic growth in recent quarters and low unemployment, yields on long-term Treasury securities haven\u2019t risen very much, even as short-term rates continue higher. That combination has led the yield curve, or the difference between short and long rates, to flatten.The yield on two-year Treasury issues at the end of December was 0.51 percentage points below 10-year Treasury yields, close to the narrowest spread in 10 years. The spread has widened slightly but if the yield curve should invert, pushing short-term rates above long-term ones, it would be an ominous sign, because an inverted curve often heralds a recession.\u201cIt\u2019s very instructive that the bond market is giving a completely opposite story,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt has gone from being somewhat cautious to excessively cautious. I think it will invert over the next few months.\u201dThe average bond fund rose 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.8 percent on the year.\u201cThe fixed-income rally still has a way to run,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted. \u201cIf we do have a massive stock market correction, we will see the 10-year Treasury and investment-grade bonds going down in yield.\u201dHe would reduce holdings of stocks and focus on defensive sectors and foreign markets, and he would allocate as much as 20 percent of a portfolio to cash.The low volatility and overvaluation in the stock market have lasted a long time and might do so until a catalyst arises. That could be the continuing shift in Federal Reserve policy that kept short-term interest rates close to zero percent for nine years and led the central bank to buy trillions of dollars of bonds in its quantitative easing program.The Fed has already raised rates five times in the last two years, including in December, and it announced in September that it would begin selling the bonds in its enormous inventory. The impact of such changes on the markets could depend on what investors focus on: how much support the Fed continues to provide, or how quickly it is removing support.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, cautioned in a note to clients that while economic conditions may seem close to ideal, small changes could threaten that benign outlook.\u201cPerhaps we are in the early stages of a melt-up similar to the late stages of past bull markets,\u201d Mr. Paulsen wrote. \u201cHowever, several economic and financial market indicators are on the cusp of eye-catching levels, which could shatter the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 scenario.\u201d Long-term Treasury yields in early December were 0.25 percentage points below three-and-a-half-year highs, for instance; wage and consumer price inflation were near multiyear highs; and unemployment was a couple of tenths of a percentage point from 50-year lows.One recent development that caught the eyes of investors was the most sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code since the 1980s, including a drastic reduction in corporate income tax rates. But there are other matters of policy and politics that could send stocks lower if a more aggressive Fed does not.Mr. Sri-Kumar advised investors to \u201cwatch for a possible cancellation of Nafta in the first quarter.\u201d If the North American Free Trade Agreement is torn up, American multinationals may face retaliation abroad.\u201cThe rising risk of a trade war will be a more important factor to consider for 2018 than any positive impact of the corporate tax cut,\u201d he said.Concern that American stocks may be expensive and accident-prone is sending some investors packing. Foreign stocks comfortably outpaced their American counterparts during 2017 when returns are expressed in dollars.The SPDR S.&P. 500 exchange-traded fund rose 19.4 percent last year, while iShares MSCI EAFE, which tracks foreign developed markets, rose 23.8 percent, and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets gained 35.2 percent.The average international stock mutual fund was up 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 25.9 percent for the year. Specialists in China and India rose more than 40 percent on average for 2017.The comparative strength overseas \u201chas probably got to do with the starting points in terms of valuations and interest rates,\u201d said Benjamin Beneche, one of the managers of the AMG Managers Pictet International fund. American stocks are so expensive that, even with the recent underperformance, they remain considerably more expensive than foreign shares.At the end of the year, the S.&P. 500 E.T.F. traded at 22.7 times the earnings of the constituent companies over the preceding 12 months, according to Morningstar. Valuations were 17.5 times earnings for the EAFE fund and 14.4 times for the emerging markets E.T.F.Jeremy Richardson, a portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management, attributed the strength abroad to evidence that President Xi Jinping was consolidating power in China; recent increases in commodity prices, which help the many emerging economies that export them; and \u201ca firming of economic growth, in Europe in particular, amid some signs of central bank and fiscal policy taking hold.\u201dHis advice for investors scouting around for foreign assets is \u201cto emphasize equities because they\u2019re better in the long run\u201d and \u201cto pay close attention to the quality of companies you\u2019re buying.\u201dMr. Richardson finds particularly good opportunities in cloud computing, where \u201cthe size of the market is underappreciated by most investors,\u201d and businesses related to electric transportation, such as battery and motor manufacturers.Mr. Beneche likes the auto industry, too, but the old-fashioned one.\u201cThere\u2019s a myopic focus on electric vehicles and ride sharing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe electric transition might take longer than people are expecting.\u201d He especially likes companies that make parts for cars already on the road, such as Hyundai Mobis.Other niches he favors include Asian consumer technology companies like SoftBank, Alibaba and JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce business, and businesses with a large controlling shareholder, such as Vivendi and Richemont.Ms. Patterson is less sanguine about foreign stocks. She said much of the outperformance has been caused by a weak dollar, which raises the value of foreign assets. She expects the dollar to recover and prefers American stocks, particularly technology issues. Nevertheless, the risks that have lain dormant have persuaded her to remain well diversified in bonds, foreign stocks and gold, which has \u201ckind of been left for dead.\u201dThe stock market has had plenty of life in it, even if trading has not been lively. For Ms. Patterson, \u201cthe base case is that Goldilocks continues,\u201d she said, meaning conditions will be just right, with low inflation and benign central bank policies. But with that outlook ubiquitous on Wall Street, as implied in the eerie calm in the stock market, she is reluctant to state her case too strongly.\u201cThe idea that the party will continue for quite a long time is creating more risk-taking, and that\u2019s what worries me more than anything else right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWill this year be more of the same, or will a big bear come out and ruin us?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Drops Huawei\u2019s New Smartphone Amid Security Worries", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, Huawei\u2019s push to sell the phone in the United States has suddenly lost a powerful backer \u2014 and the push has attracted some unwanted scrutiny from Washington.The reasons that led to AT&T\u2019s shift were not entirely clear. But last month, a group of lawmakers wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission expressing misgivings about a potential deal between Huawei and an unnamed American telecommunications company to sell its consumer products in the United States. It cited longstanding concerns among some lawmakers about what they said were Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government.The letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, said Congress had \u201clong been concerned about Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei\u2019s role in that espionage in particular.\u201dFletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, declined to comment.The last-minute disruption is the latest in a long line of setbacks for Huawei, which has struggled for years with political opposition to its efforts to tap the hugely valuable United States market. More broadly, it underscores a deepening political rift over issues of technology, user privacy and security \u2014 a rift that adds to a brewing trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Huawei has been counting on the Mate 10 to compete with Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, in a test of the potential appeal of a Chinese brand in the American market. While Huawei has long sold budget phones, some Mate 10 versions cost $900 or more without subsidies from phone carriers.Huawei sells smartphones in the United States, but it does not have smartphone deals with any of the major wireless carriers in the country. Those carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 dominate the market, making it more difficult for Huawei to get a foothold in the country. The AT&T deal was supposed to cement the company\u2019s status as a top maker of the devices, alongside Apple and Samsung Electronics of South Korea.Congressional misgivings about the company\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government have long plagued Huawei. Already, other major telecommunications companies refuse to buy the equipment Huawei makes for telecommunications networks \u2014 its core business \u2014 because of worries in Washington over security.In the letter, the lawmakers said Huawei had ties to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as to the country\u2019s intelligence and security services, and they accused Huawei of disregarding intellectual property. In particular, the letter implies that the deal with AT&T could more firmly establish Huawei phones in the United States, and ultimately open up the possibility of American government officials using them.Analysts said the political opposition to Huawei was not surprising. Leaders in China and the United States view technology made in the other country with suspicion. In policy guidance and speeches, Chinese officials have repeatedly called for technology made by American companies to be replaced by locally produced ones. Beijing has also widely blocked major American internet companies from offering products in the country.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
