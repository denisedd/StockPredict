{"Headline": "What You Need to Do Because of Flaws in Computer Chips", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the world\u2019s largest tech companies have been working on fixes for these problems. But the researchers who discovered the flaws said one of them, Spectre, is not completely fixable. \u201cIt is a fundamental flaw in the way processors have been built over the last decades,\u201d said Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered these flaws.Here is a guide to what you need to know and what you should do.Both are issues with the way computer chips are designed.Meltdown affects most processors made by Intel, the company that supplies the chips for a majority of PCs and more than 90 percent of computer servers.Spectre is far more difficult for hackers to exploit. But it is even more pervasive, affecting Intel chips, microprocessors from the longtime Intel rival AMD and the many chips that use designs from the British company ARM. Your smartphone most likely contains an ARM chip.Both flaws provide hackers with a way of stealing data, including passwords and other sensitive information. If hackers manage to get software running on one of these chips, they can grab data from other software running on the same machine.This is a particular issue on cloud computing services.Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, these are services where any business or individual can rent access to computing power over the internet. On a cloud service, each server is typically shared by many different customers. By exploiting the Meltdown flaw, a hacker can just load some software onto a cloud service and then grab data from anyone else who has loaded software onto the same server.Phones and PCs are more difficult targets. Before they can exploit the chip flaws, hackers must find a way of getting their software onto your device. They could fool you into downloading an app from a smartphone app store. Or they could trick you into visiting a website that moves code onto your machine.The onus is now on consumers and businesses to install the fix on their machines.Keep your software up-to-date. That includes your operating system and apps like your web browser and antivirus software. Microsoft, Mozilla and Google have already released patches for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome to help address the problem.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs, and they carry malware.\u201dYour operating system and apps typically have a button you can click to check for software updates. For example, in Google\u2019s Chrome browser on a computer, you can click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and click Update Google Chrome. To update Windows, click the Start button and click through these buttons: Settings, Update & security, Windows Update and Check for updates. To update the Mac system, open the App Store app and check the Updates tab for the latest software.Amazon, Google and Microsoft said that they had already patched most of the of servers that underpin their cloud computing services, and that largely addresses the problem. But Amazon and Google also said customers might need to make additional changes.To share computing power with customers, cloud services offer \u201cvirtual machines.\u201d These are computers that exist only in digital form. Customers use these virtual machines to run their own software. After Amazon, Google and Microsoft update their machines, customers may have to update the operating systems running on their own virtual machines to guard against some exploits.No. The researchers who discovered Meltdown said that patching systems would slow them down by as much as 30 percent in certain situations. That could be a problem for big cloud systems.Independent software developers also ran tests on a patched version of Linux, the open-source operating system that now drives more than 30 percent of the world\u2019s servers, and saw similar slowdowns.\u201cThere are many cases where the performance impact is zero,\u201d said Andres Frome, a software developer who has tested the new code. \u201cBut if you are running something like a payment system, where a lot of small changes are made to data, it looks like there will be a significant performance impact.\u201dConsumers are less likely to be affected, and Mr. Kocher said slowdowns could dissipate over time as companies refined their patches.According to the researchers who discovered these flaws, including security experts at Google, the memory chip maker Rambus and various academic institutions, Spectre can\u2019t be completely fixed. But patches can solve the problems in some situations. Intel and Microsoft and others said the same.No, according to the researchers. But Spectre is much more difficult than Meltdown for hackers to exploit.Similar to Meltdown, Spectre can steal information from one application and share it with another. For example, an app you download from the web could steal information like passwords from other software on a computer.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert that said the only solution to the threats posed by Meltdown and Spectre would be a full replacement of the chips. But that does not seem feasible, given how many machines are involved. \u201cSpectre is going to be with us a lot longer,\u201d Mr. Kocher said.An Intel vice president, Donald Parker, is adamant that the company\u2019s chips will not need to be replaced. He said that with software patches and \u201cfirmware updates\u201d \u2014 a way of updating code on the chip itself \u2014 Intel and other companies could \u201cmitigate the issues.\u201dNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Is a Bitcoin Believer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday and happy new year!\u2022 Bitcoin\u2019s value jumped as Peter Thiel\u2019s venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency.\u2022 Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial\u2019s purchase of MoneyGram.\u2022 The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time.\u2022 Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year.\u2022 The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail.From Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

He plans to use that to cover the bureau\u2019s projected quarterly expenses of $145 million.While the move is largely symbolic, it follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney that spotlight the Trump administration\u2019s desire to shift the consumer bureau\u2019s trajectory.Ignore all the one-time charges related to the new tax law that banks announced this week, the industry, long-term, should be among the biggest winners.But how much of the windfall will end in the pockets of employees and customers?Yet despite this largess, \u201cthe industry stands to retain more than 75 percents of the savings\u201d from the tax law, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In fact, the total cost of the wage increases and bonuses \u201cwill amount to just 1.75 percent of the banking industry\u2019s noninterest expenses in 2018.\u201dThe NumbersShares of Morgan Stanley gained 1.5 percent in early trading and are up 29 percent over the past year.Yes, stock\u2019s are down a bit Thursday, but that doesn\u2019t obscure the fact that major equity indexes are off to their best start in years.Investors have piled into stocks to start 2018. It took the Dow industrials just eight trading sessions to go from 25,000 to 26,000, the fastest move between millennial markers on record.So far this month, the S. & P. 500 has risen about 4.8 percent this month.

{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Qualcomm $1.2 Billion Over Apple Deal", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean antitrust officials hammered Qualcomm with a $1.2 billion fine on Wednesday, saying the American chip maker, whose technology underpins much of the world\u2019s mobile phone industry, had abused its dominant market position to squeeze out competitors.Those moves have prompted complaints from American technology giants that they are being unfairly targeted, but European Union officials strongly deny the accusations.In the latest decision, European regulators found that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphone chips, abused its market dominance by preventing rivals from competing in the smartphone chip market thanks to an agreement in which it paid Apple to exclusively use its chips in iPhones and iPads between 2011 and 2016.\u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals,\u201d she added. \u201cThese payments were not just reductions in price \u2014 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads.\u201dThe European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, found that Qualcomm\u2019s practices had a significant, detrimental impact on competition in the region. \u201cIt excluded rivals from the market and deprived European consumers of genuine choice and innovation,\u201d the commission said.Ms. Vestager said that she could not say how much Apple had ultimately received from Qualcomm in payments, but that it was in the \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201dShe said that internal documents reviewed as part of the inquiry showed that Apple had seriously considered using chips made by a rival manufacturer, Intel, during the period of its agreement with Qualcomm, but did not do so until the deal with Qualcomm had concluded.If Apple had introduced a smartphone using products from a different chip maker, she said, Apple not only would have lost future payments from Qualcomm, but also would have been forced to pay back some of the money it had already received.Ms. Vestager said that Apple would not face any repercussions because the inquiry had been focused on Qualcomm\u2019s practices. European regulators are also continuing a separate investigation into preliminary findings that Qualcomm sold its chips at below cost price from 2009 to 2011 to force a competitor out of the market.In a statement, Qualcomm said that it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the decision and that it would appeal the ruling to the European Union\u2019s highest court.Qualcomm has been a longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, and its trove of patents, which include ubiquitous processes such as the way applications are downloaded from smartphone app stores and the use of airplane mode, remains one of the most lucrative assets in the world of wireless networking.Founded in 1985, the company helped build the modern mobile phone industry with its technology. For decades, Qualcomm engineers have made crucial innovations that have helped the sector develop and expand, and bolstered the company\u2019s results along the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Team Up to Try to Disrupt Health Care", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Three corporate behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation\u2019s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.It was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees\u2019 existing health coverage \u2014 whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses.But Tuesday\u2019s announcement landed like a thunderclap \u2014 sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market.That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.The companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon\u2019s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans \u2014 from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics.\u201cIt could be big,\u201d Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. \u201cThose are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.\u201dBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies \u2014 which, combined, employ more than one million people \u2014 might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans.\u201cThis is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,\u201d said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. \u201cThe idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.\u201dEven the three companies don\u2019t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company.Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency \u2014 whatever it might turn out to be.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in the statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dOver the past several months, the three had met formally \u2014 along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan\u2019s board \u2014 to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s thinking.The three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set.Mr. Buffett\u2019s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country\u2019s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged \u2014 he is 87 \u2014 the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said.The companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company wouldn\u2019t replace existing health insurers or hospitals.Planning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis\u2019s mergers and acquisitions strategy; Mr. Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.One potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities.\u201cEach of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,\u201d said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn\u2019t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.\u201dThe e-commerce giant\u2019s actions \u2013 some big, like buying Whole Foods Markets; some smaller, like Amazon meal kits \u2013 have led to stock sell-offs for a wide range of businesses.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards.\u201cI think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,\u201d he said.Amazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.Nationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs \u2014 they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments.Suzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, \u201cit\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said.She added, \u201cThere are so many opportunities to do this better.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Katie Thomas from Chicago and Reed Abelson from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "TV Content Wars: Too Many Characters Chasing Not Enough Action", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC.That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle \u2014 and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2014 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Can\u2019t Resist Playing by China\u2019s Rules", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorApple is selling out. It\u2019s not about the latest version of the iPhone, but the huge cache of personal data that will be going directly to the largest, and one of the harshest, authoritarian regimes in the world: the Communist government of China.Given the Chinese government\u2019s continuing crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech under President Xi Jinping, as well as its deepening reach into Western democracies, Apple\u2019s policies in China have far-reaching implications for us all.Customers registered in China, according to Apple\u2019s new terms and conditions agreement for the country, must \u201cunderstand and agree that Apple and G.C.B.D. will have access to all data that you store on this service, including the right to share, exchange and disclose all user data, including content, to and between each other under applicable law.\u201dIn short, all personal user information stored on the iCloud \u2014 including photos, videos, text files, contacts, calendars and iCloud email \u2014 will be shared with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data and could be available to the Chinese authorities as well. Apple has said that G.C.B.D. will not have access to the personal data stored in its facility without Apple\u2019s permission, but the new terms and conditions agreement appears to say the opposite.Under the agreement, Apple seems to be absolving itself of responsibility for what the authorities may choose to do with personal data in G.C.B.D.\u2019s hands. Users who refuse Apple\u2019s terms will be denied iCloud services. Users who accept run the risk of unwittingly provoking the ire of the aggressive police state, resulting in deleted data or accounts, or harassment and imprisonment.This kind of partnership between an American company and a dictatorial regime is at odds with the image Apple has built as a company committed to privacy and a willingness to stand up to pressure from larger entities like the United States government. In a 2015 interview with NPR, the Apple chief executive Tim Cook emphasized that privacy \u201cis a fundamental human right that people have,\u201d from a \u201cvalues point of view,\u201d not \u201ca commercial interest point of view.\u201dUnfortunately, it now seems that such \u201cvalues\u201d are taking a back seat to profits.In 2017, Apple also announced it was halting the sale of virtual private networks, apps that allow users inside China to get access to blocked content that is critical for activists and regular citizens. IPhones in China also no longer include some Western news outlets like The New York Times on the News app.In response to criticism about these steps, Apple has blithely responded that it is obeying China\u2019s laws. Is this how American companies should respond to dictatorial demands and arbitrary, unjust legal codes?The Chinese regime makes no apologies about its human rights violations and seems not to care whom it crushes in its quest for power and control, whether it is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died last year in Chinese custody, or the many human-rights lawyers and activists who have been detained and tortured in recent years.When dealing with the Chinese regime, American companies should likewise not apologize for their commitment to the fundamental values \u2014 human rights, democracy, freedom of information, the rule of law \u2014 that have allowed them to flourish. American companies should not follow practices in authoritarian countries that are illegal in the United States.It\u2019s hard to believe that Apple is caving in to the regime like this. The only conclusion I am left to draw is that the company is O.K. with taking part in the suppression of freedoms abroad while espousing high-minded values at home.Those companies, institutions and organizations that play an outsize role in society should not shirk their responsibility to uphold social justice. The Chinese people have been fighting for human rights for decades, including the rights to privacy, freedom of speech and democracy. Many have lost their lives doing so. Instead of aiding dictatorships and following a misguided path to the future, Apple should return to its core values and protect the rights of its users at home and abroad.Chen Guangcheng, a civil-rights activist, is the author of \u201cThe Barefoot Lawyer: A Blind Man\u2019s Fight for Justice and Freedom in China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lebanese Intelligence Turned Targets\u2019 Android Phones Into Spy Devices, Researchers Say", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe spy operation, revealed on Thursday, is among dozens around the world uncovered by human rights groups and technical organizations in recent years as governments and intelligence agencies have started relying more on mobile and desktop spyware than on traditional forms of cloak-and-dagger espionage.The researchers found what they said was evidence that Lebanon\u2019s intelligence agency \u2014 called General Directorate of General Security, or GDGS \u2014 spied on their targets\u2019 Android mobile devices and desktop computers using various methods for more than six years. Their primary attack method, researchers said, was through a series of decoy Android apps designed to look like widely used private, secure messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal.Once downloaded, the apps allowed spies to steal nearly everything off their victims\u2019 phones, including text messages with one-time passcodes for accessing email and other services, as well as contact lists, call logs, browsing history, audio recordings and photos. The apps also let the spies take photos using the phone\u2019s front or back camera, and turned the device into a silent microphone to capture audio. The apps were not designed to target Apple iPhone users.\u201cOne of the main takeaways from this investigation is that actors, like Dark Caracal, are shifting away from a pure desktop capability for espionage to now relying heavily on mobile tools to gather their intelligence,\u201d said Michael Flossman, a security analyst at Lookout, referring to the name that he and other researchers coined for the Lebanese spies they said were most likely responsible for the espionage.GDGS is Lebanon\u2019s main internal intelligence agency, and its director, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, a career army general, has a rising profile and a broadening portfolio. The agency oversees residency permits for foreigners, from diplomats and tens of thousands of Southeast Asian domestic workers to more than a million Syrian refugees. The agency\u2019s expertise and clout has traditionally been seen as stemming from its human intelligence, not from high-tech espionage techniques.Speaking ahead of the report\u2019s publication, General Ibrahim told Reuters: \u201cGeneral Security does not have these type of capabilities. We wish we had these capabilities.\u201d GDGS did not return a call for comment on Thursday.Together, researchers tracked the spying to command and control servers operated by the attackers. The researchers looked at who had registered the servers and when, as well as the dates of some of the stolen content. They deduced that the campaign had been going on for as long as six years.The attackers were targeting journalists and activists, as well as government officials, military personnel, financial institutions, defense contractors and others in 21 countries. Those countries included the United States, China, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and inside Lebanon.The researchers traced the attacks to a building in Beirut that houses Lebanon\u2019s GDGS, using Wi-Fi networks and so-called internet protocol addresses assigned to attackers\u2019 machines. While researchers said they could not be sure whether the attacks were the work of the GDGS or rogue employees, many of the attacks appeared tied to an email address \u2014 op13@mail.com \u2014 that had been linked to various online personas, including \u201cNancy Razzouk\u201d and \u201cRami Jabbour.\u201d All of the physical addresses listed with registrations made by that email account were clustered around the GDGS building in Beirut, according to the user\u2019s wireless activity.Emails sent to that email address were not returned.As part of their work, researchers found evidence that Lebanese spies were directing victims to install the spy apps through WhatsApp messages that began innocuously with a \u201cHow are you?\u201d Those then linked to the spy apps with additional messages like \u201cYou can download from here to communicate further.\u201dIn other cases, the spies found their targets on Facebook, inviting them to Facebook groups, where they posted links to their decoy apps, which they often referred to by names like \u201cWhatsApp plus.\u201d The spies also directed victims to fake login sites for social media services like Twitter and Facebook to steal their credentials, hijack their accounts and push out trick messages to more people.Researchers also found evidence that Lebanese officials had previously used FinFisher, a product manufactured by the British company Gamma International, which sells surveillance tools that let customers turn computers and phones into listening devices to monitor a target\u2019s messages, calls and whereabouts. Increasingly, researchers discovered that the spies had built their own custom mobile spy tools that were less sophisticated than FinFisher but as effective in getting the intelligence they were after.Researchers also uncovered evidence that Lebanese officials deployed several variants of malware to victims\u2019 desktop machines; the malware was designed to work across several operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple\u2019s Mac and Linux. That malware could steal screenshots of victims\u2019 computer screens, use the victim\u2019s webcam to spy on their physical whereabouts, record sound, grab photos and any Skype activity, file listings and files, and even iPhone backups.In the hours after researchers published their report on Thursday, the servers conducting the spying went dark.Anne Barnard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Warn of Hits From Tax Cuts. Don\u2019t Be Fooled.", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt will sound like bad news.Over the next few weeks, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, household names including Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson, are likely to warn that their financial results will be severely dented, if not altogether wiped out, by huge tax bills that they have to pay to the Internal Revenue Service.Don\u2019t be fooled.The big one-time losses are a prelude to even bigger profits \u2014 a paradox caused by the tax cuts that recently zoomed through Congress and that largely benefit corporations.A couple of provisions in the tax package are prompting many companies \u2014 those based in the United States as well as some foreign corporations with big American presences \u2014 to pay the taxman while anticipating huge savings for decades to come.Until now, companies generally didn\u2019t have to pay federal income taxes on such earnings, at least not immediately, as long as those profits stayed overseas. But if the companies brought the money back to the United States, they would face a 35 percent tax rate (minus whatever they had already paid tax collectors in other countries).American companies currently attribute about $2.8 trillion to their overseas units. The new law requires them to bring the money back to the United States \u2014 or to \u201crepatriate\u201d it \u2014 but at reduced tax rates as low as 8 percent.The phenomenon is likely to be on display in the next few weeks, as companies report financial results that look surprisingly weak because of the tax law.Why? Because the repatriation provision is part of a package likely to deliver vastly larger long-term savings for the world\u2019s biggest multinationals. Mr. Zion estimates the benefit from the repatriation tax break alone could be worth $500 billion to companies compared with the old law \u2014 more than double what they\u2019re paying upfront.And so profit warnings that normally would leave investors shuddering are instead being taken in stride.Apple might eventually fork over about $33 billion to the I.R.S. when those earnings come back to America, Mr. Zion said. But, in yet another oddity caused by the tax package, the company might actually record a one-time benefit to its profits.That\u2019s because, over the years, Apple has set aside money, at least in accounting terms, to cover the potential taxes it might owe on its offshore earnings. But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.Going forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.Under the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)The new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.It is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.In Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.Credit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.Several companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain. They included the German automakers BMW and Daimler, which both said the law would provide a temporary benefit of more than $1 billion.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201dThe analysts add:\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.\u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201dG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow\u2019s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT\u2019s Stacy Cowley reports:When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director \u2014after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 could only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u201d That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president.The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.Ensuring that financial services are not badly hit by Brexit is a top priority for the UK, since the sector is Britain\u2019s biggest source of exports and tax revenue.Theresa May\u2019s government has also argued that if the City is damaged it would adversely affect financial stability and EU groups\u2019 cost of financing, while contributing to the fragmentation of the sector.But participants said that in the EU27 meeting the European Commission played down the risks of cutting off the City to EU businesses, saying the financial sector was mobile enough to adapt.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSince then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm.

Time spent on the site by users will probably fall, and that means advertising will grow more slowly. That helps explain the 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s shares by early afternoon on Friday. It\u2019s worth it over the long term, however, if it keeps users sufficiently content to remain on the Facebook farm.The bigger pictureMore from Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly in the NYT:Five years ago, fixed-income trading \u2014 so called because its keystone product, bonds, typically provides a fixed payout \u2014 generated nearly $103 billion in income for the top 12 investment banks, according to Coalition, a London research firm. By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.That client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports.\u201cThe borrowing entity pledged 628 million Steinhoff shares as collateral on the loan, according to a company statement at the time. After the share price collapse, however, that collateral has little value relative to the debt.\u201dHow often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong?That odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary.This obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below].The S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.\u2019s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case.Defendants argued the judges are not mere employees but \u201cofficers\u201d so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status.The S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution.The key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out.-- Peter J.

{"Headline": "Alexa, We\u2019re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors.The challenge isn\u2019t finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom.A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions.Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 \u201cskills\u201d \u2014 third-party apps that tap into Alexa\u2019s voice controls to accomplish tasks \u2014 it makes available.But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, \u201cpeople are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that there is something that\u2019s going to drive people to use these.\u201dThere is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon.Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services \u2014 like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals.With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes.Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant.For now, consumers\u2019 satisfaction with their smart speakers \u2014 and by extension, the onboard assistants \u2014 is helped in part by the fact they didn\u2019t pay a lot to get them into their homes.Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he\u2019s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that.\u201cThere\u2019s only certain things I use it for, but I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my taxes with it.\u201dPaul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances.\u201cThe more interesting functionality is yet to come,\u201d Mr. Erickson said. \u201cPart of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we\u2019re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.\u201dCompetitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software.Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories \u2014 although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language.Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 \u2014 or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units.There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren\u2019t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad\u2019s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once the money from a sale comes in, bankruptcy law dictates who gets paid first \u2014 the banks that kept Weinstein Co. in business \u2014 and who gets paid last \u2014 women claiming that Weinstein Co. was part of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s pattern of alleged sexual misconduct.But it\u2019s complicated. A bankruptcy filing could provide legal structures for Mr. Weinstein\u2019s accusers, like a judge\u2019s supervision of sales and settlements.RICO lawsuits are tempting. They allow a plaintiff to sue a variety of defendants by claiming that they acted together and seek an award of triple damages, a bonanza in some business disputes that can run into millions of dollars. But these cases should also come with a bright red warning sign: Tread lightly or see your case thrown out of court before it even gets started.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tackling the Internet\u2019s Central Villain: The Advertising Business", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSo who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online?This isn\u2019t that hard. You don\u2019t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It\u2019s the advertising business, stupid.And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain \u2014 and perhaps even reform.But the online ad machine is also a vast, opaque and dizzyingly complex contraption with underappreciated capacity for misuse \u2014 one that collects and constantly profiles data about our behavior, creates incentives to monetize our most private desires and frequently unleashes loopholes that the shadiest of people are only too happy to exploit.And for all its power, the digital ad business has long been under-regulated and under-policed, both by the companies that run it and by the world\u2019s governments. In the United States, the industry has been almost untouched by oversight, even though it forms the primary revenue stream of two of the planet\u2019s most valuable companies, Google and Facebook.\u201cIn the early days of online media, the choice was essentially made \u2014 give it away for free, and advertising would produce the revenue,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association that represents companies in the digital ad business. \u201cA lot of the things we see now flow out from that decision.\u201d\u201cTechnology has largely been outpacing the ability of individual companies to understand what is actually going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really an unregulated stock market effect to the whole thing.\u201dThe company also pointed to several steps it had taken recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our ad policies, hired more ad reviewers, and created a new team to help detect and prevent abuses,\u201d said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising. \u201cWe\u2019re also testing a tool that will bring more transparency to ads running on our platform. We know there is more work to do, but our goal is to keep people safe.\u201dA spokesman for Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, said it was constantly policing its ad system, pointing out recent steps it has taken to address problems arising from the ad business, including several changes to YouTube.The role of the ad business in much of what\u2019s terrible online was highlighted in a recent report by two think tanks, New America and Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The report chronicles just how efficient the online ad business has become at profiling, targeting, and persuading people. That\u2019s good news for the companies that want to market to you \u2014 as the online ad machine gets better, marketing gets more efficient and effective, letting companies understand and influence consumer sentiment at a huge scale for little money.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEither you have a brilliant technology that permits microtargeting to exactly the people you want to influence at exactly the right time with exactly the right message \u2014 or you\u2019re only reaching a small number of people and therefore it couldn\u2019t be influential.\u201dThe tinkering continued on Tuesday, when Facebook also said it would ban ads promoting crypto currency schemes, some of which have fallen into scammy territory.Yet these are all piecemeal efforts. They don\u2019t address the underlying logic of the ad business, which produces endless incentives for gaming the system in ways that Google and Facebook discover often only after the fact. Mr. Rothenberg said this was how regulating advertising was likely to go \u2014 a lot of fixes resembling \u201cWhac-a-Mole.\u201dOf course, there is the government. You could imagine some regulator imposing stricter standards for who has access to the online ad system, who makes money from it, how it uses private information and how transparent tech companies must be about it all. But that also seems unlikely; the Honest Ads Act, a proposal to regulate online political ads, has gone nowhere in Congress.I stand by that view, but now I also regret dismissing his warning so cavalierly. Socially, politically and culturally, the online ad business is far more dangerous than I appreciated. Mr. Cook was right, and we should have listened to him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Names Newark and New York City as \u2018HQ2\u2019 Finalists", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York metropolitan area picked up a one-two punch Thursday in the battle among North American cities hoping to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, when both Newark and New York City landed on the retail giant\u2019s shortlist.More than 238 applications poured in to Amazon from cities and regions vying to become its \u201cHQ2.\u201d Amazon has narrowed the list to 20, with most finalists far from the tech-saturated hubs on the West Coast. Along with Newark and New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Denver and Nashville all made the cut.\u201cNew York gets two bites of the apple,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, of the Anderson Economic Group, which advises cities on economic development and had handicapped the Amazon sweepstakes.Before Amazon released its list of finalists, some analysts had dismissed the chances of either New York City or Newark. New York City was considered too expensive, and Newark was seen as hampered by its reputation as a hardscrabble urban center.But Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the city\u2019s most prominent residents, seemed intent Thursday on trying to capitalize on that image by appealing to Amazon\u2019s potential to be a game-changer for the state\u2019s largest city.\u201cWe have sites ready downtown, or on the waterfront. We have universities and fiber,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cAmazon could have a transformative effect on one of America\u2019s oldest cities. This is an opportunity for Amazon to change the narrative about the company and where it\u2019s headed.\u201dNew York City is already home to a large Amazon distribution center in Staten Island and offices for more than 2,000 finance, sales and marketing workers in Manhattan. New Jersey has three Amazon distribution centers, including one 12 miles from Newark.If Amazon finds housing and the cost of doing business too high in New York City, it could turn to Newark, which sits atop the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard and is in the midst of a resurgence. Office and apartment rents are substantially lower and Amazon already has a subsidiary there, Audible.Either way, Amazon could tap into a tech work force of nearly 300,000 people, far more than Chicago (138,813) or Los Angeles (166,234), two cities that also made Amazon\u2019s shortlist. The impact of 50,000 new jobs would be felt throughout the metro area.\u201cNewark, New York City and Chicago all have very strong workforces,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNewark has the advantage on cost of doing business, which is very important to Amazon.\u201dMr. Anderson had put New York at the top of his list when he rated the competition last fall. Nearly three-quarters of his top 20 picks landed on Amazon\u2019s shortlist.But the eventual winner is by no means a foregone conclusion.The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area presents a triple threat, with three areas \u2014 Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, Md., and the capital itself \u2014 making the list. Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon, has a home in Washington and owns the local newspaper, The Washington Post.Still, there are 100,000 more tech workers in the New York region than in Washington and its suburbs.\u201cThis is what Amazon said they wanted in a candidate,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNo incentives, silly sales pitches or talk of how cool their sports teams are.\u201dBut at this stage of the contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, the subsidy packages that competing cities offer Amazon may influence the decision.\u201cAmazon, like most big companies, is dollars-and-cents oriented,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cHere\u2019s where incentive packages may tip the scales.\u201dThe state of New Jersey, which is backing Newark\u2019s bid, has offered the biggest plum of all: $5 billion in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies. Newark officials have also discussed a supplementary subsidy package that could be worth as much as $2 billion.\u201cIn the last decade, Newark has experienced unparalleled growth, paving the way for many new companies to call our city home. A Newark HQ2 would mean tens of thousands of local jobs, a boost to our regional economy and small businesses, and an opportunity for Amazon to take a tremendous stake in the continued transformation of our great city,\u201d Mr. Booker said.Critics contend that the Garden State is being overly generous with tax dollars.\u201cWe remain wary of the steep price tag for taxpayers that state and local lawmakers have already put on this project,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cIt has ensured that the returns will be minimized if Amazon were to ultimately choose the state.\u201dOn the same day New York City submitted its bid to Amazon, Mr. de Blasio criticized the company for its destructive impact on local shop owners. But at this point, neither that criticism nor the lack of an enhanced subsidy package has hurt New York\u2019s chances.\u201cWe\u2019re not changing our approach,\u201d said Alicia Glen, New York City\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development. \u201cWe offered four very viable options in different neighborhoods. If you want to hire 50,000 incredibly smart people, there\u2019s no better place. And a city that has art, culture, food and urban walkability are a huge priority for this generation of workers.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, a business group that has strongly supported the city\u2019s bid for Amazon, said New York\u2019s chances are good.\u201cAmazon is notoriously cheap and our costs our high,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership\u2019s president. \u201cBut in every other way, New York is a winner. It has the markets they want to reach, the talent and a strong history as a global retail capital. The question is, \u2018Does Bezos sees the value of mixing with the global industries and market leaders that are based in New York?\u2019 \u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strava Fitness App Can Reveal Military Sites, Analysts Say", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fitness app that posts a map of its users\u2019 activity has unwittingly revealed the locations and habits of military bases and personnel, including those of American forces in Iraq and Syria, security analysts say.Some analysts have taken to social media to warn that, although the map does not name the people who traced its squiggles and lines, individual users can easily be tracked, by cross-referencing their Strava data with other social media use. That could put individual members of the military at risk, even when they are not in war zones.In Afghanistan, for instance, two of the largest coalition bases in the country \u2014 Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul; and Kandahar Airfield, in southern Afghanistan \u2014 can easily be picked out. The same is true for smaller bases around the country whose existence has long been public.But there also appear to be other airstrips and base-like shapes in places where neither the American-led military forces nor the Central Intelligence Agency are known to have personnel stations.Perhaps more problematic for the military are the thin lines that appear to connect bases. Those lines seem likely to trace the roads or other routes most commonly used by American forces when traveling between locations, and their exposure could leave troops open to attack when they are most vulnerable.The Pentagon did not directly address whether the heat map had revealed any sensitive location data. But Maj. Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said that the Defense Department recommends that all its personnel limit their public social media profiles and that it was reviewing the situation.\u201cRecent data releases emphasize the need for situational awareness when members of the military share personal information,\u201d Major Harris said. The Pentagon \u201ctakes matters like these very seriously and is reviewing the situation to determine if any additional training or guidance is required,\u201d the major added.The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment.Strava is not the first program to collect far more information, including location data, than users realize, nor is it the first to make some of that information available to prying eyes, intentionally or not.But the Strava app, which works with wearable technology, goes even further in tracing people\u2019s locations with precision and sharing that information with the world. The map\u2019s settings show the extent to which routes are traveled, and whether on foot, by bicycle or in a vehicle.Strava, which is based in San Francisco, claims tens of millions of users, in almost every country. The app can be used on Apple and Android phones, and wearable activity trackers like Fitbit devices, the Apple watch, and Garmin and Suunto sports watches.The map \u201cexcludes activities that have been marked as private and user-defined privacy zones,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are committed to helping people better understand our settings to give them control over what they share.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "FeatureYes, it\u2019s driven by greed \u2014 but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.Supported bylayer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maidOn the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}

That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year.

But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201dVia Recode:\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify.\u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201dThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales.

{"Headline": "Amazon Chooses 20 Finalists for Second Headquarters", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Like a college applicant waiting for that special message in the mail, officials in Boston got what they wanted on Thursday: a cryptic four-sentence note informing them that the city made the finals in its bid to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u201cWe would like to move Boston forward in the process so we can continue to learn more about your community, your talent, and potential real estate options,\u201d Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive, wrote in the note. \u201cPlease email me back with available times for a call so we can discuss next steps.\u201dThe winner could get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in investment, figures that Amazon has dangled in front of local officials, setting off an unprecedented competition to be the second home for one of the internet\u2019s mightiest companies. In all, 238 cities and regions applied to bring the company to town, many using promises of tax breaks and public charm offensives to gain favor with the e-commerce giant.The finalists include places like Newark, where the local economy has struggled for decades, and hip centers like Miami and Austin, Tex. For other cities, like Los Angeles and New York, luring Amazon would cement their place as centers of the tech industry.The other finalists are Atlanta; Chicago; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Md.; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; Washington and Toronto \u2014 the only one outside the United States.Officials from the 20 locations celebrated their selections and, in most cases, reiterated their pitches for why Amazon should ultimately pick them. Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, said Amazon would have \u201ca tremendous social and economic impact on this city, state and region by coming to Newark.\u201dKathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, reacted with what could be perceived as a dig at her American competitors. Toronto was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d for Amazon, in part because of Canada\u2019s universal health care system and its openness to immigrants, she said.\u201cWe are already welcoming the best and brightest talent from around the world \u2014 no matter where you come from, you are welcome and you will feel at home in Ontario,\u201d Ms. Wynne said.But there were several surprise snubs, too. Amazon rejected applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego, plus all the bids from Mexico. The list leaned east, away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast.\u201cGetting from 238 to 20 was very tough \u2014 all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\u201d Ms. Sullivan, Amazon\u2019s head of economic development, said in a statement. \u201cThrough this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\u201dAmazon shrouded its selection process in secrecy. On Thursday, the company said little about how it had pared down the list, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier.The process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate, according to people briefed on the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term \u201cHQ2,\u201d was also involved, the people said.The veil of secrecy kept even the finalist cities in the dark until Thursday\u2019s announcement.Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, was on her way into the office when a deputy mayor called and said that the city had made the Top 20. \u201cI was, of course, pleased, but not that surprised because we know that Washington, D.C., matches what Amazon is looking for,\u201d Ms. Bowser said.Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.\u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said.The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year \u2014 and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. Emissaries from Amazon are expected to visit the finalist locations in person.Some of the finalists are neighbors, setting up what are likely to be intense regional rivalries. Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.\u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201dMayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.\u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.\u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201dTiffany Hsu, Patricia Mazzei, Conor Dougherty, Mitch Smith, Kirk Johnson and Zach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your iPhone Slowed Down. Here\u2019s What to Do When the Solution Is Just as Slow.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWhen Kathryn Schipper discovered in December that her iPhone had slowed down because it needed a new battery, she unknowingly walked into the middle of a growing Apple controversy \u2014 and is now mired in the continuing fallout.Yet when Ms. Schipper, who lives in Seattle, took her iPhone 6 Plus, purchased in 2014, to an Apple store in early January, she was told that the store was out of replacement batteries for at least two weeks. An Apple representative later left her a voice mail message with a new estimated wait time: up to four months.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m waiting outside of a club and the bouncer won\u2019t let me in because I\u2019m not fashionably enough dressed,\u201d Ms. Schipper said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m at the back of the line because I don\u2019t have a fancy phone.\u201dFor iPhone owners, Ms. Schipper\u2019s experience does not have to be the way forward. Even as Apple appears to be struggling to keep up with customers asking for new batteries, there are other ways to make sure your smartphone is still running. The workarounds include finding a reputable third-party repair shop, using a battery pack or replacing the battery on your own.Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.\u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201dFinding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.If you don\u2019t feel confident hiring a third-party fixer or installing your own battery, you can always wait for Apple to replace your battery. But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack. In the meantime, she is constantly plugging her iPhone into a power outlet because her battery lasts only two hours a day.Yet she has resisted what she thinks Apple wants: for her to buy a new phone.\u201cI was tempted to just chuck this phone and suck it up and spend $1,000-plus and get the iPhone X,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, darn it, I have a budget I\u2019m saving up.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to let Apple push me around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Promising Billions to Amazon: Is It a Good Deal for Cities?", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany economists, however, saw something else: a failed development strategy that they had hoped was falling out of favor.In their view, tax incentives are little more than corporate giveaways that divert money from education, infrastructure and other priorities that ultimately do more for a region\u2019s economy. In the last decade, those arguments seemed to be gaining traction, as state and local officials put limits on once-generous handouts.\u201cThe stakes are getting higher and the deals are getting worse for the taxpayer,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of tax incentives.More than 200 North American cities submitted bids for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, and the enthusiasm is hardly surprising. The e-commerce giant has said it plans to invest as much as $5 billion in the project and to hire up to 50,000 workers, most earning high salaries. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the project could be \u201ctransformational even for a big city.\u201dBut the project also carries risks. Accommodating Amazon\u2019s thousands of workers will require hiring more teachers, widening roads and building more housing. The costs for those upgrades will fall on residents and existing businesses.Gina Schaefer, who owns a dozen hardware stores in the Washington area, said she did not mind paying taxes, and had learned to deal with the bureaucratic hurdles that come with running a small business in the area. But she said it was frustrating to watch local governments \u2014 three of the 20 finalists for the Amazon project are in the Washington area \u2014 roll out the red carpet for a multibillion-dollar corporation. Suddenly, she said, her tax dollars could be flowing to one of her most daunting competitors.\u201cThere are no incentives for those of us who are already here,\u201d Ms. Schaefer said. Alluding to Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, she added, \u201cWhy should the richest man in the history of the world get money to open his business?\u201dIndeed, tax incentives tend to flow overwhelmingly to big, established companies, rather than to the local start-ups that research has shown are a more significant source of job growth. And some who have studied the issue say incentives rarely work: Companies will play cities and states off one another to save money, but ultimately base site-selection decisions mostly on other factors.Megan Randall, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies economic development policy, said companies cared most about a talented work force, which requires good schools and colleges, and amenities like affordable housing, parks and public transit that make a place desirable. Tax incentives, she said, make those investments harder for local governments to afford.\u201cThose dollars are things that could go toward educating kids, building roads, investing in quality of life for your residents,\u201d Ms. Randall said.Many local officials acknowledge the downsides to incentives, and say they try to build in protections, such as clawback clauses that require companies to repay incentives if they do not hire as many workers as promised. But they say that refusing to offer incentives at all is the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.\u201cNobody wants to get involved in it, nobody wants to have to do this, but we\u2019re in a competitive environment,\u201d said Dennis M. Davin, secretary of community and economic development for Pennsylvania, where two cities \u2014 Philadelphia and Pittsburgh \u2014 are among the 20 finalists for the Amazon project.Still, until recently there had been signs that cities and states were, if not declaring a cease-fire, at least taking steps toward de-escalation in the incentive wars. Counties in Ohio and Colorado reached regional agreements to stop using tax breaks to compete with one another, and Florida\u2019s Legislature voted to rein in that state\u2019s business incentive program. Several states commissioned audits of their programs and took steps to make them more transparent.And although megadeals never disappeared, the growth of incentives programs did slow for a period. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., has compiled a database of state tax incentives dating back to 1990. The value of such incentives soared in the 1990s, Mr. Bartik has found, but has largely leveled off since the early 2000s.\u201cIt really seemed like the incentive competition had kind of stabilized,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.Economists are not opposed to all incentives in all cases. Publicly funded transportation upgrades or job-training programs, for example, can help entice companies while also benefiting existing businesses. Tax credits aimed at revitalizing abandoned, polluted or blighted areas can encourage development that eventually expands a city\u2019s tax base.That is essentially the approach taken by New York, another Amazon finalist. Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said Amazon would probably get hardly any tax breaks if it chose to locate its second headquarters in Midtown or Lower Manhattan, the city\u2019s two traditional business centers. But the company would get tax breaks if it selected less-established sites in Brooklyn or Queens. Those incentives, she noted, are available to any company that locates in those areas, although New York State could also offer its own tax breaks.\u201cWe don\u2019t rely on incentives, but we do have incentives in place to encourage companies to go to parts of the city that they might not otherwise consider,\u201d Ms. Glen said.Many cities have kept the details of their bids under wraps, but have left little doubt that they are open to negotiations.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be outbid on Amazon doing business here,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas. \u201cWe dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best.\u201dBut even in Texas, there are limits.\u201cI knew it was going to be a big bloody incentive war,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, \u201cand I just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to play in that kind of game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of community and economic development.

{"Headline": "MoneyGram and Ant Financial Call Off Merger, Citing Regulatory Concerns", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 United States officials have effectively killed a Chinese company\u2019s $1.2 billion plan to buy MoneyGram, the money transfer company, signaling the Trump administration\u2019s growing skepticism of Chinese purchases of American companies and of broader business ties between the two economic powers.MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, said Tuesday that they had canceled the deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies.The move comes amid a shifting relationship between the two countries. The MoneyGram-Ant Financial deal collapsed as tensions have grown over who will control the technologies of the future. As the scotched deal shows, China and America are also increasingly at loggerheads over whether private data will be kept safe as money and corporate ownership cross borders.\u201cThe geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,\u201d the chief executive of MoneyGram, Alex Holmes, said.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon who controls Ant Financial. Shortly after Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.That push apparently could not compete with Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about Chinese money and deal makers, and with his administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisitions of American know-how. The administration is finishing an investigation into Chinese theft of intellectual property owned by American companies, which could result in tariffs on Chinese imports or further restrictions on Chinese investment.At a daily news conference on Wednesday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said that the government hopes the United States could create a level playing field for Chinese companies.Other deals under review include the sale of SkyBridge Capital \u2014 an investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of Mr. Trump \u2014 to an arm of HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate.The collapse of the deal offers the latest sign of a shift \u2014 one that began during the end of the Obama administration \u2014 over how Washington treats Chinese acquisitions of American assets.That has led to calls to tighten reviews of Chinese purchases of American assets. Chinese investment surged to more than $130 billion in 2017 from just $21.5 billion in 2012, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm. In 2018, bankers say they expect another big year of investment, targeted more at sectors considered important to future economic growth like high technology and renewable energy.The deal\u2019s demise also illustrates rising concerns in both the United States and China over sensitive personal data. In buying a large-scale money-transfer company like MoneyGram, Ant Financial would have had access to a large number of records of financial flows within the United States. That fact, combined with close ties to China\u2019s government, could have created security problems. For example, the flow of funds could point to possible espionage targets in the United States military who face financial difficulties.Ant Financial has disputed such claims, saying that consumer data would continue to be stored in the United States.\u201cThis deal fell apart because Ant Financial is from China, a country that has little credibility when it comes to protecting personal data,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAdd to that the lack of reciprocity \u2014 China would never countenance such a deal in reverse \u2014 and one could ask why Alibaba would expect to find a sympathetic hearing in Washington.\u201dCritics of the deal also asked whether Ant Financial would be able to properly police transactions linked to money laundering or terrorism. Ant Financial had said the deal would give MoneyGram greater resources to toughen its efforts to prevent money laundering.China, as well, has taken steps to stanch American company access to data. A new cybersecurity law there forces American companies to keep data on Chinese citizens stored within China, while Chinese state-media have run public service announcements warning about private data collected by Apple\u2019s iPhones.\u201cData flows out of and into China are an increasing source of suspicion in the bilateral relationship,\u201d said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He said Washington was in the \u201cparadoxical position\u201d of criticizing the new Chinese law while opposing deals like MoneyGram because of national security concerns.For Ant Financial, the decision is a setback to its efforts to extend its strong position in online payments abroad. Ant Financial, which grew out of the Chinese payment service Alipay, wanted to buy MoneyGram to accelerate its global expansion. In the past several years, the company has pushed into India, South Korea and Thailand.Mr. Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon, has worked hard to put a positive face on his companies in the United States. He also controls the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s largest internet company, and last year he hosted a conference in Detroit aimed at helping American businesses sell on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites.Amid the heightened sensitivity to overseas purchases, MoneyGram and Ant Financial said it was clear that Cfius would not approve the deal, despite their efforts to quell concerns.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Paul Mozur from Taipei, Taiwan.Advertisement"}

Bet You Didn\u2019t Watch Them All.", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Too many TV shows to choose from?You\u2019re not alone.At least 487 original scripted programs aired in 2017, the latest record-breaking figure for the TV industry, according to data released Friday by the cable network FX.That was more than the 455 shows that broadcast in 2016, more than the 288 in 2012 and far more than the 182 from 15 years ago.In 2013, the year that Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d premiered, online services distributed only 24 original programs. In 2017, that number skyrocketed to 117.Others are responsible, too, though. In the last five years, premium cable has seen 45 percent growth in the number of original programs and basic cable networks a 40 percent rise, and even the broadcast networks have grown by 29 percent, according to FX. This doesn\u2019t even include the large number of non-scripted reality or documentary series.Even lesser-known shows are plugging along. \u201cFuller House,\u201d a Netflix revival of the old ABC family sitcom, released its third season, to little fanfare, last year.\u201cSomeone will tweet me, and they will be, like, \u2018I watched all four seasons in two days,\u2019\u201d the Australian comedian Josh Thomas said last year about his show, \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d \u201cThat took me five years to fill that two days,\u201d he added, with an expletive for emphasis.Still, the freewheeling spending of the streaming services has prompted more networks to spend more than they usually would. (A respectable drama costs at least $3 million an episode to make.) It is not clear just how many players will be able to sustain that pace.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the streaming services are putting an enormous amount of pressure on the business model,\u201d John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, said at a news media event on Friday.But cancellations have done little to stop the glut of programming.With all of this content, there remain three players that make what are perceived to be the best TV shows, at least in the past year.FX, HBO and Netflix accounted for 55 percent of the shows on critics\u2019 best-of-2017 lists, according to FX. Netflix had 24 percent, HBO 21 percent and FX 10 percent. The rest were distributed by dozens of other TV networks, like NBC, Showtime, Hulu and AMC.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Warren Buffett has given two potential successors new high-profile titles at Berkshire Hathaway.\u2022 Sears issues another ominous warning about its fate as it tries to turn itself around.\u2022 Chinese government officials reportedly view Treasury bonds as less attractive. \u2022 And how will President Trump tout \u201cAmerica first\u201d at the World Economic Forum?\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWho are they?\u2022 Mr. Abel is the chairman of Berkshire\u2019s energy unit, which earned $2.3 billion in 2016. He\u2019ll be vice chairman for non-insurance businesses.\u2022 Mr. Jain is the longtime head of Berkshire\u2019s vast reinsurance operations. He will become vice chairman for insurance operations.Still, there are plenty of reasons for bond investors to be jittery these days. Central banks around the world are in tightening mode and are stepping back from the bond market. The global economy is gathering momentum and expectations for higher inflation are picking up.What Sears said it plans to do now\u2022 The company has already arranged a new $100 million loan backed by ground leases and some intellectual property\u2022 It is trying to raise an additional $200 million, supported by the same collateral\u2022 It is trying to secure more than $600 million in a new credit facility, backed by additional property.\u2022 Cut some $200 million in costs that aren\u2019t tied to store closures.\u2022 Potentially close more Sears and Kmart stores.These steps, Sears asserted, should help the company return to profitability this year.What Sears\u2019s chairman, Eddie Lampert, saysWhile these actions have so far helped our company survive the so-called \u201cRetail Apocalypse\u201d, many observers are not persuaded that Sears Holdings can be a viable competitor in the long term. It is obvious that to overcome such skepticism and obtain the support of outside lenders and our vendor community \u2013 which is crucial to the success of any retailer \u2013 we need to undertake further measures.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFrom Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources:China holds the world\u2019s largest foreign-exchange reserves, at $3.1 trillion, and regularly assesses its strategy for investing them.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will G.E. be broken up? Maybe not in the way people think.\u2022 Nestl\u00e9 signs a deal to sell its U.S. confectionary business to Ferrero.\u2022 Why Elliott is agitating at Bezeq.\u2022 The one interesting number from Silver Lake\u2019s $3.5 billion bid for Blackhawk Network.\u2022 Qualcomm\u2019s busy M.&A. day.On a conference call with analysts, Mr. Flannery said:\u201cWe are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses. Our results, over the past several years, including 2017 and the insurance charge, only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape GE.\u201dIt\u2019s more likely that Mr. Flannery and his team will consider unique ways of separating G.E.\u2019s core business units without actually splitting them completely apart. But it\u2019s all somewhat speculative at the moment.It is now abundantly apparent that the previous management team led by Jeff Immelt had little handle on the comings and goings of all the pieces of this sprawling conglomerate. The reasons for keeping GE together \u2014 shared resources and technology \u2014 look increasingly tenuous. If you ask employees, they don\u2019t really see the benefit of having both a power and an aviation business, for example.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Michael J. de la MercedThe attorneys general said the rollback of so-called net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and a reversal of a longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.The petition to begin the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court of Appeals in Washington, is the first legal challenge against the F.C.C.\u2019s order in December. Several others are expected, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and Free Press, which argue that the F.C.C.\u2019s order was harmful to consumers and was done hastily and without proper public input.The numbers\u201cWith Ferrero we have found an exceptional home for our U.S. confectionery business where it will thrive. At the same time, this move allows Nestl\u00e9 to invest and innovate across a range of categories where we see strong future growth and hold leadership positions, such as pet care, bottled water, coffee, frozen meals and infant nutrition.\u201dThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOne of Elliott\u2019s first campaigns of 2018 sees the activist hedge fund going even further abroad: Its latest target is Bezeq, the once-government-owned Israeli telecom company. The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.The context Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.What Elliott wants\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the companyAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.What could lie aheadBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release. (More on that below.)The backstoryThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firstQualcomm unveiled its first official \u201cfight letter\u201d in its campaign to beat back Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for the chip maker.Among the highlights of the letter:\u2022 Qualcomm says that it will deliver between $6.75 and $7.50 in pro forma earnings per share for its 2019 fiscal year.\u2022 A pledge to continue the company\u2019s its cost-savings program.\u2022 A reiteration that Broadcom\u2019s offer ignores the upswing that the emerging 5G wireless standard will bring for Qualcomm\u2019s stock.Broadcom is asking Qualcomm stockholders to voluntarily transfer to a hostile acquirer the considerable near- and long-term value creation Qualcomm has in front of it. It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.The secondRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done \u2014 but at a higher price.Should Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s a look at its results by the numbers:\u2014 Stephen GrocerGoldman\u2019s commodities unit has been under scrutiny both within the bank and among investors since it revealed its second-quarter performance was the worst in its post-IPO history. That triggered an informal review of the unit and several high-profile departures, including global commodities head Gregory Agran.The bank\u2019s commodities earnings in the final three months of 2017 were better than the previous two quarters as losing natural gas trades were closed. Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.Goldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time.It took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.And it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\u2014 Stephen GrocerVia ValueWalk:Despite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.More in corporate social activism \u201cThese guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures.\u201dIn other media deals:A few years ago I met with a very successful entrepreneur who built his company outside of the tech sector. When I asked him about equity compensation he said to me \u201cYou people in tech are crazy. I pay my employees handsomely in cash and I keep all of the equity for myself.\u201dHe adds:We should be confronting the true cost of this practice and asking ourselves if it is best for our employees, and if so, which ones, and if it is best for our companies and our shareholders.The tech and telecom flyaround\u201cWe talk to everybody, and we are continuously learning and making selections on the basis of the best available technology.\u201dMr. Marchionne also confirmed that this will be his last year leading Fiat Chrysler, with a successor to be named in March.The Detroit Auto Show flyaroundThat\u2019s an actual question posed in a private forum that was sent to us by a reader this weekend.Investors \u201cshould be prepared to lose all their money\u201d in Bitcoin, said Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong.The digital money flyarounddamageAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World\u2019s Computers", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201cWhat actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,\u201d said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability \u201chas existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.\u201d It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of A.W.S. and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers \u2014 and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers\u2019 data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability \u2014 at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel\u2019s business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.\u201cIntel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIntel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.\u201dThe researchers who discovered the flaws notified various affected companies. And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.For now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel\u2019s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is \u201cgoing to live with us for decades,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.\u201cWhereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve really screwed up,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThere\u2019s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.\u201dThe Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.The researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.The second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.\u201cThis will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It\u2019s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.\u201dFollow Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @nicoleperlothAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have We Aged Out of Age Spots?", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkin DeepAging can bring unwelcome surprises, like crusty brown spots that gradually appear on your face, neck or trunk.They\u2019re called unflattering names: age spots, barnacles or, God help us, senile warts, but physicians know them as seborrheic keratosis lesions, or SK lesions, for short. They come in as many varieties as apples at a farmers\u2019 market: waxy, warty, raised or flat. The good news is they\u2019re benign.And there hasn\u2019t been an easy cosmetic treatment, until now.On Dec. 14, the Food and Drug Administration approved a first-of-its-kind liquid called Eskata that targets these unsightly spots. By late April, people who have the means and the patience to sit through at least two visits to their dermatologist\u2019s office can get rid of some raised spots.\u201cA lot of patients have SKs and want them gone,\u201d said Ellen Marmur, a dermatologist with two Manhattan practices who wasn\u2019t part of the clinical trials conducted by Aclaris Therapeutics, the maker of Eskata. She thinks it has the potential to be a \u201cgreat tool\u201d in carefully selected patients.Some people have one or two spots. Others have dozens across their chest and back. \u201cThe sheer number of lesions can be depressing,\u201d said Victor Neel, the director of dermatologic surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, adding that he has heard people say \u201cthey haven\u2019t taken off their shirt at the beach in 25 years.\u201dBefore Eskata, dermatologists could freeze lesions or use a laser or scalpel to remove them, but the procedures could be painful and patients didn\u2019t necessarily want to risk potential scarring for a cosmetic annoyance.Here\u2019s how Eskata works: After a dermatologist has determined a spot is not cancer, a staff person (not necessarily a doctor) delicately applies the highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide liquid to each lesion four times, roughly a minute apart. The idea is to moisten the lesion to dissolve it, while avoiding damaging surrounding skin.Noelle Galperin, a 49-year-old strategy consultant in Miami who participated in a clinical trial at Leslie Baumann\u2019s office, said she felt a \u201ctingling, almost burning, sensation.\u201d Later, scabs formed on her lesions, and she wore an adhesive bandage for a few weeks to hide the spots from the sun.Ms. Galperin used to be so self-conscious about the lesion on her forehead that she would Photoshop it out of pictures. \u201cWho wants to be seen with brown age spots?\u201d she said. After her Eskata treatments, the spot on her forehead is gone with no scar or sign she had it removed.She also wanted two larger spots on her back treated so \u201cthere\u2019s no chance of seeing them in my wedding dress,\u201d said Ms. Galperin, who will marry soon in France in a gown with a V-shaped back in scalloped lace. One is gone, but the other, she said, will need another treatment to remove it completely.\u201cPatients need to know that there\u2019s a chance after two treatments their lesion may be gone and they\u2019ll be happy,\u201d said Robert T. Brodell, the chairman of the department of dermatology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Miss. \u201cOr some may have a lesion that\u2019s 90 percent better, or some might take a third touch-up treatment.\u201dStill, Dr. Brodell called Eskata \u201csomething that\u2019s totally different that\u2019s an advance.\u201dIn one study, approximately 65 percent of the facial lesions on roughly 220 patients were completely or almost clear 106 days after the first treatment, compared with 15 percent of roughly 225 patients who got a placebo liquid.In an interview, Dr. Walker estimated that each Eskata applicator will cost the patient $200 to $250. One applicator, he estimated, will be able to treat seven large spots up to 1.5 centimeters wide, or 10 smaller ones.Dr. Neel is starting a company to bring to market his own topical treatment for SKs, one that would theoretically work by inhibiting an enzyme that the lesions need for survival. The lesion would die, but the regular skin wouldn\u2019t be damaged, so large areas of skin could be treated quickly. But that is years off.Some research has found that Eskata has minimal side effects when carefully applied. More than 90 percent of the mostly white patients had no scarring or pigmentation issues. But darker skin tends to have more trouble with pigmentation and scarring after, say, cryotherapy. Ninety-eight percent of patients in the clinical trials were Caucasian.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge gap in the study design,\u201d Dr. Marmur said.The Fitzpatrick phototyping scale classifies complexions from Type 1 (ivory) to 6 (very dark). In one study to measure the effectiveness and safety of Eskata, no patients had the darkest skin tone, and only four of the 450 enrolled participants had Type 5, which resembles Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s skin.Dr. Marmur said that until that research is published, she would do a test spot before using Eskata on darker skin. \u201cThat patient might come back with a big keloid,\u201d a scar bigger than the disliked spot, she said.As for Ms. Galperin, she would love to get the stubborn brown spot on her back treated again before her February wedding, and tackle another raised spot on her back.Alas, Eskata won\u2019t be commercially available until April, too late for her big day.An earlier version of this article misstated Robert T. Brodell\u2019s title. He is the chairman of the department of dermatology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, not a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ad Executive Often in the Vanguard Peers Into the Future", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe responses underscored Mr. Norman\u2019s reputation, built over more than three decades, as a clarifying voice in a cacophonous media landscape.Mr. Norman, 57, has had a front-row view of that shifting world through his roles at GroupM, which spends billions of dollars a year on behalf of a long roster of WPP advertisers, from Campbell Soup to Unilever. (GroupM, where Mr. Norman remains a consultant, claims it\u2019s responsible for one out of every three ads worldwide.)While television and newspapers were the dominant forces in his native England when Mr. Norman started his career, he began working with online advertising in the mid-1990s, taking on challenges like increasing listings on search engines like Excite and AltaVista.Later, he guided brands and colleagues through the heydays of MSN and Yahoo and the rise of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and streaming TV. Along the way, Mr. Norman became known for sharing his insights at industry events and in trade publications, always with a healthy dose of dry British wit.Mr. Norman recently spoke with The New York Times about where the media and advertising worlds are now and where he thinks they are going. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.There is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.The people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.At the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters. Then it was held by this display triumvirate of Yahoo, MSN and AOL and, separately, search by Google. And it took quite a long time to get here.If you asked anyone in 2009, \u2018Guess what the combined market shares of Google and Facebook will be in 2017,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure there would have been anyone that would have come close.How long do you think will they maintain that position? It kind of depends on what Google and Facebook allocate their resources to, and like everybody else, it depends on how they manage to navigate actual and potential regulatory environments going forward. I think if they were both worried about a thing today, it would be what regulators think about them, because they\u2019re not at the peak of their popularity with those folks at the moment, it would seem to me.I think that\u2019s why people are so interested in the Amazon story and were so interested in the Snap story and were so interested in Twitter\u2019s story \u2014 because everyone\u2019s looking for the next one to break through.What\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to look and feel completely different that disrupts how people interface with the world around them? My guess is that five to seven years from now, there will be at least one company that people will think of in the top five most important enterprises in advertising that simply doesn\u2019t exist now.Imagine a massively emboldened Hulu.If Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.You could have things like day-after episodes of new drama of the Hulu model and then the entire movie libraries of Universal, Fox, Disney, Pixar and all of the other stuff with it.Then what happens if that same group of people says to the broadcasters of the world: \u201cWhat we have here is a working business model of what the studio system plus the broadcast system can look like in a new world, with a tiered-option model based on some combination of live, day-after, on-demand, paid, ad-funded and so forth, and basically you could slice it whichever way you\u2019d like for your market. We\u2019ve got the content block and the technology license block so that everyone can build their own castle in all these markets.\u201dIt may not be owned 100 percent by one company, but it could be a new phenomenon that could be a kind of distributed monopoly, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really thought about.And this could potentially run ads?Because you\u2019re using the same underlying systems, you suddenly have a data pool that crosses all of that content, all of those users and potentially all of those markets. People are asking the question about what\u2019s the third force? That would probably be the answer.What\u2019s another way that could go?I think if I learned one thing over my career, it is that Newton was right: The objects that are in motion stay in motion, and that motion tends to accelerate, hit plateaus and reaccelerate.Given the asymmetry of certain enterprises in the world, you kind of wonder as to whether or not new Disney, with all of its IP, has in fact become the juiciest peach in the world to be consumed by Apple.If Apple was going to make a \u201cone bound and you\u2019re serious\u201d move into the video content business globally, and the provision of video service business globally, it could make sense. You then have most of Hulu and all of the IP in Pixar, Marvel and all of the other things that Bob Iger has been assembling over the years, and you have ESPN. That wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place to start, and they could do it for 30 percent of their market cap.You can on one hand take it at face value and say that Facebook is taking a step back to their roots. The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.The one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?What have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that? It seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news. I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big appetite for Facebook saying, \u201cWe would like 20 news organizations to provide news bulletin programming for Facebook Watch.\u201dWe know there are dozens and dozens of news organizations around the world, or at least a dozen or two that include The Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, the BBC and so on, who are, for the most part, the keepers of truth in news and the people who keep the public informed.And it seems odd to me that if you have aspirations to take up a very significant part of the media consumption time of the public that you do not have an overt policy for the dissemination of news and to participate in the funding of news for your audience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Said to Be Going Public in Early 2018", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify is finally ready to go public.The streaming music giant filed a confidential registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late December, with the intention of listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of this year, according to two people briefed on the company\u2019s plans who were not authorized to discuss them.As expected, Spotify will pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued \u2014 and therefore no money is raised \u2014 but existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. Such a listing would bypass much of the bureaucracy of a standard initial public offering, saving the company time and potentially millions in underwriting fees.The move, if it goes forward as planned, would be the most prominent music-related listing since Pandora Media\u2019s initial public offering in 2011, and would recognize Spotify, which began its service 10 years ago, as a transformative force in the music industry. After some 15 years of decline, revenues of recorded music sales began to recover in 2015, largely thanks to streaming.A Spotify spokesman declined to comment.In the United States, streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music account for more than two-thirds of the business, according to Nielsen, and are still growing rapidly. According to BuzzAngle, another music data tracker, American listeners streamed 377 billion songs last year, up 50 percent from 2016.Spotify would be coming to the public stock markets at an auspicious time. Last year, 138 companies \u2014 including well-known ones like Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat \u2014 went public, up 45 percent from 2016, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Together they raised $30.6 billion, roughly double the amount raised in 2016.But last year\u2019s burst of activity remained well below the decade-high mark set in 2014, as the ease of raising money in private markets has dissuaded big start-ups from pursuing I.P.O.s. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have pushed off market debuts while amassing valuations that rival their publicly traded brethren.What Spotify is doing is different, however, and has few precedents. Most companies that have pursued direct listings have been much smaller, with the exception of Freddie Mac in 1989. Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary.A prospectus from Spotify, expected to be made public before the listing, would shine additional light on the company\u2019s finances and on the economics underlying streaming music.Spotify is hoping to avoid that fate with newly renegotiated licensing deals with the major record companies that lessened Spotify\u2019s royalty rates by a few percentage points, and by maintaining its growth around the world. The service is available in 61 territories, from Greece to Guatemala.But while streaming has lifted revenues at the major record companies, which have minority stakes in the company, musicians and songwriters remain skeptical of Spotify\u2019s model, and of their ability to earn livable wages from Spotify.Spotify had no comment on the lawsuit.Advertisement"}

But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age. He is 54, not 53.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s Message: Contribute to Society, or Risk Losing Our Support", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOn Tuesday, the chief executives of the world\u2019s largest public companies will be receiving a letter from one of the most influential investors in the world. And what it says is likely to cause a firestorm in the corner offices of companies everywhere and a debate over social responsibility that stretches from Wall Street to Washington.Laurence D. Fink, founder and chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, is going to inform business leaders that their companies need to do more than make profits \u2014 they need to contribute to society as well if they want to receive the support of BlackRock.Mr. Fink has the clout to make this kind of demand: His firm manages more than $6 trillion in investments through 401(k) plans, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, making it the largest investor in the world, and he has an outsize influence on whether directors are voted on and off boards.It may be a watershed moment on Wall Street, one that raises all sorts of questions about the very nature of capitalism. \u201cIt will be a lightning rod for sure for major institutions investing other people\u2019s money,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management and an expert on corporate leadership. \u201cIt is huge for an institutional investor to take this position across its portfolio.\u2018\u2018 He said he\u2019s seen \u201cnothing like it.\u2019\u2019In a candid assessment of what\u2019s happening in the business world \u2014 and perhaps taking a veiled shot at Washington at the same time \u2014 Mr. Fink wrote that he is seeing \u201cmany governments failing to prepare for the future, on issues ranging from retirement and infrastructure to automation and worker retraining.\u201d He added, \u201cAs a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges.\u201dIt is a refrain that we\u2019re hearing more and more from various pockets of the business community, and in fact last year company leaders found themselves taking stands on issues like immigration policy, race relations, gay rights and more.But for the world\u2019s largest investor to say it aloud \u2014 and declare that he plans to hold companies accountable \u2014 is a bracing example of the evolution of corporate America. Mr. Fink says he is adding staff to help monitor how companies respond; only time will tell whether BlackRock truly uses his firm\u2019s heft to influence new social initiatives.Part of Mr. Fink\u2019s argument rests on the changing mood of the country regarding social responsibility. He contends that if a company doesn\u2019t engage with the community and have a sense of purpose \u201cit will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.\u201dCompanies often talk about contributing to society \u2014 sometimes breathlessly \u2014 but it is typically written off as a marketing gimmick aimed at raising profits or appeasing regulators.Mr. Fink\u2019s declaration is different because his constituency in this case is the business community itself. It pits him, to some degree, against many of the companies that he\u2019s invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.Until recently, companies like BlackRock have traditionally been passive investors and have done little to pressure the leaders of companies they invested in; in fact they were known for rubber stamping management\u2019s plans. It was active investors who sought to hold companies accountable \u2014 either by agitating for change or by selling their shares to express their displeasure.Indeed, Mr. Fink has in the past denounced \u201cactivist\u201d shareholders as too focused on the short term. \u201cIf you asked me if activism harms job creation, the answer is yes,\u201d he told me back in 2014. Now he is changing his stripes.Over the past two years, for example, BlackRock quietly became a thorn in the side of Exxon. In 2016, the firm withheld support from two directors as a protest against Exxon\u2019s \u201cnon-engagement\u201d policy, which barred independent board members from meeting with shareholders like Mr. Fink. Then, in 2017, BlackRock supported a shareholder proposal to enhance the company\u2019s disclosures on climate, in part because Exxon\u2019s policy prevented the firm from getting a full understanding of its long-term strategy and risk exposure.The climate disclosure proposal ultimately passed, and just last month Exxon agreed to publish climate impact reports. Perhaps even more notably, Exxon also changed its policy of non-engagement, and now permits meetings between shareholders and independent directors.BlackRock has even begun siding with activist investors themselves, something it hasn\u2019t publicized. One of its funds voted in favor of the activist Nelson Peltz last year in his proxy fight with Procter & Gamble. It also voted in favor of Bill Ackman against ADP. BlackRock voted in favor of activist-led proposals in 19 percent of proxy fights last year and that number is likely to rise.The chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, once referred to Jana as \u201cgreedy bastards\u201d when the firm was attacking him. But here was Jana espousing the importance of issues like public health, human capital management and environmental protection, and saying that \u201ccompanies pursuing business practices that make short-term sense may be undermining their own long-term viability.\u201d\u201cIn the case of Apple,\u201d Jana wrote, \u201cwe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy, and the company itself, are inextricably linked.\u201d (Side note: It isn\u2019t clear why Jana went after Apple, considering that it has better tools to manage the use of its products by children than anyone else in the industry; but the general idea of technology companies paying more attention to children\u2019s health is a good one.)Mr. Fink makes a point in his letter that the recent corporate tax cut could bring out the kind of activist investors he once denounced. \u201cTax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows,\u201d he said, \u201cand companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns.\u201dDespite Mr. Fink\u2019s insistence that companies benefit society, it\u2019s worth noting he\u2019s not playing down the importance of profits and, while it\u2019s a subtle point, he believes that having social purpose is inextricably linked to a company\u2019s ability to maintain its profits.On that score, Mr. Fink and Friedman aren\u2019t that far apart. \u201cIt may well be in the long-run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government,\u201d Friedman wrote in 1970, adding that this approach may make it easier to attract desirable employees along with \u201cother worthwhile effects.\u201dBut he also added a dollop of reality to the debate. Noting \u201cwidespread aversion\u201d to things like capitalism, profits and the \u201csoulless corporation,\u201d he wrote that social responsibility is \u201cone way for a corporation to generate goodwill as a byproduct of expenditures that are entirely justified in its own self-interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Child a Phone \u2018Addict\u2019?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI have spent the past 15 years helping teens with organization and time management. Many parents of kids I work with are conflicted about their teens\u2019 smartphone use. They appreciate the convenience of having access to their children and the potential safety benefits. And, in an age of social media socialization, teenagers use messaging apps to stay in touch with friends and make social plans, some of which can be positive.When a high school student I work with broke his neck playing football this past fall, his smartphone became a crucial link not just to friends, but also to others dealing with similar injuries. After watching videos of others documenting their recovery on YouTube, he connected with some via Facebook Messenger and began conversations he found \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201dFor some teens, the constant potential feedback loop from notifications and messaging might create a fear of missing out, or FOMO. And although there is currently no official medical recognition of \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d as a disease or disorder, the term refers to obsessive behaviors that disturb the course of daily activities in a way that mirrors patterns similar to substance abuse.In my work with students, I\u2019ve found that even teenagers who want to curb their phone use may find it difficult to self-regulate without parental guidance. Creating daily and weekly offline time as part of the family routine is helpful, and finding a way to have a once- or twice-yearly extended period of time off \u2014 at a summer camp or outdoor expedition without Wi-Fi, or on a family trip \u2014 may provide the reset teens need to break negative habits.For parents thinking of getting their kids smartphones, providing incremental and compartmentalized access can help establish good habits and prevent problematic dependency. Parents sometimes hand down their old iPhones as a first phone for a child in elementary school. I encourage parents to get their kids flip phones first, and wait until they have developed good overall habits before giving them a smartphone.Just as kids learn to ride bikes with training wheels or get junior licenses when they learn to drive, kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to manage their first smartphones all by themselves. Fortunately, there are ways to manage use and help kids develop better tendencies, and much of it requires a delicate balance of parental modeling and involvement.For parents of teens who have smartphones, making the effort to understand how, where and why kids are spending time on their phone is critical.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Second Act: Big-Time Producer", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "From Oscar-winning actress to Emmy-winning producer: After taking charge of her career, she makes deals with HBO and Apple.Supported byA few months ago, Reese Witherspoon realized everything had changed.Not long after that night, she found herself in demand.\u201cIt opened a lot of doors for me,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview this past week. \u201cPeople wanted to be in business with me as a producer in the TV space. My mission was to create television for other women, for other female storytellers that are actresses, other directors and other writers. I think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds.\u201dSince then, Ms. Witherspoon has transformed herself from an actress increasingly frustrated with the roles she was being offered into a producer with a slate of projects that puts her in the company of series creators like Dick Wolf, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.Apple\u2019s top TV executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, said in a statement that Ms. Witherspoon had \u201can extraordinary knack for being a step ahead of the zeitgeist.\u201dThe rise of Hello Sunshine \u2014 with projects centered on strong, complicated women \u2014 syncs up perfectly with the #timesup movement, which counts Ms. Witherspoon as a major player, and gives evidence that the risk-averse Hollywood establishment may have learned something from the blockbuster success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d last year.\u201cPeople are desperate for this kind of storytelling about the female heroes that have always been in the shadows and now are coming into the light,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Ms. Witherspoon, 41, does not have the track record of super producers like Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy, who have created hit shows for more than a decade, but she has already put a lot of distance between herself and the pack of actors who run production boutiques as a hobby.Ms. Rhimes, the hitmaker behind \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d who recently signed an deal with Netflix, called Ms. Witherspoon a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d producer.\u201cReese has been very smart about what she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cShe has leveraged her power in a very smart way to get big projects done. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201dCasey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO, said he was impressed by her willingness to get into the minutiae.\u201cReese is a movie star, she has a movie star\u2019s presence, she\u2019s a great actress \u2014 that all goes without saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat surprises people is I can call Reese on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 and have those conversations, saying, \u2018How do we get this deal closed?\u2019 \u2014 and she\u2019ll go off and get it closed.\u201dOne of her recent producing coups was to add Meryl Streep to the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d cast. Along with her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star (and fellow executive producer) Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon lobbied Ms. Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, to come aboard. She said yes in an email to Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman on the day \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was nominated for six Golden Globes. (The show went on to win four.)\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I got that email,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said. \u201cI called Nicole, and I just started to cry.\u201dThat catharsis was a long time in coming, said Ms. Witherspoon, who had seen a number of her projects wilt. She grew weary of hearing that the industry had reached its quota of female-driven movies for the year. At the same time, she was starring in mostly forgettable movies \u2014 \u201cHow Do You Know\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Knot\u201d \u2014 and her box-office stock was dropping.She took control of her career by making a deeper commitment to producing. An avid reader who often posts photos of her favorites on Instagram, she started optioning book after book, partly motivated by a conversation she had with her husband, Jim Toth, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.\u201cI talked to my husband around that time, when the movies weren\u2019t working for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Are these movies you want to be making?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting for the scripts to come in.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who sits around and waits for the phone to ring. You read more books than anybody I know, so why don\u2019t you start making them into your own material?\u2019\u201cAnd I thought about my mom, who said, \u2018If you want something done, do it yourself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Witherspoon continued. \u201cYou can sit there and complain about it, or you can do something about it. Instead of having people make calls for me, I called every studio head myself: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Reese!\u2019 I\u2019ve known everybody for 27 years. They knew me when I was 14 years old, all of them. I\u2019ve made movies at pretty much every studio. It\u2019s still the same 200 people who are working in our business.\u201dMs. Witherspoon\u2019s previous production company, Pacific Standard, had hits with the 2014 movies \u201cWild\u201d (based on the memoir by Cheryl Strayed and starring Ms. Witherspoon) and \u201cGone Girl.\u201d It came to an end in 2016 when Ms. Witherspoon split from her longtime producing partner, Bruna Papandrea.Ms. Witherspoon sought outside investment when she was ready to start Hello Sunshine, striking a deal with Otter Media, a company owned by the Chernin Group and AT&T, which bought a 30 percent stake in her new production house.In addition to the three Apple projects and \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Hello Sunshine has two potential series in the running at ABC and NBC. Several film projects are also in the works. Among them, Fox 2000 has picked up \u201cSomething in the Water,\u201d based on a thriller by Catherine Steadman about newlyweds whose Bora Bora honeymoon goes awry, and Sony\u2019s TriStar Pictures has given the green light to \u201cA White Lie,\u201d based on a 2016 novel \u201cThe Gilded Years,\u201d by Karin Tanabe, about the first black woman to attend Vassar College, in the 1890s.Hello Sunshine, which recently named Sarah Harden, formerly of Otter Media, as its chief executive, also has plans to create short bursts of digital-friendly content. At the moment, though, Ms. Witherspoon is making her name in the producer ranks because of her work in the hypercompetitive streaming market.Her planned Apple series with Ms. Aniston \u2014 the \u201cFriends\u201d star\u2019s return to a lead role in a television series \u2014 was inspired by \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d a book by the CNN media reporter Brian Stelter on the so-called morning TV wars. For that one, Apple has pledged to make two 10-episode seasons, without so much as a script written. Two people familiar with the project said Apple would pay $12 million to $15 million an episode. (By comparison, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the costliest shows ever made, has a budget of $15 million an episode for its final season.)Unlike the stereotypical Hollywood producer or celebrity, Ms. Witherspoon is a deep reader \u2014 which has impressed the women who are working with her on Hello Sunshine\u2019s other Apple projects.Colleen McGuinness, a former \u201c30 Rock\u201d writer who is the show runner for the planned series based on a short-story collection by Curtis Sittenfeld, was surprised that Ms. Witherspoon had read the book before their first meeting. When Ms. McGuinness mentioned this, she said, she \u201cgot a look\u201d from Ms. Witherspoon.\u201cWe laughed about it, and I said, \u2018Yeah, most people don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Ms. McGuinness said.During a meeting about the project starring Ms. Spencer, the writer-producer Nichelle Tramble pointed out a book in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s office \u2014 \u201cThe Alice Network,\u201d a novel by Kate Quinn set in the 1940s. That led to a discussion of the lack of female leads in historical dramas.\u201cThat she was such an intense, true and avid reader was very exciting and a little bit shocking,\u201d Ms. Tramble said.Ms. Witherspoon marvels at how the business is changing. A few years ago, she said, prospects were dim for actresses over age 40. She hopes she can help change that in her new role.\u201cYou get older and the phone does stop ringing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, because the people who are writing the stories aren\u2019t 40-year-old women. You write what you know. Well, there were no 40-year-old female screenwriters, and now women of color are writing screenplays and getting them made at big studios.\u201cI\u2019m as incredulous as everybody else,\u201d she continued. \u201cI never thought this would happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Backlash Grows as Investors Press Apple to Act on Children\u2019s Use", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA creator of the iPhone called the device \u201caddictive.\u201dA Twitter founder said the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201dAn early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network\u2019s impact on children\u2019s brains.Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children\u2019s use of iPhones and iPads.Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction.But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives.Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California\u2019s public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business.\u201cWe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,\u201d the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image.Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children\u2019s preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports.\u201cOver the past 10 years, there\u2019s been a bottom-up backlash,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d \u201cYou see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down.\u201d\u201cThese things can be incredibly addictive,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.\u201dA growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune.\u201cThe short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,\u201d he said. \u201cNo civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.\u201dBy going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company\u2019s stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users\u2019 time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products.\u201cApple\u2019s business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,\u201d Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company.For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, \u201cit turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act.\u201dIn a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices \u201clead the industry\u201d and that \u201cwe think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them.\u201d\u201cWe take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\u201dBut some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive.Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about \u201chow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, \u201cin the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.\u201dMr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, \u201cwe had no idea this was going to happen.\u201d But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones.\u201cNow it needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years in the making.\u201dEven Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company\u2019s influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days.Advertisement"}

Average hourly earnings rose just 2.5 percent last year, below the Fed\u2019s target and in line with recent years.But there has been some optimism that wage growth might pick up this year because: 1) The unemployment rate should continue to fall; 2) Companies are doling out one-time bonuses and pay raises in response to the new tax law; 3) Several cities and states raised the minimum wage on Jan. 1.The economists at BofA Merrill Lynch took a closer look these dynamics, and here\u2019s their take away:\u201cWage increases by companies and higher state and local minimum wages should provide a slight bump to wage growth in the next few months...Once the initial boost to wage growth fades, we think the trajectory for wage growth should be a function of the degree of tightening in the labor market. The descent in the unemployment rate should be able to boost wages to a high-2% pace by year-end and to 3% by the middle of 2019. The trajectory is still gradual, but clearly higher.\u201dSo far, the markets don\u2019t seem bothered.

Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201dSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.The market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk tech.People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.The problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.Then, nothing.A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.It\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.That\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.There\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.It\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.Advertisement"}

This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new.Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up?\u201cThis new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,\u201d Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging.Mr. Hall said he had received \u201cno word whatsoever\u201d from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, \u201cAll the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls.\u201d (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.)Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk.Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus.The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon\u2019s public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos\u2019 growing wealth and power.For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process \u2014 which will continue for months \u2014 is \u201creality show\u201d theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said.Amazon, he said, \u201cwants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids.\u201d\u201cFrom a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,\u201d Mr. Rolnick added. \u201cFrom a national perspective, it makes no sense.\u201dSome elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done.\u201cIt was like \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u201d the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa\u2019s mayor, G.

Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don\u2019t even know what company is interested.\u201dNot all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that.One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point.However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something.\u201cSecond headquarters are the thing of the future \u2014 the companies are getting too big for a single market,\u201d said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation.\u201cIf Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba\u201d \u2014 the Chinese internet retailer \u2014 \u201cis willing,\u201d said Mr. Phillips.

{"Headline": "Bonuses Aside, Tax Law\u2019s Trickle-Down Impact Not Yet Clear", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There are good ways to start measuring how much the Trump tax cuts might be helping American workers. Tracking the bonus announcements flowing from corporations is not one of them.Those announcements, which include $2,500 in stock grants for Apple employees, up to $1,000 for certain workers at Walmart and $1,000 bonuses for Bank of America employees, are both real money and smart marketing. President Trump and top Republican lawmakers have praised many of the companies that are disclosing tax-cut-fueled bonuses and wage hikes.For the most part, though, they are not indicative of the windfalls that companies are reaping from the $1.5 trillion tax law \u2014 and how much of that money that might trickle through to workers in the years to come.Companies are acknowledging this in their fourth-quarter earnings reports and other financial disclosures, which earmark just a sliver of their future tax savings for direct and indirect investments in workers.Bank of America\u2019s bonuses will cost the bank $145 million in 2018, or about 5 percent of the nearly $2.7 billion in savings it is expected to reap in 2018 from a lower, 21 percent corporate tax rate. Apple\u2019s bonuses will cost $300 million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law, which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than half the rate it would have paid under the old system.And two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a cost of $300 million, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt. The cost of the buyback: $4 billion.The gap between what companies are saving and how they are, so far, rewarding workers, doesn\u2019t mean that the new law won\u2019t eventually lead to substantial wage increases. Economists across the political spectrum agree it\u2019s simply too soon to tell whether \u2014 and to what degree \u2014 that will happen.The flurry of high-profile bonus announcements \u201care hard to interpret,\u201d said Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School whose research supports the idea that corporate tax cuts lead to at least modest wage increases. \u201cThey may well be evidence for these gains, but just as well may be an example of savvy public relations. The reality is we\u2019ll have to wait for a few years and good empirical work to really know the answer.\u201dThe bonus announcements are, in some ways, a relatively easy opportunity to generate positive headlines and, perhaps, curry favor with Mr. Trump.\u201cCertainly, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is bonuses, rather than wages. It\u2019s a one-time thing \u2014 you don\u2019t have to do it again. It\u2019s political, obviously. It\u2019s P.R.,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.Liberals, though, have latched on to other details in recent corporate announcements \u2014 the ones that show companies plan to pass most of their initial tax savings to shareholders by raising dividends or buying back stock or debt.An S&P Global report estimates that banks will return 75 percent of their windfall to shareholders. More than four in five Morgan Stanley analysts, across industries, said in a survey that the firms they track will use their tax gains to facilitate buybacks and dividends. Barely one in five said firms would pass even some of the tax gains on to workers.Andrew Bates, deputy communications director for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, said the Walmart buybacks, which dwarf the cost of what it is returning to workers, show \u201cwhy Donald Trump is forced to hide most of the story when he tries selling this plan to the American people. It\u2019s also why they aren\u2019t buying it.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic critic of Wall Street, said last week that tax-cut-linked share buybacks by companies such as Bank of America are \u201cnot a measure of the economic health of the American family.\u201dThe theory is investment in structures, equipment and other initiatives, either by companies or their shareholders, boosts productivity in companies, and with it, wages. It is a bank-shot theory of wage growth, and one that many economists espouse, though often to a much lesser degree than Mr. Hassett, whose research suggested typical workers would see an increase of between $3,000 and $7,000 in take-home pay.\u201cThe theory that tax cuts will increase wages is a theory based on investment, and the effect that increased investment will have on productivity,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt is not a theory based on a pure transfer of excess profits into workers\u2019 profits. That takes longer than two weeks to happen.\u201dAnecdotes of bonus payments, or even minimum wage increases, are the least-useful way to determine if a tax change is lifting workers, said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington. The best way is rigorous academic study, which Mr. Greenberg noted takes years to complete.The middle ground between those two is watching economic indicators \u2014 the rate of investment growth in the economy, or of real wage growth.But even that will prove tricky in the months to come, because the economy was strengthening even before the tax cut. Most economists believe the United States is now at or near so-called full employment, when employers are forced to compete for scarce workers, and employees are empowered to bargain for higher wages, whether their companies just received a tax break or not.Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said it will be difficult to initially tease out the impact of the tax bill from those overall trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to buried in with everything else,\u201d he said.Politicians will make no such distinctions, of course. But workers might be able to guess if wage gains are in their future, at least a little bit, by reading the fine print of corporate announcements. If companies announce new projects, initiatives or capital investments \u2014 anything that might boost worker productivity \u2014 wage increases could follow.Not because companies are dying to share their tax spoils with workers. But because they have to, or those workers will take a job with another company that will.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the dollar amount of stock grants for Apple employees. It is $2,500, not $2,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple\u2019s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple\u2019s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.\u201cThis is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn\u2019t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple\u2019s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.Patricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Extends Hand to Apple and Others by Easing Rules on Foreign Firms", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe changes could lead Apple and other companies based outside this country of 1.2 billion to significantly expand their retail presence here. In addition to the changes in the retail sector, the government also said it would allow up to 49 percent of Air India, the troubled national air carrier that is now up for sale, to be bought by foreign airlines.Apple and other multinational retailers had lobbied the government for several years to ease a requirement that foreign-owned, single-brand retailers obtain 30 percent of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country.The new rules could break the stalemate. They allow single-brand retailers that are entirely foreign-owned to temporarily meet the 30 percent requirement by buying goods made in India and then selling them overseas. If, for instance, Apple sold $100 million of its products in India, it could meet the target by buying $30 million of India-made leather cases and selling them outside the country. After five years, the existing local-sourcing requirement for sales in India would apply.In addition, foreign-owned single-line retailers would no longer have to seek government approval before opening.\u201cThese rules are a very dramatic relief,\u201d said Sudhir Kapadia, a partner at EY India, an affiliate of the accounting and consulting firm formerly known as Ernst & Young.Apple declined to comment on the change. The company has scouted out potential locations for its first stores in India, and its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, reiterated to investors in November that opening stores in the country was an important piece of its strategy here, where inexpensive Android handsets now dominate.Single-brand shoe or clothing companies like Uniqlo could also find India a more appealing place to operate stores, perhaps buying some products here to sell overseas and others to sell locally, said Ankur Bisen, senior vice president of retail at Technopak, a consulting firm based in New Delhi.Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has spent five and half years trying to open in India. Part of the challenge has been finding the right Indian suppliers of furniture and other household items to meet the 30-percent requirement for local goods. The new rules give the company more flexibility toward meeting the goal.Foreign brands like Kenneth Cole, Marks & Spencer and Tesco that already operate in India through joint ventures with local companies may now find wholly owned units to be a better option, Mr. Bisen said.Opening the Indian economy up to foreign companies remains a politically delicate proposition, particularly since employment is a major issue among voters.The Confederation of All India Traders said that relaxing the restrictions on single-brand retailers would make it too easy for multinationals to enter India.\u201cWhat will happen to my people who will be losing their jobs?\u201d said Bal Krishna Bhartia, national president of the group, which represents 70 million traders. \u201cThese corporates will not hire them.\u201dVindu Goel reported from Mumbai and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201dAnother idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).\u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.\u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s working on something grand.Advertisement"}

What they need to do to grow, and increase their wealth, often requires people to stand in for them. It\u2019s not easy when customers expect to see the person whose name is on the door.\u201cIt\u2019s always very tempting to name a company after yourself,\u201d said Tim Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cIt is simple. It is honest. And for a lot of entrepreneurs, when they\u2019re starting a new business, it\u2019s the place to start.\u201dAnd it has worked. Think of Bloomberg, which serves as the name of not only the company founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, but also a philanthropic foundation and a highly profitable terminal that sits on thousands of trading desks around the world.Or consider Donald J. Trump, who before he became president was the head of one of the country\u2019s best-known namesake brands. Nothing he owned, managed or marketed lacked the Trump name, from high-rises and golf courses to wine and water.Many other namesake companies have become so enmeshed in the business landscape that consumers forget they were once associated with a person: Procter & Gamble (a candle maker and a soap maker), Bose (an engineer), Duncan Hines (a restaurant critic), Doc Martens (a doctor who wanted comfortable shoes) and even institutions like the Mayo Clinic (not for mayonnaise but two brothers).He remembered preparing for a trade show and needing a name, so he chose all three of his. He added the product\u2019s ingredients and intended purpose on the label.\u201cAt the beginning, there were no disadvantages or advantages because no one cared,\u201d Mr. Roth said.Occasionally, buyers wanted to meet him. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019d want me there because I was the face of the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t always work. They\u2019d say, \u2018Can Peter come?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018No, he can\u2019t come to Ohio for a $1,000 order because the airfare and hotel cost more.\u2019\u201dEarly on, Mr. Roth learned the extent and limits of having the company named for him. \u201cI can call the head of a company, and they actually take the call,\u201d he said. What he could not do, though, was call the same company\u2019s accounts payable department: \u201cYou can\u2019t call a customer to ask for money. You look like a loser.\u201dFor some entrepreneurs, their name is the only logical choice for a company.\u201cIf you took myself out of it, there isn\u2019t much to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a service business in a lot of ways.\u201dWith a namesake business, problems arise with success and failure. If the company is successful, selling it with your name on it can be difficult \u2014 and changing the name can create problems with how consumers identify with the brand.\u201cAll the great things you\u2019ve done to build your brand reside with you,\u201d said Kevin Lane Keller, the E. B. Osborn professor of marketing at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business. \u201cIn technology, the chief executives and the founders are real important to the brands, the way Steve Jobs was to Apple. But they chose names that allow them to do many different things.\u201dThere\u2019s also the more mundane problem of what happens after an eponymous owner departs. Anyone looking for a job this new year might think of Russell Reynolds or Spencer Stuart, two gigantic recruiting firms named for people who are no longer there. Mr. Stuart died in 2011, and Mr. Reynolds is running a smaller firm after he left the company that bears his name in 1993.\u201cYou can\u2019t sell the firm, otherwise,\u201d said Mr. Keller, who takes no credit for the marketing move. \u201cHe came up with it on his own. I applauded the move, and it made a lot of sense.\u201dA name can also saddle others who share it with an association they might not want.\u201cIf you look at a brand like Steinway, that was originally a family name,\u201d Mr. Calkins said. \u201cToday, if your name is Joe Steinway, people will think you know a lot about classical music and have this association with you that isn\u2019t true.\u201dWhat a name can give a company is a story, which David Aaker, vice chairman of Prophet, a branding firm, said companies needed to get their brand noticed.\u201cFacts don\u2019t work,\u201d said Mr. Aaker, who is also an emeritus professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPeople counterargue. They\u2019re skeptical. But if you tell them a story, that all goes away.\u201dMr. Kappler, the equestrian, used this approach to his advantage. He started riding when he was 9 years old and won Olympic gold at 37.\u201cIt\u2019s helped because people who know me identify me as very methodical with my approach,\u201d he said. \u201cI take my time with the horses and riders. I develop them with confidence, so they\u2019re very prepared to any competition they go into. We\u2019re always thinking long term.\u201dOn the negative side, entrepreneurs can hurt their brand with personal mistakes. Several professors pointed to the example of Martha Stewart, who built a lifestyle brand around her aesthetic and perfect-lifestyle choices before going to prison in 2004.Ms. Stewart was convicted of lying about selling stock based on inside information \u2014 and not of doing something related to her company \u2014 but it was not a choice any lifestyle guru would want to encourage.\u201cPeople have secret lives, people are fallible, they make mistakes, and sometimes they\u2019re scandalous,\u201d Mr. Aaker said. \u201cOr if you have a founder who is associated with failure rather than success, it\u2019s going to be harder to turn around than a failure connected to a product.\u201dRegardless of the growth that entrepreneurs achieve with the namesake companies, they need to keep doing what got them there in the first place: Work. Mr. Donner plays about a third of the 150 balls, galas and soirees his orchestras are hired for each year. And he said he called every client to get feedback.\u201cIf there is a small downside to the business, it\u2019s that I have to realize I\u2019m constantly the face of this business and I have to make sure that I\u2019m always appropriately dressed and handle myself in a professional manner,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have a good time at a party but not too good of a time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Drops Huawei\u2019s New Smartphone Amid Security Worries", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, Huawei\u2019s push to sell the phone in the United States has suddenly lost a powerful backer \u2014 and the push has attracted some unwanted scrutiny from Washington.The reasons that led to AT&T\u2019s shift were not entirely clear. But last month, a group of lawmakers wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission expressing misgivings about a potential deal between Huawei and an unnamed American telecommunications company to sell its consumer products in the United States. It cited longstanding concerns among some lawmakers about what they said were Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government.The letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, said Congress had \u201clong been concerned about Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei\u2019s role in that espionage in particular.\u201dFletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, declined to comment.The last-minute disruption is the latest in a long line of setbacks for Huawei, which has struggled for years with political opposition to its efforts to tap the hugely valuable United States market. More broadly, it underscores a deepening political rift over issues of technology, user privacy and security \u2014 a rift that adds to a brewing trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Huawei has been counting on the Mate 10 to compete with Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, in a test of the potential appeal of a Chinese brand in the American market. While Huawei has long sold budget phones, some Mate 10 versions cost $900 or more without subsidies from phone carriers.Huawei sells smartphones in the United States, but it does not have smartphone deals with any of the major wireless carriers in the country. Those carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 dominate the market, making it more difficult for Huawei to get a foothold in the country. The AT&T deal was supposed to cement the company\u2019s status as a top maker of the devices, alongside Apple and Samsung Electronics of South Korea.Congressional misgivings about the company\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government have long plagued Huawei. Already, other major telecommunications companies refuse to buy the equipment Huawei makes for telecommunications networks \u2014 its core business \u2014 because of worries in Washington over security.In the letter, the lawmakers said Huawei had ties to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as to the country\u2019s intelligence and security services, and they accused Huawei of disregarding intellectual property. In particular, the letter implies that the deal with AT&T could more firmly establish Huawei phones in the United States, and ultimately open up the possibility of American government officials using them.Analysts said the political opposition to Huawei was not surprising. Leaders in China and the United States view technology made in the other country with suspicion. In policy guidance and speeches, Chinese officials have repeatedly called for technology made by American companies to be replaced by locally produced ones. Beijing has also widely blocked major American internet companies from offering products in the country.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa, What Happened to My Car?", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAmazon\u2019s Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant is the Chatty Cathy of the tech world, a digital darling that consumers can\u2019t get enough of. It can tell chicken jokes, order pizza and turn off the kitchen faucet. So it\u2019s not surprising that Alexa has made the leap from the home to the car.But just as Alexa promises added hands-free convenience for drivers, researchers and engineers warn that it also opens new avenues for hacking, tracking and sonic attacks. Depending on how voice-activated assistants are connected, such hacks could range from annoying pranks like opening a car\u2019s windows in the rain to dangerous attacks like remotely unlocking a house\u2019s doors for a robbery.\u201cAs we make everything smarter and more connected,\u201d said Nadir Izrael, chief technology officer of the internet security firm Armis, \u201cwe end up creating a huge attack surface on devices, like cars, that weren\u2019t intended.\u201dCars are a highly lucrative target, said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer at Argus Cyber Security, which the automotive systems supplier Continental recently acquired. \u201cPeople are inside these vehicles moving at high speeds, and cars cost a significant amount of money. So how many Bitcoins would you pay a ransomware hacker?\u201dBut in those cases, voice commands are limited. They can\u2019t remotely start a car or open its windows. Siri can\u2019t even change the radio station.Alexa, on the other hand, is intended \u2014 via specific, preprogrammed commands \u2014 to interact with thousands of connected devices, performing tasks like turning on lights, opening door locks, disabling home security systems or even ordering a year\u2019s supply of toilet paper. And it\u2019s already connecting living rooms to cars.Automakers ranging from BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Nissan to start-ups like Byton have tapped into Alexa\u2019s appeal. Although voice assistants are increasingly becoming intertwined with new models, including those from Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, most current Alexa car skills are strictly one-way, from the home to the car, and use existing automotive smartphone applications.\u201cAlexa piggybacks on our app,\u201d said Denise Barfuss, a senior manager for connected services at Nissan. \u201cSo if it\u2019s 25 degrees outside, you can just tell Alexa to start the car\u201d from inside your house to warm it up, she said.Simple Alexa commands can flash the lights or honk the horn, Ms. Barfuss said, but remote instructions that alter the state of the car \u2014 such as locking the doors and starting the engine \u2014 also require a spoken PIN code.And even though voice bots like Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant can be taught to recognize different voices \u2014 well enough to cater to each family member\u2019s favored Pandora stations, for example \u2014 they do not offer any sort of biometric security, such as voice print analysis. As a result, Alexa\u2019s voice-recognition capabilities are not discerning enough for security purposes, according to Amazon. (A company spokesman noted, however, that Amazon had special teams dedicated to continually reviewing and updating the security of its software.)Without such measures, anyone who eavesdropped on a spoken PIN command could use it to unlock and get into a vehicle, leaving a victim to ask, \u201cAlexa, what happened to my car?\u201dSecurity experts are also concerned about more sophisticated cyberattacks involving voice assistants.\u201cThere are synthetic voice sound clips,\u201d said Gang Wang, assistant professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering. \u201cIt sounds like random noise to us, but to the machine it sounds like a specific command.\u201d So a seemingly innocuous sound, like an explosion in a YouTube video played on a nearby TV or tablet, could contain secret instructions.Other hacks have included ultrasonic commands that are beyond the range of human hearing but understood by voice bots. And even if they do establish biometric security features, Mr. Wang said, regenerative machine learning could use a recording of a person\u2019s voice to synthesize new commands that could fool them.The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company\u2019s Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase.Such convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford\u2019s supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel.Ford\u2019s setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn\u2019t automatically be able to unlock a home\u2019s front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner\u2019s smartphone (which they\u2019d have to steal, too).Adding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly.\u201cWhat gets added with the car is your specific location,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cYou can track where the car goes and at what times.\u201dIf compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user\u2019s purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon\u2019s servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system\u2019s \u2014 and the car\u2019s \u2014 security vulnerabilities.Ultimately, the car will simply understand when it\u2019s being spoken to.\u201cPeople will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,\u201d said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. \u201cSo security is going to have to continue to evolve with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
