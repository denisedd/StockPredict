{"Headline": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s Telegenic Warrior", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "How Dana Loesch, a onetime Democrat, became a Second Amendment spokeswoman too incendiary for some right-wingers to handle.Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Dana Loesch has a biblical inscription tattooed on her forearm, a reference to a passage in the Book of Ephesians that calls for Christians to wear holy armor to protect themselves from a dark world. It is an apt precept for Ms. Loesch, a 39-year-old conservative radio talk-show host and political commentator who views the world through a lens of fear and violence.It is why she has an arsenal of firearms strategically placed in safes throughout her home. She keeps a handgun near her bed in the event of an intruder, she said, which she can use until she finds a more powerful shotgun or rifle nearby. She sometimes tucks a gun in the small of her back. Other times, she keeps a knife in her purse.\u201cEvil is real,\u201d she said over a plate of barbecued sausage last month in a suburban restaurant.And if there is a question about what God has to do with any of this, she keeps a sign in the window of the house that she and her family recently vacated. \u201cThis home protected by the good lord and a gun,\u201d it read. \u201cIf you came here to steal or do harm you might meet them both.\u201d\u201cWhen she knows she has just upset someone, she will laugh,\u201d said Ben Howe, a close friend and senior contributing editor at RedState.com who worked with her at The Blaze. He added, \u201cShe\u2019ll be ready to jump into the fray, swinging her sword, and see who gets killed later.\u201dAnn Coulter found her voice as a Cassandra for the right in the early 2000s. In the Trump era, Ms. Loesch has found hers as a telegenic warrior for the N.R.A. She shares some characteristics with President Trump, said Megyn Kelly, the NBC talk show host who used to have her on as a guest on Fox News when Ms. Kelly had a show there. \u201cShe is compelling television,\u201d she said.Even Ms. Kelly, a friend, has noticed that Ms. Loesch has embraced a more barbed tone the past year. \u201cOn my show, she was never a bomb thrower,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cWe tried to veer away from that.\u201d But public conversation has grown more cacophonous since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. And unlike Ms. Coulter in her heyday, Ms. Loesch faces an ever-expanding field of conservative pundits willing to do anything to entertain followers on Twitter, in their jostle for the seats at Fox\u2019s table.\u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a whore for the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Loesch said. \u201cI\u2019m a prostitute for the N.R.A. But I believe so strongly in the natural right to bear arms. I feel so passionately about that.\u201dDismissal only firms her resolve. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like I am doing what I want to do,\u201d she said, \u201cand what I feel fulfilled in doing.\u201dFor as long as Ms. Loesch can remember, the world has been a scary place. She was born Dana Eaton in 1978 in Hematite, Mo., a small community about 40 miles south of St. Louis. Her parents divorced when she was in kindergarten and she has not spoken to her father in more than a decade. Her mother worked three jobs after they moved to nearby Festus, Mo., bringing home bags of granola bars after her shift at a local granola factory. Ms. Loesch said she spent school-day afternoons at home alone or with an aunt.\u201cNow, you could say it was like a meth \u2019hood,\u201d Ms. Loesch said of her old neighborhood. \u201cPeople were fighting. It was kind of crazy. It wasn\u2019t the most stable of childhoods.\u201dMs. Loesch mostly found refuge at her grandparents\u2019 home in Annapolis, Mo., a town of about 450 people nestled in the rural Ozarks. Her family voted for Democrats. Her grandfather hunted deer and raccoon. Despite episodes of violence, Ms. Loesch idealized summers in Annapolis in \u201cFlyover Country.\u201d In the book, she recalled her grandfather standing on the porch one night with a shotgun in his hands. Ms. Loesch\u2019s aunt had just arrived; her estranged husband had threatened to kill her.\u201cLooking back,\u201d Ms. Loesch said, \u201cI think I always wanted to know that I was safe.\u201dIn the late 1990s, Ms. Loesch attended Webster University in suburban St. Louis, studying journalism, but dropped out after she got pregnant. In 2000, she married Chris Loesch, the baby\u2019s father: a musician and son of a preacher who now manages her career. They attend weekly services at the Church of Christ. And on Halloween they give a party that harks back to more pleasant childhood memories. \u201cHalloween was big with her mom,\u201d said Leigh Wambsganns, a friend. Last October Ms. Loesch said she dressed as Wonder Woman.As a new parent in St. Louis, she blogged about motherhood and began her long-running radio program, \u201cThe Dana Show.\u201d She became disillusioned with Democratic politics, though, in the wake of President Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. She helped found the St. Louis Tea Party, organizing protests and speaking at rallies. And, in 2010, she joined Andrew Breitbart at his website, one of several new voices railing against establishment politics and media bias.\u201cDana comes across clearly to our members and gun owners,\u201d Mr. Arulanandam said.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that she was really talking to me,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cShe was using me to rile up the base.\u201d Last week Ms. Loesch said she had no interest in speaking with Mr. Mckesson.Ms. Loesch said she has received death threats for the past two years; they often follow her appearances on television. In December 2016, she said, \u201cmy son went and got the mail and we had all these Christmas cards. He opened them up. And there were pictures, with their heads blown off.\u201d Not long after, someone posted her phone number and a photograph of her house on Twitter. She starting getting calls, including a man on the line, breathing heavily.\u201cHe said he would drag me out and beat me in the yard,\u201d said Ms. Loesch, who moved last month to a new home in suburban Dallas. \u201cI reached out to our local police.\u201d She alerted the N.R.A. \u201cIt worried them too,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not responsible for crazy people. They want to make sure I am safe and that I am O.K. Because I have kids.\u201dDid the experience remind her of her childhood?\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this time, I\u2019m my grandpa.\u201dThe range was at the back of a gun shop, soundproof rooms with stalls facing paper targets clipped to a metal bar. A cartoon of a couple brandishing pistols and dressed in black tie had been taped to the door, advertising two-for-one shooting and happy hour drinks at a local taco shop. But tonight was ladies\u2019 night, and a woman dressed in black high heels was there, holding a pistol.Mr. Loesch laid out a number of guns the couple had brought from home, including his wife\u2019s Glock 19 (a semiautomatic pistol) and an AR-15 (a semiautomatic rifle). Ms. Loesch had taped a drawing of George Washington to the magazine of her AR-15 with the words, \u201cWe The People.\u201d The body of the gun said \u201cLet It Rain!\u201d She had invited an instructor to join her, and he took her through a number of drills using her pistol. After a few adjustments, she hit the bull\u2019s-eye.She urged this reporter to try her AR-15: \u201cIsn\u2019t it easy?\u201dIt was. Like an arcade video game.Ms. Loesch offered thanks for the sojourn. \u201cIt means a lot to me,\u201d she said.In a car ride afterward, she wished that there was also time on this trip to visit a church together.\u201cWe are all sinners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all people who have messed up. I fall short every single day.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the name of a gun.

{"Headline": "In Winter, Take the Bitter With the Sweet", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenWe think of summer as prime time for produce, but winter has bright seasonal salads, too. A cold-weather salad bowl may hold a lively mixture of sturdy-leafed, multicolored greens in the chicory family, instead of lettuce, along with a riot of citrus fruits.It is bit odd to term them \u201cgreens,\u201d since many chicories\u2019 leaves are a deep red, ranging from burgundy to crimson. This is especially true of the slightly-but-pleasantly-bitter Italian varieties of red chicory known as radicchio.The round-headed red radicchio di Chioggia, which looks something like a small red cabbage decorated with distinct white veins, is the most common found in supermarkets in the U.S. Some like to chop it or even shred it like slaw, but I usually prefer to tear the leaves in to fairly large pieces for a salad.Other radicchio varieties, like the ruddy, elongated Treviso, which I cut into 1-inch wide ribbons, and the scarlet curly-fingered Tardivo (I lop off the fingers and leave them whole) are likely to be available at farmers\u2019 markets in the coming months. Some produce markets receive weekly deliveries of these characteristically Italian salad greens.But for a spectacular pairing of flavors, I suggest a sweet connection between radicchio and citrus.Citrus is at its peak now, so destiny prevails. My favorite combination for this salad is blood oranges, navel oranges, ruby grapefruit and kumquats, but you can pick and choose. A small serrated paring knife will help to remove the peel and pith of the fruits easily. Then simply slice them and arrange them among the red leaves in all their colorful glory.All that remains is to whisk up a little dressing with some chopped shallot and grapefruit juice. Use olive oil or walnut oil, and add some toasted walnuts. The sweet-sour-bitter-nutty combination is extremely seductive.Chicories come in other shapes and colors. Green escarole is a member of the family (as is fris\u00e9e, curly endive).The Belgian endive is a pale ivory, and its leaves are tightly packed into pointed, torpedolike heads. Endives (there are also red-hued and frilly fringed yellow versions) are great for salads. Some find them a bit less bitter than radicchio. I don\u2019t find raw endive bitter at all; the leaves to me are crisp, juicy and refreshing.Cooking turns eating them into an altogether different experience, with a complex flavor that reminds me of artichokes. In Belgium and France, roasted or gratin\u00e9ed endive is a common side dish.Choose medium to small endives, split them lengthwise top to bottom, and they are ready to cook. First they are browned in butter, then slathered with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and broiled until nearly, but not quite, burnt.This is a simple riff on an old French \u201ccomfort food\u201d recipe for endive \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me, a homey gratin with cream and bits of ham. Without the ham baked in, it makes an excellent first course, perhaps draped with a bit of prosciutto; or it may reside happily alongside a piece of roasted chicken or fish. The taste of broiled endive is revelatory if you\u2019ve never tried it: The endive becomes both creamy and caramelized, and the combined layers of flavor are exquisite.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Court Closes Foundation of Aleksei Navalny, a Kremlin Critic", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Moscow court on Monday ordered the closing of a foundation supporting the activities of Aleksei A. Navalny, the country\u2019s leading opposition politician, moving quickly in a case filed only this month by the Justice Ministry.The court order came before a series of rallies in more than 90 Russian cities and towns, scheduled for Sunday and organized by Mr. Navalny and his supporters.The foundation, the Fifth Season of the Year, has been used by Mr. Navalny to collect donations that finance campaign materials, salaries and offices in 84 regions across Russia, among other weapons in his drive against corruption and the workings of the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin. More than 145,000 Russians have donated $4.9 million to the foundation over the past 13 months, Mr. Navalny says.In response, Mr. Navalny announced that he would turn his candidacy into a campaign for a boycott of the presidential election, and he called on his followers to take part in street protests. That, he added, was what led to the court case against his foundation.\u201cPutin was so scared by our announcement that we transform our campaign for presidency into a campaign for a boycott that he quickly created a special group to check our foundation,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in a video released last week.Mr. Navalny and others have noted that even though Mr. Putin\u2019s re-election is a foregone conclusion, the Kremlin would still like to see a high turnout, as that would cement his legacy as one of Russia\u2019s greatest leaders. In that context, a boycott becomes a very delicate issue for Mr. Putin, Mr. Navalny said.\u201cWe wanted to take part in the election, but they did not let us, so we will campaign against this election,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in the video. \u201cYou cannot consider Putin\u2019s reappointment an election.\u201dThe Justice Ministry said in court that the foundation had listed a wrong official address, that it was illegally spending money on Mr. Navalny\u2019s presidential campaign, and that it had violated a law regulating the use of personal data. The judge, Irina Afanasieva, reached her decision in less than three hours.\u201cWe have 30 days to appeal it,\u201d Leonid Volkov, Mr. Navalny\u2019s campaign manager, wrote on Facebook after the court\u2019s announcement. \u201cUntil then, we continue our work.\u201dMr. Navalny built his career on exposing graft in the higher echelons of the Russian government.

{"Headline": "Learning to Love Nehru", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 I grew up with an aversion to India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.He was the towering figure of the postcolonial world. Harrow- and Cambridge-educated, he was one of the architects of the Non-Aligned Movement, which sought a third way through the odious binaries of the Cold War. In India, he dominated the political landscape and is credited with laying the foundation for our country\u2019s democracy.By then, India was changing. The economic reforms of the 1990s had empowered a new class of Indian, less colonized, more culturally intact. We entered an age when authenticity was prized above all else, and Nehru, by his own admission, was not authentic, not culturally whole. He was a hybrid, forged on the line between India and Britain, East and West. The reputation of Mahatma Gandhi, though he was no less a hybrid, survived the change. Nehru\u2019s did not.Every year, around Nehru\u2019s birthday on Nov. 14, a battle rages in which the bedraggled remains of India\u2019s left try to defend the first prime minister, even as an increasingly louder chorus of voices on the right portray him as having been soft on Muslims and having betrayed the interests of the Hindu majority.Which brings me to an embarrassing confession: Nehru is one of those people I thought I knew without ever feeling the need to read. He was among the great literary statesmen, and his output was prodigious: letters, speeches, famous books like \u201cThe Discovery of India\u201d and \u201cGlimpses of World History.\u201d And there is his autobiography, \u201cToward Freedom,\u201d in which he truly comes alive.I have at last been reading Nehru, now at this hour when his stock is at an all-time low. And I have yet another embarrassing confession to make: He\u2019s wonderful. It is not just a question of the peerless prose \u2014 the American journalist John Gunther was quite right to say that \u201chardly a dozen men alive write English as well as Nehru.\u201d Nor is it simply that he is a man of astonishing reading, intellect and sensitivity. What makes Nehru so compelling is his acute self-knowledge. There is practically nothing you can say against him that he is not prepared to say himself.Consider him on the subject of his own deracination. In \u201cToward Freedom,\u201d he writes: \u201cI have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere. Perhaps my thoughts and approach to life are more akin to what is called Western than Eastern, but India clings to me, as she does to all her children, in innumerable ways.\u201d He continues: \u201cI am a stranger and alien in the West. I cannot be of it. But in my own country also, sometimes I have an exile\u2019s feeling.\u201dNehru, unlike Mr. Modi \u2014 who is decidedly not a reader and who has an almost childish regard for the Indian past \u2014 can look hard at himself and his country. \u201cA country under foreign domination seeks escape from the present in dreams of a vanished age, and finds consolation in visions of past greatness,\u201d he writes in \u201cThe Discovery of India.\u201dNehru is never more prescient, seeming truly to speak across the decades, than when he addresses the nationalism that will one day endanger his vision of India. \u201cNationalism,\u201d he writes in \u201cToward Freedom,\u201d \u201cis essentially an anti-feeling, and it feeds and fattens on hatred against other national groups, and especially against the foreign rulers of a subject country.\u201dI was stunned, reading these lines at a moment when Mr. Modi\u2019s Hindu Renaissance has proved to be precisely the \u201canti-feeling\u201d Nehru described: a culture war against two enemies, Westernized Indians and the country\u2019s approximately 170 million Muslims.If Mr. Modi stands for authenticity, Nehru forces us to question the premium we place on it. He forces us to ask ourselves if purity is even desirable, and whether India\u2019s true genius does not lie in its ability to throw up dazzling hybrids, like Nehru, who seem, in intellect and sophistication, vision and worldliness, to be every bit Mr. Modi\u2019s superior.Mr. Modi has certainly ushered in an age when the \u201cIndian soul\u201d \u2014 like the German and Russian soul before it \u2014 is finding utterance. But what is it saying? Last month, in Rajasthan, a state whose government is run by the B.J.P., we were given yet another sampling of what Mr. Modi\u2019s brand of authenticity looks like: a Hindu man axed to death a Muslim man, then set the body alight, while asking his nephew to film the murder.Time may have trifled with Nehru. But time will also reveal him to be the giant that he was.Advertisement"}

(There is, however, evidence of similar clam-and-tomato-juice drinks that predate it.

SurveyMonkey interviewed roughly 19,000 black men and 31,000 black women.It is also wrong to compare exit polls to SurveyMonkey\u2019s results. The company surveyed adults who both are, and are not, registered to vote. By contrast, exit polls necessarily survey people who have just voted.The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iranian Hackers: Sophisticated, Frustrated and a Rising Global Threat", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Between breaking into the email accounts of United States government officials, political dissidents and international human rights organizations, Iranian hackers liked to joke about their slow internet service, poor pay and lack of skilled colleagues.In conversations obtained by security researchers, the hackers groused like any other start-up employees, often frustrated by their lack of progress and inability to carry out more grandiose schemes.But the work being discussed had global ramifications, and painted a picture of how Iranian hackers have matured over the last decade from defacing websites with crude photos and slogans. Now, they appear to be an organized work force, starting systematic cyberespionage campaigns aimed at promoting Iran\u2019s interests around the world and on curbing dissent within the Islamic Republic.\u201cThrough their carelessness, we were able to get a real picture of who these individuals are and what their goals are,\u201d said Mr. Anderson, who has been researching Iranian hackers for more than five years.The hackers appeared to be testing malicious software on themselves or accidentally clicked on malware they were developing. Either way, they exposed activity on their own computers, inadvertently giving researchers a glimpse into their lives through chat logs, emails and the targeting of their victims.One six-month chat log between two Iranian hackers gave particular insight into how they ran their day-to-day operation. By tracing where and how web domains were registered, as well as other data found online, Mr. Anderson concluded that the aliases \u201cmb_1986\u201d and \u201cArYaIeIrAN\u201d represented two Iranian men whose real names were Mojtaba Borhani and Behrouz Keshvari.Neither replied to a request for comment sent to email addresses referred to in their chat logs.Over time, the two become more sophisticated, developing malware as they moved between Iranian hacking groups. Recently, the men have been tied to a group known as \u201cCharming Kitten\u201d by security companies. The group is believed to be responsible for a range of attacks, including targeting aviation companies in the United States.The chat logs showed two men frustrated with the pace of their work.\u201cWe need someone for Mac in Tehran,\u201d Mr. Keshvari wrote on June 15, 2014, bringing up a topic the two men had discussed nearly a month earlier. The best hackers, he complained, were making \u201cgood money\u201d elsewhere, and were not tempted by the idea of moving to Tehran to work in a cramped office for roughly $780 a month. There should be some other benefit, Mr. Keshvari joked, at one point suggesting they offer to send prospective hires on vacation to Turkey and Thailand.Mr. Keshvari appeared focused on bringing in prospective new hires, but he was often stymied by Mr. Borhani. On May 30, 2014, he complained that Mr. Borhani had scared off prospective new hires.\u201cListen, if during the interview you ask them about working with SCADA, I will kill you,\u201d Mr. Keshvari wrote, referring to the operating system used to control industrial facilities, such as power plants or oil and gas refineries.Mr. Keshvari responded that he \u201cdoes not do the interview in this way.\u201d And after several profanities were exchanged, the two agreed to meet with a new recruit.\u201cWe need them \u2026 send them here,\u201d Mr. Borhani wrote. He repeatedly pressed for programmers with expertise in Mac operating systems.Their focus on hiring people with an expertise in Apple products, specifically the Mac operating system, was unsurprising, Mr. Anderson said, given that many of Iran\u2019s dissidents and human rights workers had transitioned to Apple products in the hopes that they would prove more secure than Microsoft\u2019s Windows software.\u201cImagine them like start-ups who are contracted to the government,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThey are chasing demographics that the government has an interest in targeting.\u201dThe two men often discussed names and shared phone numbers of people they were working with, and one individual appeared to warrant deference. A figure named only as \u201cHajji,\u201d a title widely used in the Muslim world to denote someone who carries out the hajj, a sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, appeared to frequently visit the men and make final decisions on whom they could hire to help with various projects.\u201cIt seems likely that Hajji is an Iranian government handler,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Iran\u2019s government, he added, is careful to not directly tie itself to hackers involved in offensive operations. Iran\u2019s government also probably operates a separate cyberwarfare department, though the people it employs there appear more skilled and better at covering their tracks, he said.In the year since President Trump took office, Iran has focused its efforts on infiltrating the computers of anyone associated with the president, Mr. Anderson said.\u201cThey are clearly trying to gain any insight they can as to what this administration is going to do vis-\u00e0-vis Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very persistent, but we don\u2019t know their level of success.\u201dThere are few who know Iranian hackers persistence better than Thamar E. Gindin, an Iran specialist from Shalem College of Liberal Arts in Israel.In May 2015, Ms. Gindin was the \u201cpatient zero\u201d in an attack by Iranian hackers, who infiltrated her computer through a malicious email and used it to try to gain access to other academics studying Iran, according to a report published by the Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky.With the help of ClearSky, the hackers were booted from her system. But in the two years since, they have tried almost monthly to get back in through a number of ploys playing to her personal interests \u2014 including posing as reporters from the BBC who hoped to interview her, and sharing a file on \u201cunique chocolates\u201d after she wrote a post on Facebook promoting her cousin\u2019s chocolate business.Among the groups targeting her are Charming Kitten, the group Mr. Borhani and Mr. Keshvari had been linked to.\u201cI feel like we are playing a game. I have to admit, I kind of like them,\u201d Ms. Gindin said. \u201cThey are persistent and stubborn, but they aren\u2019t very smart all the time. It\u2019s really like a game.\u201cAdvertisement"}

So far so good. Democrats, however, were 84-10 against the candidate and independents were also opposed, 73-19. A plurality of Republicans, 48 percent, said they would consider the candidate, and 34 percent said they would not. Crucially, among Republican men, 56 percent said they would consider voting for the candidate and 29 percent said they would not.Trump displays unalloyed masculine strength. His supporters do not care if he is predatory, insulting, or offensive as long as he is never in doubt, especially if he is kicking the limp Washington establishment around. Trump\u2019s instinct-driven behavior confirms that he is the archetypal alpha-male, the unfiltered reptilian brain, concerned only with sustenance, survival or sex. If anything enters his world, they know he must either eat it, kill it, or mate with it. That\u2019s why they like him. For about half of America, that is terrifying. For the other half, Trump\u2019s strength is the only thing they can count on to protect them from return of the elite bloodsuckers who would devour them.Castellanos continued, heating up his rhetoric:Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t expect his unrestrained id to ponder the details of briefing papers before he eats the red meat in front of him. As long as Trump displays strength and grabs the media, the establishment and America\u2019s adversaries by the pussy, he\u2019s the T Rex many of his supporters want.If the idea is that Democrats can win over and mobilize people who did not vote for them last cycle by calling Trump a sexist, and Roy Moore a predator \u2014 even if many voters agree and are disturbed by Moore and Trump \u2014 many of them can also sympathize with Trump in a sense. The same people who are bashing Trump have also disparaged them (Trump supporters) as misogynistic, racist, homophobic, ignorant, etc. \u2014 to their minds, unfairly. So they don\u2019t put a lot of stock in those messengers, and indeed, hearing Democrats sling these kinds of labels around will probably just stir up resentment against the left.progressives have done a great job framing racial inequality, feminism and LGBTQ rights as part of the same basic struggle. However, this association works both ways. Accusations of misogyny, for instance, are often heard in the context of a fundamentally anti-white, anti-Christian culture war \u2014 a zero-sum campaign waged against ordinary hard-working Americans by condescending and politically-correct liberal elites.Feminism and anti-feminism are essentially baked into the political parties at this point and it is difficult to believe that there are many people left for the parties to capture on the basis of gender-linked issues including sexual harassment.Huddy warned specifically against Democrats adopting \u201ca singular focus on harassment and gender issues\u201d given the 2016 election outcome:Gender issues were front and center in Clinton\u2019s campaign and that had something of a polarizing effect that likely contributed to weaker support for Clinton among white working class men.More important, according to Huddy,Democrats need to figure out how to combine issues linked to gender/feminism, race, and immigration \u2014 identity politics \u2014 into a more coherent economic framework that reduces the sense that one group wins at another group\u2019s expense.I asked Pepin and Cotter about the significance of their findings for the #MeToo movement. Cotter emailed back:My own work, which has focused on the stalled gender revolution over the past twenty years, would suggest some mix of optimism and pessimism about this. One of the apparent reasons for the stall is the flagging of the women\u2019s movement after the successes of the 1970s and the defeat of the ERA in the 1980s.On the optimistic side for Democrats, Cotter wrote,this moment/movement definitely looks like it is taking hold \u2014 and it\u2019s had real consequences at least at the level of individual harassers and abusers being called out and facing consequences. Many reports suggest a large number of female candidates for office at all levels.On the pessimistic side, Cotter argues,we can already see the beginnings of a backlash against #MeToo. There\u2019s a large reservoir of gender traditionalism and misogyny as shown in the Trending towards Traditionalism paper \u2014 and it persists among youths so may be part of our social fabric for some time.It seems to me that women themselves are divided on these issues, at least some of the most conservative religious women. How else to explain the white women who voted for Roy Moore, despite everything, and who still support Trump?Some of the anti-Hillary women may shift to support Kirsten Gillibrand (if she does run), who may seem a much more acceptable sort of female candidate (more feminine, less threatening, perhaps) and has not, to my knowledge, appeared to insult women who stay home and bake cookies,\u201d Griffith wrote, but \u201csome segment of (white, anyway) women will evidently always stand by the macho male candidate, no matter how vile he may be.Putting those qualifications aside, Griffith argues that \u201cit certainly appears that women\u2019s #MeToo fury is a powerful force with no sign of ebbing,\u201d adding, \u201cbut my God, anything could happen between now and then, couldn\u2019t it!? Still, my money\u2019s on them for this year and, if I had to bet that far in advance, probably for 2020 too.\u201dShe notes thatTurning toward upcoming elections, Kam makes the case thatfor these issues to play a truly transformative role in 2018 and 2020, I think they will need to be more directly tied to institutionalized sexism and associated policy solutions for it rather than tied to singling out specific wrongdoers and removing them from positions of power.For many women, according to Lake, \u201cthere is a continuum from sexual assault to sexual harassment to bad social and dating behavior,\u201d all of which can help motivate female voters.This may be the first time in American history that an entire cohort of young women reports greater political engagement than their male peers. If so, this could presage a new wave of female activism that shifts the course of our politics in the 2018 mid-term elections and beyond.\u201cThat seems well behind the level of media attention the issue has received,\u201d Franklin notes.There are at least two possible developments that could substantially increase the attention paid to the issue of sexual harassment.The first is Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s potential presidential candidacy. Gillibrand has taken the lead on the matter of sexual misconduct, declaring that \u201cenough is enough\u201d in a Dec. 6 Facebook post:We should not have to be explaining the gradations between sexual assault, harassment and unwelcome groping. And what message do we send to our sons and daughters when we accept gradations of crossing the line? None of it is ok and none of it should be tolerated.The second possible development is a Democratic takeover of the House or the Senate (or both) in the 2018 midterms. With majority control of either branch, Democrats would have the power to keep Republicans on the defensive and to set the issue agenda so as to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of gender polarization.This contrast appears in question after question. Sixty-four percent of Democratic women say that they feel more unsafe after the election, compared with 14 percent of Republican women.In other words, what looks like a favorable climate now for Democrats is in fact highly volatile, particularly when the man in the White House likes to set bonfires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More College Students Seem to Be Majoring in Perfectionism", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cMillennials feel pressure to perfect themselves partly out of social media use that leads them to compare themselves to others,\u201d said Thomas Curran, the study\u2019s lead author and a lecturer in the Center for Motivation and Health Behavior Change at the University of Bath in England. He added that this theory hasn\u2019t been tested and would require further research.\u201cMeritocracy places a strong need for young people to strive, perform and achieve,\u201d he said. They have \u201cincreasingly unrealistic educational and professional expectations for themselves.\u201dParents in my practice say they\u2019re noticing how often their kids come away from Facebook and Instagram feeling depressed, ashamed and anxious, and how vulnerable they are to criticism and judgment, even from strangers, on their social media feeds.Perfectionism is a personality trait or characteristic that is innate in many people. It is nurtured in some environments, notably in families where personal accomplishment, academic or otherwise, is rewarded: \u201cWhere self-esteem is earned, not just given out with a trophy for participation,\u201d said Steve Codling, a high school teacher in Seattle who believes in pushing his students as well as his college-age sons to excel and praising them when they do. But for other parents, it\u2019s often difficult to know when perfectionism in their kids is cause for concern: After all, the high standards they set for themselves probably got them into college.The researchers looked at more than 41,000 students\u2019 responses on the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, which not only measures degrees of perfectionism but also distinguishes among its three aspects: self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed. And while self-prescribed perfectionism is associated with greater productivity, conscientiousness and career success, many parents are concerned when they see signs that it is affecting their child\u2019s mood and behavior.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s paralyzing,\u201d Katherine Dieckmann, a filmmaker and professor at Columbia University, said of the perfectionist tendencies she sees in her 20-year-old daughter, a college sophomore. \u201cI understand, because we were both born that way.\u201dAs an artist, Ms. Dieckmann herself has difficulty letting go of a project or task unless it\u2019s perfect. Like her daughter, she worries it to death, \u201cbelieving it can be better, which so often is worse.\u201d She recognizes that her daughter\u2019s habit of procrastination is not from lack of motivation but more from a sense that \u201cif she can\u2019t finish it perfectly, she\u2019d rather not do it.\u201d That characteristic carries over into other areas of her life, Ms. Dieckmann said. \u201cShe\u2019s the same way about her hobbies, like photography.\u201dAnother parent, whose son is a student at an Ivy League college, said: \u201cHe\u2019s not striving to meet our standards, they\u2019re his own.\u201d The father, whom I cannot name because he is my patient, said: \u201cI keep reminding him that perfect is the enemy of good, and he says, \u2018Yeah, but good\u2019s not enough to get into med school.\u2019\u201dHannah Miller, a Columbia graduate student, is candid about her perfectionism. \u201cWhen it\u2019s not out of control, it\u2019s a good thing to have. When it overwhelms me, which is less often than it did when I was an undergraduate, I have to force myself to step back and make an accurate assessment of how important the task is and consider it thoughtfully rather than emotionally \u2014 like, how good does it have to be?\u201dWhen she finds herself procrastinating until a deadline, she repeats a maxim favored by a high school teacher: Do the best that you can in the time that you have.Ms. Miller said that when she\u2019s stressed and anxious she turns to her close friends for comfort and support, and also to her mother, whose perfectionism, like her own, is mostly self-prescribed. Mother and daughter share a kind of presentational perfectionism, especially about public speaking. Ms. Miller said that her mother \u201cgets over it the same way she tells me to: Prepare thoroughly and it will carry you through.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to tell how much social media is affecting your child\u2019s self-image; many feel enormous pressure to be perfect off line, too. And it\u2019s difficult to know what, if anything, parents can do about it, beyond offering empathy, reassurance and emotional support.If they\u2019ve been here before, remind them that perfect wasn\u2019t the goal; good enough was, and it did the trick. (\u201cRemember the way you felt before your SATs, and how well you did?\u201d) Make sure it\u2019s their perfectionism you\u2019re worried about, not yours. And stay in touch without hovering. If they seem really anxious for more than a week, suggest they seek counseling, or contact the school to ask whether the department of student life might sponsor a program about perfectionism.And meanwhile, send care packages. It\u2019s fine if they\u2019re not perfect \u2014 they will still brighten your student\u2019s day.Jane Adams is a social psychologist, writer and coach.Advertisement"}

Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system.

An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf.

Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re using that platform and using our voices to say we can change this ideology, and shatter the sexism that teaches men that women are less.\u201dYet some find fault in the red carpet plan, saying the extent to which women get so dolled up promotes unrealistic, male-gaze standards that are at odds with the Time\u2019s Up core mission of fighting sexism.That comment drew both praise and predictable ripostes from people noting that it was skating dangerously near a \u201cblame-the-victim-for-what-she\u2019s-wearing\u201d mentality, and that women could wear what they want. That said, many women, and men, see the red carpet as a grit-your-teeth-and-bear-it forced march driven by studio expectations and publicity demands, a repetitive dog-and-pony show that can feel endless during awards season. (It also can be lucrative for women getting paid by designers to sport their wares.)Here\u2019s a guide to the Golden Globes nominees that are both streamable and worth your time from Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.And yet. That the quarry is coming armed to the red carpet\u2019s shooting gallery represents a big leap from the not-so-distant days of 2015, when the #AskHerMore campaign was urging awards-season reporters to talk to actresses about more than dresses, diets and jewels.But Time\u2019s Up is the first time that so many women in Hollywood \u2014 more than 300 actresses, agents, producers, writers, showrunners and executives \u2014 have collectively pooled their resources for the singular purpose of fighting pernicious sexism. It extends beyond speechifying to tangible solutions. Notable lawyers like Anita Hill and Tina Tchen, who was Michelle Obama\u2019s chief of staff, are heavily involved. Prominent Hollywood women are leveraging their power to help women with less of it, and to force change. Several talent agencies have already pledged to achieve gender parity in their leadership tiers in the next two years.Can all of this \u2014 any of it \u2014 be relayed by actresses wearing black at the Golden Globes? Maybe. Probably. At least in part. They\u2019ll be playing the game on their own terms, and there\u2019s power in that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Cozy With Silicon Valley, Democrats Grow Wary of Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In November 2016, Dipayan Ghosh was still reeling from Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat as he left what was supposed to be a celebration party at the Javits Convention Center in New York to attend morning meetings for his job at the Washington offices of Facebook.As Mr. Ghosh, a former White House technology adviser to President Barack Obama, made the four-hour drive, troubling questions started nagging him. What if fake news on Facebook and other sites had an impact on voters? How did the campaigns and any outsiders use ads on the site to influence the election?\u201cThe problems were much broader than we imagined, and it was not just about one tool or platform,\u201d said Mr. Ghosh, who with his co-author, Ben Scott, worked on devising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tech policy platform. \u201cIt\u2019s the profit model underlying the whole digital advertising system.\u201dMr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott are the latest members of the political party that more eagerly embraced Silicon Valley to sharply criticize the tech industry. Tech policy officials from the Obama administration and from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, as well as prominent Democrats in Congress, are demanding changes from companies they had long viewed as too important and nimble for regulations.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut has called for the Federal Trade Commission to restart an antitrust investigation into Google. And Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota has introduced a bill that would update antitrust policies to take more direct aim at the tech sector.\u201cDemocrats and progressives still strongly feel that there are shared values with Silicon Valley, but there is also a real concern over the industry\u2019s increasingly concentrated wealth and power,\u201d said Daniel Sepulveda, an ambassador and deputy assistant secretary at the State Department for the Obama administration.Karen Kornbluh, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that before the election, there was a view of \u201cinternet utopianism\u201d in government. Officials looked to the internet to solve problems in education, income inequality and global democracy. They called on tech executives to help with those initiatives and hired from Google and other tech outfits to bring their expertise into the White House.\u201cSo if you were championing the best things about the internet, it was easy to be disappointed that it was hijacked to subvert the very things it could foster,\u201d Ms. Kornbluh said. But she said few people in government were looking with a full view of how social media and other internet services posed national security, economic and other risks.Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott played a leading role in helping to create the tech-friendly policies that helped companies like Facebook and Google flourish during the Obama administration. But as more information trickled out about the role played by technology firms in Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the presidential election, they, like many Democrats, became disillusioned.\u201cWe were always careful to condition our optimism and our advocacy that this technology was potentially a double-edged sword,\u201d said Mr. Scott, who is a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America. \u201cBut I guess we didn\u2019t expect them to hit home quite as hard as it did.\u201dTitled \u201c#DigitalDeceit: Exposing the Internet Technologies of Precision Propaganda,\u201d their report argues that the interests of internet giants in helping advertisers run persuasive campaigns are aligned with those of someone looking to spread misinformation.The authors suggest a few ways to regulate the advertising technology industry, including requiring more transparency for political advertising, restricting data collection or ad targeting on political issues, and strengthening consumer protection and competition policies.Republicans have also expressed concerns about internet giants. Many on President Trump\u2019s campaign suspected that Google rigged search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, questioning the influence of high-profile supporters of hers like Eric Schmidt, who is the former executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. They were outraged by claims that Facebook manipulated its trending topics feature to push down results related to Republicans.But increasingly, the most vocal criticism is coming from Democrats. Tom Wheeler, Mr. Obama\u2019s head of the Federal Communications Commission, recently called for social media firms to make it easier to figure out how certain information goes viral, who is sending those posts and what impact that activity may have.\u201cThe internet was once heralded as the great democratizing tool,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cThat vision was smashed by the algorithms of the social media platforms.\u201dOn Friday, Twitter said it had found more than 50,000 Russian-linked accounts tweeting election-related content in the 10 weeks preceding the vote. Twitter said it would email notifications to 677,775 people in the United States who followed, retweeted or liked tweets from accounts linked to propaganda efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin.But Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott said it would be a mistake to focus solely on the Russians. They argued that the tools used by the Russians could easily be applied to other misinformation campaigns. In the same way digital advertising campaigns spend relatively small sums of money to reach millions of people, any party with an interest in swaying sentiment can gain access to reams of behavioral data on the internet to target specific audiences.Improvements in artificial intelligence for digital advertising could allow for more precise audience targeting and make the problem even worse, they said.Fundamentally, the problem is that \u201cdisinformation campaigns and legitimate advertising campaigns are effectively indistinguishable on leading internet platforms, \u201d Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott wrote.The changes were viewed as a response to the wave of criticism accusing the company of allowing its algorithms to promote misleading news and misinformation. On Friday, Facebook also said it would give priority to news sources that its users ranked as the most credible.Mr. Ghosh said that these changes were significant and might throw off propagators of disinformation in the short term, but that they \u2014 like advertisers \u2014 would adjust. Ultimately, the underlying business model of digital advertising hasn\u2019t changed, and it\u2019s not clear how Facebook will handle content that advertisers pay to promote.\u201cI felt like Facebook was an amazing company, and in many ways I still think it is,\u201d Mr. Ghosh said. \u201cBut something changed in me at the Javits Center.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the center at Harvard that collaborated with New America on a report about the intersection of technology, advertising and disinformation. It was the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, not the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The History of Wine in 442 Podcasts", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourOne of wine\u2019s great treasures is available, free, with the touch of a smartphone or the click of a mouse.Through the podcast\u2019s 442 episodes (and counting), Levi Dalton, the host and a former sommelier in New York, has talked to people of consequence in almost every corner and level of the business.Wine is enjoyable enough if you know no more about what you are drinking than what\u2019s in the glass. But the more context you add, the more fascinating it becomes. \u201cI\u2019ll Drink to That\u201d provides the sort of background that helps to transform the notion of wine from a simple beverage to a complex culture.The podcasts are bare-bones, largely free of sound effects, except for the occasional segments produced by Erin Scala, another former New York sommelier who now owns In Vino Veritas, a wine shop in Keswick, Va. They may include thoughtful essays on issues that wine geeks, at least, debate frequently, like whether to include the grape stems in the fermentation process.Otherwise, the podcasts are mostly recorded in Mr. Dalton\u2019s unprepossessing studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he lives with his wife, Ayako, a private chef, and their young son, Louie.Guests, like Christian Moueix, proprietor of Ch\u00e2teau Trotanoy in Pomerol and Dominus Estate in Napa Valley, among others, may be offered a cup of tea before sitting across a dining table from Mr. Dalton. While he also records podcasts on location while visiting wine regions, the interviews are always conducted face to face.You could make an entire playlist of great Burgundy producers, like Guillaume d\u2019Angerville and Michel Lafarge, the alpha and omega of Volnay; as well as Jeremy Seysses of Domaine Dujac, Jean-Marie Fourrier of Domaine Fourrier, or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mugnier of Domaine Jacques-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mugnier.Over time, Mr. Dalton has noticed patterns among winemakers.\u201cIn the U.S., some guy decides he wants to make wine, and does it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Europe, it\u2019s often a family generational story. Both of these really resonate with me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll Drink to That\u201d is different. It does not pretend to be a wine primer, and it makes few concessions to newcomers who are not already familiar with the intricacies of wine or its places and people.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about, \u2018If you don\u2019t know what ros\u00e9 is, here\u2019s an explanation,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dalton said. \u201cMy strength is talking to people who are already committed to wine, and I want to take them further.\u201d\u201cIt was a little like a surrogate family,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have siblings, so I hung out with career waiters, people with life experience.\u201dHe got the job and, sensing he could increase his income if he sold more wine, he set about teaching himself, reading everything he could and working in the restaurant\u2019s wine cellar. As an added bonus at the Federalist, he was able to taste many classic wines from Bordeaux, the Rh\u00f4ne and Germany. Eventually he became a sommelier.\u201cIt was a different era,\u201d he said. \u201cWine was less expensive. Regular people could have great bottles of wine for special events. Now they can\u2019t.\u201dThat all changed after 9/11. Customers stopped spending money, Mr. Dalton said, and eventually he lost his job. But one of the cooks at the Federalist opened a neighborhood Italian place and hired Mr. Dalton to manage the wine. There, he grounded himself in Italian wines.On a wine-tasting trip to New York, he sat at the bar at the restaurant Daniel and was wowed by the breadth of the wine list. A determination to work there sent him first to Florida, where his mother had relocated and where he landed a job at Caf\u00e9 Boulud, which had opened a branch in Palm Beach. He parleyed that into a job in 2005 at Daniel, the mother ship of the chef Daniel Boulud.Together, they hatched the idea of a podcast. Mr. Duckor would handle the technical production, and Mr. Dalton the interviews.At first, Mr. Dalton\u2019s technique was rocky. He interrupted guests and seemed eager to demonstrate his own knowledge. \u201cThat\u2019s a sensitive thing for me, learning how to be wrong,\u201d he said.But over time, his work improved exponentially. He learned how to listen, to use silence to encourage further thoughts and, because he does know so much, became adept at asking excellent questions. Mr. Duckor left, but Ms. Scala arrived, and the podcasts improved technically as well.\u201cErin has been huge,\u201d Mr. Dalton said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Levi, what you\u2019re doing is really important, and she had recording and editing experience.\u201dWhile Mr. Dalton has spoken with some of wine\u2019s greatest personalities, a few, like the wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. and the storied importers Kermit Lynch and Neal Rosenthal, have resisted or not responded to invitations.One of the nicest moments, Mr. Dalton said, was when Mr. de Villaine of Roman\u00e9e-Conti arrived at Mr. Dalton\u2019s little apartment. Looking at it, he said, \u201cI can see that a lot of nice memories have been had in this place.\u201d A lot of history, too.Advertisement"}

Daniel Hall, a 30-year-old Apache helicopter pilot based at Fort Bliss, in Texas.\u201cThat attack mind-set is shared by the entire Apache community,\u201d Captain Hall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real macho thing.\u201dAs he spoke, Captain Hall was flanked by Capt. Vincent Franchino, a 26-year-old fellow Apache pilot who is also stationed at Fort Bliss, where they are both a part of another community: the group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender soldiers who serve there.\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a bumpy road for us,\u201d said Captain Franchino, who married Captain Hall on Jan. 13 in the Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., where they are believed to be the first active-duty, same-sex couple to exchange vows at the legendary Army post.The Rev. Dawn Sangrey, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony before 150 guests, many in Army service uniforms.The couple, beaming in their own immaculately pressed blue mess uniforms, the most formal threads in the Army\u2019s wardrobe, were celebrated by a saber-arch salute as they departed the chapel.\u201cWe\u2019ve experienced everything from people feeling awkward around us to being called faggots while holding hands and walking down the street, stuff like that,\u201d said Captain Franchino, who was born and raised in Stony Point, N.Y., the youngest son of Holly Franchino, a retired pharmacist, and Robert Franchino, a retired sergeant with the Police Department in Clarkstown, N.Y.The emotions and romantic feelings felt by Captains Hall and Franchino, as well as scores of others from the L.G.B.T. military community, were hamstrung by \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d a policy that went into effect in October 1993 under President Bill Clinton; it forbade any homosexual or bisexual member of the military from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages.\u201cThrough mutual friends at West Point, we had each learned the other was gay, and though we were attracted to one another, we couldn\u2019t say or do anything about it,\u201d said Captain Hall, who grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., the only son of Kyle Hall, a middle school mathematics teacher, and Stephen Hall, the vice president for nylon polymer strategic development at Koch Industries in Wichita, Kan., where his parents now live.\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when two people have feelings for each other but are not allowed to act on them,\u201d Captain Hall added. \u201cWe were serving under a policy that was telling all of us \u2014 perfectly capable soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines \u2014 to lie about ourselves.\u201dCaptain Franchino said that lying was much better than the alternative.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell the truth for fear of what would happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we put it in our minds that we were never going to say we were gay, we were never going to get made fun of, and we were certainly never going to get kicked out of the Army.\u201dThe first time they met was on a Friday afternoon at West Point in August 2009.Captain Franchino was taking part in an annual tradition during Ring Weekend in which freshmen (known as plebes) get a chance to retaliate against their often overbearing senior cadets (known as firsties) by doing all they can to delay the departure of those seniors, who are trying to hurry home after the ceremony to spend a weekend with their families.It took Captain Hall, swarmed by plebes, a full hour to cross the final 100 yards to his room. When he got there, he had no idea that four more plebes were waiting patiently to jump out of hiding spots in the room in an effort to scare him and further delay his weekend. After the first three plebes had departed, Captain Hall assumed he was alone, but as he prepared to leave, he was ambushed by Captain Franchino, who had been hiding under the bed.\u201cWhen I came out from under the bed, Dan was so startled, he jumped over his desk,\u201d Captain Franchino said, laughing.Captain Hall said he remembered thinking, \u201cThis guy has a lot of guts, and he\u2019s kind of cute too.\u201dThey went their separate ways, though neither veered too far from the other\u2019s line of vision. In January 2010, they selected each other as a partner in a mentorship program that allowed seniors to offer instruction to freshmen who were following similar career paths.By April of that year, it was clear to their fellow cadets that a spark had been ignited, but under the rules, there could be no flame.\u201cYou could tell that there was this chemistry, this unspoken communication between them,\u201d said Capt. Owen Waits, a close friend to both who was a senior cadet at that time and later married Captain Hall\u2019s sister, Lauren.\u201cIt was kind of strange because you knew that there was this whole aspect of their feelings and personalities that were being suppressed,\u201d Captain Waits said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the way it was.\u201dBut in September 2011, it was that way no longer. Congress repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and Captains Hall and Franchino were soon celebrating their new sense of freedom.\u201cVinny came out with a big splash to everyone on Facebook, posting all of these pictures of himself and Dan kissing and hugging, and I thought it was so brave that he did that,\u201d said Captain Franchino\u2019s uncle, Charlie Franchino, of Brooklyn, who is also in a same-sex marriage and was often the shoulder that his nephew leaned on when struggling to keep his sexuality a secret.Mr. Franchino said he also stepped in to \u201chelp ease the shock that was initially felt by Vinny\u2019s parents.\u201d\u201cMy brother\u2019s a cop, he\u2019s a tough guy, and so I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy for him and his wife to handle this news,\u201d Mr. Franchino said. \u201cBut whatever initial shock they had, they got over it quickly and immediately embraced Dan.\u201dThat evidence was on display during the couple\u2019s reception at the elegant Skylands Manor in Ringwood, N.J., a 44-room Tudor revival mansion perched high in the heavily wooded Ramapo Mountains along a stretch of long and winding country roads snaking through Ringwood State Park.\u201cSpeaking from my heart, I love Dan,\u201d Holly Franchino said during the cocktail hour.Her husband, Robert Franchino, added of their new son-in-law: \u201cThey are two peas in a pod.\u201d\u201cYou can see the chemistry between them,\u201d he added. \u201cWithout a doubt, Vinny is absolutely a happier person today than he was before he met Dan.\u201dThe relationship has not always been so accepted or in tune, including beginning with their first date in February 2012 in Washington.\u201cThat\u2019s where some guy called us both faggots,\u201d Captain Franchino said.But they had a bigger problem to deal with, as Captain Hall, then in flight school at Fort Rucker, in Alabama, learned he was being deployed to South Korea, along with his Boeing AH-64 Apache, a four-blade, twin-turboshaft attack helicopter equipped with a 30-millimeter M230 chain gun, as well as Hellfire missiles and Hydra Rocket Pods.Upon hearing the news, Captain Franchino was not feeling quite as macho as Captain Hall. Just five months removed from \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d the young soldier was on edge.\u201cI was so worried about Dan, it was really nerve-racking,\u201d Captain Franchino recalled. \u201cAt the time, there was just too much pressure involved, we were both very nervous about the long-distance thing, so we both thought it was best to just step away.\u201dThey began dating other people but had a change of heart and got back together in November of that year.Three years later, their relationship was on more solid ground, so Captain Franchino was in a better place emotionally to hear the news that Captain Hall was being deployed to Kuwait.A year after that, Captain Hall was flying his Apache above war-torn Iraq.\u201cWe\u2019ve just grown accustomed to being apart at times,\u201d said Captain Franchino, who spent all of 2017 deployed in Germany and several countries in Eastern Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of who we are, a part of what we do, so we simply accept it.\u201dCaptain Hall, who said he plans on \u201cleaving the Army after spring,\u201d also said that his military stint, especially the time he spent in the cockpits of Apache helicopters, \u201chas brought a lot of excitement to my life, and so has Vinny.\u201dBut when pressed, Captain Hall refused to say which of the two has brought him more excitement.\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d he said with a wink and a smile. \u201cI won\u2019t tell.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saucy App Knows China\u2019s Taste in News. The Censors Are Worried.", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 One of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups got that way by using artificial intelligence to satisfy Chinese internet users\u2019 voracious appetite for news and entertainment. Every day, its smartphone app feeds 120 million people personalized streams of buzzy news stories, videos of dogs frolicking in snow, GIFs of traffic mishaps and listicles such as \u201cThe World\u2019s Ugliest Celebrities.\u201dNow the company is discovering the risks involved, under China\u2019s censorship regime, in giving the people exactly what they want.The makers of the popular news app Jinri Toutiao unveiled moves this week to allay rising concerns from the authorities. Last week, the Beijing bureau of China\u2019s top internet regulator accused Toutiao of \u201cspreading pornographic and vulgar information\u201d and \u201ccausing a negative impact on public opinion online,\u201d and it ordered that updates to several popular sections of the app be halted for 24 hours.In response, the app\u2019s parent company, Beijing Bytedance Technology, took down or temporarily suspended the accounts of more than 1,100 bloggers that it said had been publishing \u201clow-quality content\u201d on the app. It also replaced Toutiao\u2019s \u201cSociety\u201d section with a new section called \u201cNew Era,\u201d which is heavy on state media coverage of government decisions.The episode points to the fine line that Toutiao\u2019s creators must walk.Despite China\u2019s famously strict censorship, online news is a big business there. More than 610 million people in the country gained access to some news on the internet in 2016, according to official statistics.Suan Lin, a 24-year-old private equity analyst in Shanghai, said that she normally has to search high and low online to find articles about the Chinese historical dramas she watches on television. But Toutiao delivers, she said.\u201cOnce you\u2019re on it,\u201d she said, \u201cyou just can\u2019t stop.\u201dIn Toutiao\u2019s case, one of the accounts that were suspended this week had posted a saucy video of a woman in a short skirt. It got 57,000 views. Another suspended account had recently put up a post titled \u201cThe World\u2019s Ugliest Celebrities, Michael Jackson Is Ranked First, You Won\u2019t Want to Eat After Reading This.\u201dAs Toutiao\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed, Bytedance has become a darling of Silicon Valley investors such as Sequoia Capital. The company, which is currently valued at $20 billion, has been in talks with existing backers to raise new financing that would value the company at more than $30 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public.Jinri Toutiao, whose name means \u201ctoday\u2019s headlines\u201d in Chinese and is pronounced JING-er TOE-tee-yow, aggregates content from various sources and looks much like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed. But instead of displaying articles and videos based on what your friends have shared, the app does so based on what you have previously read and watched on the app.If you click on articles about iPhones, then Toutiao will feed you more tech coverage. After you watch a few cooking videos, the app will fetch you more clips of people wrapping dumplings and braising chicken\u2019s feet.This approach has helped Toutiao thrive amid China\u2019s heavily controlled environment for social media. Instead of policing the sharing activity of tens of millions of users, the company needs only to calibrate and adjust its centralized recommendation software.But it also needs to make sure the app\u2019s content does not cross the lines of censors. That is a huge task, particularly given that the overwhelming majority of content on Toutiao is produced by individual bloggers, not professional news organizations or other institutions. Ms. Liu said at last month\u2019s conference in Beijing that 90 percent of the app\u2019s content comes from blogger accounts. Toutiao has around 1.2 million content-producing accounts in total.According to Bytedance, every piece of content is automatically screened to check that it is acceptable before appearing on Toutiao. But once something has attracted more views, the system applies a more sophisticated screening algorithm. Certain material is also examined by humans as a final check.Bytedance also takes more overt steps to stay on the right side of the authorities. Important updates from the government are sometimes pinned to the top of a user\u2019s feed. That can lead to awkward juxtapositions \u2014 between, say, a state media write-up on President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent decisions and a photo slide show on six women who are \u201cso beautiful that rich businessmen immediately became attracted to them,\u201d as the piece\u2019s headline puts it.Despite Toutiao\u2019s popularity, some in China share that view. Yang Sun, a 26-year-old financial analyst in Shanghai, decried the app\u2019s sensationalist headlines.\u201cIt should absolutely be taken offline,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cTotally deserves it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how Bytedance screens content uploaded to its Jinri Toutiao news app. All content gets screened by a basic computer algorithm. It is not the case that content is not screened if it is seen by only a handful of people. The incorrect information came from a comment by Wei-Ying Ma, head of Toutiao\u2019s artificial intelligence lab, who told a Beijing conference last month that, \u201cIf there\u2019s a video that one or two people watch, we don\u2019t care.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Medieval Times Goes Modern, Replacing Its Kings With Queens", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lerner\u2019s drive to work takes about seven minutes in her used Nissan Sentra which, like her condominium, she never would have been able to afford if she hadn\u2019t gotten lucky and landed what for now is her dream job.She works in a replica of an 11th-century castle off the Stemmons Freeway north of downtown. It can pack in 1,000 people who pay $60.95 (less for children or anyone with a coupon) to put on paper crowns, slide behind long counters and tear apart chicken with their hands while watching a low-tech, two-hour drama that wraps elements of professional wrestling inside a Renaissance fair.As the fog from dry ice floated out over the arena\u2019s sand pit and waiters set slabs of spongy garlic bread in front of the audience, Ms. Lerner adjusted her gold cape and rode out on an Andalusian stallion bred especially for the show. She was Do\u00f1a Maria Isabella, the sole ruler of a kingdom filled with battling knights.For the 34 years Medieval Times has been in business, that monarch has been a man. But the show, which draws an estimated 2.5 million customers each year, is replacing all of its kings with queens. And its peculiar brand of dinner theater \u2014 a sort of G-rated \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 is taking on an unlikely resonance amid the national jousting over gender equality provoked by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements.In the show\u2019s old plot, the king had to fight off a challenger from another realm using a knight who bested five others in a tournament. In the new script, the queen has taken over for her late father (presumably the king from the previous show). She presides over a tournament to find the best knight in the land; drama ensues when a knight who has been acting dishonorably challenges her authority.\u201cThe fact that a woman is sitting on the throne in our show at the same time the gender equality movement hit is a coincidence,\u201d he said. Mr. Cordner was simply responding to audience members who kept asking why women played nothing but princesses. (On the other hand, the show still refers to its waitresses as wenches.)The joust-and-eat prototype for Medieval Times was created in 1973 by an entrepreneur who wanted to capture the tourist trade in Majorca, Spain. Since the American version began in Orlando, Fla., in 1983, almost 66 million people have attended.Here in Dallas, the production runs Thursday through Sunday; on a busy Saturday, they\u2019ll run three shows, and go practically nonstop for the nine days during spring break.\u201cShe ate everything,\u201d said Gretchen Midkiff, the Dallas marketing and sales manager.A different queen was on the throne that night. Ms. Lerner, 27, shares the role with three other actors, including Quinn Coffman, 23, a close friend who was her roommate until Ms. Lerner saved enough money to rent the condo.Both see larger implications in their coronation. \u201cIf it can help empower women and we can be role models for these young women and men and show you need to respect women, then it is very fortuitous timing,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cIt gives you the chills.\u201dBut on a recent Sunday evening in the lobby of the Dallas castle, the #MeToo movement hadn\u2019t shown up. As guests wandered around with $17 souvenir schooners of beer and watched Ms. Lerner perform some preperformance knighting ($20 extra), questions about the social significance of the new show were largely met with blank stares.One Australian tourist allowed that it was a clever idea, but many audience members said they had no inkling \u2014 or didn\u2019t care \u2014 that the show had changed.By the time the performance ended, John Freeman, 38, had formed an opinion. He didn\u2019t like it one bit. He was there celebrating his sister\u2019s birthday. It was the family\u2019s fifth visit.\u201cThe king gives it a more powerful feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just feel the emotions better.\u201dHis son, John Jr., who is 16, said he was mainly there to watch the knights fight. His daughter, Miakoda, 13, just shrugged.His wife, Stacey Freeman, 34, thought the queen freshened things up. \u201cIn my everyday life, I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m treated any different than a man,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know it happens.\u201dMs. Freeman was more concerned when a reporter mentioned that Medieval Times is thinking of tinkering with the menu, which is exactly the same at every castle.Women in corsets and skirts, and men in tights and tunics (called serfs) pour every guest a metal bowl of tomato soup that tastes like Campbell\u2019s slightly more sophisticated sister. Next they hustle through their stations serving 24-ounce roasted chicken halves from deep sheet pans.Then come stubby ears of corn steamed with soy butter, sugar, paprika and a little cayenne pepper, and large russet potatoes, each cut in half and roasted in oil with a host of spices that include garlic powder.\u201cJust do not change the food,\u201d Ms. Freeman implored. \u201cDo not take my corn away. I love that corn.\u201dFrank Dameron, 60, is the director of food service for the company, which is headquartered in nearby Irving. He lost his job as chef for a hotel chain during the last recession. Medieval Times was a life saver.Even though the menu is formulaic, Mr. Dameron tries to innovate. Before the show, he was in the kitchen working on a recipe for roasted carrot and zucchini sticks. Guests aren\u2019t given cutlery, so every dish has to be easy to pick up with fingers. There is no saut\u00e9 station. Everything is cooked in ovens so big you could walk into them.Dessert is another potential area for experimentation. Everyone gets a slice of lemon poundcake, which arrives at the castle frozen, in cardboard boxes. Could they make the course in-house? Mr. Dameron is pondering a chocolate crepe.The menu has changed before. Cornish game hens were the original entree, but guests balked at how bony they were. The company has added some optional vegan dishes, a three-bean stew and hummus; it dropped the pork ribs after diners complained that the meal was too protein-heavy or had religious objections. Besides, the ribs were a bit of a pain: The racks varied too much in size.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be sitting next to somebody who\u2019s getting something bigger than you,\u201d Mr. Dameron said.The food is popular with the staff. If there are leftovers, crew members eat chicken on benches in the locker room or walk out with foil-lined bags containing the complete meal, minus the soup and cake.Ms. Lerner is allowed to eat while perched on her throne during the show, since the story line is built around a banquet. But on this night she was already full. She has been experimenting with a paleo diet, and had eaten some spaghetti squash with tomato sauce and garlic she made in her slow cooker.In the stables, a knight, Kyle Calloway, 24, was making do with a coffee-flavored Monster energy drink as he warmed up for his star turn.The switch to a queen hasn\u2019t made much difference, he said, except in the part of the show when she rebukes the sexist knight who defies her.\u201cYou do get a huge reaction from the females in the crowd,\u201d Mr. Calloway said. But he doesn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it. \u201cAll I do is eat, sleep, joust, repeat.\u201dAfter the show, Ms. Lerner drank some water, took off her microphone and found her Sharpie. She had to make one more trip to lobby to sign autographs and perform any last-minute knighting ceremonies in the same formal, vaguely English accent all the actors are encouraged to use.She gets paid by the hour, and doesn\u2019t mind having to do her own makeup at a sink near the toilet stalls in the locker room or to work the lobby before and after the performance. It\u2019s show business, and she has loved it as long as she can remember.Instead of attending a high school, she was home schooled so she could dedicate herself to acting and writing music. Her first credit was as a mean girl on \u201cThe Bernie Mac Show.\u201dThen her dad died of lung cancer. She was 18. Her career faltered. \u201cI just collapsed,\u201d she said.She had to get out of town. Friends had moved to Dallas. Why not join them?Ms. Lerner got a job as the manager of a gelato shop. Then she enrolled in acting school, and landed roles in some well-received local productions. She worked princess parties for kids. (She still teaches vocal technique and acting to children.)A year and a half ago, she saw a notice on a school bulletin board for a princess job at Medieval Times. She was hired in an instant.There weren\u2019t many guests left in the lobby on this night, so her shift ended early. She handed her dress and cloak to the woman in charge of cleaning costumes and pulled on an oversize Walmart T-shirt printed with an American flag superimposed over a white tiger.When she heard that some audience members didn\u2019t seem to grasp the larger social significance of replacing the king with a queen \u2014 and that some even wanted the king back \u2014 she seemed slightly crestfallen.\u201cWell, at least a seed has been planted,\u201d she said.Ms. Lerner grabbed the Medieval Times umbrella that management gave her as a holiday gift, punched out and said good night to the operations manager camped at a desk near the back door. She walked out into the damp Dallas night, a foil-lined bag of chicken and vegetables in her hand.Hoppy Joe was waiting.Advertisement"}

We can fulfill these goals by setting aside special interests and opportunism. UNITED WE CAN ACHIEVE THEM!\u201dIt was unclear if Mr. Fujimori\u2019s remarks were a hint that he planned to play a more active role in Peruvian politics. But the message rippled across Peru, where Mr. Fujimori is a deeply divisive figure.Though respected by some, he has been vilified for leading an administration that led a violent crackdown in the 1990s on the Maoist Shining Path insurgency, which had all but brought normal life in Peru to a standstill with bombings and killings.In 2009, Mr. Fujimori was sentenced for his role in two massacres that killed dozens of Peruvians in its effort to quash the Shining Path.Peru, a country with an authoritarian past, returned to democracy only 17 years ago. And critics denounced Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s pardon as a blow to the fight against impunity and efforts to heal national wounds after Mr. Fujimori\u2019s presidency.The Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa and 238 other writers signed an open letter saying the decision covered the nation \u201cin infamy and shame.\u201d The letter said the pardon was not an act of compassion, as the government insisted, but \u201cthe most crude and cynical political calculus.\u201d\u201cDear countrymen,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthis pardon does not in any way mean impunity or oblivion; this is about starting to heal our wounds as a country.\u201dMany had expected the vote to result in his removal, with the chamber dominated by the opposition Popular Force, a right-wing party founded by Mr. Fujimori\u2019s daughter, Keiko, who supported the effort to impeach Mr. Kuczynski.Some lawmakers said that Mr. Fujimori had asked them to follow his son\u2019s lead, and the pardon was widely seen as a quid pro quo with Mr. Kuczynski, charges the administration has denied.In signs of a split in Popular Force, Kenji Fujimori has accused his sister of \u201cconspiring\u201d to keep his father imprisoned. He has asked that his father be named an aide to the family-run party.\u201cOn the one hand, there\u2019s Keiko and her bloc that directly opposes the government,\u201d said Gilbert Violeta, a congressman who is president of Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s party, Peruvians for Change. \u201cOn the other hand, there\u2019s Kenji and the bloc that supports Alberto Fujimori.\u201d\u201cWe will only know the real effects of that confrontation in the following days, when Congress is back in session,\u201d Mr. Violeta added.Lawyers say there is no legal obstacle preventing Mr. Fujimori from seeking public office now that he has regained his freedom.Since then, he has spent his days inside a rented house in a quiet suburb of the Peruvian capital, Lima, where his doctors say he is recovering from a heart condition.Yonette Joseph contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

They argued that this was an empty exercise.\u201cI do believe that it is useful, or can be useful, clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can also be less than useless.\u201dWe\u2019ll get to some of the least useless suggestions below, but first here are some of the broad trends revealed by the approximately 3,000 responses submitted on Facebook, Twitter, our website and directly to my email.A significant minority had grown comfortable with \u201cGeneration Z,\u201d including Raquel Glassner, 22, of Olympia, Wash.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard iGeneration before, but that is really horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cOur whole generation shouldn\u2019t be branded by Apple. Gen Z is the final generation of the 1900s, and a generational title using the last letter in the alphabet seems fitting.\u201dThe youngest respondent I tracked down was Mari Sobota, 8, a third-grader in Madison, Wis., who wrote in to say that her generation would be known for \u201cgirl power!\u201dMari, 8, could identify an obvious generational difference between her and her 12-year-old sister Cassandra, and their mother, Carousel Bayrd. \u201cWe both like cotton candy, and my mom hates that,\u201d she said.The oldest respondent to give her age was 91-year-old Annette Benedict, of the Bronx. \u201cI figure you\u2019re not an ageist,\u201d she wrote, a gambit that all but ensured her inclusion. Her suggested name was The Thumbies, for the digit used to operate smartphones. \u201cI think that suits them,\u201d she said, chuckling, when I called her.A significant number rejected the age ranges we selected, especially 22-year-olds who consider themselves millennials, like Zach Witkin, of Providence, R.I., who said he could clearly recall Sept. 11, 2001, an unforgettable day for many older respondents. He was 6 then.\u201cMaybe we could make a firm cut-off just beyond 1995?\u201c he suggested.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being called Generation Scapegoat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt would be kind of the tongue-in-cheek dry humor that I see in this generation. And when baby boomers and Generation X or Y or whatever decide to start using us as punching bags instead of millennials, it\u2019s gonna be much harder to whine about us if they\u2019re forced to call us The Scapegoats.\u201dRoshan Mueller, 11, was one of many to suggest the Meme Generation. \u201cI think it goes with how our generation goes through life,\u201d he explained in a phone interview, with his mom listening in. \u201cWe go through life fast. And just like that, memes spread fast.\u201dWe also heard from multiple people suggesting Memelords, Memennials and Generation Snap. Also, the Hopeful Generation, the Anxious Generation, Generation Fix-It and The Cleaner-Uppers. Some simply wrote \u201cDoomed.\u201d The Last Generation and the Final Generation were also popular.Andrea Habiba, 15, of Houston, suggested the Sisu Generation. \u201cSisu is a Finnish word that roughly translate to determination in the face of adversity, and my generation will be facing many adversity such as fixing the economy, global warming, the threat of terrorism and so on,\u201d she wrote.Benton Molina, 21, of Athens, Ohio, suggested we call the new youngs Spimes. The term, coined by the science fiction author Bruce Sterling, refers to an object hooked into the internet of things: aware of its environment, constantly documenting itself, its existence mirrored in the cloud.\u201cPost-millenials share these characteristics,\u201d Mr. Molina observed. \u201cThey are central units in small, personal clusters of technological nodes (made of both people and machines) who leave a data trail throughout their entire lives.\u201dBut we had a favorite. Four separate people suggested Deltas or the Delta Generation. Kelsy Hillesheim, a 22-year-old New Yorker, provided the most thoughtful explanation.\u201cDelta is used to denote change and uncertainty in mathematics and the sciences, and my generation was shaped by change and uncertainty,\u201d she explained, mentioning terror attacks, wars, the Great Recession and the 2016 election. \u201cI do not have much memory of a sustained time of stability, and I\u2019m on the older end of what you\u2019re looking for, though I imagine this is also the case for younger deltas.\u201d\u201cWe take nothing for granted,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe were kids when our parents lost their jobs in the recession. We also are a generation of demographic shift \u2014 we are more diverse than any in American history. We generally see it as something to embrace, and welcome changes that could make for a more inclusive and just America.\u201dDelta also implies members of this generation will be agents of change, not just people reacting to it, she said. \u201cWe are not passive products of circumstance, but active members of society with agency to affect the course of history, and will to build each other up to make things better,\u201d she added. \u201cWe know all too well that adults aren\u2019t doing so today.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled a source\u2019s given name.

It won\u2019t, the company said, affect the sponsored posts that businesses pay to show people as they scroll.But several advertising executives have speculated that the new rules could ultimately fuel the social network\u2019s long-held video ambitions.\u201cFacebook has been studying TV for a few years now, and they see there is a certain equation to the size and success of TV,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer of the agency OMD. \u201cIt\u2019s three elements: a high-quality user experience, prominent high-quality video and a curated, restricted supply of said video. What that equation results in is higher rates and stable, consistent ad dollars and growth \u2014 and Facebook is looking for ad growth.\u201dMore generally, video content is \u201camong the most shared and commented-upon content on the web,\u201d said Mr. Winkler, who expects videos will now be given priority over text posts on Facebook.\u201cThere is a recognition that Facebook has been, for lack of a better word, toxic,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cIf they have ideas around what the solution to that problem is, and it happens to clear the field for Facebook-owned and -operated content, that\u2019s a happy coincidence.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that Facebook has done here that it hasn\u2019t necessarily done so much in the past is they let the ad model lead the consumer behavior versus the other way around,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the agency 360i. \u201cWatch was built with the premise that ad dollars were coming to video and it would be smart for Facebook to have a video platform.\u201dMs. Hofstetter noted that Watch could potentially benefit if publishers that had relied heavily on Facebook traffic started making fewer videos now. \u201cThis, in turn,\u201d she said, \u201ccould lead to less inventory and push advertisers towards the more premium videos within Facebook Watch.\u201dPublishers could also respond by migrating their videos to Watch, where Facebook could sell more of the pre-roll ads with sound that run before YouTube videos, said Ben Hovaness, executive director of digital activation at Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science agency.\u201cYou can think of the Watch tab as Facebook trying to have its own YouTube inside of it,\u201d he added.Right now, said Mike Dossett, who leads digital strategy at the agency RPA, most Facebook video ads \u201cshow up as a sponsored video from a brand like any other post in your feed.\u201dMr. Dossett said he anticipated a broader transformation of what appeared on Facebook as the company focused on videos that inspired the active participation of its users, like live sports.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see what that might turn into for the type of content Facebook is buying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pretty radically shift the type of video that is populating the platform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canadian Whisky\u2019s Long-Awaited Comeback", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time, in the decades after Prohibition, when Canadian whisky was all the rage in America, when a bottle of Crown Royal sat on the bar cart of any serious imbiber. But by the time the renaissance in whiskey making and drinking began in the early 2000s, the Canadian product had long ago been dismissed as bland and bottom-shelf.It\u2019s a story that Davin de Kergommeaux, a whiskey writer in Ottawa, knows all too well. When he published his book \u201cCanadian Whisky: The Portable Expert\u201d in 2012, it was the first serious guide to the category in decades \u2014 not that anyone noticed. He would give seminars at whiskey festivals and be lucky if a few dozen people showed up.\u201cI was very much a voice in the wilderness,\u201d he said during a recent visit to New York.\u201cAt an event in Ottawa, 169 people bought tickets for one of my talks,\u201d he said.The sudden popularity of all kinds of whiskey on both sides of the Canadian-American border is driving a rapid expansion among Canadian distillers. Mr. de Kergommeaux\u2019s first edition covered just nine distilleries \u2014 eight large, traditional operations, and one craft start-up. The new edition includes 40 more, all of them newly opened, with many more on the way.In both countries, the figures signal a clear tilt in favor of more expensive, and more innovative, brands. \u201cA lot more consumers are taking Canadian whisky seriously,\u201d Mr. de Kergommeaux said. \u201cThey taste it and recognize the care that goes into it.\u201d\u201cCanadian whisky\u201d is both a simple geographic identity \u2014 it\u2019s whiskey, made in Canada \u2014 and a specific, somewhat complicated style. While some new distilleries, like Eau Claire, make Scotch-style single malt as part of their lineups, all the large distilleries, and most of the start-ups, focus on Canadian-style whisky.Like bourbon and most American ryes, Canadian whisky is typically made from a combination of different grains. But while the grains in bourbon and rye are mashed together first, then distilled and aged, in Canada each grain is processed separately, then blended together at the end.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.And while most American whiskey must by law be aged in charred, new oak barrels, no such restrictions exist in Canada. Distillers there can work with any grain (though rye predominates), and they can age it in any kind of barrel \u2014 new, used or one that held another beverage, like rum or wine.The result is a spectrum of flavors for blenders to work with. \u201cPut these variables together, and there are literally thousands of different points we can hit in terms of flavor,\u201d said Rick Murphy, who oversees production for Alberta Distillers, one of Canada\u2019s largest.That freedom, however, presents a problem in the United States, where 69 percent of Canadian whisky is sold, according to Spirits Canada. American law requires that Canadian whisky be labeled \u201cblended\u201d \u2014 which, in the United States, usually means a whiskey that combines a small amount of strong whiskey with mostly neutral grain spirits, creating a cheap, nearly flavorless drink.As a result, many Americans assume that Canadian whisky is boring and poorly made, a misconception that the industry\u2019s leaders are only now pushing back against.\u201cI think we\u2019ve been apologizing for it too long, and haven\u2019t gone out to tell our story,\u201d said Don Livermore, the master blender at the Hiram Walker & Sons distillery in Windsor, Ontario. \u201cCanadians have been doing themselves a disservice for 80 years.\u201dCanadian whisky has done well in America; Crown Royal, made by Diageo at a plant in Manitoba, is the second-best-selling whiskey in the United States, behind Jack Daniel\u2019s.Still, for decades Canadian whisky has been stereotyped the same way Canada has been: as unassuming, a bit bland and averse to change. But these days the country is challenging those preconceptions, celebrating its diversity, its youthful spirit and its embrace of innovation. The same is happening with its whisky.Distilleries are sending their master blenders around the world to promote their product, and inviting tourists into their plants with new visitor centers. And they are creating flavorful and exciting new expressions: peppery whiskys made with 100 percent rye grain, like Lot 40; whiskys finished in port or rum barrels, like Pike Creek; and weird but delicious blends like Alberta Dark Batch, which combines 6- and 12-year-old Canadian rye with bourbon and sherry.\u201cPeople are looking for heavier, bolder styles of whiskey,\u201d Mr. Livermore said. \u201cI grew up on meat and potatoes, my kids are growing up on sushi. What I like about Canadian whisky is that we can adapt easily to changing tastes.\u201dThough he is probably too modest to claim credit, Mr. de Kergommeaux is part of Canadian whisky\u2019s success story. His book quickly became required reading for whiskey fans, and he became both prophet and proselytizer for the spirit\u2019s resurgence at seminars and festivals around the world.The rye grain in Northern Harvest, Mr. Murray wrote, was \u201cnot just turning up to charm and enthrall but to also take us through a routine which reaches new heights of beauty and complexity. To say this is a masterpiece is barely doing it justice.\u201dCanadians celebrated the news as if they had just won the World Cup. Within days, stocks of Northern Harvest in Canada and the United States disappeared.\u201cWhen Murray\u2019s award was announced, I got a call from someone at Canadian Club who said, \u2018We won,\u2019\u201d Mr. de Kergommeaux recalled. \u201cI said, Crown Royal won, not his brand. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018Canada won.\u2019\u201dThe price for the world\u2019s best whiskey? $35. Which is another thing Canadian has going for it. Prices for single-malt Scotch, Japanese whiskey and even bourbon have skyrocketed in the last decade, putting luxury bottles out of most drinkers\u2019 reach. A bottle of 40-year-old single-malt Scotch from the Balvenie costs $4,000. A bottle of 40-year-old Canadian Club, in contrast, costs $200 (though you\u2019ll have to go to Canada to get it; it is not yet available outside the country).\u201cThe way Canadian is blended opens up flavor possibilities, so you can choose specific whiskys for different cocktails,\u201d said Ray Daniel, Char No. 5\u2019s head bartender. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fairly modestly priced, so you don\u2019t have to take a risk.\u201dWhat really excites Mr. Daniel \u2014 and anyone who\u2019s betting on Canadian whisky \u2014 is the type of customer ordering his drinks. When Char No. 5 opened in 2014, business travelers from Europe and the United States would sidle up to the bar, and their eyes would skip right over Char No. 5\u2019s lengthy list of Canadian whiskey, in search of Scotch or bourbon.No longer. \u201cAmerican guests in particular are very open to trying new things,\u201d Mr. Daniel said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for Jack and Coke anymore.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Eau Claire Distillery.

{"Headline": "Missouri\u2019s Combative Governor, Deep in Scandal, Puts on the Charm", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 As Paul DeGregorio, a prominent Missouri Republican and former political operative, pondered whom to support for governor of Missouri in 2015, he thought he had found just the right candidate after spending about an hour with Eric Greitens.Mr. Greitens seemed to check every box: He was a political newcomer and family man whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included stints as a Rhodes scholar and Navy SEAL. \u201cI was hopeful that he would bring the change that was necessary in Missouri, and be this breath of fresh air,\u201d Mr. DeGregorio said.But not long after Mr. Greitens won the election and took office last January, Mr. DeGregorio began to have second thoughts.\u201cHe held so much promise because of his background,\u201d Mr. DeGregorio said. \u201cIt just comes down to: It was all about his ego and his ambition.\u201dNow this onetime rising star of the Republican Party, whose White House ambitions were something of an open secret, is mired in a political crisis that has left him alienated among many of his former champions.He is in survival mode, telephoning scores of legislators and donors in a furious scramble to contain the damage and hold on to the governorship.The maverick, confrontational style that helped Mr. Greitens win office, achieve some legislative victories and attract national attention is now hampering his efforts to weather a fierce political storm. He is on an emergency charm offensive.\u201cThis kind of an approach works very well until it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said John Hancock, a political strategist and former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t foster relationships with the legislators that you\u2019re serving with and when you don\u2019t foster relationships with the press who cover the state capital on a daily basis, that all can be just fine. But when you then face a crisis, there\u2019s no cavalry running to your defense.\u201dMost Republicans in the State Legislature have not pulled their support for the governor over the affair, but they have not loudly defended him, either, and some have already suggested he must resign \u2014 or, one said, be impeached \u2014 if all the allegations leveled against him prove true.Mr. Greitens\u2019s lawyer, James Bennett, said the governor was not resigning. He added that Mr. Greitens was paying him personally and that \u201chis goal is to begin the process of making amends with people who may feel impacted by the lapse in his conduct that he has acknowledged.\u201dThe woman, who has not been publicly identified and did not respond to requests for comment, requested privacy in a statement by her lawyer on Friday.\u201cIt is very disappointing that her ex-husband betrayed her confidence by secretly, and without her knowledge, recording a private and deeply personal conversation and then subsequently released the recording to the media without her consent,\u201d said the statement from her law firm, Knight & Simpson.Some Democrats have called on Mr. Greitens to resign. Several Republican lawmakers signed a letter asking the state attorney general, Josh Hawley, to investigate the blackmail claims. Mr. Hawley\u2019s office said the issue was outside his jurisdiction but St. Louis\u2019s prosecutor, Kimberly Gardner, said she was investigating.A spokesman for the governor did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to figure out what\u2019s best for him and what\u2019s best for the state of Missouri,\u201d said Nate Walker, a Republican state representative.Asked if Mr. Greitens should consider stepping down, Mr. Walker said, \u201cI think that has to be an option.\u201dMr. Walker, one of the governor\u2019s earliest campaign supporters from the legislature, recalled asking Mr. Greitens when he was a candidate if there was anything in his past that might come out. Mr. Greitens assured him there was not, Mr. Walker recalled.\u201cI can see by your pupils in your beady little eyes that you\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d he said to Paul Wieland, a Republican state senator, in a dispute last year over a legislative pay raise.Jean Evans, a Republican state representative in her first term, said it was disappointing \u201cto have a teammate, particularly a leader of the team, speak negatively of other members of the team.\u201dMs. Evans was among those who received a call from Mr. Greitens \u2014 whose wife, Sheena, was on the line as well, seeking to make amends.\u201cI was certainly surprised and pleased that he made that effort,\u201d she said.Todd Graves, the chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said the governor\u2019s style had hurt him with his political relationships but had resulted in some legislative victories, too.Mr. Greitens achieved the passage of right-to-work legislation, long a goal among the state\u2019s Republicans. He has signed into law bills that make it more difficult to sue an employer for discrimination and restrict how much plaintiffs can receive in injury lawsuits. And he has gotten the state to withhold $140 million that was slated to be spent on low-income housing tax credits.He has not fared as well on other issues. An ethics reform bill to ban lobbyist gifts to legislators failed after questions arose about the governor\u2019s own ethics.John Eligon reported from Jefferson City, Jess Bidgood from St. Louis, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Business World All About Greed?", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 When I visit university campuses, I\u2019m periodically asked if students who seek jobs in the business world are immoral, money-grubbing sellouts.We interrupt this column for a paragraph of cynicism. Tycoons always claim to cherish ordinary people\u2019s best interests even as they rip them off. American tobacco executives have killed more people than Stalin managed to, and pharma executives recklessly peddling opioids may have killed as many people as Colombian drug lords, yet these business leaders sometimes seem to get moist-eyed describing the work they do.But the business toolbox is too important to give up on. To me, the most interesting people in Davos aren\u2019t the presidents or celebrities, but the social entrepreneurs \u2014 those using business tools to address social problems \u2014 and their work offers an inspiring window into what can be accomplished.Refunite is now helping more than one million refugees search for missing family members. It has already helped 40,000 of them connect, and Mikkelsen says this would never be possible if it were just an aid group rather than a hybrid piggybacking on business networks.With water shortages around the world, there\u2019s growing interest in that approach, so Haiti may become a model for other nations in the developing world.In Kenya, Christie Peacock tackles a huge problem for farmers: Much of the feed, medicine and other agricultural supplies for sale are fake or substandard, including about 60 percent of the fertilizer. When farmers buy fake seeds, their crops fail, and they go hungry.That\u2019s the advantage of a business approach: It is often more sustainable and scalable than a charity. By working with African farmers to improve coffee production, Starbucks helps lift more people out of poverty than any number of aid efforts.What\u2019s driving the rethink isn\u2019t a tingling of the tycoon conscience but brutal self-interest. Millennials want to work for ethical companies, patronize brands that make them feel good and invest in socially responsible companies.Some of this is shallow and some is deep, but it\u2019s authentic: Doing good is no longer a matter of writing a few checks at the end of the year, as it was for my generation; for many young people, it\u2019s an ethos that governs where they work, shop and invest.C.E.O.s tell me that this forces their hand. If companies protect groping scumbags, that hurts recruitment and they lose in the war for talent. Increasingly, a company that ignores social value loses shareholder value.Other companies hailed as model global citizens include Unilever, Starbucks, Whole Foods, Mastercard, Danone and Chobani. (What is it with yogurt companies? Their culture?)When companies with hundreds of thousands of employees elevate women, fight for Dreamers, adopt environment-friendly packaging, when they serve not only shareholders but also the larger society, the impact can be transformational. But enough with the gauzy rhetoric. It\u2019s time for businesses to walk the talk.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy finished off last year on a firm footing, and is poised for more vigorous growth in the months to come.\u201cThe year-end is solid,\u201d said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit. Details within the report, about climbing business investment and depleted inventories, suggest more economic strength than the bare-bones headline number might indicate. \u201cIt portends well for 2018 demand,\u201d he said.Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits.\u201cThe economy\u2019s sustainable trend is around 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.The Commerce Department\u2019s report on the gross domestic product \u2014 which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent \u2014 is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit \u2014 it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December \u2014 and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves.The American economy\u2019s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.Exhilarating stock market gains have also been a worldwide phenomenon. Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out that the major stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea registered gains comparable to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, if not better.\u201cThe U.S. performance doesn\u2019t stand out relative to the rest of the world,\u201d he said.The I.M.F. warned against assuming that the current economic cycle would go on indefinitely, however, particularly given the towering debt of the United States and other countries. By borrowing so much, the government can crowd out other investors and drive up interest rates. At the same time, giant deficits crank up pressure to cut government spending on health care and housing, policing and schools. With less money to go around, spending dries up and consumer demand \u2014 the economy\u2019s primary engine \u2014 slows.\u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the current economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.\u2019s chief economist.An additional, unexpected flaw in recent United States data may come more sharply into focus this year. G.D.P. figures may have been artificially lowered over the last decade because of tax policies that encouraged domestic-based multinationals to shift billions of dollars in domestic profits overseas.The tax-code changes could muddy attempts to measure growth in 2018, and possibly 2019, though. If enough companies stop disguising significant domestic profits as foreign, G.D.P. in the United States would suddenly expand \u2014 without any underlying change in output.\u201cOver the next couple of years, I think there will be a one-time jump in the level of G.D.P. because the profits that Apple, Google, Facebook and others attributed to an offshore tax haven affiliate will now appear in their U.S. accounts,\u201d said Mr. Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.\u201cIf it happens at a larger scale, it will give the appearance of faster G.D.P. growth,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article understated the size of the American economy. Its annual output is more than $19 trillion, not $17 trillion. The article also misstated the year-over-year growth in the gross domestic product in 2015. It was 2.9 percent, not 2.6 percent. And because of an editing error, an outdated estimate was cited for last year\u2019s first-quarter growth. The Commerce Department says the annualized rate was 1.2 percent, not 1.4 percent.Advertisement"}

The rules will let internet service providers block online content, or charge websites for faster delivery to consumers, by rolling back the protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.\u201cThe rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d Michael Beckerman, the association\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday.Netflix, whose data-heavy video streams could face extra charges by internet service providers, also said it would support a legal challenge.The issue of regulating internet service providers to maintain an open internet has wound through the courts and the commission for more than a decade. The repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, attracted strong opposition.Mr. Pai has said the new rules would encourage more investment and innovation by internet service providers. He has also argued that the change would withstand any legal challenge, as it essentially restores the rules to what they were before 2015.The commission declined to comment on Friday.Democratic lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the commission\u2019s action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous bills that could replace the agency\u2019s rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States lawmakers in California, New York and Washington are also considering bills that would recreate the 2015 net- neutrality rules in those states.Public interest groups are trying to make net neutrality an issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections. They have deployed text and email campaigns meant to pressure lawmakers to support a congressional reversal of the commission\u2019s action.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going to court soon to challenge the F.C.C. and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had \u201cawakened the public.\u201dThe strong response to the repeal has also led to some safety concerns. At the commission meeting where the new rules were approved, law enforcement officials briefly cleared the room to address an unspecified security issue.Mr. Pai canceled a scheduled appearance at the tech industry\u2019s CES trade show next week. The commission declined to say why he would not attend, but has previously confirmed that he and his family had recently received threats by phone and email over the net neutrality issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV Content Wars: Too Many Characters Chasing Not Enough Action", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC.That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle \u2014 and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2014 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Can\u2019t Resist Playing by China\u2019s Rules", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorApple is selling out. It\u2019s not about the latest version of the iPhone, but the huge cache of personal data that will be going directly to the largest, and one of the harshest, authoritarian regimes in the world: the Communist government of China.Given the Chinese government\u2019s continuing crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech under President Xi Jinping, as well as its deepening reach into Western democracies, Apple\u2019s policies in China have far-reaching implications for us all.Customers registered in China, according to Apple\u2019s new terms and conditions agreement for the country, must \u201cunderstand and agree that Apple and G.C.B.D. will have access to all data that you store on this service, including the right to share, exchange and disclose all user data, including content, to and between each other under applicable law.\u201dIn short, all personal user information stored on the iCloud \u2014 including photos, videos, text files, contacts, calendars and iCloud email \u2014 will be shared with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data and could be available to the Chinese authorities as well. Apple has said that G.C.B.D. will not have access to the personal data stored in its facility without Apple\u2019s permission, but the new terms and conditions agreement appears to say the opposite.Under the agreement, Apple seems to be absolving itself of responsibility for what the authorities may choose to do with personal data in G.C.B.D.\u2019s hands. Users who refuse Apple\u2019s terms will be denied iCloud services. Users who accept run the risk of unwittingly provoking the ire of the aggressive police state, resulting in deleted data or accounts, or harassment and imprisonment.This kind of partnership between an American company and a dictatorial regime is at odds with the image Apple has built as a company committed to privacy and a willingness to stand up to pressure from larger entities like the United States government. In a 2015 interview with NPR, the Apple chief executive Tim Cook emphasized that privacy \u201cis a fundamental human right that people have,\u201d from a \u201cvalues point of view,\u201d not \u201ca commercial interest point of view.\u201dUnfortunately, it now seems that such \u201cvalues\u201d are taking a back seat to profits.In 2017, Apple also announced it was halting the sale of virtual private networks, apps that allow users inside China to get access to blocked content that is critical for activists and regular citizens. IPhones in China also no longer include some Western news outlets like The New York Times on the News app.In response to criticism about these steps, Apple has blithely responded that it is obeying China\u2019s laws. Is this how American companies should respond to dictatorial demands and arbitrary, unjust legal codes?The Chinese regime makes no apologies about its human rights violations and seems not to care whom it crushes in its quest for power and control, whether it is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died last year in Chinese custody, or the many human-rights lawyers and activists who have been detained and tortured in recent years.When dealing with the Chinese regime, American companies should likewise not apologize for their commitment to the fundamental values \u2014 human rights, democracy, freedom of information, the rule of law \u2014 that have allowed them to flourish. American companies should not follow practices in authoritarian countries that are illegal in the United States.It\u2019s hard to believe that Apple is caving in to the regime like this. The only conclusion I am left to draw is that the company is O.K. with taking part in the suppression of freedoms abroad while espousing high-minded values at home.Those companies, institutions and organizations that play an outsize role in society should not shirk their responsibility to uphold social justice. The Chinese people have been fighting for human rights for decades, including the rights to privacy, freedom of speech and democracy. Many have lost their lives doing so. Instead of aiding dictatorships and following a misguided path to the future, Apple should return to its core values and protect the rights of its users at home and abroad.Chen Guangcheng, a civil-rights activist, is the author of \u201cThe Barefoot Lawyer: A Blind Man\u2019s Fight for Justice and Freedom in China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They arrived after 2001, so none of them were ever eligible for the protection the White House is taking away. But their lives here \u2014 and the lives they fled in El Salvador \u2014 illustrate how disastrous it will be for their country to attempt to absorb 200,000 people who are required to return in September 2019.The young woman, whom I met when I wrote a book about her family and whom I called Maricela there, lives in rural El Salvador and gets her news via Facebook on a phone that only sometimes works \u2014 when it doesn\u2019t rain, and when she has the money to pay for data. It took only a day for her to learn about the policy shift, and to become terrified.She knows that being deported can be a death sentence. She explained that when young Salvadorans are sent home, they risk being killed by gang members, often the very people who ran them out of the country. Some returnees who have been away for a long time will be considered \u201cdesconocido,\u201d unknown, and are likely to be targets because of suspicion (they could be members of a rival gang) or because, by virtue of having lived in the United States, they are assumed to have money. \u201cMy parents are so worried,\u201d the woman told me.Her fear is no doubt being felt by many whose relatives\u2019 status has been thrown into question by the announcement, and whose loved ones face dismal fates if they\u2019re made to return. While the decision to end temporary protected status is causing shock waves in the United States as Salvadorans here reckon with the prospect of being separated from their families and sent back to a country plagued by deadly violence, or moving into the underground undocumented economy, it is also a source of intense anxiety for millions in El Salvador about how it will affect their own lives.\u201cWe can\u2019t go back,\u201d was a refrain that I heard again and again during the three years I spent reporting on unaccompanied minors from El Salvador and that I still hear from the dozens of Salvadorans I work with at a high school in Oakland, Calif. One 15-year-old student has had repeated panic attacks; she shakes uncontrollably and gasps for breath at the prospect of returning. \u201cThe gangs tried to recruit me into their group,\u201d Jorge, who arrived here two years ago, told me this week. When he didn\u2019t join, they threatened his life. \u201cThey\u2019d kill me if I went back,\u201d he said.Salvadorans like the young woman in my book are also fearing the impact of so many people being sent home so suddenly. El Salvador is home to 6.34 million people; the 200,000 deportees from the United States would mean a population increase of 3 percent. Where are these 200,000 people expected to go, and how will they possibly be absorbed? They won\u2019t, Mr. Bukele says \u2014 or at least not without severely harming the economy and civil society.The last time the United States mass-deported people to El Salvador was in the 1990s, when the country\u2019s long civil war ended. Salvadorans who had come of age in low-income, violence-riddled communities in the United States took that violence back to El Salvador in the form of gangs modeled after American gangs.The violence in El Salvador today is a direct result of both American foreign policy during the Salvadoran civil war and the immigration policy immediately following. In vowing to send nearly 200,000 people back to a country plagued by violence, we seem destined to repeat the same mistakes, with consequences perhaps even more dire than before.As a result of the administration\u2019s decision, many Salvadorans who lose their temporary protected status will no doubt flee into the shadows in this country. And those forced back home, once they experience how dire the situation is there \u2014 and how much their mass arrival has wreaked havoc \u2014 will almost certainly risk their lives to return to the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5-Year-Olds Work Farm Machinery, and Injuries Follow", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "Children are growing up driving large farm machines to help their families. Thousands are injured every year; many are killed.Supported byOGDENSBURG, Wis. \u2014 Cullen Schachtschneider, 6 years old, lay bleeding beside the barn, tangled up in a 4,600-pound farm machine that had ripped his left leg apart.Like children across America\u2019s two million family-run farms, Cullen had grown up around farm equipment, including the yellow loader now covered in his blood. He rode along as his father hauled calves. He watched his grade-school-age brothers drive the diesel-powered loader, carrying corn and doing chores to help keep their family\u2019s struggling Wisconsin dairy afloat. The work was woven into their childhood.But one evening last October, as Cullen\u2019s father was using the loader \u2014 called a skid steer \u2014 to feed the cows, Cullen clambered aboard, and his foot slipped. The machine\u2019s hydraulic bucket bit into Cullen\u2019s left leg and tore it from knee to ankle, ripping off his tissue as easily as someone slipping off a glove.The boy\u2019s father, Caleb, jumped off the machine and frantically called 911. Two years earlier, Cullen\u2019s brother Kholer, 8, had driven the steer into his older brother, Maric, sending him to the hospital. Now another child was hurt.If the family business were medicine or construction, there would be little chance of a kindergartner wielding a scalpel or shingling a roof.The toll has stirred a debate among farm safety groups and in rural communities about whether young children should be allowed to tackle such risky jobs. After a string of horrific accidents this year, intense discussions flared up on social media about when \u2014 and whether \u2014 it was safe to let children work and play around heavy equipment.At a time when industries and some rural residents have rallied behind the Trump administration\u2019s push to roll back an array of regulations, the debate over safety standards on family farms raises difficult questions about the line where personal responsibility should end and government oversight should begin.\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many children killed,\u201d said LuAnne Ujazdowski, a counselor at Cullen\u2019s elementary school in central Wisconsin who has 60 beef cows at her home and calls herself \u201crural to the roots.\u201d\u201cParents in the city would not be allowed to do some of these types of things,\u201d said Barbara Lee, director of the National Farm Medicine Center at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wis. \u201cYou see a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old riding on a tractor fender, nobody reports it. They say, \u2018That\u2019s farming.\u2019 \u201dBut questioning whether a child should be riding in a tractor or playing in the barn is no easy thing in rural communities. Generations of farm children have woken before dawn to feed livestock and do chores that families call a sacrosanct part of life. It is a way of passing on lessons about hard work, responsibility and the pulse of the land that their children will some day take over.With prices plummeting for wheat, dairy and other products, smaller, struggling farms are also under intense financial pressure, and entire families are pitching in to survive.\u201cThese kids help,\u201d Cullen\u2019s mother, Amanda Smith, said. \u201cThey are our hired hands.\u201dWhere safety advocates see preventable and predictable deaths, other families see tragic accidents that merit prayers and sympathy, not criminal charges or more government regulation.\u201cKids on the farm do operate machinery,\u201d one Wisconsin farmer wrote on Facebook, wading into a sea of online comments about the accident that killed the 3-year-old boy. \u201cPart of their life.\u201dRural lawmakers and farm groups revolted when the Obama administration tried to tighten some child labor rules to keep children away from manure pits and block them from driving tractors and other heavy equipment. They pilloried the move as a big-government intrusion that would outlaw children from doing their chores. The proposals \u2014 which would have exempted children on their parents\u2019 farms \u2014 were quickly dropped.On the Schachtschneider farm, the boys started learning early. Their father, Caleb Schachtschneider, 36, said he taught his two older sons, Maric and Kholer, by letting them sit in his lap as he drove the tractor or skid steer across the farm.\u201cIt\u2019s like an extension of you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re around it, you\u2019ve got to teach them. They need to know because they\u2019re there. Otherwise, they\u2019d get hurt worse.\u201dRunning the equipment became second nature to the older boys, their father said. But accidents still happened. Two years ago, when Kholer struck Maric with the skid steer, Maric spent a week in the hospital and came home in a wheelchair, said the boys\u2019 mother.Ms. Smith, 34, said she hated seeing her children drive the yellow machine squatting beside the barn. Sometimes she fantasized about ramming it with her car or maybe selling it off. But she also defended allowing the boys to do work that would otherwise require hiring help the family could not afford. Seeing her children bottle-feed calves and milk full-grown cows was a source of pride. Farmwork taught them how to take care of themselves, she said.\u201cIf we were to just leave and not let our kids continue to grow up like this, what are they going to have?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are they going to learn? Just to quit?\u201dTen years ago, Ms. Smith and Mr. Schachtschneider went all in on the farm out on County Road K. They borrowed more than $400,000 for their mortgage, equipment and operating loans. They hung a wooden sign on a kitchen wall: \u201cNo Farmers, No Future.\u201dMr. Schachtschneider worked at a foundry for two years to help with their budget. Ms. Smith pulled shifts at a bar. But they could not sustain the jobs while raising five sons, ages 4 months to 9 years, and milking a herd of dairy cows twice a day.When Cullen got hurt last October, support and donations poured in. But the ripples from his injury compounded the farm\u2019s problems, like a crop blight.For a month after the accident, Mr. Schachtschneider stayed with Cullen at Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin, near Milwaukee, about 125 miles from the farm. The family has applied for health insurance for Cullen under a Wisconsin program that covers low-income residents, and Ms. Smith said they do not know yet how much the bills may total.The disruptions and absences have already taken a toll on the farm. A teacher from the boys\u2019 school stopped by to feed and milk the cows, and relatives pitched in. Still, the farm\u2019s biweekly milk production fell from an average of 3,600 pounds to 1,900. They sold three cows.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten kind of tough,\u201d Mr. Schachtschneider said.When Cullen came home after a month of surgery and skin grafts, he would wake up the family night after night with his screams, and cry when Ms. Smith left his sight. \u201cHe has to go everywhere with me because he\u2019s scared, and I have to protect him,\u201d she said.Mr. Schachtschneider said that Cullen\u2019s accident and his own self-recrimination played on a loop in his head.After months of physical therapy, Cullen can walk again, and the waves of infection and pain have eased for now. The imaginative boy is back to making up his own songs and pretending to be a charging bull, and now brags to medical staff about his progress.But his leg, stripped of layers of protective tissue, will be vulnerable to infection and injury for years to come, Cullen\u2019s physical therapists and nurse say.Despite all this \u2014 the bills, operations, medications and grief \u2014 there were still cows to be fed and feed to be hauled. And the children were still going to do the work.\u201cAs long as I\u2019m in the skid steer, I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Maric, 9, who rakes hay for the cows and dreams of growing up to be a farmer like his father. \u201cI have to drive it. I have to put hay in for the cows.\u201dOne frozen afternoon, as Cullen drifted into a long nap, the older boys pulled on their boots and tramped into the icy, manure-covered lot where the cows feed during the day. Mr. Schachtschneider called out to his oldest: \u201cMaric, I need your help. Get like three-quarters of a scoop, O.K.?\u201dThe boy hopped into the skid steer and drove it across the snow to a spout where ground-up cornstalks and kernels poured out of a silo. He filled the bucket, pulled a lever to swing it high in the air, and spun the machine around, steering it toward the pen of waiting cows.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a Wisconsin city where a child was killed in a farm accident.

{"Headline": "How to Counter the Circus of Pseudoscience", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe one day, once I have decades of experience as a doctor and further training in my area of specialization, I will be able to speak about health matters with the tone of authority of the average naturopath.That was the thought that crossed my mind recently while I waded through the online world of alternative-health practitioners, wellness bloggers, whole-food chefs and Gwyneth Paltrow.I did not seek it out at first; it came to me through a social-media algorithm. Facebook offered up a video advertisement from a \u201cfemale hormonal health specialist\u201d with her own \u201cpractice.\u201d Not an endocrinologist but a naturopath. She lectured with confidence on thyroid testing, though much of what she said was wrong. And down the internet rabbit hole I went.One traditional view of the medical profession is that doctors are commanding and authoritarian, even arrogant. Though some individuals fit that description, in fact, the profession is built on doubt.Most doctors, especially the good ones, are acutely aware of the limits of their knowledge. I have learned from those much more experienced and qualified than me that humility is something to be cultivated over time, not lost.Our field is built around trying to prove ourselves wrong. In hospitals we hold morbidity and mortality meetings trying to show where we have failed, what we need to change, how we can do better. Our hospital work is audited to identify where we fell short of our ideals. Through scientific research we try to disprove the effectiveness of treatments. Our failings are exposed from the inside.The nature of evidence-based health care is that practices change as new evidence emerges.That is also the case for other health professionals whose practice is based on science, like qualified dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists. Guidelines are revised, advice is reversed \u2014 on blood pressure, diet, hormone replacement, opioid prescribing. This can be immensely frustrating for patients, even though it is what we must do to provide the best possible treatment.In the face of such doubt, it is not surprising that some individuals, even those who are intelligent and well educated, are swept away by the breezy confidence of health gurus, who are full of passionate intensity while the qualified lack all conviction, to borrow from Yeats.This may explain how an Australian celebrity chef named Pete Evans cannot only promote the health benefits of a Paleo diet but also feel knowledgeable enough to make pronouncements on fluoride, sunscreen and vaccinations. He responded to criticisms in a television interview by saying: \u201cWhat do you need a qualification for? To talk common sense?\u201d He added, \u201cWhy do you have to study something that is outdated, that is industry backed, that is biased, that is not getting the results?\u201dEngaging is difficult when the alternative-health proponents are on such a different astral plane that it is a challenge even to find common language for a conversation, especially when they promote spurious concepts such as \u201cpyrrole disease,\u201d which they can speak about in great, false detail, drawing the well-informed physician, dietitian or scientist into a vortex of personal anecdote and ancient wisdom, with quips about big pharma thrown in for good measure.Countering the online health gurus is especially difficult when they offer the irresistible cocktail of medical language muddled with a much more pleasing aesthetic than medicine, far from the clinical world of linoleum and antiseptic, a better place where patients\u2019 conditions are diagnosed with metaphors (\u201cadrenal fatigue\u201d) and treated with poetry (holy basil, bone broth, Himalayan sea salt).In the face of this circus, we doctors must hold tight to evidence. We must hold tight to our doubt, our knowledge of our fallibility as individuals and as a profession, knowing that humility is a strength, not a weakness.But we must also as a profession engage in the public conversations about health, including on social media, along with our colleagues in allied health fields. If we do not, the discussion will be dominated by the passionately uninformed, who build trust only to sell false cures. And we must listen to patients, as we are taught to do, showing care and understanding. We must take on the difficult challenge of inspiring and motivating with the truth.Lisa Pryor, a medical doctor, is the author, most recently, of \u201cA Small Book About Drugs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lebanese Intelligence Turned Targets\u2019 Android Phones Into Spy Devices, Researchers Say", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe spy operation, revealed on Thursday, is among dozens around the world uncovered by human rights groups and technical organizations in recent years as governments and intelligence agencies have started relying more on mobile and desktop spyware than on traditional forms of cloak-and-dagger espionage.The researchers found what they said was evidence that Lebanon\u2019s intelligence agency \u2014 called General Directorate of General Security, or GDGS \u2014 spied on their targets\u2019 Android mobile devices and desktop computers using various methods for more than six years. Their primary attack method, researchers said, was through a series of decoy Android apps designed to look like widely used private, secure messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal.Once downloaded, the apps allowed spies to steal nearly everything off their victims\u2019 phones, including text messages with one-time passcodes for accessing email and other services, as well as contact lists, call logs, browsing history, audio recordings and photos. The apps also let the spies take photos using the phone\u2019s front or back camera, and turned the device into a silent microphone to capture audio. The apps were not designed to target Apple iPhone users.\u201cOne of the main takeaways from this investigation is that actors, like Dark Caracal, are shifting away from a pure desktop capability for espionage to now relying heavily on mobile tools to gather their intelligence,\u201d said Michael Flossman, a security analyst at Lookout, referring to the name that he and other researchers coined for the Lebanese spies they said were most likely responsible for the espionage.GDGS is Lebanon\u2019s main internal intelligence agency, and its director, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, a career army general, has a rising profile and a broadening portfolio. The agency oversees residency permits for foreigners, from diplomats and tens of thousands of Southeast Asian domestic workers to more than a million Syrian refugees. The agency\u2019s expertise and clout has traditionally been seen as stemming from its human intelligence, not from high-tech espionage techniques.Speaking ahead of the report\u2019s publication, General Ibrahim told Reuters: \u201cGeneral Security does not have these type of capabilities. We wish we had these capabilities.\u201d GDGS did not return a call for comment on Thursday.Together, researchers tracked the spying to command and control servers operated by the attackers. The researchers looked at who had registered the servers and when, as well as the dates of some of the stolen content. They deduced that the campaign had been going on for as long as six years.The attackers were targeting journalists and activists, as well as government officials, military personnel, financial institutions, defense contractors and others in 21 countries. Those countries included the United States, China, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and inside Lebanon.The researchers traced the attacks to a building in Beirut that houses Lebanon\u2019s GDGS, using Wi-Fi networks and so-called internet protocol addresses assigned to attackers\u2019 machines. While researchers said they could not be sure whether the attacks were the work of the GDGS or rogue employees, many of the attacks appeared tied to an email address \u2014 op13@mail.com \u2014 that had been linked to various online personas, including \u201cNancy Razzouk\u201d and \u201cRami Jabbour.\u201d All of the physical addresses listed with registrations made by that email account were clustered around the GDGS building in Beirut, according to the user\u2019s wireless activity.Emails sent to that email address were not returned.As part of their work, researchers found evidence that Lebanese spies were directing victims to install the spy apps through WhatsApp messages that began innocuously with a \u201cHow are you?\u201d Those then linked to the spy apps with additional messages like \u201cYou can download from here to communicate further.\u201dIn other cases, the spies found their targets on Facebook, inviting them to Facebook groups, where they posted links to their decoy apps, which they often referred to by names like \u201cWhatsApp plus.\u201d The spies also directed victims to fake login sites for social media services like Twitter and Facebook to steal their credentials, hijack their accounts and push out trick messages to more people.Researchers also found evidence that Lebanese officials had previously used FinFisher, a product manufactured by the British company Gamma International, which sells surveillance tools that let customers turn computers and phones into listening devices to monitor a target\u2019s messages, calls and whereabouts. Increasingly, researchers discovered that the spies had built their own custom mobile spy tools that were less sophisticated than FinFisher but as effective in getting the intelligence they were after.Researchers also uncovered evidence that Lebanese officials deployed several variants of malware to victims\u2019 desktop machines; the malware was designed to work across several operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple\u2019s Mac and Linux. That malware could steal screenshots of victims\u2019 computer screens, use the victim\u2019s webcam to spy on their physical whereabouts, record sound, grab photos and any Skype activity, file listings and files, and even iPhone backups.In the hours after researchers published their report on Thursday, the servers conducting the spying went dark.Anne Barnard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Rockefeller Center\u2019s owners were determined to tear down the hall. When the city tried to landmark it, they sued.\u201cThey brought out the big legal gun,\u201d Ms. Wood said. \u201cIt could\u2019ve overturned the entire landmarks law and the ability to protect any interiors.\u201dWhen the landmarks commission prevailed, Ms. Wood said, it reaffirmed the group\u2019s mission.\u201cTo me it\u2019s that moment of realization that the value of these spaces is not just in dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what they mean to New Yorkers and the spirit of New York.\u201dMs. Wood said Radio City\u2019s interior is the city\u2019s most extensive interior landmark, protecting everything from the auditorium to the grand staircase to the bathrooms.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s worth buying a ticket for a show or going on a tour of Radio City just to go into the bathrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re bathrooms like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dAlexandra S.

{"Headline": "Georgian Court Sentences Mikheil Saakashvili in Absentia to 3 Years in Prison", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 A Georgian court on Friday sentenced former President Mikheil Saakashvili to three years in prison for abusing his pardon powers while serving as president. Mr. Saakashvili, who is now in Ukraine, was sentenced in absentia.Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s legal woes have been piling up in both his adopted country, Ukraine, and his homeland, Georgia, but the ruling is the first time he has been sentenced to prison.A gregarious populist and an avowed enemy of Russian influence in former Soviet states, Mr. Saakashvili has cast himself as a fighter for good government and pluralistic democracy, and he has said that the criminal cases against him are pushback from an entrenched, corrupt elite. Detractors call him a showboating has-been.Georgian authorities accuse him of abusing his power, and Ukraine has stripped him of his citizenship for making false statements on a form.After stepping down as president in 2013, and a brief retirement in Brooklyn, Mr. Saakashvili supported the Ukrainian revolution the following year. Petro O. Poroshenko, who became Ukraine\u2019s president after the ouster of Viktor F. Yanukovych, rewarded him with citizenship and a position as regional governor in Odessa.That relationship soured, though, after Mr. Saakashvili accused Ukrainian cabinet ministers and Mr. Poroshenko of corruption. While the Georgian government has sought his extradition for years, his troubles in Ukraine make that prospect more likely.The pardons, prosecutors contended, were part of a scheme to cover up evidence in the investigation of the murder of a Georgian banker, Sandro Girgvliani.In his statement, Mr. Saakashvili called the ruling ridiculous and orchestrated by a political enemy, Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire and a former prime minister who has had business interests in Russia. Now, Mr. Saakashvili wrote, Mr. Ivanishvili and President Poroshenko are coordinating the legal actions against him in Ukraine and Georgia.\u201cTo judge a president for using his right to pardon, which I applied to 133 former military service personnel and which is not limited in any way, testifies to the completely political character of this process,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis \u2018decision,\u2019 as well as the parallel legal process in Kiev, clearly demonstrates that the oligarchic governments in both Ukraine and Georgia are working \u2014 in a synchronized and completely coordinated fashion with each other \u2014 against me.\u201dMr. Saakashvili stepped down in Georgia after serving the constitutional limit of two terms, an exception in the former Soviet states where authoritarian leaders have bent the rules to stay on for decades.But the government that succeeded him quickly set about prosecuting him. Along with the pardon case, the authorities in Georgia also accuse Mr. Saakashvili of repressing a protest and taking over a television station in 2007, of orchestrating an attack on an opposition politician and of wasting budget funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u2019 the Most Radical Show on TV?", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "FeatureThe reality-television competition that began nine years ago has evolved to reflect an era fixated on gender and identity \u2014 and the boundary-pushing spirit of its star.Supported byThis was an \u201call star\u201d season, meaning the eight contestants had all appeared in previous seasons. One queen was dressed like a Barbie doll, her makeup exaggerating her features so that her eyes, lips and rosy cheeks resembled an anime character. Another, dressed in an ice-blue peignoir, petted a stuffed lap dog with one hand and preened with the other. A queen wearing a purple halter dress and a fringe wig clutched a martini glass and wobbled dramatically in her hot pink heels.The camera crews started filming. Charles, dressed in an expertly tailored light pink suit, stepped onto the set as the fun-house version of Chris Harrison, host of the \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Bowyer-Chapman beamed, gamely playing the part of an anxious suitor. Instead of long-stemmed red roses, he would hand out bulging purple eggplants, a nod to their popular use as suggestive emoji. Charles asked Bowyer-Chapman if he was ready to begin the ceremony. Suddenly, the two froze, and their eyes locked. Charles whispered into Bowyer-Chapman\u2019s ear, and in one smooth sweep, Bowyer-Chapman scooped up all 6 feet 4 inches of Charles and strolled away. The departure sent the queens into a choreographed frenzy. The martini drinker pretended to faint. Another queen whipped out an oversize flip phone and screamed at her agent. One pulled out a paper bag and breathed heavily into it.The director called cut, and everyone broke into boisterous laughter, including me. The footage would be assembled into a short film and played for the judges, who would grant the queen whose performance they deemed the best with an automatic slot in the competition\u2019s next round. Part of me wanted to be offended at the over-the-top interpretations of \u201cfemale\u201d behavior, but I was defenseless against the sheer silliness of it all, and the way that it slyly highlighted how our culture coaxes us to treat finding love as a competition.Bowyer-Chapman, a die-hard fan of the show who is a frequent guest judge, later told me that he felt the scene was cutting commentary on both the racial discrimination of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d which has never had an African-American star, and the way television warps people. The contestants \u201cbecame caricatures of themselves in ways that were the polar opposite of what usually happens on \u2018Drag Race,\u2019 which is about finding the authenticity of yourself and showcasing it,\u201d he said. The show reveals, Bowyer-Chapman argued, that regardless of gender and orientation, \u201cwe all have more in common than not.\u201dDrag has been featured in popular culture for decades. Movies like \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d \u201cTootsie,\u201d \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d \u2014 even \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d \u2014 have showcased men, some gay, some not, who dress and perform as women. But most tended to treat drag as high jinks. Nothing about the inner lives of queens has hit critical mass quite like \u201cDrag Race,\u201d not even the 1991 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d which followed the black and Latino drag ball circuit in New York during the 1980s. \u201cIt is a popular movie, but it didn\u2019t reach everyone the way a weekly television show does,\u201d said Lady Bunny, a drag queen in her 50s who is often regarded as one of the legendary figures of American drag culture. \u201cMany people have never had any interaction with a drag queen, and barely know what it is,\u201d Bunny continued. \u201cAnytime Middle America gets a taste of a community that they\u2019re not familiar with, it does normalize the L.G.B.T. experience.\u201dCharles has said that he feels he is beyond categorization \u2014 he\u2019s black but he\u2019s not; he\u2019s gay but he\u2019s not. These days, when someone says that, it\u2019s usually met with a polite eye roll, the kind reserved for out-of-touch elders. The personal politics of this moment are almost entirely defined by naming. There\u2019s space for every pronoun, every hyphen and every politically correct portmanteau. But Charles belongs to a different generation, one that fought so hard for visibility that they feel they\u2019ve earned the right to eschew all political decorum and enjoy the anarchy of reinvention, co-opting and bending language beyond recognition. When \u201cDrag Race\u201d first began, it seemed like a fun window into an underground culture, but over the nine years it has aired, the show has evolved to reflect America\u2019s changing relationship to queer rights and acceptance.Drag, to Charles, is about the perversion of our understanding of gender, and by extension, ourselves. \u201cWe queens take on identity, and it is always a social statement,\u201d Charles explained to me. \u201cIt\u2019s all nudge, nudge, wink, wink. We never believe this is who we are. That is why drag is a revolution, because we\u2019re mocking identity. We\u2019re mocking everyone.\u201dIn 2009, the year that the first season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d was broadcast, the buzziest reality shows on television tended to be the most melodramatic and cattiest \u2014 \u201cSurvivor\u201d or \u201cThe Hills.\u201d \u201cProducers were just looking for the nasty side of the human experience, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Charles told me. Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, founders of the production house World of Wonder, talked him into it. The trio had been collaborating since the 1980s, when Barbato and Bailey were in an electro band called the Fabulous Pop Tarts. Charles appears in one of their videos in a skin-tight leopard dress. They produced Charles\u2019s VH1 variety show in the 1990s. \u201cI knew they loved drag the way I loved drag, and they would celebrate the art of drag,\u201d Charles said. Tom Campbell, head of development at World of Wonder, told me that the idea for the show was to create a competition that would groom the next generation of drag superstars by replicating all the major milestones of Charles\u2019s career \u2014 model, television personality, performer. \u201cThis was his turn to give back and create his legacy,\u201d he said.At first, \u201cDrag Race\u201d wasn\u2019t an easy sell. \u201cEveryone felt like it was too much,\u201d Barbato said. Even when Viacom\u2019s L.G.B.T. channel, LogoTV, picked it up, Charles had to fight to realize his vision for the show. According to Charles and the producers, in the first season Logo resisted including a queen named Tammie Brown, who called to mind a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Prymaat, the matriarch in the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch \u201cConeheads.\u201d Charles felt it was important to reflect the oddballs of drag, a staple of the culture.Despite airing on a niche cable channel, the show found a loyal audience that included an elite coterie of celebrity fans who appeared regularly as guest judges, including Lily Tomlin, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Margaret Cho, Amber Rose, Rosie Perez and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. It was the most-watched show in the history of Logo. Last year, the show moved to VH1 and grew significantly: The ninth season averaged nearly 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double that of Season 8, according to data collected by Nielsen. In 2016, Charles won an Emmy for host of a reality show, and in 2017, he won again and the show picked up two more. Time magazine recently named Charles one of its 100 Most Influential People of the year.\u201cDrag Race\u201d has become a staple of modern television for the way it skewers expectations and attitudes about gender, much as a show like \u201cblack-ish\u201d works to challenge stereotypes about black families in America. That isn\u2019t to say contestants on \u201cDrag Race\u201d don\u2019t bicker or trade petty insults, as in other reality-TV shows, but the program doesn\u2019t leave viewers with the same existential dread about the future of humanity as, say, any of the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchises. In Season 5, for example, a contestant named Jade Jolie criticized her competitor, Alyssa Edwards, for having back fat. In a cutaway reaction, Edwards cocked an eyebrow, recoiled in disbelief and managed to completely defang the insult with a single word: \u201cBackrolls?\u201d \u2014 signaling that the word was both ludicrous (she is rail-thin) and so untoward that it could not be taken seriously. Some five seasons later, \u201cbackrolls\u201d still pops up on the show as a kind of venomless meta-reference.Each season is imbued with a sense of optimism in the face of relentless adversity; Charles believes that is central to the gay and queer experience. \u201cThere is a sisterhood here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to do with the shared experience of being outsiders and making a path for ourselves.\u201d The camaraderie Charles describes is evident: Even after their season ends, \u201cDrag Race\u201d contestants work together, live together, travel together. Their Instagrams are full of photos of one another. The kinship feels real, and it\u2019s what initially caught my attention and endeared the show to me.Amid the glitz and glamour of drag, the show doesn\u2019t obscure the violence and terror that accompanies the life of the marginalized. On the first season, a contestant named Porkchop described being shot at while standing outside a gay bar. In Season 8, Kim Chi, a shy Korean-American queen known for elaborate outfits, talked about hiding her colorful drag persona from her parents out of fear of shaming them. Trinity K Bonet talked about living with H.I.V. Last season, Cynthia Lee Fontaine revealed that if not for a last-minute change in her schedule, she would have performed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando the night of the mass shooting there; one of her friends, Martin Benitez Torres, unaware of the change, came to see her and was killed in the massacre. When I asked Charles if there was a deliberate decision to infuse the show with overt political messaging, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s inherent in our experience. We don\u2019t have to do much to infuse a consciousness into the show. It is such a part of our story, and we walk with it.\u201dAs \u201cDrag Race\u201d matures, it continues to find a broader and younger audience. Charles told me that some of the most dedicated viewers are women, especially teenagers and women in their 20s and 30s. \u201cThere is so much programming by social media, and how you have to construct your sense of self in line with how everyone else is constructing their sense of self. I think they see our show as a handbook for a navigation, and think, How can I rig this conveyor belt where I don\u2019t have to go down that thing?\u201d That awakening feels familiar to him because he went through it himself at 13. He looked like a girl, with sharp cheekbones, a soft brow and a red Afro that he let grow so big that it flopped down. \u201cWhen I first started doing drag in clubs, it was like the blurry picture that people had of me became clear,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the queens were kicked out of their homes, bullied or ostracized from society, and here they are looking gorgeous and confident. I know that\u2019s what kids are relating to. They\u2019re having a great time, but they\u2019ve overcome the pain too.\u201dCharles thinks these new fans who follow him and the queens on Instagram or who show up at live events for the show are embracing the spirit of drag and the freedom it offers. \u201cThey are shifting the balance of masculinity and femininity. And that makes me so optimistic.\u201d I was slightly skeptical that so many young people were watching the show, but as we sat over breakfast at Palihouse in West Hollywood, I noticed a middle-aged woman hovering with a nervous grin, waiting for her moment to approach. As Charles stood up, unfolding his lanky frame \u2014 sheathed in a slightly iridescent emerald-green suit \u2014 and leaned down to pick up his brown leather handbag, the woman rushed over. She wanted a photograph. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, but for my kids,\u201d she explained. Her children were 9 and 5, she told Charles. \u201cThey watch you every week,\u201d she gushed. \u201cThey love you.\u201dA few months later, in November 1960, that boy was born. His full name was RuPaul Andre Charles. His parents were living in San Diego at the time, having moved with their twins, Renetta and Renae, from Louisiana during the second wave of the Great Migration. Charles\u2019s parents traveled to the farthest coast, the literal end of the country their ancestors were forcibly brought to, only to discover that the mythos of the West \u2014 that it was a land of fresh starts \u2014 was far more complicated for black people, who still faced discrimination. \u201cShe was heartbroken by this world,\u201d he told me, with tears in his eyes. His parents were poor, and Charles\u2019s mother suffered from a debilitating depression throughout his youth. \u201cMy folks, and other folks in the South, had such traumatic experiences. I was able to dissect and deconstruct some of my feelings. I could afford to do it. They couldn\u2019t afford to do it.\u201dIn the summer of 1976, Renetta and her husband, Laurence, moved to Atlanta and invited Charles, who was 15, to join them. \u201cIt was like my bar mitzvah,\u201d Charles told me. \u201cSouthern culture has always had a place for eccentrics. I was ready to bust out and become who I am today.\u201d Those years imbued Charles with confidence. He enrolled at a performing-arts high school, where he took drama and theater. Atlanta\u2019s night life was a Warholian village of underground clubs, art shows, D.I.Y. movie shoots and warehouse parties. Under the governance of Maynard Jackson, the city\u2019s first African-American mayor, Atlanta was also a boomtown for African-Americans, creatively, socially and economically. He had never seen so many black people in one place \u2014 he didn\u2019t even know that many black people existed.He saw his first drag performance: Crystal LaBeija, an icon in drag-queen history, was singing Donna Summer in black fishnets and a bustier. Charles was floored. He used Renetta\u2019s sewing machine and drafted the first iteration of his new persona, blending the new-wave punk aesthetic of Bow Wow Wow, the goth freakiness of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d and jungle prints. A favorite look was a jock strap with football shoulder pads, fishnets and knee-high wading boots and dramatic eyes, all finished with a pile of hair whose volume rivaled Tina Turner\u2019s. He started bands, made music videos with friends, appeared on public-access variety shows and worked as a go-go dancer. He papered downtown Atlanta with handmade posters of himself that read, \u201cRuPaul Is Everything,\u201d and \u201cRuPaul Is Red Hot.\u201dAlthough drag has a long cultural history in America, it remained largely underground till the late 1980s. During the 1920s, the height of speakeasy culture in America, illicit venues and establishments that catered to gay clientele frequently hosted drag performance. By the 1940s and 1950s, postwar America had become more conservative, and the gay community was more heavily policed: A \u201cpervert inquiry\u201d in government agencies led to dismissals of federal and military personnel suspected of homosexuality. Cross-dressing was a punishable offense; in New York, men wearing fewer than three pieces of clothing could be arrested. But with the end of McCarthyism and the beginning of the sexual revolution, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the United States was home to about 500 regularly performing drag queens, with several, like Divine, reaching cult status. When Charles settled in Manhattan in the late 1980s, drag was a full-on cultural phenomenon in the city, and Charles was determined to be at its center.At 28, Charles became a fixture as a dancer at downtown clubs like Pyramid, Tunnel and Limelight. His popularity and career exploded when he teamed up with a D.J. named Larry Tee for the roving underground party Love Machine. It quickly became a trendy scene \u2014 even Liza Minnelli made an appearance. By then, Charles had transformed his look from what he called \u201cfright drag\u201d to something much more glamorous. The B-52s asked Charles to appear in their 1989 video \u201cLove Shack,\u201d which was shown regularly on MTV; four years later, Charles released the album \u201cSupermodel of the World\u201d on Tommy Boy Records, a label that had introduced acts like De La Soul and Queen Latifah. The album featured the song \u201cSupermodel (You Better Work),\u201d in which he gave models runway advice like \u201cshantay,\u201d a word Charles described as casting a bewitching spell. The song became a club anthem. The designers Todd Oldham and Isaac Mizrahi used it in their runway presentations during fashion week, and a cover of it appeared in \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie.\u201d In 1993, it was nominated for best dance video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Charles landed a regular modeling contract with MAC Cosmetics \u2014 the advertising campaign featured him in full glamazon drag, alongside the tag line \u201cI am the MAC girl.\u201d He had become the most successful queen of his era.I asked Charles if his mother ever got to see him perform. She did, once, in 1993. She was on her deathbed at home, suffering from cancer. She and Charles watched a Kurt Loder segment on MTV News around the release of \u201cSupermodel.\u201d It showed Charles prancing around a mall in New Jersey before a recorded voice-over declared him a \u201csupermodel of the world.\u201d His mother turned to him, he recalled, and said, \u201cNigga, you crazy.\u201d But Toni could also see that the psychic\u2019s premonition \u2014 that Charles would be famous \u2014 had come true. \u201cI could see her thinking, It\u2019s happening,\u201d he told me.For two years, he hosted, accompanied by his close friend Michelle Visage (a regular judge on \u201cDrag Race\u201d), \u201cThe RuPaul Show,\u201d a kind of variety program featuring pop-culture celebrities like Cher and Eartha Kitt. It was the first national show to have a drag queen as host. He released 10 more studio albums, but none were as successful as \u201cSupermodel.\u201d Then Bailey and Barbato, his World of Wonder co-producers, urged him to pitch the reality-show competition that would become \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d \u201cWe thought, Everyone is ready for drag \u2014 it\u2019s mainstream now,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cDistribution is part of the reason it hadn\u2019t been realized as a cultural phenomenon.\u201dA few years ago, the show hit a third rail. On \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d Banks would send the contestants a video message called \u201cTyraMail\u201d when she wanted to communicate with them; \u201cDrag Race\u201d had a version of this called \u201cShe-Mail.\u201d There were also challenges in which contestants were shown body parts and asked to guess \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cshemale.\u201d Some viewers complained on Twitter, and trans activists and writers started a public campaign advocating against the terms \u201cshe-mail\u201d and \u201cshe-male,\u201d arguing that they were transphobic. Charles and his producers initially defended their position. Charles tweeted, \u201cOrwell\u2019s book \u2018Animal Farm\u2019: The rebels eventually forgot the purpose of the revolution.\u201d But eventually the show dropped the term. Carmen Carrera, who competed in the show\u2019s third season and came out as transgender after her season aired, wrote on Facebook that although she didn\u2019t think the show meant any harm, \u201c\u2009\u2018shemale\u2019 is an incredibly offensive word, and this whole business about if you can tell whether a woman is biological or not is getting kind of old.\u201d For Charles, the controversy represented the antithesis of drag, which he sees as a subversive, countercultural reminder not to take the world so seriously. But for members of the trans community, language isn\u2019t a magic trick. Stepping into an identity other than the one you were assigned at birth isn\u2019t a performance \u2014 it\u2019s a confirmation and a correction.The controversy speaks to how quickly the culture has changed over the past 10 years. When I was on the phone with Lady Bunny, I used the word \u201cqueer.\u201d Bunny let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cOh, God, do I have to say it, too, now?\u201d During her youth, which is still recent history, \u201cqueer\u201d was a slur \u2014 what \u201cthey\u2019d say right before they bashed you in the head,\u201d she reminded me. The boundary-pushers of Charles and Bunny\u2019s time reveled in making a mockery of identity politics and political correctness; ours is defined by sharpening categories as a means to demand inclusion and recognition. (Facebook now has more than 50 options for listing gender identity, including pangender and agender.)Throughout my conversations with Charles, I got the sense that he is a sensitive person who is actively trying to evolve with the times. \u201cEvery season the girls come and they challenge me. A new nose contour technique or a new way to see themselves and identity, and it helps me stay on my game and stay engaged in the conversation.\u201d Last season, midway through the show, a queen in her late 30s named Peppermint revealed she was transgender, the first time being trans became a significant part of a character\u2019s narrative arc. Peppermint talked openly about her transition with Charles and the other contestants. Peppermint had auditioned twice for the show, and she didn\u2019t mention her transness. \u201cI was always careful to separate my trans identity from my drag career,\u201d she told me in a phone conversation. When she finally made it onto the show, she was asked if she would feel comfortable speaking about it. She has gorgeous features and deep dimples, but on the show, she described how her figure and hair, which were perceived as masculine, invited critiques from people who felt she should transition further or appear more feminine. \u201cI came to terms with my womanhood, even if I naturally have a beard growing in,\u201d she said. \u201cMen don\u2019t own gender and gender performance. We all can turn gender on its head.\u201dPeppermint noted the ways the popularity of \u201cDrag Race\u201d has bolstered an entire community, and in turn, an entire economy. In the \u201990s, she recalled, it was only lucrative to be a drag queen if you were one of the chosen queens \u2014 Lady Bunny, Candis Cayne, Miss Understood and, of course, RuPaul. She reminisced about doing drag seven days a week to pay the rent. \u201cReally, only 10 or 15 queens were benefiting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now the show has given so much exposure that it gives everyone a chance to earn very good money and recoup all the investments that we\u2019ve put in over the years \u2014 you know, the money we\u2019ve spent on glitter and rhinestones.\u201dJack Halberstam, a professor of English and gender studies at Columbia University and author of the book \u201cFemale Masculinity,\u201d a study of the history of diverse gender expressions, told me that we\u2019re in a watershed moment for gender visibility and equality, and he doesn\u2019t want to play down the importance of a mainstream drag show on television. Even now, gay life on television is limited \u2014 typically it\u2019s a side plot or narrative device. Representation still matters. But he raised an interesting point: \u201cNotice that there\u2019s no \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Kings,\u2019\u2009\u201d Halberstam said \u2014 meaning the culture of drag where people, usually gay women, dress up as passable versions of men. \u201cIt\u2019s as equally raucous and raunchy, with lip-syncing and costume competitions. We still have this idea that femininity is malleable, and masculinity is a protected domain of real power and privilege. It is not transferable or attainable. The public has no appetite for artificial masculinity.\u201dI tried to imagine a version of the show where contestants won prizes for making fun of male archetypes and stereotypes, and demonstrated that male identity can be deconstructed as easily as whipping off a toupee and a soft prosthetic penis. It was impossible.Charles frequently described his relationship to drag as \u201cthe Superman to my Clark Kent.\u201d The first time he stepped into his drag persona, Charles felt fully alive, electric with a power to command attention and desire. One day his therapist told him he could be Superman regardless of his attire. \u201cShe said, \u2018The power you feel in drag is available to you 24/7,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. That realization, he said, is what he is trying to relay in each season of the show, to both the queens and the viewers. Charles is rarely in drag these days \u2014 only for special occasions, and during the judging and elimination rounds on the show \u2014 a shift that he made about a decade ago. For Charles, the confidence and fun of drag is a state of mind, not an outfit change. But he is always keenly aware of the power dynamics (the ones Halberstam noted) that favor men, even when they are taking on female personas. \u201cWe never forget the fact that we are men in a male-dominated culture where masculinity is a currency that is valued more than gold. For men to do anything with femininity, to use femininity as a palette, it\u2019s basically an act of treason in our culture.\u201dDuring a break in taping while I was on set, Charles rounded up people for a game of dirty charades, which he loves so much that he keeps a list of clever ideas on his iPhone that is several swipes long. Empty director\u2019s chairs were dragged into an approximation of an audience around the giant stage where the show\u2019s contestants usually walk the runway. About half a dozen crew members arranged themselves accordingly. Charles, impeccable in his petal-pink three-piece suit, leapt onto the stage, lit by fuchsia lights, and signaled the start of the game. He used his hands to simulate the whirring of an analog film camera, and then held up three fingers, indicating a three-word movie title. He pinched his forefinger and thumb to indicate that the first word was short. He curled his hands into soft fists and raised them to his mouth. He mimed licking himself, and then spun around and squatted, reaching his hands around and motioning as if he were pulling something from his ass. The group, including me, burst into laughter. Someone yelled, \u201cThat Darn Scat!\u201d and Charles slapped his thighs and released a peal of laughter so distinct and delightful \u2014 like a throaty giggle \u2014 that as a child his older sisters regularly tickled it out of him.No one wanted to try and top that performance, so Charles cycled through several more R-rated versions of movies and songs like \u201cIt\u2019s the Hard-Knock Life,\u201d \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Lagoon.\u201d After each round, there was wild applause. I had the discomfiting sensation of catching a glimpse of something deeply private, like walking in on someone in a state of undress or using the bathroom. I had seen more than 100 episodes of \u201cDrag Race.\u201d I had watched Charles play the matriarch and patriarch, dispensing wisdom, jokes, admonishments and pep talks. Here, he looked carefree as he moved seamlessly between impersonations of a tough biker, a coquettish flirt, a naughty schoolgirl. Onscreen, he was always slightly removed, distant, ruling the show with a steely reserve that bordered on conservatism. The contrast between that Ru and the Ru pantomiming masturbation onstage was so disorienting it made my head spin. Watching him shape-shift onstage, I finally understood what he was trying to get at, how he refuses the outward ways in which people try to characterize him \u2014 and really, all people.Charles has been with his husband, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met on the dance floor at Limelight. On their second date, they flew from London to D\u00fcsseldorf on Elton John\u2019s private jet. They married in early 2017, 23 years after they met. The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Wyoming, where LeBar, a ruggedly handsome man somehow taller than Charles, has a 60,000-acre ranch. When they can, they take quick trips to San Francisco, New York or Maui. One time they took a helicopter from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, had lunch and took a boat down the Colorado River. \u201cHaving money is great when you have an imagination,\u201d Charles told me. I asked him if LeBar likes that sort of thing. \u201cHe loves luxury and doesn\u2019t give a [expletive] about culture,\u201d Charles replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who the Kardashians are. He doesn\u2019t know who Lil Yachty is. He couldn\u2019t name a Taylor Swift song.\u201d It\u2019s a reprieve from the celebrity status of Charles\u2019s world.But Charles thrives on that culture. He is working on a scripted television series for Hulu with the director J.J. Abrams based on his own life, and he recently appeared in the fourth season of \u201cBroad City,\u201d as Marcel, the manager of a haughty Brooklyn restaurant where Ilana works, who encourages her to be mean to the customers as a tactic to pressure them into spending money. Ilana eventually pushes back against Marcel\u2019s tyranny and realizes she is more successful as herself \u2014 the ultimate Ru message. \u201cWe wrote this character with Ru in mind,\u201d Abbi Jacobson, the creator of the show with Ilana Glazer, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a [expletive]-it mentality of being and owning yourself, and experimenting with yourself,\u201d she said of his appeal. Jacobson and Glazer watched \u201cThe RuPaul Show\u201d when it aired during the 1990s and remembered the fun freakiness of the cast and characters. At the time, Glazer was also watching the sitcom \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d which featured model-looking teenagers; the show made her feel \u201cugly and fat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a relief to change the channel and see Ru dancing and partying in the margins, and making space for his identity. He elbowed his way into the room in such a way that includes so many more people than him, and that representation trickled all the way down to these two little weird Jewish girls.\u201dTables were laden with items for sale: intricate corsets, leather gloves, beaded jewelry, sequined pasties, gel breastplates and elaborate bouffant-style wigs in every shade of pastel. There were makeup counters and queens giving attendees makeovers. One aisle was marked \u201cbackrolls.\u201d Past winners and former contestants paraded the halls, with everyone holding court in their best looks. Ginger Minj was dressed as Snow White, while Bob the Drag Queen looked like a cute clown in a blue tulle top and yellow party hat. Nearby, a queen named Detox lounged near the kind of bubble pit usually reserved for children at a fast-food restaurant. There were local queens, too, as well as children like Lactatia, a 9-year-old drag queen from Montreal (born Nemis Quinn M\u00e9lan\u00e7on Golden), who strutted the convention floor in an iridescent hologram three-piece suit and a cotton-candy-pink bobbed wig. Peppermint was there, too, resplendent in a sheer polka-dot caftan.Hordes of young people swarmed around the queens, eager to have their photos taken with them. There were long lines of men and women excited to take photographs with Charles, who was holding court in a section reserved for the V.I.P.s who bought special badges. There were people dressed as mermaids, muppets, cartoon characters and ghouls. There was a queen dressed as a sea captain being half-eaten by a shark. The atmosphere was the freakiest I\u2019d ever seen in Midtown during the daylight. I flashed back to a conversation with Charles when he told me about the early days of throwing wild, gender-bending parties in New York. People came out for the simple sake of experimenting. They dressed weird and let loose on the dance floor \u2014 the only place such liberation was possible back then.At one point, I spied a pack of children, of indeterminate gender, outfitted in suits and dresses. They could have been dressed for the occasion, or just in their daily wear. Amid of sea of six- and seven-foot queens in stilettos, they stood out, doll-size and adorable. Their cuteness drew gasps and oohs, but I also couldn\u2019t help thinking that we were also captivated by them for another reason: They felt like a glimpse of a future \u2014 and maybe even, someday, the new normal.Advertisement"}

The last time athletes from both North and South Korea played on the same team was during an international table-tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991.North and South Korea also reached an agreement last Wednesday for their athletes to march together under one flag at the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.With the official announcement on Saturday that 12 North Korean players would be added to the Olympic women\u2019s team roster, with three of them mandated to dress for each game, some of the South Korean athletes fear losing playing time or being benched for some games.Within South Korea, criticism of the government\u2019s decision to field an inter-Korean team has undermined the approval ratings of President Moon Jae-in, who has vocally supported the North\u2019s inclusion in hockey.\u201cCan abstract values like \u2018peace\u2019 and \u2018unification\u2019 get ahead of individual freedom?\u201d one commenter on the petition wrote. \u201cSouth Korea is a free liberal country, not a socialist country. I hope the government will not force individual sacrifice.\u201dLee Min-ji, a player who lost a spot on the Olympic roster, posted \u2014 and then later took down \u2014 a long statement on Instagram, lamenting the decision to add North Koreans to the team as \u201cextremely unfortunate.\u201d\u201cHow can one think that the players would take this situation in a good mood,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote, \u201ceven when anyone can become such a sacrificed player?\u201dMost of the players are still teenagers, and several have battled injuries and endured long commutes and punishing training along with the tormenting embarrassment of blowout losses.With the South Korean team ranked 22nd in the world, many around the team believe the decision to unite with North Korean players is rooted in disrespect. The men\u2019s team was never considered for integration.Last week, South Korea\u2019s prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, drew sharp ire when he said that the women\u2019s team was not a medal contender anyway, implying that its athletic unity could be sacrificed for political unity. He later apologized for the comments.Some analysts said the decision was simply sexist. \u201cThere is a degree of gendered notion that women\u2019s sports aren\u2019t as important and that they can be used in this soft cultural approach,\u201d said Benjamin Young, a Ph.D. candidate in modern Korean history at George Washington University. \u201cThe South Korean government is not having two inter-Korean hockey teams, male and female. They are kind of making explicit their gender bias known. I can certainly understand why the team players, coaches and public are upset.\u201dAnalysts said young South Koreans in particular objected to the last-minute insertion of North Korean players for political reasons as fundamentally unfair.\u201cDuring the campaign for the 19th presidential election, President Moon Jae-in stressed, \u2018Opportunity will be fair; the process will be fixed and the result just,\u2019 \u201d a commenter wrote on a petition submitted to the Blue House. \u201cBut the government that took away our athletes\u2019 opportunity; that ignored the preparation process, is this really just?\u201dIn the case of the ice hockey team, Professor Lee said, the government is favoring North Korean players in order to make a political statement. \u201cThe government high officers, without any consultation with the hockey players, decided they will form this united team,\u201d he said.South Korea\u2019s sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, initially raised the idea of a joint team last June, which bothered players then.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want it to happen,\u201d said Marissa Brandt, a player who was born in South Korea and adopted by a family in Minnesota, in an interview last October. Ms. Brandt, who said she never \u201cfelt Korean\u201d growing up, is an assistant captain who proudly wears her Korean name on her jersey.\u201cEvery girl on this team has put in so much time and effort, and it would be tough to see any of us get cut or have to give up a spot to someone else,\u201d Ms. Brandt said. \u201cWe are such a tight-knit team, and we want to stick together.\u201dSome analysts said the opportunity to create a sense of unity and advance a peace process was more important than the team\u2019s disappointment.\u201cThe public hoopla on how we are sacrificing the young Korean women\u2019s Olympic dreams, I think, is another political statement with specific aims to undermine the fact that there is going to be some peace process going on with the Pyeongchang Olympics,\u201d said Chung Yong-chul, a professor of sports psychology in the Graduate School of Education at Sogang University in Seoul. \u201cAll the people talking about how unfair it is for them to give up their spot, they didn\u2019t even know what ice hockey was before this issue came up.\u201dFor now, the South Korean teammates are putting in their last practices before the Games begin next month. The slogan on their black warm-up shirts reads: \u201cMake Korea Proud.\u201dSu-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victoria Beckham Draws Uproar Over Superthin Model in Ad Campaign", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe glossy image of the Lithuanian model Giedre Dukauskaite, published by Ms. Beckham on social media last week as she unveiled designs from her spring and summer 2018 eyewear range, has drawn a fierce public response. It is not the first time the fashion designer has been accused of promoting an unhealthy body image while advertising her luxury products, and is just the latest campaign to fan the perennial debate around when thin is too thin.Hundreds of social media users agreed. Elena Mata Westerman commented on Ms. Beckham\u2019s Facebook post, saying: \u201cEyes didn\u2019t even notice the glasses. The model was the focus. Sickly skinny! Beckham should be ashamed promoting eating disorders. Her young daughter is heavier than her models.

It\u2019s quite painful to look at.\u201dAlthough some people cautioned against body-shaming Ms. Dukauskaite, 29, calling for greater acceptance of all body shapes and sizes, the overwhelming majority voiced concern that fashion houses continue to encourage potentially hazardous behaviors by glamorizing models who are rail-thin.Ms. Beckham, whose own weight has frequently come under public scrutiny, did not respond to requests for comment.This latest outcry comes six months after the French Parliament published two new decrees aimed at protecting the health of models, preventing anorexia and promoting transparency around digitally retouched photographs. Models there need a doctor\u2019s certificate to certify they are fit to work, and employers can be jailed or fined 75,000 euros, or about $91,500, if the rules are breached.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rising Oil Prices Buoy Russia\u2019s Economy, Despite Sanctions", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In Russia, as in Texas and other energy-dependent regions around the globe, a rising tide (of oil) lifts all boats.That helps explain why on Thursday, as four American senators asked the State Department and other government agencies to blacklist two senior officials, the Russian stock market rose.It was not the prospect of more sanctions, of course, that was buoying the Moscow markets but the global price of oil, which has been soaring to heights not seen in several years.\u201cSanctions are important, that is for sure, especially for the market and for debt and equity investors, but for G.D.P. and the life of ordinary Russians, oil is far more important,\u201d said Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, referring to Russia\u2019s gross domestic product.Rising global oil prices, which hit a three-year peak last week above $70 a barrel, are brightening Russia\u2019s once gloomy outlook.Goldman Sachs has forecast economic growth of 3.3 percent for 2018, well above even the government\u2019s own estimates. Consumer spending is picking up. Inflation has dropped to 2 percent, a level once unimaginable for Russia.For years, Russian government officials have argued that the country\u2019s pariah status and Western sanctions were not having much effect.But in a sign of how quickly Russia\u2019s economy has turned around, the country\u2019s economic development minister wound up this week actually trying to tamp down what he described as too-rosy expectations of a strong recovery, such as the one outlined in the forecast by Goldman.\u201cI think that, for now, there\u2019s no basis for such optimism,\u201d the minister, Maksim S. Oreshkin, told reporters at the Gaidar Forum, an annual economic conference in Moscow.To be sure, nobody is predicting a return to the oil boom years, and sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States and other nations have hobbled important state-owned companies and banks.Yet the oil price rise in the first weeks of the year, if it persists, could shift the economic landscape for Russia and outweigh the ill effects of sanctions.In compliance with a law Congress passed last summer, the Treasury Department is expected to release on Jan. 29 a blacklist of Russian businessmen deemed close politically to President Vladimir V. Putin.But the global price of petroleum products like oil and natural gas, which account for about 50 percent of Russia\u2019s exports, has a greater sway over Russia\u2019s economy than sanctions imposed after the Ukraine crisis and meddling in the American election, economists say.\u201cCheap loans are unavailable to most Russian companies,\u201d because of sanctions, Aleksander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut that is a midterm problem. In the short term, the rising oil prices are a factor for growth.\u201dAlso, Russia\u2019s economy grew last year despite a production-cutting agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That deal remains in effect, but rising global oil prices suggest it could be unwound sometime this year, further helping Russia\u2019s economy.In Russia, as in other petroleum-dependent countries, high oil prices have often proved to be a curse. With plenty of money, there is no incentive for the government to spur growth in nonnatural resource sectors, while the strong currency that comes with the influx of petrodollars makes it hard for other Russian industries to compete globally.Historically, periods of low oil prices have been associated with market liberalization in Russia, beginning with the Soviet-era reforms of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the 1980s and continuing with the introduction of a flat tax and other business-friendly measures at the turn of the century.Unfortunately, from a Western perspective, that correlation seems to have broken down lately, with Mr. Putin steadfastly refusing to yield to Western pressures despite the three-year slump in oil prices.Under new rules, the retirement age for men and women was set to rise to 65. That now seems less likely, as the government is predicting a budget surplus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Davos: Not Exactly Best Friends, but Not Enemies Either", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavos MemoDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 When President Trump arrived on Thursday at the conference center where the world\u2019s financial and political elite have been meeting, onlookers crowded a balcony and craned their heads to see the leader who has challenged the very international order that Davos represents. At first, it was quiet. Then someone called out a question.\u201cAre you going to be treated well?\u201d he was asked.\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Mr. Trump replied.The reverse question was unasked but hung in the air: How was he going to treat them?If he was not exactly entering the lion\u2019s den, it was nonetheless a fraught moment for both sides as the America First president ventured into the lair of the we-are-the-world banking titans, corporate magnates and international leaders who have spent decades preaching the virtues of global integration.Rather than confrontation, both sides labored for conciliation, at least to a point. For one afternoon and evening, at least, Mr. Trump threw no protectionist grenades and even broached the possibility, however remote, that he would re-enter a Pacific trade agreement that he scrapped last year, if it were renegotiated. For its part, the Davos crowd welcomed its top critic with a reception and warm words.The mood was strikingly different from a year ago, when Mr. Trump was about to take office and the globalists meeting in this mountaintop getaway reeled in shock, panicked that his campaign promises meant the end of the movement they had nurtured for decades.A year later, many of the business and political elites remain dismissive of him, privately rolling eyes and using words like \u201cmadman,\u201d but there was excitement about economic growth, and the tax cuts and regulatory rollback he has ushered in.\u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s here to be congratulated by the billionaires of Davos or to scold them on behalf of the people who elected him,\u201d said Robert A. Johnson, president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a research institution in New York. \u201cHe will act like he\u2019s doing both.\u201dAsked his message for Davos, Mr. Trump said: \u201cThe real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace, and I think that\u2019s the message. It\u2019s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment, and today has been a very exciting day.\u201dDavos has never encountered anyone quite like Mr. Trump. For one week each year, this ski town is transformed into a festival of deal-making capitalism, international wonkery, late-night parties and earnest save-the-world panel discussions. Heads of state, corporate chieftains, policymakers and celebrities slip and slide along icy streets to stop in glass-enclosed, tech-heavy spaces set up by countries like India and South Africa and companies like Facebook and Google along the Promenade, the main drag.At times, the tensions of the outside world follow them here. The Ukrainians were chagrined to discover this year that the space they rented at Promenade 73 turned out to be right across the street from Russia House at Promenade 72. Grim jokes ensued about the Russians crossing the road to take over a room in Ukraine House.Unlike other visitors, Mr. Trump did not wander the pavilions. He attended a reception in his honor by the forum, and then was host at a dinner for about 15 chief executives from firms like Siemens, Nokia, Nestle, HSBC, Anheuser-Busch and Bayer.As the executives tucked into grilled beef tenderloin or fried Swiss pikeperch with purple carrot pur\u00e9e, Mr. Trump flattered them as \u201csome of the greatest business leaders in the world\u201d and invited them to talk about their businesses, much as he does at cabinet meetings back home. Like his cabinet secretaries, many of the guests volunteered praise of the president and gratitude for his efforts to cut taxes and regulation.The greeting did not surprise everyone. \u201cTrump made a Christmas gift to everyone with those tax rebates,\u201d said Charles-Edouard Bou\u00e9e, chief executive of Roland Berger, a global consultancy with offices in Shanghai and Munich.Even leaders with grievances against the Trump administration seemed intent on playing up to him.An aide to Mr. Trump who arrived before him expressed astonishment that he was being received so warmly by people he had criticized so harshly. But outside the president\u2019s earshot, there was still plenty of skepticism and concern.At a separate dinner on Thursday night, George Soros, the liberal financial trader and philanthropist, called Mr. Trump the vanguard of a new wave of authoritarian rulers that threatens open society.\u201cThe survival of our entire civilization is at stake,\u201d said Mr. Soros, while pointing a finger at \u201cthe rise of leaders like Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.\u201dIn the days before Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival, the leaders of India, Canada, France and Germany used a series of high-profile speeches to mount an aggressive defense of the global trading system, while other officials worried that Mr. Trump and other nationalists posed grave risks.\u201cThe whole world is concerned that the United States is disengaging from the global trade arena,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstrom, trade minister for the European Union. \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned.\u201dBut as he has on immigration in recent days, Mr. Trump toggled between being hard-line and accommodating. In an interview with CNBC to be aired on Friday before his speech, Mr. Trump raised the possibility of rejoining the Pacific partnership, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama but never submitted to Congress amid bipartisan opposition.\u201cI would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe deal was terrible; the way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to be written off by some ill-judged words,\u201d said Nicky Newton-King, chief executive of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. \u201cOur exchange is regarded as world class. We\u2019re completely proud of what we\u2019re able to do in one of these countries the president is so dismissive of.\u201dLynette Wallworth, a virtual reality filmmaker from Australia who has traveled the world to introduce viewers to diverse cultures, expressed hope that Mr. Trump would use his time here to absorb challenging points of view.\u201cHe seems to talk about barriers,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs to listen to the people who are gathered here, who are trying to make an inclusive world.\u201dTolu Oni, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, asked if Mr. Trump was capable of absorbing opinions that conflict with his preconceptions.\u201cI wonder what he will get from this,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that in coming here, there is some degree of learning that national interests are not necessarily in contradiction with being a responsible global citizen.\u201dElisabeth Bumiller, Keith Bradsher and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning to Fool Our Algorithmic Spies", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn a series of studies published in 2012, two psychologists, Ara Norenzayan and Will Gervais, set out to test a simple question: When people think about God, do they feel or act as if they are being monitored? Subjects of varying religiosity were primed to think about God, then asked to complete self-evaluations based on statements like \u201cI am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me\u201d and \u201cNo matter whom I\u2019m talking to, I\u2019m always a good listener.\u201d Results, researchers said, were consistent with what they call the \u201csupernatural-monitoring hypothesis\u201d \u2014 that is, that \u201cthinking of God triggers the same social cognitive processes that are activated by real-time social surveillance.\u201d A sense that you\u2019re being seen \u2014 whether by a fellow human or by a supreme consciousness from which no thought can be withheld \u2014 does seem to change how you see yourself as well as how you behave.Since 2012, online platforms have moved to the center of hundreds of millions more lives, popularizing their particular brands of social surveillance. Services like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are inextricably tied to the experience of being monitored by others, which, if it doesn\u2019t always produce \u201cprosocial\u201d behavior in the broad psychological sense, seems to have encouraged behaviors useful to the platforms themselves \u2014 activity and growth. These businesses serve many different purposes, but the one thing they have in common is that they have figured out new ways to monetize the powerful twin sensations of seeing and being seen by others.But alongside this exhilarating, debilitating, empowering and terrifying human spectacle, these sites have also fostered \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a new but not entirely unfamiliar feeling, that of being watched from above. There is little about the ruthless, marketlike social-media experience that primes you to think about any sort of god. But there are, I\u2019ve noticed, persistent and ever-more-obvious experiences that remind you of another kind of higher power: the automated systems on which these platforms run.Services that used to depend on asking me questions \u2014 What do you like? Whom do you want to follow? \u2014 have started making more assumptions based on my behavior. I\u2019m reminded that my actions are being recorded and factored into my experience when I am greeted on Twitter by a series of recommendations derived, apparently, from things I\u2019ve liked, looked at or reposted. I\u2019m implicitly prompted to think about algorithmic surveillance when, the day after I wasted a few minutes scrolling through a cycling publication\u2019s account, my Instagram app floods my Explore tab with photos of mountain bikes. Weeks after tapping an unfamiliar name on Facebook and scrolling through the recent posts \u2014 a postmarriage surname change, a new profile photo \u2014 this person, a former acquaintance I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, is given the same feed placement as current close friends.These experiences manifest beyond social networks as well. Searches for holiday gifts haunt web browsing, as Amazon \u201cretargeting\u201d ads place the products I looked at, briefly \u2014 a thermos, headphones, binoculars \u2014 next to, above and in the middle of news articles. They find their way back over the walls too, placing reminders of my recorded behavior in my Instagram feed \u2014 ads that say, \u201cWe\u2019d like you to buy running gear,\u201d not quite so loudly as they say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got eyes everywhere.\u201dOf course, this is the deal we have entered into with such services: our data for their products. That this surveillance is happening is obvious, even if the ways we\u2019re reminded of it can still be jarring. Spotify, the music-streaming service, recently began an ad campaign that mined and cheekily broadcast actual individual listening habits: \u201cDear person who played \u2018Sorry\u2019 42 times on Valentine\u2019s Day: What did you do?\u201d; \u201cTo the person in NoLIta who started listening to holiday music way back in June: You really jingle all the way, huh?\u201d The company was boldly showing off its intimate knowledge of current users in an effort to gain new ones \u2014 a harmlessly creepy example of a strategy that could easily backfire.For example, I thought better of searching for a friend with whom I had lost touch, knowing that his posts would then climb the ladder of my Facebook feed, turning a flash of guilt into a persistent reminder of my failure. For work, I sometimes need to watch videos made by a range of toxic, hateful or just unappealing vloggers, and I found that I\u2019d avoid watching them on my phone, waiting instead until I could get to my laptop, where I could more quickly and totally log out, go incognito and avoid filling my future YouTube recommendations with bile. During the holidays, I shopped in anonymous tabs, assuming that gifts could be revealed during an idle Instagram scroll on the couch.As with performing on social media for friends, family or co-workers \u2014 posting your best pictures, documenting your most exciting activities or professionally marketing yourself \u2014 these individually tiny elisions weren\u2019t entirely honest. But unlike these social displays, they were first and foremost intentionally deceptive, and they were rooted in antagonism.Believers in an omniscient God tend to assume that nothing can truly be hidden, including doubt. Pascal\u2019s Wager, for example, which supposes that believing in God is simply a safer bet against even vanishingly narrow odds of eternal damnation, leans on a potentially fatal premise: Surely any conceivable God would know you\u2019re just making a bet? But we ascribe no such powers to algorithms. Machine surveillance can be fooled in small ways and big ones: by the creation of blacked-out spaces, the introduction of strategically tainted data and the performance of a particular version of the self.Social platforms also expect faith from their users: that data will be used responsibly, that at least some forms of privacy among people will be respected. But the flashing reminders of the automatic surveillance on which they are increasingly built can undermine those expectations and remind us instead of our ability to withdraw. Residents in neighborhoods that have been flooded by drivers following directions from Waze \u2014 which is owned by Google and supplies data to for Google Maps \u2014 have resorted to filing false accident reports to divert drivers. Waze has sought to curb these reports, but in so doing, it has come across less as omniscient than unthinking and defensive \u2014 and above all, corporate. Knowing that our maps were watching us produced individual acts of defiance that amounted to collective acts of resistance.Increased awareness of automated surveillance, in other words, is most effective at demystifying the systems doing the watching, not reifying their wisdom and authority. It clarifies our relationships with them: each recommendation or subtle change reminds us not only that we\u2019re being watched, but also that we\u2019ve consented to it. And such awareness will also be a necessity should one or all of these platforms \u2014 through more brazen exploitation, calamitous hacking or even greater sharing with governments \u2014 cause us to well and truly lose faith. They may aspire to divine levels of omniscience, but they risk driving away their followers in the process.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

There was no amoral approach to science, Mr. Lehrer reminded us. Seeing science and the tools and connections it provides as a good in itself is profoundly dangerous and wrong.Founded by young computer engineers, Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley companies have been happy to view their powerful inventions as neutral platforms. Once the posts are up, who cares where they come down? These companies have converted an engineer\u2019s disregard for real-world outcomes into a libertarian ideology that belittles the harms that stem from their platforms and rejects rules and regulations meant to prevent those harms.The public faces the unsatisfying question: Is it better to suffer an engineer\u2019s neglect or an engineer\u2019s concern?Since Facebook\u2019s earliest days, Mr. Zuckerberg has been fascinated by the power to understand and manipulate users by applying algorithms to the data it collects. In 2005, speaking at Stanford, he described how he and a friend were \u201cseeing if we could use the information that we had to compute who we thought were going to be in relationships. So, we tested this about a week later, and we realized that we had over a third chance of predicting whether two people were going to be in a relationship a week from now.\u201d Through this deep knowledge of its users, Mr. Zuckerberg explained, Facebook could determine \u201cwhat actually matters to each person on a more granular level.\u201d\u201cWhen people spend a lot of time passively consuming information \u2014 reading but not interacting with people \u2014 they report feeling worse afterward,\u201d the company said. By contrast, \u201cactively interacting with people \u2014 especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions \u2014 is linked to improvements in well-being.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg says Facebook will be steering users to healthier interactions. \u201cI expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,\u201d he wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cBut I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable. And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.\u201dThe other was \u201cpromoting equality,\u201d which they defined as \u201cmaking sure everyone has access to these opportunities \u2014 regardless of the nation, families or circumstances they are born into.\u201d Often, \u201caccess\u201d appears to mean relying on the internet to provide an education or work opportunity. Connecting people is what keeps society churning, improving. \u201cFor every 10 people who gain internet access, about one person is lifted out of poverty and about one new job is created,\u201d they wrote.Turns out, an enlightened, socially engaged Facebook has a similar outlook as the amoral, audience-seeking Facebook.

Mrs. Netanyahu had become angry after the 44-word item mentioned her obligation, as the prime minister\u2019s wife, to perform public service \u2014 but did not cite her education credentials to her satisfaction.\u201cI\u2019m an educated woman!\u201d she can be heard shouting at the publicist. \u201cPsychologist!

{"Headline": "Nations Seek the Elusive Cure for Cyberattacks", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the \u201cWannacry\u201d ransomware attack spread across Britain, Japan Russia, Taiwan and places in between last May, it took only a few days for private firms that looked at the code to come to some pretty quick conclusions. The attack almost certainly came from North Korea. The North Koreans almost certainly used computer code that had leaked from the inner sanctum of the National Security Agency. And the ransomware part was a scam: If you paid off the hackers, your data still wasn\u2019t restored.Yet it took until October for the British government to identify North Korea as the culprit in an attack that paralyzed its health care system for a few days, and until mid-December for the Trump administration, in a presentation at the White House, to reach that same conclusion.So what was the penalty for the government in Pyongyang for unleashing a devastating cyberattack? There was none. Nothing. Not even the kind of weak economic sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on the North three years before for its attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.\u201cPresident Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said when he made the \u201cname and shame\u201d announcement blaming the North. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure.\u201dSecuring the world against cyberattacks \u2014 from nations, criminal groups, vandals and teenagers \u2014 will be on the agenda when many of the world\u2019s top leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. As usual, there is a flurry of reports, and entrepreneurs will declare they have technological solutions at hand. But the fact remains that the major powers of the world have been unable to come up with a viable means of deterring the most damaging attacks. It still takes too long to formally identify the culprits, and the responses, as Mr. Bossert indicated, are insufficient.Efforts to establish \u201cnorms of behavior\u201d got a promising start, but are now falling apart. No one can even agree on when an act of aggression in cyberspace amounts to an act of war. The Pentagon, in its first nuclear strategy review since President Trump took office, is even proposing to use the threat of unleashing nuclear weapons against a country or group that delivered a devastating cyberattack against the critical infrastructure of the United States or its allies. But that doesn\u2019t help with the problem of everyday attacks.The most talented state sponsors of attacks \u2014 mostly Russia, China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 have carefully calibrated their operations in cyberspace to achieve their strategic aims while avoiding a real shooting war. So far they have succeeded. While there have been indictments of Iranian and Chinese hackers in major strikes on the United States, they have never seen the inside of an American courtroom.North Korea has been a case study in how a nation learns to make use of its cyberweapons for disruption, revenge or profit, without fear of serious retaliation. It has learned how to station hackers around the world \u2014 in China, Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere \u2014 and has gotten away with bolder and bolder attacks, from Wannacry to its raid on Bangladesh\u2019s central bank, which nearly resulted in the theft of a billion dollars. (The transfers were halted after $81 million had passed through the Swift system, the international clearinghouse for transactions, after someone at the New York Fed discovered a spelling error \u2014 the word \u201cfandation\u201d for \u201cfoundation\u201d \u2014 and stopped the heist. )As James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it recently, \u201cNorth Korea is both cautious and cunning in its use of force, including cyberattack.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe North has been successful only against poorly protected targets, of which there are many, suggesting that there is a relatively low ceiling for its cyberattack capabilities.\u201dIn fact, the explosion of state-sponsored, sophisticated cyberattacks over the past seven or eight years has been fueled, in large part, by the expansion of poorly protected targets. Yes, banks and major utilities have, for the large part, tightened their defenses, and tens of billions of dollars have been made by companies promising all kinds of cyber protections, from the most basic programs loaded on your laptop to sophisticated systems designed to anticipate future action, or watch for variations in the normal behavior of users.But none of that has prevented cyberspace from becoming what President Barack Obama termed the \u201cWild, Wild West,\u201d a territory of anarchy, where adversaries take free shots at one another. In the past five years, these attacks have become the cheapest way for nations to undercut one another in the name of bigger strategic goals.Yet the world has been unable to decide what constitutes fair game, and what should be off limits. For years officials talked about their fear of a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a devastating strike against the power grid that would turn out the lights from Boston to Washington, or London to Rome. That has not happened, save for limited strikes in Ukraine, widely attributed to Russian hackers, that seemed intended to send a message that they could attack critical infrastructure at any time. Countries have sensed what would happen if they went too far.Instead, cyberattacks have taken a far more subtle turn. The Russian-led attacks on the 2016 American election \u2014 and similar efforts in France and Germany last year \u2014 are prime examples. While United Nations experts had been struggling to come up with \u201cnorms of behavior\u201d in cyberspace, a consensus about what was off-limits \u2014 like attacks on power grids or safety systems, for example \u2014 few were thinking about the use of the technology to influence elections.In fact, the election systems in the United States \u2014 the foundation of American democracy \u2014 were never on the list of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d until Mr. Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, added them in the last days of the administration. By then it was too late.Infrastructure is only part of the problem. The evidence that has poured out of the United States after more than a year of congressional investigations has left no doubt that Russian hackers \u2014 working largely on behalf of two of Moscow\u2019s spy services, the SVR and the GRU \u2014 did far more than use cyber tools to break into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of key players in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.The sophisticated use of \u201cbots\u201d to target key demographic groups with Twitter messages, Facebook ads and just ordinary-looking social media exchanges made it clear that we have entered a new world, in which states marry some of the oldest propaganda techniques with the newest ways to disseminate a divisive message.Yet thinking about how to regulate that kind of activity is tying the West in knots. President Emmanuel Macron in France is proposing that government authorities be able to take down \u201cfake news\u201d during elections, declaring in his New Year\u2019s speech that \u201cif we want to protect liberal democracies, we must be strong and have clear rules.\u201dYet those rules clearly could not survive in the United States, where First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from stepping in and declaring what is fake and what is not.President Trump\u2019s own declarations about what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 including articles about the Russian election activity \u2014 underscore the dangers of putting that power into government hands.There are other complications. After the election hacks in the United States, many called for \u201creal identities\u201d on the internet, so the world would know exactly who is tweeting or posting. Sensible as it may sound, it would also be a boon to the Russians, the Chinese and any authoritarian government looking to crack down on dissent. In short, the best way to solve the problem of election meddling and anonymous attacks would be a dictator\u2019s dream.There have been a few successes in setting norms of behavior, particularly when it comes to banning child pornography or cracking down on intellectual property theft. But those are the easiest issues on which to agree.The United States, for example, would never support rules that banned espionage. And what about rules prohibiting the placement of \u201cimplants\u201d in foreign computer networks, so that in the future they could monitor activity or plant malware to bring a network down?American and European officials raise the alarm whenever they find such implants in their electrical grids. But they also quietly place them in hundreds of thousands of foreign networks. That is how Presidents Bush and Obama got inside Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment site at Natanz, with the Stuxnet code.It is a power that the United States and its allies, have no intention of giving up.David E.

{"Headline": "Facebook Overhauls News Feed to Focus on What Friends and Family Share", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often, saying on Thursday that it would prioritize what their friends and family share and comment on while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands.The shift is the most significant overhaul in years to Facebook\u2019s News Feed, the cascading screen of content that people see when they log into the social network. Over the next few weeks, users will begin seeing fewer viral videos and news articles shared by media companies. Instead, Facebook will highlight posts that friends have interacted with \u2014 for example, a photo of your dog or a status update that many of them have commented on or liked.The changes are intended to maximize the amount of content with \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d that people consume on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. Facebook, he said, had closely studied what kinds of posts had stressed or harmed users. The social network wants to reduce what Mr. Zuckerberg called \u201cpassive content\u201d \u2014 videos and articles that ask little more of the viewer than to sit back and watch or read \u2014 so that users\u2019 time on the site was well spent.\u201cWe want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe need to refocus the system.\u201dThursday\u2019s changes raise questions of whether people may end up seeing more content that reinforces their own ideologies if they end up frequently interacting with posts and videos that reflect the similar views of their friends or family. And bogus news may still spread \u2014 if a relative or friend posts a link with an inaccurate news article that is widely commented on, that post will be prominently displayed.The goal of the overhaul, ultimately, is for something less quantifiable that may be difficult to achieve: Facebook wants people to feel positive, rather than negative, after visiting.\u201cWhen people are engaging with people they\u2019re close to, it\u2019s more meaningful, more fulfilling,\u201d said David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s good for your well-being.\u201dThe repercussions from Facebook\u2019s new News Feed changes will almost certainly be far-reaching. Publishers, nonprofits, small business and many other groups rely on the social network to reach people, so de-emphasizing their posts will most likely hurt them. Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, who is responsible for running the News Feed, acknowledged that \u201cthere will be anxiety\u201d from partners and publishers who often complain about the constant changes in what will be shown across the network.The change may also work against Facebook\u2019s immediate business interests. The company has long pushed users to spend more time on the social network. With different, less viral types of content surfacing more often, people could end up spending their time elsewhere. Mr. Zuckerberg said that was in fact Facebook\u2019s expectation, but that if people end up feeling better about using the social network, the business will ultimately benefit.Facebook has conducted research and worked with outside academics for months to examine the effects that its service has on people. The work was spurred by criticism from politicians, academics, the media and others that Facebook had not adequately considered its responsibility for what it shows its users.On Thursday, he said many of the discussions about Facebook\u2019s responsibilities had prompted the company \u201cto get a better handle on some of the negative things that could happen in the system.\u201d\u201cJust because a tool can be used for good and bad, that doesn\u2019t make the tool bad \u2014 it just means you need to understand what the negative is so that you can mitigate it,\u201d he said.Facebook and other researchers have particularly homed in on passive content. In surveys of Facebook users, people said they felt the site had shifted too far away from friends and family-related content, especially amid a swell of outside posts from brands, publishers and media companies.\u201cThis big wave of public content has really made us reflect: What are we really here to do?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cIf what we\u2019re here to do is help people build relationships, then we need to adjust.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he was now focusing his company around the new approach. Product managers are being asked to \u201cfacilitate the most meaningful interactions between people,\u201d rather than the previous mandate of helping people find the most meaningful content, he said.Mr. Zuckerberg added that his way of running Facebook has shifted since the birth of his two daughters, Maxima and August, in recent years. He said he had rethought the way he views his and Facebook\u2019s legacy, even if it will cost the company in the short term.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brown Ales May Be Unfashionable, but the Style Is Timeless", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeers of The TimesIt turns out that in beer-drinking circles I would be considered unfashionable.I don\u2019t care much about fashion, either. But I do care about the beer I drink, which apparently would be considered hopelessly uninteresting by those who follow the latest trends.I\u2019m talking about wonderful, thirst-quenching, conversation-inducing beers, the type that you can drink a lot of almost without noticing. Brown ale, for example. Recently, the beer panel tasted 20 examples of American brown ale, which is something of an afterthought in a beer culture awash in more au courant styles.I cannot say I share the taste for these I.P.A.s, which, with their emphasis on the imperious flavors of American hops, are the equivalent of oaky California chardonnays of the 1990s.Brown ales and like-minded styles \u2014 including straightforward lagers, pilsners and porters \u2014 to name a few, are very different sorts of beers. They occupy subtler realms, quenching thirst with pure flavors and perhaps a snappy zestiness in the case of pilsner and a rich depth in the case of porter. They are not flamboyant styles that wow with complexity or make themselves the centers of attention. They simply satisfy.\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of beer that gets left behind in our I.P.A. culture,\u201d Orr said.Clay had a more charitable explanation. \u201cIn the \u201990s, everybody made brown ales or porters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense that a new generation would want to do something different.\u201dIn the 1970s and \u201980s, early craft brewers were motivated by what seemed lost. Back then, American beer culture was dominated by the insipid lagers of the big brewers. Dozens of classic styles, developed over centuries of brewing, had largely been abandoned. Porters, amber ales, India pale ales, brown ales \u2014 English styles mostly \u2014 had been read about more than tasted.Our favorites in the tasting all leaned toward the textbook style: malty, with flavors of chocolate, coffee or, sometimes, dried fruit. Mostly these brown ales were dry and nutty, although sometimes they left an impression of sweetness \u2014 Clay found that some had a surprising flavor of strawberry candy.Other similar efforts were so dominated by hops that we had no clue to the style of the beer in the glass.Now, I should point out that beer tastings, particularly with styles like brown ale, have gotten complicated for us. For these blind tastings, we include only beers that we have purchased from retail outlets.We all found the tasting stimulating, even if the style supposedly does not inspire much excitement among beer nerds. Well-made, subtly delicious and refreshing are high accolades, as far as I am concerned, and brown ale fits that bill. Fortunately, many brewers still seem to feel the same way.Dry, creamy and well balanced with lingering flavors of malt, chocolate and dried fruits.Relaxed and pure with flavors of grain, coffee and chocolate.Balanced, subtle and easy to drink, with flavors of coffee and chocolate.Slightly tart, with flavors of coffee and tobacco, and a bitterness that lingers pleasantly.Full-bodied and rich, with flavors of chocolate and malt, well-integrated hop bitterness and a touch of heat.Rich, creamy aromas, with flavors of chocolate, toffee and grain.Rich and thickly textured, with smoky flavors of chocolate and grain.Well balanced, with flavors of malt, cola and dried fruits.Strong and full-bodied, with flavors of malt, dried fruits and sourdough bread.Not quite sweet, but on the edge, with flavors of buttercrunch, spice cake and hazelnuts.cookingAdvertisement"}

It is now India\u2019s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians\u2019 financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.\u201cOur truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,\u201d he said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm\u2019s plans.The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.Mr. Singh\u2019s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm\u2019s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.\u201cWe really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,\u201d said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.Still, the country\u2019s cash economy has endured.Only one-third of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.\u201cPeople feel scared to use these apps,\u201d Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce \u2014 and collect more taxes.Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.\u201cWe have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,\u201d said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. \u201cThat\u2019s our daily job.\u201dThe job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm\u2019s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. \u201cPeople like to spend money on more than just needs,\u201d he said.Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm\u2019s progress because it\u2019s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company\u2019s chief executive, grew up nearby.On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.The problem? Paytm\u2019s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.\u201cThe only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a culturally different country being built.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed research from Mumbai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Difficulties With Facebook\u2019s News Feed Overhaul", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtImagine you\u2019re a cookie mogul. You figured out a way to make lots of money by giving away delicious cookies for free, and in less than a decade, you created a global cookie behemoth.But recently your cookie kingdom has begun to crumble. Scientists are worried that people are eating so many of your cookies that they\u2019re making themselves sick \u2014 yet they keep eating more, because who can say no to free cookies? There are concerns that your cookies are crowding out the market for normal food; after your success, fruit and vegetable companies have pivoted to free cookies, and now much of the global food supply is just cookies. Rising cookie addiction might even have helped a foreign government influence your country\u2019s election.So you decide to do something. You convene your best bakers, and you tell them, look, from now on, we don\u2019t just care about how many free cookies we can shove into people\u2019s gullets. We want to take a holistic look at the overall cookie experience. We want people to eat some cookies, sure, but we don\u2019t want them to eat too many, so we will have to make our free cookies less addictive and more \u201cmeaningful.\u201d Let\u2019s maybe put carrots and kale and broccoli in the cookies.What sort of cookie company wants people to eat fewer cookies?One named Facebook, apparently.The effort sounds helpful, even noble, given that Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged the change could be bad for business in the short run. But if you think about Facebook\u2019s primary service as free cookies rather than social networking, the underlying difficulties with the plan become obvious, and even existential.Do people really want a more \u201cmeaningful\u201d Facebook any more than they want healthy cookies? Didn\u2019t we get hooked on Facebook for its easy outrages in the first place \u2014 for the sugar, not for the broccoli? And if Facebook\u2019s underlying business model is based on how much time we all spend eating there, can the company ever truly resist the pressure to keep plying us with more cookies?These questions don\u2019t mean that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s new plan will fail. But if he really does want to make the time we spend on Facebook count as \u201ctime well spent,\u201d I suspect Facebook will have to change much more radically than it is now letting on. It can\u2019t just become a slightly healthier cookie company; it may have to get out of the sugar business altogether. And what, then, happens to all those billions in future profits? (On Friday, the stock market seemed to harbor the same worry; Facebook\u2019s stock fell 4.5 percent.)But a study that Facebook\u2019s scientists conducted with outside researchers found that deeper sharing on the network \u2014 \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions,\u201d per the blog post \u2014 improves a person\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s this sort of activity that Facebook is trying to encourage with the new design. Think of it as the kale cookie of Facebook.Facebook is conceding that when the good kind of social networking is given priority over the bad kind, people are likely to spend less time on the service. What\u2019s unclear is how much less time. According to data collected by Nielsen and crunched by Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, American adults spent about 37 minutes a day on Facebook in September. What if it turns out that if we\u2019re going to spend only worthwhile time on Facebook, we need only 10 or 15 minutes there a day?It\u2019s likely that Facebook has a very good idea of how its changes will affect engagement; the company is obsessive about running experiments and modeling its changes using data, and it probably would not have pushed this change if the numbers were catastrophic.But its modeling is most likely only a guide to the short term. What Facebook can\u2019t predict is how the outside world might react \u2014 how users, advertisers, investors and competitors will alter their behavior in the face of a less immediately engaging News Feed.Mr. Zuckerberg is a famously fierce and ruthless competitor. If it looks like Facebook\u2019s business is starting to suffer because of the healthier News Feed, and if some competitor comes along to offer us all the free cookies that Facebook is denying us, I doubt Mr. Zuckerberg will be able to stick to his guns.People started creating Facebook groups promising to boycott Facebook, and within days those groups quickly grew to hundreds of thousands of members \u2014 the biggest groups that had ever formed on Facebook. Which, oddly, backfired. To the News Feed\u2019s creators, the protests only served to prove the News Feed\u2019s utility; it was only thanks to the viral power of the News Feed that people were able to mobilize against News Feed.All these years later, the story also suggests how hard it will be to alter the purpose of the feed. The News Feed\u2019s killer app has always been easy, viral outrage. It\u2019s always been just clicking Like on something you\u2019re kinda, sorta passionate about, then forgetting about it.It\u2019s always been cookies, not broccoli. It\u2019s hard to see how that changes now.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle.

Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown?

{"Headline": "One Year After Women\u2019s March, More Activism but Less Unity", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "Women\u2019s March Inc., which organized the event in Washington, has encouraged more protests. But a new group is focused on winning elections, especially in red states.Supported byAmber Selman-Lynn wanted to help plan a women\u2019s march in Mobile, Ala., this month to mark the first anniversary of last year\u2019s huge protests across the country. The day had been significant for her.With no experience in political activism, she had helped organize a bus full of women to go from Mobile to Washington. After they came back from the euphoric trip, they formed a group called Mobile Marchers that met monthly. They spoke up for the Affordable Care Act at town-hall-style meetings, and knocked on doors for the Alabama Senate candidate Doug Jones, the Democrat who beat Roy S. Moore in a stunning victory last month.But when Ms. Selman-Lynn tried to register her anniversary event on the website for Women\u2019s March Inc., the high-profile group formed by the organizers of last year\u2019s event in Washington, she received an unusual letter. It said that while the group was \u201csupportive of any efforts to build our collective power as women,\u201d it asked that she \u201cnot advertise your event as a \u2018Women\u2019s March\u2019 action.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of silly,\u201d Ms. Selman-Lynn said. \u201cWe are clearly the women\u2019s march in Mobile.\u201dThe Women\u2019s March a year ago aimed to start a movement of women from all walks of life who would continue their activism long after they had gone home.In many ways, that goal has been realized. In the wake of the march on Washington \u2014 and simultaneous marches in more than 600 towns and cities across the country \u2014 thousands of women threw themselves into activism for the first time in their lives, especially in red states where the events provided a rare chance to build a network of like-minded people.But as the movement evolves, differing priorities and tactics have emerged among the women, nearly all of them unpaid and spread across the country. Now, on the eve of the anniversary, a rift is emerging between two groups: Women\u2019s March Inc., which organized the march on Washington and spent much of the year creating more social justice protests, and another organization of activists who planned sister marches last year and believe that winning elections, particularly in red states, should be the primary goal. The split has raised questions about who can claim the mantle of the Women\u2019s March \u2014 and the funding and press attention that goes with it.\u201cWe can march and take to the streets and yell about all the stuff we want to change, but unless we\u2019re getting people elected to office who are going to make those changes, we\u2019re not really doing anything,\u201d said Lindsey Kanaly, who organized the women\u2019s march in Oklahoma City and is now a March On board member.The group is now focused on helping liberal women in Republican-led districts organize ahead of the pivotal midterm elections this year.Mindful of the optics of dividing the movement, March On founders describe the organization as a complement, not a competitor, to Women\u2019s March Inc. Both groups have refrained from criticizing the other in public. But behind the scenes, there has been some frustration.Winnie Wong, a Women\u2019s March Inc. volunteer and adviser, wrote recently in a public Facebook post that March On \u201cseems like an ill-conceived attempt at organized co-option.\u201d\u201cSomebody got to tell the truth!\u201d replied Tamika Mallory, a co-president of Women\u2019s March Inc.Bob Bland, also a co-president, said the new group was \u201cwelcome in the resistance.\u201d But she noted that its creation had led to \u201ca lot of confusion\u201d among activists on the ground who did not realize that it was a separate entity.\u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important for new groups coming into this movement, like March On, to make sure they have distinct branding and messaging that is specific to them and their group that doesn\u2019t appear as if it is directly Women\u2019s March related,\u201d Ms. Bland said.Ms. Selman-Lynn in Mobile had been unaware of the difference between the two groups and organized her event using online tools from March On. To satisfy Women\u2019s March Inc., she reprinted her banner to remove March On\u2019s slogan, \u201cMarch On the Polls.\u201dIt was a minor inconvenience, she said. But she hopes the two groups will work together in the future.\u201cThe Women\u2019s March is really iconic and of course we want to be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut March On has a great tool kit. Most of us have never done this before. We need all the guidance we can get.\u201dThe dispute over branding gives a glimpse of how much has changed since ad hoc committees of volunteers put together the marches in the weeks after President Trump\u2019s election.The marches grew out of a Facebook post by a woman in Hawaii who floated the idea, attracting widespread interest. A core group of organizers in New York City planned the march on Washington, while hundreds of other women organized similar marches in their own communities.The organizers of the march in Washington made a point of picking leaders from communities who have historically been ignored by mainstream feminist groups. Of the four national co-chairwomen of the Washington march, three were minorities. But the group\u2019s leadership had very little geographic diversity. Nearly all of the board members of Women\u2019s March Inc. are from New York City.After the march, Women\u2019s March Inc. used its powerful platform to advance social justice causes, urging marchers to hold conversations about racial injustice, protest the deportation of undocumented immigrants, attend vigils for Syria and participate in a national strike called A Day Without Women. Women\u2019s March Inc. activists said they saw social justice protests as crucial to forming effective and diverse coalitions.Yet many of their protests failed to catch on in red states.\u201cWhat they are doing is great, but it\u2019s difficult to tap into here,\u201d said Kelly Smith, a librarian from Berea, Ky., who organized buses from Kentucky to Washington for the march last year. A general strike could not work in Kentucky, a state where many women depend on hourly wages and do not have union protections, she said.Women \u201cwould have come back to work the next day and had no job,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t be on board with that.\u201dKentuckians have other urgent priorities, like saving the pensions of public-school teachers that were cut by a conservative governor, she said.In Texas, Melissa Fiero, who helped organize a march of 100,000 people in Austin, said her group had not participated in any of the protests urged by Women\u2019s March Inc. Instead, it has focused on promoting Democrats for local office.\u201cThe needs are different from Texas to New York,\u201d said Ms. Fiero, who lives in the rural community of Oatmeal. \u201cA woman\u2019s right to choose is constantly under assault in Texas.\u201dBoth Ms. Kelly and Ms. Fiero have chosen to affiliate with March On.The goal of March On is to take a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach that can draw women in rural places, said Jaquie Algee, who helped plan the Women\u2019s March in Chicago and now serves as the board chairwoman of March On.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that women in red states who need the most support are in positions of leadership,\u201d said Ms. Algee, who is also an organizer in Kansas, Indiana and Missouri for the Service Employees International Union. Ms. Algee, who is black, said that March On also \u201cstrives continually\u201d for racial diversity in its leadership. Four out of 13 board members are minorities.Ms. Bland disputes claims that Women\u2019s March Inc. has had difficulty in conservative areas. \u201cRed states are where there\u2019s actually the most activity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to facilitate the vision of the actual state organizers and the grass-roots groups that are doing the work.\u201dMarch On\u2019s founders say the group grew out of weekly conference calls held by the organizers of sister marches as they swapped tips on applying for permits, finding sponsors and obtaining event insurance. After the marches, they met for the first time at a retreat and decided to form a new organization that would focus on giving organizers tools to help win elections.Women\u2019s March Inc. has struggled to bring the decentralized women\u2019s march movement under its umbrella.Canadian activists who held marches in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March on Washington were outraged when American activists with Women\u2019s March Inc. in New York registered the name Women\u2019s March Canada and appointed a board without consulting them.\u201cWe believe our network has shown itself to be excellent custodians of the Women\u2019s March spirit and ethos, and respectfully request the time and space to prepare a plan to move ahead in unity and solidarity,\u201d they wrote in an open letter to national co-chairwomen of the Women\u2019s March on Washington.After they did not get a response, they renamed themselves March On Canada and created the Twitter hashtag #DontTradeMarkTheMovement. They are now affiliated with, but not controlled by, March On.Jo Reger, professor of sociology at Oakland University in Michigan, says the feminist movement, like other important social movements, has always had people coming together and then breaking apart.\u201cWe think it looks so chaotic and full of factions and what it really looks like is every other social movement,\u201d Dr. Reger said. \u201cOften those factions end up coming back together later on.\u201dSo far, the split between Women\u2019s March and March On has not dampened the enthusiasm for marking the anniversary. Many activists in the field said they were unaware of the division. Those who are say they seek resources from both organizations: Women\u2019s March Inc. provides a unifying vision and a national spotlight, while March On gives on-the-ground support, such as legal advice on applying for nonprofit status.Many women say the marches last year unleashed a new era of activism and a level of energy that shows no sign of flagging. Ms. Selman-Lynn said she simply wanted all the help she could get to win more elections for Democrats in Alabama.\u201cWe have a lot of work to do, convincing people that there\u2019s a grass-roots group with a lot of energy who is willing to work,\u201d said Ms. Selman-Lynn. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of ground to gain here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an incorrect figure from March On for the number of minority women on the organization\u2019s board. There are four, not three.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a sociology professor at Oakland University. She is Jo Reger, not Roger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fake News\u2019: Wide Reach but Little Impact, Study Suggests", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindFake news evolved from seedy internet sideshow to serious electoral threat so quickly that behavioral scientists had little time to answer basic questions about it, like who was reading what, how much real news they also consumed and whether targeted fact-checking efforts ever hit a target.Sure, surveys abound, asking people what they remember reading. But these are only as precise as the respondents\u2019 shifty recollections and subject to a malleable definition of \u201cfake.\u201d The term \u201cfake news\u201d itself has evolved into an all-purpose smear, used by politicians and the president to deride journalism they don\u2019t like.The reach of fake news was wide indeed, the study found, yet also shallow. One in four Americans saw at least one false story, but even the most eager fake-news readers \u2014 deeply conservative supporters of President Trump \u2014 consumed far more of the real kind, from newspaper and network websites and other digital sources.While the research can\u2019t settle the question of whether misinformation was pivotal in the 2016 election, the findings give the public and researchers the first solid guide to asking how its influence may have played out. That question will become increasingly important as online giants like Facebook and Google turn to shielding their users from influence by Russian operatives and other online malefactors.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the effect of fake news and a lot of numbers thrown around out of context, which get people exercised,\u201d said Duncan Watts, a research scientist at Microsoft who has argued that misinformation had a negligible effect on the election results. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about this paper is that it focuses on the actual consumers themselves.\u201dIn the new study, a trio of political scientists \u2014 Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College (a regular contributor to The Times\u2019s Upshot), Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter \u2014 analyzed web traffic data gathered from a representative sample of 2,525 Americans who consented to have their online activity monitored anonymously by the survey and analytic firm YouGov.The data included website visits made in the weeks before and after the 2016 election, and a measure of political partisanship based on overall browsing habits. (The vast majority of participants favored Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.)The online behavior of the participants was expected in some ways, but surprising in others. Consumption broke down along partisan lines: the most conservative 10 percent of the sample accounted for about 65 percent of visits to fake news sites.Pro-Trump users were about three times more likely to visit fake news sites supporting their candidate than Clinton partisans were to visit bogus sites promoting her.Still, false stories were a small fraction of the participants\u2019 overall news diet, regardless of political preference: just 1 percent among Clinton supporters, and 6 percent among those pulling for Mr. Trump. Even conservative partisans viewed just five fake news articles, on average, over more than five weeks.There was no way to determine from the data how much, or whether, people believed what they saw on these sites. But many of these were patently absurd, like one accusing Mrs. Clinton of a \u201cSudden Move of $1.8 Billion to Qatar Central Bank,\u201d or a piece headlined \u201cVideo Showing Bill Clinton With a 13-Year-Old Plunges Race Into Chaos.\u201d\u201cFor all the hype about fake news, it\u2019s important to recognize that it reached only a subset of Americans, and most of the ones it was reaching already were intense partisans,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said.\u201cThey were also voracious consumers of hard news,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are people intensely engaged in politics who follow it closely.\u201dGiven the ratio of truth to fiction, Dr. Watts said, fake news paled in influence beside mainstream news coverage, particularly stories about Mrs. Clinton and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Coverage of that topic appeared repeatedly and prominently in venues like The New York Times and the Washington Post.The new study does not rule out the possibility that fake news affected the elections, said David Rand, an associate professor of psychology, economics and management at Yale University.Americans over age 60 were much more likely to visit a fake news site than younger people, the new study found. Perhaps confusingly, moderately left-leaning people viewed more pro-Trump fake news than they did pro-Clinton fake news.One interpretation of that finding, Dr. Rand said, may be that older, less educated voters who switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 were particularly susceptible to fake news.\u201cYou can see where this might have had an impact in some of those close swing states, like Wisconsin,\u201d Dr. Rand said. \u201cBut this of course is a matter of conjecture, reasoning backward from the findings.\u201dThe study found that Facebook was by far the platform through which people most often navigated to a fake news site. Last year, in response to criticism, the company began flagging stories on its site that third-party fact-checkers found to make false claims with a red label saying \u201cdisputed.\u201dMost people in the new study encountered at least some of these labels, but \u201cwe saw no instances of people reading a fake news article and a fact-check of that specific article,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said. \u201cThe fact-checking websites have a targeting problem.\u201dIn December, Facebook announced a change to its monitoring approach. Instead of labeling false stories, Facebook will surface the fact-checks along with the fake story in the user\u2019s news feed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crowdsourcing the Commute", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTalk to Leigh Weaver, who commutes by bus from Livingston, N.J., to Midtown Manhattan, about what getting to work used to be like, and you\u2019ll hear the all-too-familiar grievances about grinding traffic, suffocating crowds and cranky drivers.\u201cI was willing to do whatever I had to do to make this happen,\u201d said Ms. Weaver, 43, a senior program manager for Google.OurBus, which started in May 2016 with a route from Kendall Park, N.J., near Princeton, to Midtown, is one of a handful of tech companies aiming to ease commuter stress by crowdsourcing rides and then developing apps that offer the routes in demand. Using available vehicles from existing charter bus services, it currently offers two routes from New Jersey to Midtown, and has plans to start a third one from Monroe later this year.Once a route has been established, riders purchase tickets through an app, guaranteeing them a seat \u2014 so no more standing in the aisle, squeezed against other passengers. Vehicles come equipped with Wi-Fi. OurBus and Boxcar buses have bathrooms onboard and charging outlets next to the seats. And riders using Chariot and OurBus can track the progress of their vehicles on their phones.\u201cIt seems so much more convenient for people to go to their phone and to be able to see when the bus is coming and then to be able to get on the bus and know that it\u2019s a new bus and somebody is taking care of it,\u201d said Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group for innovative approaches to transportation in the New York region. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be so crazy. Public transit shouldn\u2019t be miserable.\u201dEstablishing a new commuter bus route takes more planning than requesting a car share. Riders have to rely on dozens of other passengers agreeing to sign on, and the company has to establish a route, a bureaucratic process that can take months.Ms. Weaver, who commutes from Livingston, contacted OurBus after years spent riding Community Coach, a bus line owned by Coach USA. \u201cI begged them to consider us,\u201d she said of the first email she sent to OurBus in September 2016. Community Coach buses were often late, she said, broke down and were so crowded that they would sometimes pass her by, leaving her waiting on a cold suburban street corner with no idea when another one might arrive.Scott Sprengel, a vice president at Coach USA, said that the company is aware of the issues. \u201cWe are proactively meeting with our customers to meet their demands,\u201d he said. To address the crowds and the delayed service (not to mention the competition), Coach began testing online ticketing with a small group of riders on last week. If the pilot program is a success, the company plans to expand online ticketing to all commuters, said Sean Hughes, a Coach spokesman. (Currently passengers must buy paper tickets from a clerk at Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York.)\u201cNight and day doesn\u2019t even do it justice,\u201d Ms. Weaver said of her new commute. \u201cYou almost get your life back.\u201dA ticket from Livingston costs $8.60 a ride, which is slightly cheaper than Community Coach ($9.60). Coach buses, however, come more frequently. And on a recent cold December morning, four Coach buses stopped at a West Orange Park and Ride in the 25 minutes that a reporter waited for one Ourbus, watching the bus creep closer on the app (it arrived on time). While commuters filled the Coach buses, another line of riders dutifully waited for the alternative.Beth Fitzgerald, 61, a legal secretary who lives on 18th Street and First Avenue in Manhattan, regularly commutes by Chariot to and from her office on 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m the only one in the van,\u201d she said. Ms. Fitzgerald loves the service, saying it has transformed her commute. She used to take two city buses, a trip that could take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Now, her ride is consistently 10 minutes long, and the drivers handed out candy on Halloween. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d she said.Chariot sees itself as a bridge between the first and last mile of travel for riders whose subway or ferry stop might be just out of reach. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing people back to mass transit,\u201d said Ali Vahabzadeh, the chief executive of Chariot, which also operates shuttles in Austin, Seattle and San Francisco. Mr. Vahabzadeh sees the looming shutdown of the L train as an opportunity to step in. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a doomsday scenario,\u201d he said.But commuters want relief. Consider Boxcar, which started last April as an app for commuters to rent daily parking spots near New Jersey train stations, paying around $6.50 a day. The company was a few months old when the Morris and Essex lines were rerouted to Hoboken during the so-called Summer of Hell. Seeing an opportunity, Boxcar partnered with charter bus companies to run buses from towns along the affected train line into Midtown. When riders requested more stops in Manhattan, the company provided the service.But Jennifer Rowland thinks the one-way commute in the morning is worth it. \u201cI pay for the ease of the ride,\u201d said Ms. Rowland, 49, a Boxcar rider who lives in Chatham and works for a media investment company in Midtown. \u201cI am a single mother of five children. There are so many reasons to be stressed out. Commuting shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Criticize Duterte in Public, \u2018Inhale Courage and Exhale Fear\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileMANILA \u2014 She runs one of the hottest blogs in the Philippines, and her work has never been more in demand. The country\u2019s leading newspaper, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, named her one of the Filipinos of the Year for 2017.Until a few months ago, Ms. Laurio was able to do it anonymously, even as the blog gained dedicated readers. It has well past 130,000 unique followers, and is growing quickly.But during a Senate hearing last year on criticism in the media, Mr. Duterte\u2019s social media team exposed Ms. Laurio as the force behind the blog. Within days, the president\u2019s supporters were making threats against her and publishing her personal information, including her home address and where she studied.\u201cI wrote behind the cloak of anonymity, because when you write something against the government, about the children who are orphaned in this war on drugs, and if you call out the administration for false claims, you receive hate from the government\u2019s army of trolls,\u201d Ms. Laurio said in an interview during an event for the release of a book based on her blog. \u201cBut the threats are not enough to invalidate the issue that I am trying to point out: that the government lies.\u201dStill, she is worried, despite having the bodyguards her friends are helping to pay for. And there is cause.Another sent her an online message in which he threatened to smash her face with a baseball bat the next time he saw her \u2014 suggesting he was watching.Through all that, Ms. Laurio\u2019s posts on the Pinoy Ako Blog, written in Tagalog, have lost none of the dark humor and sarcasm that made the site so popular to begin with. Her admirers say her work has been brave and vital.\u201cI think P.A.B. filled in a particular niche quite effectively, providing real-time, punchy and resonant attacks against a real and perceived purveyor of so-called fake news,\u201d said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political analyst who wrote the book \u201cThe Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy.\u201dThe attention given to Ms. Laurio and other outlets that are critical of Mr. Duterte speaks volumes \u201cabout the shift of information warfare\u201d to the social media landscape, Mr. Heydarian said.Maria Ressa, the veteran journalist who runs Rappler, has long been a target of such warfare. In a particularly bad time, Ms. Laurio used the Pinoy Ako Blog to come to her defense.A wave of online harassers, many of them openly from the armed forces, were attacking Ms. Ressa. Ms. Laurio publicly called on the military chief to rein in his troops, and published several posts about soldiers discussing Ms. Ressa\u2019s looks and whether they would have sex with her.The military later apologized, and Ms. Ressa credited Ms. Laurio\u2019s blog for giving her \u201ca sense of justice.\u201d\u201cI realized that I had stopped defending myself, and here was someone I didn\u2019t know pointing out the horrors of what social media had become and the values it was rewarding,\u201d said Ms. Ressa, who has documented the weaponization of social media by Duterte loyalists.Long before she was dragged into the public eye, Ms. Laurio experienced one struggle after another.She was orphaned at an early age: She was 10 when her mother died of appendicitis, she said, and her inconsolable father turned to alcohol and quickly followed suit. She was passed among a series of relatives, mostly on the central Philippine island of Masbate, until she turned 16, when she was officially adopted by an aunt.She decided to go to Manila to study law, she said, because she wanted to help those who cannot afford legal help.Her online critics have attacked her credibility by saying she suffered a breakdown a decade ago and tried to commit suicide. Ms. Laurio was ready with an answer: She not only bluntly confirmed it, she went deeper, saying she has struggled with repressed anger since being molested as a child.Then there have been the political accusations, among them that she was being paid by the political campaign for Mr. Duterte\u2019s closest rival in the 2016 election, Mar Roxas, to smear the president.She acknowledges volunteering for the Roxas campaign during the election, but insisted that she took no money for her work there.That post was shared at least 28,000 times on social media. Shortly afterward, threats flooded her social media accounts, and her Facebook page was suspended repeatedly because of complaints from Duterte supporters. She decided to move the blog to a dedicated website.The site now has double the number of followers it had when Ms. Laurio was identified as the author late last year.Asked for comment, a spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Harry Roque, discounted Ms. Laurio\u2019s blog. \u201cI don\u2019t read her,\u201d he said.Ms. Laurio credits her blog\u2019s popularity to a sense that ordinary Filipinos are growing more impatient with the government. Many have also been struck by her courage since government officials identified her. In naming her one of its Filipinos of the Year, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said that Ms. Laurio \u201cstood out for her patriotic daring.\u201dIt has been difficult, though. Her higher profile made it impossible to continue her work at an Australian call center. And her boyfriend, an avid supporter of Mr. Duterte, distanced himself after Ms. Laurio went public.They have since reunited, having agreed to avoid talking about politics, and to unfollow each other\u2019s social media accounts. They\u2019re planning their wedding for 2020, she said.She acknowledges that she has thought at times about quitting as the threats have piled up. But an outpouring of support from friends and online followers has kept her going.\u201cThe situation that we have right now is not acceptable,\u201d Ms. Laurio said. \u201cOur countrymen are dying on the streets each day. At the same time these politicians feel that they can just do whatever that they want.\u201cRight now, I am jobless. But still doing the same thing \u2014 exposing and fighting the spread of fake news,\u201d she added. \u201cMy love for this country is greater than the fear that I have about the administration or my detractors.\u201cEvery day, my mantra is: \u2018I inhale courage and exhale fear.\u2019\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

I remember how he laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me,\u201d she said. She said she remained motionless until he finished and told her they should keep quiet about what had happened. On the ride home, she said, he had her sit on his lap in the cab.Ms. Dushku soon shared what had happened with a friend, according to her post. That friend, a woman Ms. Dushku did not name, then visited the set and confronted Mr. Kramer. Later that day, Ms. Dushku broke her ribs in a failed stunt.\u201cWhereas he was supposed to be my protector, he was my abuser,\u201d she wrote.\u201cThese are outlandish, manipulated lies,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cI never sexually molested her. I\u2019m sick to my stomach. It\u2019s not true. I think she\u2019s making this up in her imagination. This is all lies. Lies, lies, lies. This is just crazy. I treated her like a daughter. We all looked out for her.\u201dMr. Kramer also disputed two other accusations of sexual misconduct, both published by Deadline and involving women who were not named.\u201cI was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn\u2019t telling that person anything they didn\u2019t already know,\u201d she said.Ms. Dushku, she added, \u201cwas treated like one of the boys, not a 12-year-old girl.\u201dMs. Dushku\u2019s Facebook post sparked an outpouring of support from several of her \u201cTrue Lies\u201d co-stars.\u201cEliza\u2019s story has now awakened us from our denial slumber to a new, horrific reality. The abuse of children,\u201d she wrote.And the actors Tom Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Twitter that they would have helped had they known.In her piece, Ms. Curtis noted the difficulties faced by child actors, who are often thrust into a world they may not be fully equipped to understand.\u201cI have wrestled with my role as a mentor, colleague, surrogate, and friend, and each relationship is individual and unique,\u201d she said of working with child actors. \u201cAre we really friends? Are we work mates? Children are not mature enough to recognize that subtle difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an A.I. \u2018Cat-and-Mouse Game\u2019 Generates Believable Fake Photos", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "Advertisement\nThe woman in the photo seems familiar.She looks like Jennifer Aniston, the \u201cFriends\u201d actress, or Selena Gomez, the child star turned pop singer. But not exactly.She appears to be a celebrity, one of the beautiful people photographed outside a movie premiere or an awards show. And yet, you cannot quite place her.That\u2019s because she\u2019s not real. She was created by a machine.At a lab in Finland, a small team of Nvidia researchers recently built a system that can analyze thousands of (real) celebrity snapshots, recognize common patterns, and create new images that look much the same \u2014 but are still a little different. The system can also generate realistic images of horses, buses, bicycles, plants and many other common objects.The project is part of a vast and varied effort to build technology that can automatically generate convincing images \u2014 or alter existing images in equally convincing ways. The hope is that this technology can significantly accelerate and improve the creation of computer interfaces, games, movies and other media, eventually allowing software to create realistic imagery in moments rather than the hours \u2014 if not days \u2014 it can now take human developers.In recent years, thanks to a breed of algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, companies like Google and Facebook have built systems that can recognize faces and common objects with an accuracy that rivals the human eye. Now, these and other companies, alongside many of the world\u2019s top academic A.I. labs, are using similar methods to both recognize and create.Nvidia's images can't match the resolution of images produced by a top-of-the-line camera, but when viewed on even the largest smartphones, they are sharp, detailed, and, in many cases, remarkably convincing.For example, look at the two photos below and see if you can figure out which person is real.Like other prominent A.I. researchers, the Nvidia team believes the techniques that drive this project will continue to improve in the months and years to come, generating significantly larger and more complex images.\u201cWe think we can push this further, generating not just photos but 3-D images that can be used in computer games and films,\u201d said Jaakko Lehtinen, one of the researchers behind the project.As it built a system that generates new celebrity faces, the Nvidia team went a step further in an effort to make them far more believable. It set up two neural networks \u2014 one that generated the images and another that tried to determine whether those images were real or fake. These are called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. In essence, one system does its best to fool the other \u2014 and the other does its best not to be fooled.\u201cThe computer learns to generate these images by playing a cat-and-mouse game against itself,\u201d said Mr. Lehtinen.10 MINUTES8 HOURS16 HOURS1 DAY2 DAYS3 DAYS4 DAYS5 DAYS6 DAYS7 DAYS8 DAYS9 DAYS10 DAYS14 DAYS16 DAYS18 DAYS\u201cWe now have a model that can generate faces that are more diverse and in some ways more realistic than what we could program by hand,\u201d he said, referring to Nvidia\u2019s work in Finland.But new concerns come with the power to create this kind of imagery.With so much attention on fake media these days, we could soon face an even wider range of fabricated images than we do today.\u201cThe concern is that these techniques will rise to the point where it becomes very difficult to discern truth from falsity,\u201d said Tim Hwang, who previously oversaw A.I. policy at Google and is now director of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, an effort to fund ethical A.I. research. \u201cYou might believe that accelerates problems we already have.\u201dResearchers are also using a wide range of other machine learning techniques to edit video in more convincing \u2014 and sometimes provocative \u2014 ways.The results are not completely convincing. But the rapid progress of GANs and other techniques point to a future where it becomes easier for anyone to generate faux images or doctor the real thing. That is cause for real concern among experts like Mr. Hwang.Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, an organization that analyzes current events using publicly available images and video, pointed out that fake images are by no means a new problem. In the years since the rise of Photoshop, the onus has been on citizens to approach what they view online with skepticism.But many of us still put a certain amount of trust in photos and videos that we don\u2019t necessarily put in text or word of mouth. Mr. Hwang believes the technology will evolve into a kind of A.I. arms race pitting those trying to deceive against those trying to identify the deception.Mr. Lehtinen downplays the effect his research will have on the spread of misinformation online. But he does say that, as a time goes on, we may have to rethink the very nature of imagery. \u201cWe are approaching some fundamental questions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Canada, Hunting and Preserving an Indigenous Way of Life", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANIWAKI, Quebec \u2014 When the Algonquin chef Cezin Nottaway was 5 years old, her mother taught her how to kill and skin a beaver with her bare hands. The little girl also learned how to snare a rabbit and to draw a moose out of the forest by emulating its haunting grunt.Ms. Nottaway, who took her company\u2019s name from the Algonquin word for northern lights, is part of a new generation of Canadian chefs who are reclaiming and popularizing indigenous foods as part of a growing culinary affirmation of identity.\u201cEmbracing this cuisine is a form of taking back what is ours,\u201d she said.At 75, this eminence grise of Canadian cooking, an early champion of indigenous cuisine, is traveling around the province teaching young chefs reared in the age of Twitter how to use the techniques of their ancestors \u2014 such as covering a partridge in clay and simmering it for eight hours on top of hot stones in the ground.After decades in which these communities have grappled with discrimination, poverty, gambling, suicide and alcoholism, Ms. Nottaway sees her embrace of traditional cooking techniques as nothing less than \u201cdecolonizing myself.\u201d\u201cThis is the food I grew up on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took away our land, our culture, our language, and I am fighting to bring it back with my food.\u201dThe plucky, charismatic chef, who speaks three languages (English, French and Algonquin), juggles her catering business with raising her two children, and is as at home with a shotgun as with a frying pan. Her interest in traditional cooking took root when she was a teenager, eschewing trips to McDonald\u2019s in favor of learning Algonquin recipes, passed on orally from her grandmothers.Both her parents had been forcibly sent to residential schools, where, she said, a priest who taught at her father\u2019s school told him to use a metal brush to scrub the brown from his hands, until they bled.To ensure she didn\u2019t lose touch with the land, her grandmothers taught her how to smoke moose meat with rotted wood, and how to kill a rabbit for dinner by pressing an index finger on its heart.\u201cMy grandmothers taught me from a young age that I shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for killing animals, since they suffer and are lonely if they are not hunted,\u201d she said as she doled out a stewed rabbit\u2019s head served with wild garlic to three guests. \u201cWe respect animals and pray to the animal spirits to show our thanks.\u201dMs. Nottaway said her interest in reviving indigenous food was also part of a wider national effort to improve nutrition in those communities, where, she noted, the removal of people from their land has contributed to poorer health conditions, sedentary lifestyles and the proliferation of processed and junk food.Yet even as indigenous cooking is now being celebrated in some quarters, it is drawing criticism from animal rights advocates, who complain that serving the meat of hunted animals breaches Canadian food safety rules prohibiting that in most restaurants.But a counterpetition asked why that restaurant was being singled out when so many other Toronto restaurants served meat.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.Ms. Nottaway contends that hunting is part of her identity, and that the meat she hunts and butchers for her customers is the same she lovingly serves to her own family.\u201cThis food is who I am and there is no reason I shouldn\u2019t serve it, even if that means breaking the law,\u201d she said with indignation, noting that mass-produced meat is often treated with additives and chemicals.Still, an even bigger challenge looms for indigenous cooks: identifying and preserving their cuisine.\u201cIf you use local ingredients, you are bound to be appropriating indigenous cuisine but may not realize it because it is so absorbed by Canadian culture,\u201d said Mr. Lenser, 27.He and other chefs and scholars are on a mission to excavate and codify recipes and ingredients that disappeared when their ancestors were forcibly assimilated.\u201cWhen our grandparents and parents were forced to go to residential schools and literally torn away from their families, that knowledge was lost,\u201d he said, noting that he had spent hours badgering his elderly aunts to share their old recipes and secrets, including how to make oolichan grease, or fermented smoked fish fat, which he uses to flavor soups or sauces.Ms. Nottaway considers cooking her best weapon against assimilation, and on a recent Thursday afternoon, she set out to hunt for deer, partridge and beaver in a snow-covered forest on the reservation.It was well below zero. But Ms. Nottaway, dressed in traditional deerskin mukluks and holding her gun, was undeterred as she examined paw tracks and urine in the snow, sniffing out whether a deer was lurking nearby.When her prey proved elusive, she returned home and pulled a moose carcass out of the freezer instead. Before long, there was a feast spread on the table, including thin tranches of smoked moose, roasted and seared with maple syrup, made from the sap of a nearby tree.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get more Canadian than that,\u201d she said with a grin.Advertisement"}

For many woman, a discomforting d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hangs over the discussion.In 2014, a number of women came forward to The Toronto Star, the country\u2019s largest newspaper, accusing the former rock star and radio host Jian Ghomeshi of punching, biting, choking and suffocating them while on dates. One was a well-known Canadian actress, Lucy DeCoutere.The case was front-page news for months, particularly after Mr. Ghomeshi was criminally charged by the Toronto police. And it set off a national soul-searching about the high rates of sexual assault in the country and the low numbers of criminal convictions.But the court case against Mr. Ghomeshi did not ultimately encourage more women to step forward. The testimony of one complainant after another was shredded by Mr. Ghomeshi\u2019s defense lawyer, and he did not take the stand.The experience made some activists in Canada look at the growing movement across the border with trepidation.\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d said Farrah Khan, manager of the office of sexual violence support and education at Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our watershed moment in Canada.

{"Headline": "A Garlicky Stir-Fry With Basil Leaves From Bangkok", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEatLeela Punyaratabandhu grew up in Bangkok, in and out of her great-grandparents\u2019 home. She didn\u2019t live in it, not technically, but it\u2019s where she and her cousins and uncles and aunts gathered throughout the week to eat, and read, and stay up late watching movies, so it often felt as if she did. As a child, she read books out loud in Thai while walking up and down the length of her grandmother\u2019s back, to massage it, and her grandmother piped up occasionally to correct her pronunciation. On weekends, she walked with her grandfather to the newsstand to pick up a copy of The Bangkok Post so that they could each work on their own crossword puzzle. \u201cI grew up surrounded by people who had that kind of mentality, that books were important, and that the preservation of tradition was important.\u201dThe kitchen was equipped with a tiny fridge, so to supplement the daily shopping, Punyaratabandhu carried a basket through the garden, picking out just enough food for the day from a tangle of edible shoots, leaves and tubers. There was neem and basil growing, chiles and mint, six kinds of eggplant, along with trees full of mangoes, bananas, papayas and jackfruit. The kitchen was traditional, which meant that it was outdoors, with a large clay stove built right into the ground. It was lit in the morning, when all the day\u2019s cooking took place. A heavy wooden bench, about the size of a king bed, was where everyone gathered to prep the ingredients, grating coconut flesh, pounding aromatic pastes in a mortar and pestle and chopping. The kitchen belonged to Punyaratabandhu\u2019s maternal great-grandmother, who grew up outside the city, in central Thailand. \u201cWhen she married my great-grandfather, she brought a lot of traditions from up country,\u201d said Punyaratabandhu, who sometimes found it a little embarrassing when her friends from school came over and saw the clunky, old-fashioned stove.When Punyaratabandhu broke with tradition and moved to Chicago to study philology, her mother shipped over a steady supply of Thai cookbooks, persuading friends and relatives who were making the trip to carry a few with them. \u201cPart of her was afraid of losing her daughter, culturally,\u201d Punyaratabandu said. \u201cSo she tried to lure me back to my roots using the thing she knew would be most powerful: food.\u201d Over time, Punyaratabandhu became a food blogger, an author and an authority on Thai food, not only cooking but also tracing dishes through different eras, meticulously tracking their changes. What she found, time and time again, was that cooking wasn\u2019t static. That it didn\u2019t make sense to stubbornly romanticize a single past version. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as authenticity, at least not as most people understand it,\u201d she said. Instead, Punyaratabandhu thought of each dish as having a core set of ingredients that defined its identity, and even those sets could shift.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201dThe analysts add:\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.\u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201dG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow\u2019s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT\u2019s Stacy Cowley reports:When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director \u2014after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 could only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u201d That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president.The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.Ensuring that financial services are not badly hit by Brexit is a top priority for the UK, since the sector is Britain\u2019s biggest source of exports and tax revenue.Theresa May\u2019s government has also argued that if the City is damaged it would adversely affect financial stability and EU groups\u2019 cost of financing, while contributing to the fragmentation of the sector.But participants said that in the EU27 meeting the European Commission played down the risks of cutting off the City to EU businesses, saying the financial sector was mobile enough to adapt.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSince then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm.

This one rolls along happily for 15 words, parceling out a perfectly logical string of information \u2014 Christmas, birthday, presents \u2014 until suddenly that very last word snaps like the end of a whip, reversing the meaning of everything. Presents become punishments. Celebrations become rebukes. Holidays become theaters of quiet savagery.After I read this sentence many times in a row, smiling every time, eventually its structure detached from its words: \u201cAt X and on Y, I Z as if not-Z.\u201d That formula got stuck in my head like a little musical phrase. I started to fill it in with other words.At lunch and at dinner I ate fresh fruits as if they were vegetables.On the beach and by the pool I wore my Speedo as if it were a tuxedo.Before long, I was using it to create sentences that actually applied to my life:On television and on the internet I received breaking news as if it were strychnine.On Twitter and on Facebook I clicked \u201clike\u201d as if it were hate.On my phone and on my laptop I opened emails as if they were overdue bills.In the magazine and on the website I wrote sentences as if they were push-ups.Soon I was carrying this structure with me everywhere, applying it involuntarily to everything I saw. \u201cIn the dining room and in the entryway I stacked books as if they were firewood.\u201d It had begun to torture me, like a too-catchy song.

{"Headline": "Shopping, Bravery, Conspiracy Theories and Robots: Our Favorite Student Comments This Week", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationI couldn\u2019t stop shopping for the rest of the year. The reason why I couldn\u2019t stop is because I love buying new stuff for my family and I. I like to get new clothes quite often because I get sick of wearing the same stuff and I want to mix it up a little but I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that if I stopped shopping. I also like buying new video games for my PlayStation and new equipment for baseball. I couldn\u2019t buy anything for my family for Christmas which wouldn\u2019t feel right because I buy them gifts every year. So no, I couldn\u2019t stop shopping for the rest of the year.Yes, it is easy to say most teenage girls are \u201cobsessed with clothes!\u201d but clothing has always meant more to than just the excitement of purchasing something new and fun. Clothing ever since I was a little girl has been the best way for me to express myself. If suddenly I couldn\u2019t express in which the form of art I believe is fashion is in my life. I would lose my identity.Fashion is what I want to do for the rest of my life in one way or another I am determined to make a living out how I express myself every single day. Minimising other clutter in my life like cutting back on buying unnecessary items like nail polish. Or another perfume when I already have twenty is something I would be more lenient to give up for a year. It\u2019s actually something I have been trying to do more of in the past six months, and I\u2019ve got to say I enjoy the way I feel mentally after doing so.I think that everyone could benefit from something like this. Everyone\u2019s different, but I know that I spend more money than necessary - especially on my friends. I frequently shop for little things to give as gifts when I could honestly just spend more time with the person and show my love that way instead, but when I see something that reminds me of a loved one I want to get it! My brain gets excited and starts cheering \u201cthat\u2019s something my friend likes!\u201d and \u201cif I get it for her she\u2019ll know I was thinking of her!\u201d or \u201cthat would make him so happy!\u201d While I love getting new things for myself as well, giving up shopping would be immensely hard for me because I want more than anything to surround the people I care about with things that are beautiful and make them happy.I believe that \u201cneed\u201d is one of the most incorrectly used words in society today. There are many things that we can live without, but our minds trick us into believing that we need them when most of the time we just want it. I believe Ms. Patchett\u2019s chapstick example refers to how society has become blind and lazy to the opportunities that we have. We take advantage of the fact that we can have five chapsticks and if we can\u2019t find it or don\u2019t like the one of many that we have, we can just go out and buy a new one.Sometimes all we need to do is take some extra time and simplify our lives so that we can focus on other more important things happening in our lives. While not shopping for a year would be hard I believe that I would learn a lot about myself and I would be more aware of the world around me.This question reminded me of a story that my classmates and I read in English class called \u201cNeeds\u201d by Thomas Sowell. Sowell highlights that these \u201cneeds\u201d are truly just wants and we could essentially live without them. This connects to Ms. Patchett\u2019s story because it made me realize all of the unnecessary items I have in my room that I believed I was in dire need of when I bought them, like new a shirt or shoes. All of these things are just wants in life that do not help me survive. This seems like an interesting challenge for me to take part in because it would help me uncover all of the things that I have in my house that I have forgotten about and realize that I never needed them.I understand where she is coming from, wanting to no longer take things for granted and save money but I also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sin to want things or to buy things that aren\u2019t necessary. I believe it\u2019s possible to find a way to have self control without limiting yourself to never spending money outside of groceries. For me, the most difficult aspect would be not buying trinkets, things that I definitely don\u2019t need but I think are super cool. The only thing I have given up for a certain period of time would have to do with food, I give up most candy, ice cream, and sweets when I\u2019m \u201cin season\u201d during sports. This worked well for me, and I learned that not eating junk food in excess all the time makes it that much better when you do.You earn all that money, most of it goes to things you need anyway. Why not indulge yourself in your wants every once in awhile. This is coming from someone who still has money from his summer job. It isn\u2019t difficult to save up money and use it on what you want to later. Just learn patience. And if you really wanted to give to the poor then save and give to the poor. Having money and doing nothing with it seems like a waste.After reading the article, I completely agree with Ms. Patchett. My parents have taught me the skills to know whats wanted and needed and to use everything you already have instead of just going out and buying more. My parents have taught me to be smart with my money and to not buy things I don\u2019t need, especially if I already have them. I really only go out and buy new things if I need them. I buy toothpaste when its completely gone, I buy gas when I need it and I buy clothes when mine get ripped out or stained. I pretty much have been doing what Mr. Patcheet has done for my whole life._________To deal with turmoil for me, I do many things. Kindness is one way. Donating or buying gifts for others has always made me a happier person. Global issuing around the world should be resolved in helping. Everyone in the world pitching in. Of course, not forcing anyone to, but just out of pure kindness. Donating money or helping clean up something like the oil spill that happened in 2010. The line that stands out to me most in the article is \u201cwe all want to live a happy life.\u201d This stands out to me because it is true, but many people are not doing anything to make other people\u2019s lives better, or even their own.I believe everyone can have an impact on the world in a positive way. Even if one kind act makes an impact on the life of another, that impact can be felt by other people for generations to come. The idea of a compassionate kindness and empathy is one that resonates with me in a very personal way. From a young age it has been instilled upon me that having empathy and compassion for others is very important, it is important to attempt to understand others and what they are going through. Being kind is important because you never know what can happen next, and therefore you should live your life treating others as you wish to be treated. I think that these ideas should be applied to global issues. Through dialogue and diplomacy we can save more lives and learn to understand other countries and what they are going through.I greatly enjoyed reading this article. It was inspirational in a lot of ways and I agree with a lot of the ideas presented that agreed with kindness and compassion.I am very hopeful for the future. In fact, I am much more hopeful of the future that I am of the present. Even though I do not enjoy school there is something that I need from it, and that thing is a high school diploma. I would like to enlist into the Marine Corps, but to enlist in any branch you require a high school diploma. That is understandable, the military doesn\u2019t have the time to mess around with stupid people. The future however unpredictable can be conquered with just a little bit of planning. With planning it is easy to deal with the future. However, \u201cMan plans, and God laughs.\u201d Even if something goes wrong stick with the plan, just work it through. Make the future yours.Many people are excited to grow up and do these crazy things that you don\u2019t think you can do as a teen. But that isn\u2019t really true, you should strive for your dreams everyday cause you never know what might happen . Something crazy can happen if you put the time and effort you need to be successful . I can wait for the future cause all the things i do that are amazing may all gather up when i am older and can make a huge difference_________In world where social media is integrated so deeply inside our everyday culture, I am not naive enough to think that there is anyway to stop kids from being exposed to it at earlier and earlier ages. I firmly believe that social media gives a warped view of life- one of perfect lighting, makeup, and vacations- that can lead to body image issues and feelings of inferiority. It also contains multiple safety issues such as cyber-bullying and traps and posers.So how young is too young? I think we are all too young. I don\u2019t think anybody can scroll through everybody\u2019s seemingly perfect lives day in and day out and never feel bad about about their own life. And I am sure if there are people like that out there, that they are the ones resisting the trend and living a social media free life. It breaks my heart to think of ten year olds having their childhood cut short because of social media. Let kids be kids. Encourage them to make real-life friends. To be a good person with strong values and confidence. To play outside. To not get caught up in what others think of them. To thrive.In my opinion a person should at least be thirteen before getting some sort of social media account. By using social media at a younger age kids may grow up to be less sociable and probably less likely to connect with others. I really only have two friends that I feel I can discuss personal issues with for example. On the other hand this does teach children how to use social media at younger age, and more likely with parent supervision. Based on my experience with Facebook, it by far has a much more negative impact on kids than it can a positive one. I personally would not trust Facebook with a child\u2019s private information, or anyone\u2019s private information. However a child is much more vulnerable because they probably are not well equipped to understand what privacy is at their age.I think any age under twelve is too young to use social media. When I was younger I spent a lot of time outside, playing with my friends, and just being a kid. I had a lot of experiences that I wouldn\u2019t have had if I had spent all those days inside on a phone or another electronic device. The benefits of introducing technology at a younger age contribute to easily accessible information, being able to research things and use technology to benefit your education. I don\u2019t think it interferes with family life but I think it could interfere in a child\u2019s relationships with their friends, forcing them into more screen time than real contact with real people in the real world.Children should be limited as to how much time they use social media and what sites they are going to. Parents should set limits on both. If parents do this then it can help children connect with others safely. Facebook\u2019s Messenger Kid seems like it is a safe app however that still does not address how much time kids are spending using it. Again, another area where parents have to maintain parental controls on such things like time limits. Facebook is using this app to bring in a younger audience which could get them hooked at a much younger age, and for a lot more years to come. For this reason I believe Facebook is acting in its own best interest.Being a typical teenager, I have accounts for many social media websites and tend to be on them for most of the day, effecting the different interactions I have with many different people. I can embarrassingly say that I am a part of this social media epidemic.Scrolling through my Instagram feed, I see kids as young as ten actively using the website unaware of the potential dangers these platforms can cause to someone at that age. The ongoing joke with kids on social media is the simple question, \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Although this comment is comical, it has a lot of truth behind it. My parents didn\u2019t even allow me to have an Instagram account until I was 13, even after I got it my mom had my password so that she was able to access it. At the time I found it to be a violation of my privacy as I was unaware of all the negatives that come with social media. Now older and in full control of my accounts, I have come to realize that social media with children can be dangerous as there are many people in the world that unfortunately get caught up in the hate.About a year ago, my sister and her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d were planning to meet in Florida to attend a event they both desperately wanted to go. My father went with my sister to the event and also to see her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend.\u201d Well, her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d turned out not to be a \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d and instead became my sister\u2019s best friend who like the same things and around the same age.Social Media is a great platform to use. It can connect people around the world and give a broader sense of our world a new outlook on how we communicate to each other. But, a child needs to communicate outside of a phone screen. More awkward conversations during the holiday seasons are becoming more and more common as grandparents attempt to spark up a conversation only to get a three or four word response. Also, as my sister ended up meeting her new friend, some aren\u2019t as lucky. Their are those \u201cincredibly creepy online friends\u201d we have out in the world and it\u2019s important for the child and the parent to keep in touch of who they talk to online and what they are discussing. I also believe that being thirteen or over should be the recommended time to get a social media account.When I was an elementary age kid, social media did not completely rule our society in the way that it does now. Facebook had just reached worldwide popularity by the time I was already \u201cold enough\u201d to use it, but for children right now that is not the case. My 6 year old cousin is constantly using her ipod touch and is always watching internet videos or playing online games. She even uses Snapchat\u2014of course she has restrictions and only is friends with me and another cousin on Snapchat\u2014but I still wonder: is she too young?On the one hand she is not doing anything wrong or anything inappropriate, but social media can be a very scary place. It is often filled with hate, cyber bullying, racist, sexist, or homophobic posts, and sometimes is even the place of sexual harassment. Are these all things that parents would want their children exposed to? Maybe there is no right or wrong age to start using social media. Maybe the more important thing is that all kids are taught how to be safe online from a very young age. The world is consumed by social media and nearly everyone uses it in some shape or form, children included, so instead of setting up restrictions, kids should learn how to be smart and safe on social media._________As much as I\u2019d like to deny it, some internet conspiracies have made me question my entire existence.The one that genuinely makes sense to me is the butterfly effect. This theory explains how small things being altered in the past can change how we\u2019re living right now. It poses a \u201cwhat if\u201d question. What if my dad stayed in Connecticut instead of moving here at a young age? They wouldn\u2019t have ever met or even have known of each other\u2019s existence. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.Myself and many other people likely become invested with conspiracy theories because they give complex things an answer, despite the fact that it may not be completely accurate. It\u2019s human nature to love organization, and conspiracies fill the gaps of confusion with absurd answers, but an answer is an answer. Hearing all of these outrageous theories has made being paranoid impossible almost. There\u2019s nothing I can do about the fact that aliens are coming down from space and messing with us. I cannot change the fact that the entire Kardashian family is possibly involved with the Illuminati. These theories simply make me question things.I don\u2019t believe in any online conspiracy theories, yet, the amount of times I have found myself falling into a Wikipedia rabbit hole, clicking on dozens of little blue hyperlinks, is rather concerning.For a week, my heart was galloping around in my ribcage, following things so ridiculous that they just might be true.We like conspiracy theories because they offer answers - albeit, some outrageous ones. But, they are answers nonetheless. Conspiracy theories are a shot in the dark, a fingers-crossed guess where humanity finds itself pouring over their screens watching Shane Dawson provide another possibility about the thing that eats up their thoughts.But, as for the argument that the internet has stirred up more paranoia, well, that\u2019s just absolutely false. Paranoia and anxiety has gnawed up the human world for ages. Even before the internet, there were worries. The Internet simply provides a place to pour out all of the nausea, fear, and jitters - a place where minds that fly in a million different directions can intertwine with other minds that fly in a million other directions. Conspiracies unite people.Conspiracies have made me more paranoid. They make me wary, untrusting, and frankly, a little nauseous. The Internet hasn\u2019t created those feelings in me, though. The Internet has only highlighted them and brought them out of the shadows.Whenever I scope around the political side of the internet, I always see conspiracy theories that often challenge my faith in humanity. Some examples of online conspiracy theories would be the flat-earthers and the entire InfoWars website. The theories presented by these kinds of people can be dangerous when information can be passed around the world in minutes through the internet. If a large portion of the population were to believe in false theories put forward by incredible people, social order can be put in jeopardy by a single lie. I think people should use the internet with skepticism to whatever they see. If someone sees a story online, they should do research before jumping to conclusions.I think that most people make conspiracy theories in order to make a profit. One example would be Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars. Alex Jones goes onto his show and rails against the globalists while accusing the government/Illuminati (or someone) by making frogs gay through tap water. However, during his shows, he constantly advertises his own products as the only way to protect yourself from an apocalypse that is not coming.To be fair, I would love to live in a world where lizard people are real, Obama is somehow the Antichrist, the government is controlling our lives with TV, and so on. It sure must be a exciting world.Just kidding. I wonder sometimes how all the conspiracy believers even manage their lives in this much fear. Their world must be so frightening, with all this terror existing outside their homes and all. With the lizard person next to the door, and all these theories reaching such people through various questionable \u201cnews\u201d sources, I mean. I highly disapprove of the conspiracy theory that involves the \u201cSandy Hook\u201d hoax. Some of these conspiracists have been known to make threatening calls to already-grieving parents. I think to that extent, paranoia over conspiracy is very, very pernicious.I don\u2019t believe in conspiracy theories, but I do believe they are a wonderful thing. Despite the possibility of most, if not all, being untrue, they lead people to wonder. They doubt the common belief.The \u201cMandela Effect\u201d is a very popular theory that over time small things change due to the effect of black holes. One \u201ceffect\u201d from this theory is thought to be shown in the book series \u201cThe Berenstain Bears.\u201d While mostly everyone seems to remember pronouncing and reading the name as \u201cBerenstein,\u201d it is believed that the Mandela Effect has caused a change in the name to \u201cBerenstain.\u201d A crazy theory to explain something so small, but I think there\u2019s a deeper reason that so many believe this to be true. People use this theory to stray from the idea that their belief is incorrect. They had believed something was one way, when it was really another way, so instead of admitting their false belief, they are rather using the theory of a \u201cblack hole\u201d to explain why their belief is \u201cnot wrong.\u201d While they entertain me to read and look into, I have yet to find a conspiracy theory that I believe. Or, maybe I have yet to find something I need to cover with a conspiracy theory._________I strongly disagree because directors choose their cast based on how well a role is acted. Right? So why do people think that women need to prove that they can act just as well as guys? I think this is a little unfair. Do some people think that war-based movies that have a strong male cast need to be remade with a female cast? Also, since when do women think that it is \u201cunfair\u201d for movies to have a male-dominated role? Nevermind the fact that most remakes of movies are far worse than the original.This is an example of political correctness gone too far. As being a huge fan of attractive male actors, (which many women are) I think that movie ratings of new versions or remakes would go down. Also, I simply would not watch a movie that has been remade with female actresses\u2019 just to prove a point. What point is being proven? That women can act just as well as men? I think all of this political correctness is turning into a bigger deal than anyone would\u2019ve ever expected.I think this movie and others like it are cynical cash-grabs and have very little to do with political correctness. Studios are more willing to bet on proven winners (the Ocean\u2019s franchise, Ghostbusters) than to take a risk on something new. I see the \u201call female cast\u201d trend as a gimmick to justify the remakes. There are plenty of incredible \u201cwomen-centered\u201d movies out there. Kelly Reichardt\u2019s Certain Women, Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle, and Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s Things to Come are recent examples.I don\u2019t believe that they should remake movies that include a male-dominated cast, but rather focus on the upcoming movies that could cast more roles for women. There are so many movies yet to be made, these movies could try and set aside a good number of roles for women who are interested in playing the parts.If I had to choose a movie that I would change is \u201cPirates of The Caribbean\u201d because even though there are girl roles, it would be cool if a girl could play Captain Jack Sparrow, the lead._________This picture clearly shows Donald Trump giving big tax cuts to wealthier families, but it\u2019s the fine details that exaggerate the message of the cartoon.In this illustration, several things are immediately apparent: the fact that President Trump - being dressed as Santa Claus - is delivering the gift of a tax cut to an affluent looking man while on the backs of the lower classes, which are straining under the weight of the other three men burdening their increasingly tired, beaten shoulders.Other elements in this illustration are more interesting, though, such as the ladder that Trump used to get to the top. After more thoughtful observation, perhaps this ladder is symbolic of the fact that Trump and the Tax Cut circumvented the opinions of the lower classes. Had this ladder not been present in the illustration, the viewer would be left to assume that the climbing of Trump to the upper-class man was a joint-effort between Trump and the lower classes, effectively rewarding a deserving individual. Rather than depict the Tax Cut in this manner, the illustrator instead chose to place a ladder behind the tower of lower classes to show that this was a forced operation that had little room for personal choice among the lower classes, and was instead a direct deal between Trump and the upper class citizen. It is very well possible that this ladder makes the difference between this cartoon being a commentary on the political processes of the United States, or this illustration simply mocking the Tax Cut and it\u2019s seemingly \u2018crooked\u2019 motivations.The President of the United States is depicted to be hand delivering the gift to an unphased, well kept white man. In addition, the President is seen to be reaching the achievement of passing along the tax cut with the help of literally standing on the shoulders and piggybacking off of hard worker (as shown in their tattered clothing and business attire). In the cartoon the one person that is the least wealthiest (at the bottom) has to carry all the \u201cweight\u201d and on top is average middle class citizen.This image is conveying what we were all thinking in the first place: that the new tax bill benefits the rich at the expense of the poor.The new tax bill is a \u201cgift\u201d to the rich but a burden to the middle class, the working person. It reminds me of the cartoon made before the french revolution of the third estate: how the second and the first estate (clergy + nobles) were being held up on the backs of the third estate (everyone else). This just goes to show how the new tax bill is just a way for the rich to get richer while the middle class continues to shrink. The rich, who is depicted to be inside a warm house with a cigar, is getting a present from what looks like President Trump in a Santa costume, being held up by people in normal clothes out in the cold, as the \u201csuits\u201d (or the establishment) looks on.I agree with the point of view of this cartoon. I think that the new tax bill just goes to show how close America is from crossing democracy into an oligarchy. Poor people, middle class people, the people who cannot afford to be taxed more: they\u2019re the ones that are being asked to increase their taxes, whereas the rich, who can afford taxes, are getting a tax break. It\u2019s a big fat present to them at the expense of the common man. That just makes no sense to me.In addition to Trump\u2019s mission, a (first) legislative victory would be the perfect Christmas present for Republican congressmen. While wealthy Americans\u2014like the satisfied man leisurely smoking the cigar in the image\u2014are reveling in these tax cuts, the lower classes are struggling under the President\u2019s weight to support his \u201cgift-giving\u201d. In reality, they will financially suffer from the tax bill, which will result in multiple problems. The most significant aspect of the image is how the scenario takes place in the cold winter setting. The Republican tax bill is the hot issue of this December. Americans will either celebrate the holidays with joy or tremble in fear/anxiety, depending upon the tax bill vote._________Anyone can be a hero! As the article points out, people are always doing small acts of heroism and often refuse credit. I have seen so many acts of heroism as simple as letting someone sit next to someone on the bus or help bringing in groceries. These situations might not seem like a big deal but these small acts of kindness can brighten someone\u2019s day. Small acts can stop bigger situations or boost someone\u2019s courage. This reminds me of the story I heard about where a bullied student thought no one cared and cleaned out their locker. On their way they dropped their stuff and someone helped pick up the stuff. It turns out that student was going to commit suicide and that small act stopped them and gave them hope. So yeah anyone can be a hero, even you. Think about this next time you help someone or let someone sit next to you.I define a hero as someone who can put others before themselves (ie. parents), who can look fear in the eye and overcome it (i.e. women taking a stand against powerful men), and especially those who choose to endure and continue to show optimism when others told them it was unlikely or even impossible (i.e. children facing life-threatening diseases). Ultimately, you aren\u2019t born a hero or just become a hero. It\u2019s your choice. You can turn away in the face of danger or stand resilient with others and possibly stand for others who can\u2019t do it for themselves. They come in all different forms, but they are all heroes in my eyes.\u201cYou gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.\u201d - Eleanor RooseveltTeacher Heley de Abreu Silva Batista saved many children when a crazy person set fire in a kindergarten in Brazil killing dozen children, the teacher and himself. She bravely fought against the crazy guy and saved most of the children even burning in 90% of her body.\u201cCourage is not having the strength to go on. It is going on when you don\u2019t have the strength.\u201d (T.R) I don\u2019t think that there is a certain trait that makes someone courageous, it\u2019s something you just naturally chose to do. One of the heroic people out there are those who put their lives on the line to protect others. They all selflessly face danger and protect those who are afraid to do so. A hero is someone who exemplifies this trait of courage and who fits better under that definition than soldiers.Soldiers endure the sacrifice and hardships of their lifestyle to make sure others can live their lives freely without any constraints. This idea of fighting for something greater than themselves makes them one of the most courageous people out there.I am a hero too. When my family had a house fire i woke up and called the department but they were busy. So i single handedly opened the fire hydrant and the water got on my house and controlled the fire until my the department came._________2017 makes the saying \u201cit\u2019s gonna get worse before it gets any better\u201d come to life. There have been so many negative events happening in this world, it becomes painfully overwhelming. The dominance of the black in the rainbow depicts the countless accusations of sexual harassment, the gun violence, the terrorist attacks, the natural disasters, the climate change, the threats of nuclear war, and the list goes on. The little bit of color left in the rainbow portrays the little bit of peace and humanity that is left in this world. If that black continues to spread over the rainbow, there will be nothing but darkness just like if more terrible events continue to happen in this world, the following years will be nothing but darkness.This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no positive occurrences out there that are trying to keep this crumbling world together because there are, just not enough. There will never be a time where we will live in a pure and moral world of rainbows and unicorns and sunshine. The darkness will always linger around. That\u2019s why we need to make sure that even though we cannot escape the darkness and negativeness completely, we burden them with the colorful events of peace and humanity next year, the year after, and for however long this world may last.I believe that the darkness is not overtaking the rainbow, but that the light of the rainbow is slowly pushing back the darkness of all of the negative things that have happened this year.Sure, a lot of bad things have happened in 2017, but this picture depicts hope for the future and the resistance of hope and happiness against oppression and wrongdoing. See, behind the rainbow where multicoloured light is trying to break through the clouds. Soon, the clouds will clear away, and there will be hope widespread once again.Finally, the picture shows that where darkness lurks, there is always a rainbow hiding underneath, where even the most optimistic can see only darkness.We had a lot of loss this year, a lot of horrors took place all across the world. These things outshone a lot of the good things that happened this year. There is so much hate in the world these days, no one is able to get along and people search for the negativity in everything and everyone. There is little kindness to spare these days, and it\u2019s a shame that we live in the world we do. It makes me sad to see that we are headed towards a life that is filled with unhappiness and darkness. People need to be kinder and express more love and compassion towards others, so that they can reverse the rainbow and make the world a brighter place.I see the rainbow fighting against the blackness, but I don\u2019t see it winning or losing, it is stuck. I also don\u2019t see this as a representation of 2017 but rather the fight for LGBT+ rights. Each year more countries legalize same-sex marriage, however this year America showed the world that these rights are not always guaranteed for its citizens. As of now transgender people are being kicked out of the military, and not all states have gender neutral bathrooms. Not to mention most of Trump\u2019s staff is anti-LGBT+ and so far he seems to be too. But we haven\u2019t lost and hopefully we won\u2019t either because when you take away the rights of one, you have an open door to take rights away from anyone.I think that this picture is an accurate depiction of how the year of 2017 has gone so far. Nations are on the brink of war, people are dying for worthless causes and the city of Flint is still living without fresh water. The government is back to helping the 1% of people that they accurately represent and global warming is pushing species to the brink of extinction. There were many horrible things that occurred in 2017, with commercial-like breaks of happiness in between.If I could represent this year with a single picture, It would be a black and red plaid shirt. The black representing the bad and the red representing the good. This is an accurate representation to me because I feel that we had good mixed in. People this year were able to pull the good out of the bad and look on the positive side of the issues we\u2019ve faced._________I think that the choice to use a phone during church should be a personal decision. Each person has different opinions upon spirituality and should be able to express themselves however they would like. If going to church and using their phone there gives someone a calming, spiritual experience that they need, who\u2019s to say that\u2019s wrong? If simply being in church is how a person connects to their religion, and being on their phone doesn\u2019t affect this, I think that they should be able to do so and practice their religion however they see fit. However, if the phone becomes a distraction to others, that\u2019s where the line should be drawn.In my opinion, I think all people must challenge themselves to follow the guidance in Ecclesiastes, one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, in that \u201cThere is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens\u201d 3:1-13. The predicament with this piece of wise words is to decipher where phones do and do not belong.Places of worship for example, requires another level of respect of its members towards not only the church but fellow members as well. Imagine, peaceful prayers in a cathedral/temple or anything of the like being interrupted by the shrill cry of a ringtone going off. I do not think that phones contribute to spiritual experience, but should be a personal growth and the development of a good relationship with God (or others) that a person follows.I think church is a place where you should try your best to separate yourself from all distractions and just focus on your dedication to God. Not only could it distract you, but also others around you. It\u2019s hard to focus when others around you are a distraction, so it\u2019s better to put your phone away and check it later. Most people only really go to church once a week, and it\u2019s not much at all to just ask someone to go without their phone for a couple hours a day at the most. If you\u2019re going to church and constantly just going be on your phone, then what\u2019s really the point behind going?I don\u2019t think phone should be in church because it is a place you should be fully devoted to God, not your phones. It is also very hard for other to be focused on God when others are on their phones.Another place you should not have your phones are concerts. Concerts are getting more and more unnecessary, especially since we have youtube. Pulling out your phones to take a video or to text distracts other and yourself for what is slowly disappearing. Taking a video could also block the view from others behind you.Finally I think you should not have you phones if you are out to dinner with friends or family. Going on your phone during dinner is a sign of disrespect and it shows that you are not interested in what the other person has to say.One place where cell phones don\u2019t belong is in the classroom. Of course I can be guilty of this a lot of the time, but I am only doing damage to myself. Each time you glance down at your phone, you are missing out on education. Maybe not missing out on the big lessons that you will be tested on, but the small things. Maybe a tip on how to study, or a small piece of knowledge not in the curriculum, but those may be the most important to you in the long run.One day you\u2019ll be in college and not know how to study for your final because when you were in the 10th grade you decided to text back your boyfriend rather than listen to the tips your English teacher was giving you. When you are utilizing the privilege of free education, put down the phone and learn.Of course there are places like church, work etc. where you are expected to act formally and most people know it is inappropriate to use a phone. However, I feel as though there are many more scenarios where people choose to use a phone when it is inacceptable. For instance, when you are expected to be sociable but rather someone sits glued to their phone such as sitting at the dinner table or going on a long car ride.In my personal opinion, I think that a lot of the time people spend on their phones is wasted time because other than checking messages, the news or maybe the occasional glance at social media, there really is nothing else that is very productive or more important than what you could be doing instead of using your phone.There are some places where phones aren\u2019t acceptable whatsoever. Going through my day to day routine, I constantly see people looking down, faces glowing, on their phones completely ignoring the world around them. I see it in class, I see it put in public, and I see it in places like funerals and although I\u2019m not a religious person I\u2019m sure people use them at church or temple, or where ever they go to do their religious activities. I find it incredibly rude because they just tune out those who are trying to speak to them.If you were trying to speak at a funeral or a church service about something or someone that you found to be important and people were just ignoring you while they were on phones, how would that make you feel?_________People are no longer humans; they are programs. We are being wired to follow only a certain set of rules. Our free will is starting to deplete with every law being created in government. Our purpose is to acquire and spit out currency, the more the government restricts the easier it is for them to make big bucks. We see this programming not only in our governments, but also in our schools. Students -like the government- are only focused on getting one thing, grades. They are being programmed to memorize material and spew it back out into a bubbled scantron. We are only learning how to get by rather than what we retain in the long term.Robots are cold, meaning they have no emotion. Politicians are manipulating the people for their money. Students are cheating on tests for good grades. We are no longer humans anymore. We are only scraps of metal with a purpose of fulfilling what our program tells us to fulfill. Fit in, get by, and whatever you do don\u2019t go haywire. Or else we will have to be shut down for good.Humanity had been taken over by the machines. The machines didn\u2019t wield weapons that took human lives but wore suits and ties that killed human jobs. Every conceivable job has been taken over by a machine or software. People could no longer work and find any decent jobs that paid a decent wage. McDonald\u2019s began to employ automatic machines that made burgers for people, Wall Street was fully run by Stock trading AI, and manufacturing jobs for humans were nonexistent. The government tried many different solutions to solve the economic and unemployment crisis and eventually came to the solution of the Universal Basic Income. Though it was not perfect, UBI kept the economy together for a time.William put on his white collar shirt and headed out.\u201cWant to meet up at Starbucks at noon during the weekday?\u201d asked a roommate.\u201cSorry, I have to type some new AI software for the company!\u201d exclaimed William.\u201cIt will only be a matter of time.\u201d responded the roommate.William shut the door and waited for the bus to arrive. A blue bus rolled in front of him and the doors slid open. \u201cTicket please,\u201d said an automatic voice. William turns in a ticket and sat down in a free seat next to a random person that fell asleep. The bus stopped after a few stops and William looked up to see his office building. He entered and sat at his desk.William logged into his computer to see a red notification. William was devastated to see the message: You have been terminated from your position.I believe that this story depicts the loss of humanity in upcoming generations. As humans, we are obsessed with building complex forms of technology to get more money and recognition. I feel as though the more this happens, the more we lose sight on what really matters.The robots that take place in this business meeting has no feelings and feel no emotions. This symbolizes our world now because the actions we make seem to show no sign for love or humanity. For example, we are so circled on technology and advancement, but we do not really find time for parts of our country that need improvements. While we are looking into the iPhone X, or the Note 8, and future forms of technology and ways to make money, there are homeless families, extreme acts of violence and racism that we should take of._________From being accepted to college, obtaining a driver\u2019s license, starting a new school, winning sports competitions, seeing the solar eclipse, listening to good music and getting a job, to having to say goodbye to family members and friends and pets, leaving old schools, mourning mass shootings and witnessing natural disasters, readers learned a lot about others and themselves in 2017.Many people would say that this year has been nothing but disaster. Especially with all of the hurricanes that had hit all at once, the earthquakes in Mexico, and currently the wildfires in California.Some of the good things though, was the music. Music is a big thing to me so of course the many albums and songs that came out was the highlight of the year for me personally. I discovered many different artists such as Bad Suns, COIN, and Walk The Moon. even when Ed Sheeran released a new album, finally. I really have expanded my music taste and 2017 was the year for me to do that.Through this year though, I have lost quite a few family members and my family isn\u2019t all that happy with one another. Even in my own house I feel like people are fighting but in the end, we still find our ways back to each other. We had gotten a puppy almost a year ago and even though he is a big responsibility, he is now family and personally one of my favorite pets I\u2019ve had. This year I\u2019ve grown so much as a person by coming out of my shell and making many new friends. I found out that I was accepted to my favorite college which has many of my friends there as well as a lot of new ones.In my opinion 2017 hasn\u2019t been the best thing for the US. I mean a lot of stuff happened. From the presidency being corrupted to even the weather we had. For example everyone is suddenly accusing everyone who is famous of harassment or rape in someway or another and I get it is a thing to talk about, but it got to a point for me where I\u2019m just sick of hearing about it and don\u2019t believe any of it anymore. Not to mention the net neutrality thing, which is a completely ridiculous way to gain more money. Another thing is the weather, from the two major hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida, to the wildfires that plagued California because of the major drought they were in.Despite all the bad news though, there were some good times. Like the eclipse that happened in August. While I didn\u2019t get to see anything, it was nice to see videos about the eclipse. This year also created some good movies too like Stars Wars or the my little pony movie, don\u2019t judge me. I also got to make some new friends, who are amazing, at my career center class too. Another good thing that did come out of this year is not having to do so many exams because a lot of the class exams are already done or I\u2019m exempt from.2017 was a good year for me. For one, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s new album was absolutely great to listen to for the first time. It was a unique taste after his previous album \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d went massively successful. Listening to J. Cole\u2019s new album \u201c4 Your Eyez Only\u201d was a whole new perspective for me. Songs such as \u201cVille Mentality\u201d and \u201cChange\u201d introduced me to a whole new world in his eyes to tell me a story.Despite all of the good that happened in this world, there are some tragic, unforgettable events that happened here we\u2019ll never forget. In recent months, two mass shootings have taken news outlets channels and websites into my eyes. The mass shooting in Las Vegas claimed lives of 58 people and injured more than 300 people. Also, the mass shooting at a church in Texas claimed multiple lifes. Millions of hearts across the United States where shattered, but nothing done. I\u2019m hoping that change can be taken place in order to prevent these and future shootings here in the U.S. not just in 2018, but today. 2017 was a better year for me than the past and hopefully much better in 2018.Starting off my senior year I was out for a month and was in a few hospitals due to have a serve case of mono. Yet I got accepted to a few colleges and have the offer and chance to run track at a higher level. My cousin also gave birth to my youngest cousin in August giving my family the greatest blessing. Also Donald J Trump went it to office. Good? Bad? Bad. My school boy\u2019s cross country team won States and made history for my school. Everything that has happened throughout this year that I have came across has helped me have a different view on life, or change me as a person. Each year I will go through bumps in my life but its what I do to get over those problems which make me into the person I am.2017 was the year of hardships that helped me grow into the person I am now. To classify the things that happened to me this year into the worst and best things to happen is hard due to the worst things helping me improve myself.One of the worst things to happen to me this year was for my aunt to move into my house. I know that does not seem bad at all, but just wait. My aunt was a bad alcoholic that had nowhere else to go. My mother, my aunt\u2019s youngest sister, took her under her wing and let her stay at our house. We all thought that my aunt, B, would only stay for a couple weeks. Those couple weeks turned into four months. She flipped my family upside down. All B did was yell at my mother, drink my parents\u2019 alcohol, and put everyone else in an awful mood. I hated her for doing this, especially to my poor mother who was the one to give her a roof over her head. This time period of B\u2019s stay pushed me to grow into a miserable person at first, but then instead of letting it affect me negatively, I took it and let it teach me the lessons of independence and further my positivity. It pushed me to be the light inside my house that started to grow dark. My mother became distant because of the way B made her feel. I grew more independent than I ever had been before. After four, hard months, B went to rehab. My family is back to normal, but I still am left with the lessons her stay had taught me. I believe it made me grow into the better person that I am today._________Thank you for contributing!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For His Next Act, Ken Chenault Turns His Focus on Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookEver since Kenneth I. Chenault announced last fall that he would retire as chief executive of American Express, he has been fielding phone calls from companies looking to hire him.It\u2019s not surprising. Mr. Chenault is one of the most prominent African-American chief executives in the world and the man who led American Express through 9/11 and the financial crisis. When it came to selecting his next act, he was bound to have a wide variety of choices.In the last two weeks, he has announced he was joining the boards of Facebook and Airbnb. And for the last several weeks, he\u2019s been trying to keep one more secret \u2014 perhaps his biggest \u2014 about his future plans.\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI literally have been inundated,\u201d he reluctantly acknowledged, almost embarrassed, when we spoke Monday. \u201cPeople have talked to me about some very large companies and some digital technology companies. Obviously, I can\u2019t say from a confidentiality standpoint.\u201dThe recruiters can stop calling. On Tuesday, he will announce he has a new full-time job. Mr. Chenault, a name long synonymous with Wall Street, will soon become a staple of Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He will be chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, one of the most successful venture firms of the past two decades, with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap, Stripe and Warby Parker.Mr. Chenault \u2018s choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture.As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society\u2019s challenges.This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.\u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Chenault\u2019s management skills may be a perfect fit for the role General Catalyst needs him to fill. As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.\u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201dMr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.\u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201dIt is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.Mr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble, which gives him insight into what\u2019s going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.\u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Teenagers, Stop Asking for Nude Photos", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdolescencemy bf preaused me for hours to send him pictures of me naked. Now he threarens to send them out if i dont send hin more really nasty pics. The stuff i have to do is unbelievable. im 14.In the wider culture, it appears we have suddenly come to the limit of our tolerance for the sexualized abuse of power by adult men. A logical next step is to recalibrate some of the toxic norms that have taken hold among teenagers. Most schools and many parents already tell teenagers not to send sexualized selfies. But why don\u2019t we also tell adolescents to stop asking for nude photos from one another?Sara Thomas, the author of the new study and a doctoral student at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern, noted that simply telling girls not to send photographs \u201cignores the complicated tensions they are negotiating on a regular basis.\u201d If we really don\u2019t want teenagers to send sexualized photos, we should set limits on the most likely trigger for sexting: requests.In talking about sexting with both daughters and sons, parents might say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to share nude photos of yourself \u2014 even with someone you really care about and trust \u2014 because doing so puts you in a terrible position. The relationship might change, or that person could simply lose track of their phone. It\u2019s just not worth the risk.\u201d To that we should add, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not O.K. to request naked pictures because then you are putting someone else in a terrible position. Don\u2019t do that either.\u201dRules can also serve as useful behavioral speed bumps. Adolescents are impulsive by nature and gaps can readily emerge between what they know they ought to do and what they actually do. Teenagers who are asking, much less harassing, peers for sexts almost certainly realize that they are crossing a line. But if that line is never stressed or enforced by adults, they are far less likely to heed it. I\u2019m also sure that plenty of boys would appreciate having a clearly articulated rule upon which they could blame their good behavior when they are pressed by peers to obtain illicit images.Finally, rules can be used to address power imbalances. The girls in Ms. Thomas\u2019s study felt they had little recourse for dealing with the often hostile barrage of solicitations for pictures. One study participant wrote:\u2026they want me to send naked pics of me and I don\u2019t want to send them\u2026.but like idk wat to do cuz they said if I don\u2019t send them tht their goinq to spreads roumors and help me out plzzz :((Shifting the norms about soliciting images could helpfully shift the balance of power. If parents and schools have made clear that the requests are a violation, girls would feel that they had the option of taking screen shots of them and seeking help from adults.That our focus has been so preponderantly on the sending, not requesting, of sexts underscores the exact problem we need to address. We accept and perpetuate the boys-play-offense and girls-play-defense framework because it is so atmospheric as to be almost invisible. Indeed, as someone who cares for adolescents for a living I can say that it was painful for me to realize that many of my early career conversations with teenage girls boiled down to: \u201cThe adults are asking you to regulate adolescent sexuality. Because we\u2019re not going to ask the boys.\u201dAs we re-examine the sexual power dynamics between adults, we owe it to our teenagers to include them in the progress we are making.

It is unclear who she is \u2014 mother? sister? lover? \u2014 but always she is dead. The dreamer has arrived, seemingly fresh from the battlefield, just in time to mourn her. The vision haunted the nighttime hours of the dreamer for 16 years.\u201cMy work is about people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time to develop the trust and the connection. So initially there are not lots of photographs because I just start meeting new people and asking about their feelings.\u201d For Mr. Sankar Bose, a Magnum Foundation fellow, the dreams and anxieties of his subjects provide fertile ground to explore the complex etchings that history and culture can carve into our psyches. In a previous project, \u201cLet\u2019s Sing an Old Song,\u201d he revisited famous folk artists from the 1960s whose stars had faded with the advent of cinema and television. Together, they manufactured scenes and created images that reminisced on the bygone glory days and are permeated with a tangible melancholy. In \u201cFull Moon in a Dark Night,\u201d Mr. Sankar Bose set his sights on the psychic landscape of the L.G.B.T.Q. community living in the shadow of a colonial-era law, Section 377, which criminalizes same-sex sexual activity. He often spends weeks getting to know the people who will become his subjects, whom he meets through friends, local L.G.B.T.Q. organizations and referrals from people who have already become a part of the project. Once a person expresses interest, Mr. Sankar Bose will meet with her or him several times so they can get to know each other. He researches the potential subject\u2019s social media posts and asks about their thoughts, fears, desires and past traumas. Armed with all of this, they then discuss what kind of picture they might make together.\u201cThe people are part of this project too. For me they are like collaborators, rather than the subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for me to understand someone and their psychology. Every picture is a kind of story, one person\u2019s story.\u201d Despite the potentially dour subject matter, the resulting images are limned with tenderness and, if not always uplifting, are darkly beautiful. They imagine possible futures, reimagine traumatic pasts and explore the now that could have been.\u201cWhen I\u2019m doing this project,\u201d he said, \u201cmost of the friends of mine who are a part of this project, they say sometimes: \u2018This project is not just a project. This is a counseling thing. This is the only world we are making that people can express their problems or desires or dreams.\u2019 It gives them a kind of relief. For me it\u2019s very important to do this work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s worth it over the long term, however, if it keeps users sufficiently content to remain on the Facebook farm.The bigger pictureMore from Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly in the NYT:Five years ago, fixed-income trading \u2014 so called because its keystone product, bonds, typically provides a fixed payout \u2014 generated nearly $103 billion in income for the top 12 investment banks, according to Coalition, a London research firm. By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.That client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports.\u201cThe borrowing entity pledged 628 million Steinhoff shares as collateral on the loan, according to a company statement at the time. After the share price collapse, however, that collateral has little value relative to the debt.\u201dHow often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong?That odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary.This obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below].The S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.\u2019s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case.Defendants argued the judges are not mere employees but \u201cofficers\u201d so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status.The S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution.The key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out.-- Peter J.

{"Headline": "At England\u2019s Loneliest Rail Station, a Train Comes Just Once a Week", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTeesside JournalTEESSIDE, England \u2014 As an aging train pulls into view, two men wait patiently in the biting cold, taking photos as the diesel-driven carriages grind slowly to a halt, before jumping quickly aboard.It is not a good idea to miss the 2:56 p.m. service to Darlington: The next train will call here in precisely one week.At England\u2019s least popular railway station, here in Teesside, the only travelers these days are those attracted by the novelty and rarity of their journey, which lasts a maximum of 14 minutes.\u201cThe more obscure it is, the more interesting it is for rail enthusiasts,\u201d said one of the men, Henry Kennedy, from Southampton. Along with Murray Colpman, he had traveled hundreds of miles by train, then walked for 45 minutes, to reach this obscure transportation outpost in northeastern England.It was not meant to be like this.Teesside Airport rail station, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Leeds, was built in 1971 along an existing line to bring thousands of passengers to and from a regional airport, now called Durham Tees Valley Airport, whose terminal building lies less than a mile away.There is no longer a bus service from the rail station to the airport terminal, and the numbers flying from Durham Tees Valley are greatly reduced; it once attracted around 900,000 passengers a year, but now serves around 125,000, connecting to just a few destinations. So rail bosses have sidelined the stop for years, halting just two trains here a week, one in each direction.Then, in December, the service was cut again \u2014 to one train a week.Yet the various rail authorities cannot agree to close Teesside Airport rail, preferring to retain a zombie station that has come to symbolize some of the dysfunctions of Britain\u2019s transport network.\u201cThis is a good example of the sort of disconnected nature of British transport policy,\u201d said Stephen Joseph, the executive director of the Campaign for Better Transport, an advocacy group, referring to Teesside Airport. He contrasted Britain\u2019s piecemeal approach with \u201cother countries where rail, aviation and economic development are planned together at a national level.\u201dMr. Joseph also noted that when other little-used routes have been expanded with increased train frequencies, commuters have responded. \u201cWhen you do put on a decent service, they tend to get used,\u201d he said.Hidden away at the back of the airfield, Teesside Airport station is not even easy to find, and the facilities are minimal \u2014 two platforms, linked by a footbridge supported by scaffolding; a shelter; and a pay phone, a relic of the era when this station was used regularly. When the airport changed its name, the signs at the rail station were not even updated.But even in the land where rail travel was born, closing a station can be a complex, sometimes costly process. And in Britain a plethora of bodies are involved \u2014 including in this case the train franchise operator, Northern Rail; Network Rail, which is responsible for the track; the airport; and Rail North, which brings together local transport authorities across the north of England.Keeping a skeleton operation \u2014 or \u201cparliamentary service\u201d in the jargon that refers to legislators\u2019 role in deciding on closings \u2014 keeps things simple, if surreal.Behind this particular impasse lies a fight over the future of Durham Tees Valley Airport, which has suffered declining fortunes recently even though its runway is large enough to accommodate big planes, including Air Force One during a 2003 visit by President George W. Bush.The airport is responsible for the rail station\u2019s maintenance under an agreement made when its majority owner, Peel Airports, took over operations in 2003.When the airport said last month that instead of operating two services a week, there would be only one from Teesside Airport, it blamed the aging infrastructure, including the footbridge, and argued that the cost of maintaining it \u201ccould be as high as six million pounds over the next five years\u201d \u2014 a figure disputed by Ms. Foster, the campaigner.Ben Houchen, the mayor of Tees Valley, which covers five boroughs, wants a revamp of the airport and its rail link. He said that Peel Airports had wanted to close Teesside Airport rail halt, but that he had objected.\u201cIf you now decided to close the rail station at the airport, it would be significantly more difficult again to reopen it,\u201d Mr. Houchen said, adding that \u201cthere are airports, regional airports especially, that would die for the connectivity that Teesside Airport has got, actually having a station.\u201dMr. Houchen wants to create a consortium to take over the airport, and fears that Peel\u2019s \u201cultimate long-term goal is to close the airport and turn it into a housing estate,\u201d because that would turn an easier profit.Peel said that it had discussed closing the rail station, but that it had also considered moving it to a new site closer to the terminal. It rejected the claim that it wanted to run down the airport and sell it off for housing.In a statement, the airport said that, \u201cas our chairman has stated previously, we are not looking to sell the airport and remain committed to delivering our business plan to secure its future and deliver growth.\u201dThat plan involved \u201ca range of developments on land not required to aviation operations,\u201d including some housing, though \u201cthe proceeds of the residential development will all be reinvested into airport operations,\u201d the statement added.As the fate of the airport remains unclear, its rail station stays on life-support, though it seems to be getting some attention, although for the wrong reasons.Onboard the 2:56 on a recent Sunday, the conductor, Sally Holtham, said that in five years of doing her job, she had worked on only three services that stopped at this station.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve sold any tickets from Teesside Airport,\u201d she said before asking, with a long laugh, a deliberately pointless question: \u201cWould you like a single or a return ticket?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a railway stop near Teesside Airport train station. It is Chester-le-Street, not Chester-le-Track.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toronto Suddenly Has a New Craving: Syrian Food", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Soufi\u2019s offers hints of something more unusual than just a place to get lunch. They include the sinuous melodies of old Arabic pop songs, the whiff of sumac and za\u2019atar in the air, and the yellow-and-black T-shirts the staff wears, proclaiming, \u201cFrom Syria, With Love.\u201dUntil recently, Syrian cuisine hardly existed in Toronto. With just a few hundred families, the Syrian population was too small to support a restaurant scene. But over the past two years, following the high-profile resettlement of more than 50,000 refugees in Canada, the Toronto area \u2014 where over 11,000 of them live \u2014 is experiencing the green shoots of a Syrian-food boom.The entrepreneurs behind these ventures display the striking diversity of Syria\u2019s refugee population. They are as young as 17 and as old as 70, urban professors as well as illiterate farmers. They identify as Shia, Sunni, Druze, Kurd, Alawite, Christian or just Syrian. Some worked in food businesses back home. Others never cooked in their lives.In a city whose culinary landscape is proudly defined by its immigrant foods (more than half of all Torontonians are foreign-born), the emergence of Syrian cooking illuminates an immigrant community\u2019s integration into the broader population, and the bridge that food can build to a new life.But this group\u2019s arrival in Toronto also points to something new. \u201cThe Syrians are coming at a time that is very different than other immigrants before them,\u201d said Suresh Doss, a food journalist who focuses on the city\u2019s immigrant shops and restaurants in suburban strip malls.Unlike the Filipinos or Sri Lanken Tamils (including Mr. Doss\u2019s family) who opened food businesses clustered together in immigrant neighborhoods to cater to their countrymen, the Syrians have spread their enterprises across the Toronto area, at a time when the entire city is obsessed with anything edible.They can market their meals on platforms like Instagram to a wider audience, tapping into a \u201cvisual obsession with food\u201d that Mr. Doss says rewards the most \u201cnovel, spicy and authentic cuisines\u201d that Torontonians can get their hands on.And Canada\u2019s embrace of the Syrian refugees has brought them a sort of celebrity status that can translate into sales and long-term success.\u201cThere is such a positive attitude toward new businesses that newcomers have been starting here,\u201d said Jala Alsoufi, 23.In August, Ms. Alsoufi opened Soufi\u2019s, one of about a half-dozen Syrian food businesses to appear around Toronto in recent years, with her parents, Shahnaz and Husam, and her brother Alaa, 26. (A younger brother, Ayham, is still in high school.)Though originally from Damascus, the family lived for two decades in Saudi Arabia, where Husam worked as a civil engineer and Shahnaz as a social worker. Unlike the majority of recent Syrian arrivals, who came as refugees, Jala moved here first in 2012 to study at the University of Toronto, and her family followed three years later. Because Canada did not recognize Husam\u2019s engineering qualifications, and the family quickly learned about the scarcity of Syrian food in Toronto, they decided to open a restaurant.\u201cWe wanted to highlight Syrian cuisine, which had gotten lost in the shadows of Middle Eastern cuisine,\u201d Jala said, noting how Lebanese and other Arabic restaurants had cloaked their restaurants in a generic \u201cMediterranean\u201d label, for broader appeal.Soufi\u2019s is defiantly branded as a Syrian restaurant. Shahnaz, speaking in Arabic as her daughter translated, said the family wanted to demonstrate that Syrians were \u201cmore than just victims.\u201d\u201cWe wanted to consciously be light and airy,\u201d Jala added, \u201cbecause even though the situation in Syria is very unfortunate, it is important to show Syrian culture, music and art.\u201dThe Alsoufi family has purposefully struck a balance between traditional Syrian flavors and contemporary Canadian tastes. Soufi\u2019s employees are exclusively young, Syrian refugees. Some wear head scarves and beards, while others prefer tight jeans and rolled-up sleeves. The meat is halal, but beer is served, and a sticker supporting gay, lesbian and transgender causes is displayed on the front door.The menu is built around two quintessential Syrian street foods: freshly baked manaeesh flatbread topped with a variety of ingredients, from sujuk (spiced ground beef) to crumbled halloumi cheese with braised, lemony spinach; and knafeh, a warm sweet dish of gooey cheese and phyllo strands, scented with rose water and soaked in syrup.Jala refuses to make something as overtly fusion-y as a \u201cmanaeesh burrito,\u201d but you can order avocado as a topping, and her vegan knafeh, called \u201cbanoffeh,\u201d is made with coconut caramel, bananas and tahini, inspired by her love of banoffee pie, that edible portmanteau of 1970s supermarket staples like sweetened condensed milk and whipped cream.The brothers fled to Canada as refugees in 2009 from Aleppo, citing a dangerous situation they declined to discuss. While Ismail finished high school, Rasoul supported him by working in Lebanese bakeries from dawn until dusk, but the goal was always to open a Syrian bakery.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.\u201cWith other Arab bakeries, you cannot taste the butter or nuts, only sugar,\u201d Rasoul said dismissively.Crown Pastries is a recreation of their grandfather\u2019s bakery of the same name, which operated in Aleppo\u2019s old city from 1980 until the start of the civil war in 2011, when it was abandoned. It is where both brothers learned the trade.Crown Pastries\u2019 specialty is dozens of delicate sweets, layered with hand-folded phyllo dough. There are piles of baklava in various shapes and sizes; birds\u2019 nests of swirled noodles; custard-stuffed semolina and sweet cheese dumplings called halawi jibben; and chocolate mafroukeh, dense chocolate brownies covered in a storm of pistachios, almonds and cashews.Authentic Syrian ingredients are hard to find in Canada, especially now, as the war goes on. Every six months, Crown Pastries pays more than $500 for a bottle of blood-red Syrian rose water, smuggled across the war\u2019s front lines into Turkey and on to Toronto, because Ismail believes that no other rose water will do.When he arrived in Toronto, Rasoul imagined it would take him 30 years to open his own business. But the bakery has become so successful that the brothers are already planning to expand.Canada\u2019s warm welcome to Syrian refugees was a hallmark of Justin Trudeau\u2019s election as prime minister in late 2015, and for many, it remains a potent symbol of Toronto\u2019s multicultural identity. (The city\u2019s motto is \u201cDiversity Our Strength.\u201d) Syrian food businesses drew an overwhelming degree of media attention, and a customer base that extended well beyond people with Middle Eastern backgrounds.The response has been overwhelming. The couple have been invited to cater events at City Hall, the University of Toronto and the local offices of Uber. But while Mr. Fattal feels great pride in sharing the story of Aleppo\u2019s grand culinary tradition, he questions whether some Canadians are fetishizing Syrian refugees.\u201cThere are other people who are refugees,\u201d he said, \u201cand they need opportunities, too.\u201dNewcomer Kitchen began in March 2016 as a way of giving newly arrived Syrian refugees who were temporarily living in airport hotels a chance to cook a meal. But it has grown into a collective of 60 cooks, who rotate in groups of eight to make 50 three-course takeout dinners each week, for $20 apiece.The group has been the subject of dozens of news stories around the world, and a documentary film is in the works. A year ago, Mr. Trudeau visited with the press in tow, and his smiling face is proudly displayed around the kitchen.But expectations that this would lead to government funding for administrative costs have not panned out, and this winter Newcomer Kitchen has appealed to the public for donations. The project\u2019s future is tenuous.One warm morning last fall, that week\u2019s group of cooks milled about the Depanneur\u2019s large communal table, sharing jokes and drinking coffee with homemade anise-flavored cookies. Rahaf Alakbani, a 26-year-old Druze woman from Sueda, in Syria\u2019s south, and a former graduate student in English literature, urged everyone to don aprons and get to work. There was pita bread to be cut for the fattoush salad, onions to be browned for shakriya, a thick beef stew, and semolina flour to be mixed for the maamoul cookies.\u201cI had no professional cooking experience at all,\u201d Ms. Alakbani said as she led the crew, \u201cbut I have always loved cooking.\u201d Like most women here, she learned the recipes at her mother\u2019s side.Newcomer Kitchen, at its heart, is a social experiment. \u201cFood isn\u2019t the end goal,\u201d said Cara Benjamin-Pace, a retired software entrepreneur who helped found the group. \u201cIt\u2019s the platform and conversation of how to bring people together and keep the culinary traditions of these women at a certain level.\u201dIt is also, crucially, a source of healing. After ISIS killed one of her brothers as she watched, Gadda Abdulaha and her family scattered around the world. Two of her brothers now work as cooks in Europe, while she landed in Toronto with her husband and two children.\u201cI felt very comfortable coming here,\u201d Ms. Abdulaha said, on her first visit back to Newcomer Kitchen since the birth of her daughter, named Rahaf after Ms. Alakbani, who she says saved her from post-traumatic stress and depression. \u201cListening to the stories of others makes you feel O.K., that you aren\u2019t the only one who suffers. Cooking with them helped me overcome this trauma.\u201dMs. Alakbani smiled at her little namesake and broke out in song (\u201calways love songs, sexy songs\u201d), clapping a syncopated beat, as others thwacked maamoul dough onto baking sheets from a mold. Soon the kitchen was a riot of singing, dancing and smells, as a potluck lunch of fresh hummus and baba ghanouj, vegetarian kibbe and spiced meat pies called shamborak filled the table for lunch.\u201cYallah!\u201d Ms. Alakbani shouted over the joyful scene. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a subject that Jala Alsoufi, who opened Soufi\u2019s, studied in college, It is psychology, not philosophy.

{"Headline": "Mike Pence Says U.S. Embassy Will Open in Jerusalem Next Year", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that a new United States Embassy to Israel would open in Jerusalem before the end of 2019.Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital or believe it should be divided, with East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a Palestinian state. The international consensus, previously supported by the United States, has been that the city\u2019s status can be determined only through negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.Arab lawmakers rose to their feet at the start of Mr. Pence\u2019s speech in the Israeli Parliament and held up signs reading \u201cJerusalem is the capital of Palestine.\u201d Ushers pulled down the signs and escorted them out of the room, to the applause of others in the hall.In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, Mr. Trump endorsed the Israeli position, but has said that the embassy\u2019s move to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv should not hamper peace talks. He says he is working on a \u201cdeal of the century\u201d that will resolve the conflict, though few details have been released.That approach has been welcomed by many Israelis, while rankling with Palestinians, whose political and religious leaders have refused to meet Mr. Pence.In his speech to the Parliament, Mr. Pence spoke in glowing terms of the long alliance between the United States and Israel, framing it as part of an epic battle.\u201cWe stand with Israel because we believe in right over wrong, in good over evil, and in liberty over tyranny,\u201d Mr. Pence said.Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, dotted his address with biblical references and spoke of the Jewish connection to Jerusalem in historical and religious terms.\u201cThe United States has chosen fact over fiction, and fact is the only true foundation for a just and lasting peace,\u201d he said.He scarcely mentioned the Palestinians and did not refer to their history in the Holy Land, nor to their territorial claims. He said the United States would support a two-state solution \u201cif both sides agree.\u201dDuring a meeting with Mr. Pence before the speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said, \u201cThis is the first time that I stand here where both leaders can say those three words: \u2018Israel\u2019s capital Jerusalem,\u2019 \u201dThe Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, wrote on Twitter that the speech \u201ccarried a message of hope for all people in the region.\u201d\u201cTruth must be said and the truth is that Israel and Jerusalem belong to the Jewish people,\u201d Ms. Regev wrote.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, will not meet Mr. Pence. He has called Mr. Trump\u2019s Jerusalem declaration \u201ca slap in the face.\u201dSaeb Erekat, the chief negotiator for the Palestinians, said that Mr. Pence\u2019s \u201cmessianic discourse\u201d was \u201ca gift to extremists.\u201dMr. Pence has spoken of protecting Christian minorities in the Middle East, but he has been widely shunned by those same Christians for his embrace of the Israeli position on Jerusalem.No Arab Christian leaders have agreed to meet with him during his visit, and he is not scheduled to visit Christian holy sites like the city of Nazareth, the West Bank town of Bethlehem or the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradition holds that Jesus was crucified.Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Pope Francis, Fake News Goes Back to the Garden of Eden", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The serpent in the Garden of Eden hissed the first fake news to Eve and it all went downhill from there, Pope Francis wrote in a major document about the phenomenon of fake news released on Wednesday.\u201cWe need to unmask what could be called the \u2018snake-tactics\u2019 used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place,\u201d the pope wrote in a message ahead of what the church has designated as its World Day of Social Communications, in May.Arguing that the \u201ccrafty\u201d serpent\u2019s effective disinformation campaign to get Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge \u201cbegan the tragic history of human sin,\u201d he added, \u201cI would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news.\u201dBut in a varyingly sophisticated, spiritual and questionable analysis of the fake news epidemic, the 81-year-old pontiff tried on the cap of contemporary media critic to address an issue that has wreaked havoc and undermined democracies from the United States to Europe and beyond.In doing so, he offered a largely cleareyed assessment of the problem, its social impact, and the responsibility of social media giants and journalists. And he called on news consumers to break out of their comfortable echo chambers and cushy news feeds by seeking out different points of view.But at times the pope also conflated fake news, which is politically or economically motivated disinformation, with an incremental and sensational style of journalism he dislikes \u2014 a muddying of the waters that many democracy advocates have worried is corrosive to a free press and to the ideal of an informed populace.Betraying a somewhat antiquated view that separates dead-tree and digital outlets, the pope defined fake news as the spreading \u201conline or in the traditional media\u201d of disinformation that is intended to deceive and manipulate consumers for political and economic interests.He observed that fake news is effective because, like the snake in the garden, it insidiously mimics real news, and is \u201ccaptious\u201d \u2014 pope for clickbait \u2014 meaning that it grabs people\u2019s attention by exploiting \u201cemotions like anxiety, contempt, anger and frustration.\u201dFrancis identified social networks as the delivery systems for such fake news.\u201cUntrue stories can spread so quickly that even authoritative denials fail to contain the damage,\u201d he wrote, adding that those living virtual lives in like-minded silos allow disinformation to thrive and that the absence of opposing viewpoints turns people into \u201cunwilling accomplices in spreading biased and baseless ideas.\u201d\u201cFake news often goes viral, spreading so fast that it is hard to stop, not because of the sense of sharing that inspires the social media, but because it appeals to the insatiable greed so easily aroused in human beings,\u201d he wrote.The results, he said, are soul-killing.Turning to the \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov,\u201d he quoted Dostoyevsky: \u201cPeople who lie to themselves and listen to their own lie come to such a pass that they cannot distinguish the truth within them, or around them, and so lose all respect for themselves and for others.\u201d This leads to the coarsening of society, Francis said.To combat fake news, the pope called for personal efforts to unmask disinformation, but he also praised educational programs, regulatory efforts and social media companies\u2019 progress in verifying personal identities \u201cconcealed behind millions of digital profiles.\u201dBut the pope argued that the most \u201cradical antidote\u201d to the scourge of fake news lies in \u201cpurification by the truth.\u201d In Christianity, he said, that means living the truth through faith in Jesus, who, he observed, said, \u201cI am the truth\u201d and \u201cthe truth will set you free.\u201dAlong those lines, he argued that the marshaling of undeniable facts to hurt and discredit others \u201cis not truthful.\u201d Nor is any statement that provokes quarrels, division or resignation, he said. The truth, in the pope\u2019s reading, leads to dialogue and \u201cfruitful results.\u201dTo achieve a climate of open-minded dialogue, Francis exalted journalists, who have been generally demonized by President Trump and other leaders in efforts to undercut critical coverage. The pope called them the \u201cprotectors of news\u201d and characterized their profession as a \u201cmission.\u201d\u201cInforming others means forming others; it means being in touch with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace.\u201dThat message \u2014 and his appeal to cover the powerless, voiceless and downtrodden \u2014 could be found in many a Journalism 101 class. Less so his distaste for the \u201cmad rush for a scoop\u201d and focus on \u201caudience impact\u201d and \u201cbreaking news.\u201dAs the pope sees it, journalists less focused on scoops, news consumers more open to other views, and social media companies and officials more committed to safeguarding the web would open eyes to mimicry \u2014 what Francis called \u201cthat sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments\u201d \u2014 and thus cast that original and slithering bearer of fake news from the garden.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Satisfying Soup From the Italian Pantry", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenSome soups are delicate, light and refreshing, served as the prelude to a meal. Others, like this one, are hearty and nourishing meals in themselves. It is not precisely a soup, but a soupy concoction of potatoes and pasta, known throughout Italy as pasta e patate.This is an example of the country\u2019s bare-cupboard cuisine, la cucina povera, in which inexpensive basics are transformed with small jolts of flavor from aged cheese, dried chiles, herb pastes and the like. Thrifty but flavorful, its principal aim is to feed a family during times when funds are tight. (If no potatoes were in the pantry, you could make a similar soup with beans or lentils.)Humble, but not spartan, many dishes from this tradition are also exceedingly delicious.Here, you soften an onion in a hot pan with a generous glug of olive oil, then add chopped potatoes, salt, a garlic clove, a rosemary sprig and water. When the potatoes are done, a handful of pasta goes in, and when the pasta is al dente, you ladle this steaming, chunky marvel of a soup into bowls. Pass the grated pecorino and Parmigiano, a cruet of oil, the pepper mill and crushed red pepper.That\u2019s the bare-bones version. There are any number of regional variations, of course, and every cook is at liberty to customize according to whim. Some might add, for example, more vegetables, like celery and carrot; some tomato, a little or a lot; bacon or pancetta or ham; beef or chicken broth; or, as in my recipe, a large quantity of chopped kale.Though the soup could be made from start to finish and served right away, you can make it several hours, or even a day, in advance. This allows for the flavors to meld and for the potatoes to break down a bit. But since you don\u2019t want the pasta to be overcooked, cook it separately, and stir it in as a final step. Small, textured pasta shapes, like pennette, orecchiette or rigatoncini are the best choice. For potatoes, I like yellow-fleshed ones like Yukon or German Butterball, but russets will suffice.As for the double-carbohydrate, starch-on-starch nature of this soup, I regard it as a satisfying win-win.cookingAdvertisement"}

New Year\u2019s, always hard for me, felt increasingly lonely. Most of my friends are married, affianced, or gobbled up by Los Angeles, or veganism. I\u2019m 34. I\u2019m single, and always have been. I\u2019m a terrible dancer. And yet: there\u2019s virtue in stepping into the bracing cold, in shocking the blood awake and feeding the brain something new.I\u2019m firmly an indoor person, but I thought I\u2019d start off with a little natural splendor. We arrive for one of the Sunday afternoon guided walks of Wave Hill, with its striking views of the New Jersey Palisades.Turns out we are the only people on the tour. It\u2019s 16 degrees. Even Jon Snow would head inside.Later, I consider the European hornbeam tree before me, whose bare branches jut out conically, and an Asian dogwood tree, whose bark reddens in the winter. I\u2019m heartened, seeing things thrive in misery. Trees exfoliate in the winter, Tony tells us, shedding their bark in radical self-care. I imagine them opening a nice shiraz after we\u2019ve left.My fellow passengers feel differently. Everyone\u2019s bundled and exhausted, dressed for a Sunday commute, not New Year\u2019s revelry. As we pass the Statue of Liberty, foreign tourists pop onto the outer decks for quick photos, their fur-trimmed hoods flapping in the lacerating wind.In the bathroom, a man rests clanking bags of wine on either side of the sink before stepping to the urinals.George Cabon, 48, a street vendor from Staten Island, is on his way to Rockefeller Center with a shopping cart full of party hats and light-up glasses.

There\u2019s confusion. \u201cCardi\u2019s gonna have a few drinks, give her 30 minutes,\u201d the D.J. says, and puts on more music.People hit the bars, Edward Scissorhand-ing multiple glasses of champagne.

Inside it\u2019s like a David Lynch rumspringa, but with no choice at the end, just more of what you\u2019re doing.

But, frankly, after 3 a.m., New Year\u2019s takes on a homogeneous blur. People stumble on, blowing at the occasion\u2019s embers long after they\u2019ve gone out. There comes a time when you have to let a night, as you do a year, go.\u201cBodak Yellow\u201d plays softly on the radio on the ride, and I, sort of, softly, sing along.Advertisement"}

But despite his advantage in the election, Mr. Sisi has appeared intent on crushing all independent challengers even before their campaigns could start.Even if he had continued as a candidate in the election, he faced the possibility of being disqualified from the race because of the conviction.Mr. Ali\u2019s announcement came on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak and, for a time, stoked hopes for democracy in Egypt, which has been led by strongmen for most of its modern history.Now Mr. Mubarak is in peaceful retirement, having been released from custody last year, while many of the revolutionaries who helped topple him are in Mr. Sisi\u2019s jails, their hopes for democracy apparently dashed for now.Nour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The president of Senegal tweeted that he was shocked. South Africa\u2019s governing party said the comments were \u201cextremely offensive.\u201d The African Union said it was \u201cfrankly alarmed.\u201dIn Haiti, particularly, the words were greeted with pain, as the country marked the eighth anniversary of the deadly 2010 earthquake \u2014 known as the worst natural disaster of modern history, killing between 230,000 and 316,000 people and leaving 1.5 million homeless.President Jovenel Mo\u00efse attended a solemn ceremony at Titanyen, the monument to the country\u2019s earthquake victims, where thousands were buried anonymously in giant pits.\u201cThe Haitian government condemns in the strongest terms these abhorrent and obnoxious remarks which, if proven, reflect a totally erroneous and racist view of the Haitian community and its contribution to the United States,\u201d the government said, while summoning the top American diplomat in the country for clarification, and possible an apology.The fury was not limited to those countries directly mentioned, however.In Brussels, a European Union lawmaker, Gianni Pittella of Italy, told The Associated Press that Mr. Trump \u201chad forgotten to engage his brain before talking.\u201dMicha\u00eblle Jean, a former governor general of Canada who is now the secretary general of Francophonie, which comprises 84 states that share French as a language, called the comments \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\u201cIt is such an insult before humanity,\u201d Ms. Jean, a native of Haiti, who after the earthquake became Unesco\u2019s special envoy to the Caribbean nation, told the Canadian Press. \u201cFor the first representative of the United States of America to speak in such a manner is quite troubling and offensive.\u201dUnsurprisingly, some of the strongest reactions were in Africa.On Saturday morning Ghana\u2019s president weighed in, tweeting that Mr. Trump\u2019s language was \u201cextremely unfortunate.\u201d\u201cWe are certainly not a \u2018shithole country,\u2019 \u201d wrote the president, Nana Afuko-Addo. \u201cWe will not accept such insults, even from the leader of a friendly country, no matter how powerful.\u201dBotswana\u2019s government issued a statement calling the president\u2019s remark \u201chighly irresponsible, reprehensible and racist.\u201dIn September, he spoke of a country called Nambia, which does not exist. (The White House later clarified that he had meant to say Namibia.)The celebrated Haitian-American writer Edwidge Danticat said that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments gave her chilling memories of arriving to the United States in 1981, the year before federal authorities included being Haitian as one of the four increased risk factors for contracting the new, and at the time fatal, disease, H.I.V. and AIDS.\u201cAs a kid, I was beaten up in school for being Haitian,\u201d Ms. Danticat said at a literary seminar in Key West, Fla., on Friday. \u201cIn Miami, there was a boy who killed himself when his girlfriend found out he was Haitian.\u201d\u201cThere are real consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople lose their jobs. People get harassed. It\u2019s like putting a target on our backs.\u201dThe Haitian ambassador to the United States, Paul G. Altidor, told NPR on Friday it was \u201cquite regrettable that we\u2019re not discussing about the earthquake and how Haiti is moving forward.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we fear, once again Haiti finds itself in the midst of a very negative narrative in the U.S., and we are hoping this conversation will be an opportunity to address the Haiti conversation in the U.S. once and for all,\u201d he said.Across social media on Thursday night and Friday, Africans and Haitians shared pictures of beautiful beaches, tree-lined streets and glamorous tourist resorts captioned with the insult.Online and offline, in cafes and shops across Africa, some wondered why the United States had spent millions of dollars to build massive embassies in countries which Mr. Trump held in such low esteem. Others speculated that if Mr. Trump visited their countries, he might revise his assumptions. Still others said that Mr. Trump may have had a point, citing the endemic corruption, public health challenges and poverty in many African nations.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re being termed a shithole,\u201d Andrew Mataso, 55, a business executive, said on a busy street in Nairobi, Kenya.Vincent Omondi, who lives in the sprawling working-class neighborhood of Kibera, in Nairobi, pointed out that the United States had a long relationship with people from the countries Mr. Trump criticized.\u201cThe USA,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook message, \u201cwas partly built by slaves from the \u2018shithole\u2019 countries.\u201d But Mr. Omondi said poverty and economic dysfunction across Africa lent support to Mr. Trump\u2019s point.\u201cDo I care?\u201d Mr. Omondi said. \u201cNot really, but such a statement coming from the leader of the \u2018free world\u2019 should serve as a wake up call for Africans to build Africa.\u201dOyenka Nwenze, 26, a broadcaster, was stocking up on cooking ingredients for the weekend at a supermarket in the Silverbird shopping mall in Abuja, Nigeria.\u201cFor someone in that position he should know better, and he doesn\u2019t even try, he isn\u2019t attempting to expand his knowledge base,\u201d Mr. Nwenze said. \u201cIn Africa we are normal human beings.\u201dUnder rainy skies in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, many people were reflecting on the earthquake, remembering loved ones who died.Michelet Desulme, 31, a motorcycle taxi driver, said he agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of Haiti. \u201cThe way our country is,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way it\u2019s not functioning, is this what his country is like?\u201dThe State Department appeared to have gone into damage-repair mode.Not everyone accepted that gesture, and some people were fearful of speaking in opposition to what they perceived as American policy. In Dakar, Senegal, diners at a beachside restaurant that serves Moscow mules and mojitos declined to express their views about Mr. Trump, fearing they might be denied visas to visit the United States.Babacar Faye, a tailor in Dakar, tuned his radio to another station Friday morning when discussion of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments was broadcast. His remarks were not surprising, Mr. Faye said.\u201cWhite people in general don\u2019t like black people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just pretend to like us, but they don\u2019t.\u201dPhoebe Mutetsi in Kigali, Rwanda, said she was not falling for it.\u201cTrump is a troll,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is trolling the world.

Usually in this space, my colleague Mike Isaac and I chat about the week\u2019s tech news. But Mike is now fixing to become a big-time author. For the next few months, he\u2019ll be out on book leave, which leaves me free to run this show on my own!Strap in. Let\u2019s talk about some of the big stories in tech this week.It\u2019s that time of the year \u2014 CES! The world\u2019s largest technology convention is again taking place in Las Vegas, bringing thousands of nerds to see some really cool stuff that will probably never be released.I kid, but that\u2019s generally how this goes. CES used to be cool for all the new stuff companies unveiled there, but then it got so crowded that it didn\u2019t make sense to put out your product in the torrent of announcements. Now the biggest companies skip the event, so we\u2019re left with a lot of strange news from unheard-of companies.On the other hand: When the self-driving suitcase is perfected, I\u2019m buying one.When President Trump tweeted a threat of nuclear war against North Korea this month, it at the very least seemed to constitute a threat of violence that might violate Twitter\u2019s terms of service. The company has lately been trying to crack down on abusive accounts. So some people on Twitter started to wonder, would the company possibly decide that Mr. Trump had crossed the line?Sure, if Twitter barred him, he could always just go on TV and say what he had planned to tweet. But that would be slower and less automatic, and perhaps \u2014 I\u2019m going out on a limb here \u2014 he might not blurt out threats of nuclear war.This is a small slowdown, but it\u2019s not insignificant. After all, people buy new computers for speed, so being hit with a slowdown after you\u2019ve already purchased the thing is going to make lots of customers seethe.Unless the government steps in with stricter penalties, this system seems headed for catastrophe. Everything is interconnected now; it\u2019s only a matter of time until there\u2019s a hack big enough to cause widespread social and economic disruption. We should probably do something about that, maybe?The move could have wide repercussions for media outlets \u2014 which depend on Facebook for traffic \u2014 and potentially for Facebook\u2019s own bottom line. But as with all Facebook product changes, it will probably be months before we know how the move plays out. One thing is for sure: Initially, you\u2019re bound to hate it, because that\u2019s just how it goes with anything new online.O.K., that\u2019s it for now.

{"Headline": "The #MeToo Movement Hits the Circus: \u2018Grandma\u2019 the Clown Resigns", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lubin, through his lawyer, released a statement Tuesday night acknowledging and apologizing for his conduct. \u201cThe allegations,\u201d the statement said, \u201care true. What I did was wrong, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\u201dDr. Kahanovitz had told the accuser, Zoey Dunne, after receiving her letter, \u201cWe found the allegations put forth in your correspondence very disturbing.\u201d\u201cI saw this ad that said \u2018Grandma is back!,\u2019\u201d she said on Monday, \u201cand I almost threw up on the bus.\u201d\u201cI was not aware of any allegations until Friday,\u201d he said, adding that no one at the circus whom Ms. Dunne had reached out to in 2012 was still with the circus at the time that Mr. Lubin was rehired last year.Ms. Dunne said that she first met Mr. Lubin when she was touring New England with Circus Smirkus, a youth troupe that Mr. Lubin helped coach as recently as last summer. (Circus Smirkus also runs a summer camp; Mr. Lubin never taught there.)She gave the following account:During Big Apple\u2019s 2004 New York season, Mr. Lubin contacted her and offered her work with Big Apple\u2019s mini-troupe for hire. Ms. Dunne, then known as Zoey Phillips, had dreamed of a circus career. She was thrilled.\u201cAll I can remember is feeling that it was like this great mentorship opportunity,\u201d she said.But first, Mr. Lubin told her, he had another job for her: modeling, for what he described as his personal photography business.She came to Lincoln Center, and he escorted her to his trailer.The photos, Mr. Lubin explained, were for a Japanese paint-on tattoo company. First, he had her lie on a bed in a bathing suit and pretend to be sleeping. Then he showed her photos of her favorite actor, Ashton Kutcher, and told her to imagine getting ready for a date with him and to think about how excited she would feel.\u201cI felt overwhelmingly sad, not excited,\u201d Ms. Dunne recalled.Mr. Lubin told her to take off her underwear. She declined, saying she was uncomfortable.He directed her to change into a thong, spread her legs and hold a paintbrush up to her genital area. The tattoo company, he explained, would superimpose an image of a tattoo on her inner leg.To get the best angle and show the most skin, she needed to pull her underpants to the side, Mr. Lubin said.Ms. Dunne complied.Mr. Lubin paid her $100 in cash and warned her not to tell the circus, because they would be angry that he was doing outside work in their trailer.Mr. Lubin scheduled a second photo session. The night before it, Ms. Dunne said she vomited. She told him she could not make it. He insisted, saying that his clients would be mad if he did not send the second round of photos on time.Ms. Dunne returned to the trailer. Mr. Lubin told her the first round of photos had gone over well. \u201cThey told me that you\u2019re one of the sexiest girls they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he told her. Ms. Dunne posed again, and was paid another $100.Ms. Dunne\u2019s father, Tom Phillips, said that after the photo sessions, \u201cShe had a haunted look in her face that I still remember.\u201d But she told her parents that everything was fine.Then that chapter was over, and Ms. Dunne said it was as if it had never happened. Mr. Lubin made good on his offer to get her freelance work dancing and tumbling through the air on long silk streamers for Big Apple\u2019s \u201cCircus to Go.\u201d She performed with them several times, she said.But Ms. Dunne could not put the photo sessions behind her. She lost faith in herself.\u201cHe had given me these opportunities,\u201d she said, \u201cand after this happened, I started to feel that it wasn\u2019t based on my merit, and how could I have been so stupid, and really the only thing he was interested in was me as a sexual object.\u201dShe quit the circus world and drifted for several years. \u201cI just felt really confused and lost and ashamed,\u201d she said.Around 2008, while in therapy, she told her parents about the photos, Mr. Phillips said.Later in 2012, Ms. Dunne wrote to Big Apple officials that Mr. Lubin had done things to her that were \u201csexual in nature.\u201d She asked to speak to him in the presence of a Big Apple representative.

{"Headline": "In Some Countries, Facebook\u2019s Fiddling Has Magnified Fake News", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One morning in October, the editors of P\u00e1gina Siete, Bolivia\u2019s third-largest news site, noticed that traffic to their outlet coming from Facebook was plummeting.The publication had recently been hit by cyberattacks, and editors feared it was being targeted by hackers loyal to the government of President Evo Morales.As Facebook updates and tweaks its service in order to keep users glued to their screens, countries like Bolivia are ideal testing grounds thanks to their growing, internet-savvy populations. But these changes can have significant consequences, like limiting the audience for nongovernmental news sources and \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 amplifying the impact of fabricated and sensational stories.The changes are being made as the company finds itself embroiled in a larger debate over its role in spreading fake news and misinformation aimed at influencing elections in the United States and other nations.In Slovakia, where right-wing nationalists took nearly 10 percent of Parliament in 2016, publishers said the changes had actually helped promote fake news. With official news organizations forced to spend money to place themselves in the News Feed, it is now up to users to share information.A bogus news story that spread in December illustrates the problem, Mr. Struharik said. The story claimed that a Muslim man had thanked a good Samaritan for returning his lost wallet, and had warned the Samaritan of a terrorist attack that was planned at a Christmas market.The fabricated story circulated so widely that the local police issued a statement saying it wasn\u2019t true. But when the police went to issue the warning on Facebook, they found that the message \u2014 unlike the fake news story they meant to combat \u2014 could no longer appear on News Feed because it came from an official account.\u201cWe have a responsibility to the people who read, watch and share news on Facebook, and every test is done with that responsibility in mind,\u201d he said.The impact of the changes to the News Feed were also felt in Cambodia. Months into the experiment (Facebook hasn\u2019t said when it will end), Cambodians still don\u2019t know where to find trusted, established news on Facebook, said Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper.Nongovernmental organizations working on issues like education and health care also complained that the changes broke down lines of communication to Cambodians in need.Facebook has become particularly important in Cambodia. The country\u2019s leader, Hun Sen, has cracked down on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state. Journalists have been arrested, newspapers have been shut down, and Facebook has emerged as an important, more independent channel for information.That is, if you can find that information. Mr. White recalled a conversation this month with a friend who casually observed the lack of political conversation on Facebook.\u201cHe said he thought the government had banned politics on Facebook,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cHe had no idea that Facebook had created Explore or was placing news there. He\u2019s a young, urbanite, English-speaking Cambodian. If he didn\u2019t know about it, what do you think the effects are on other parts of the country?\u201dIn Bolivia, the alterations to the News Feed also occurred in a country where the government and the press have found themselves at odds, with news sites like P\u00e1gina Siete frequently criticizing Mr. Morales, a left-wing populist who has accumulated enormous power since being elected president in 2006.\u201cWe became the only media to take on the government,\u201d said Rodolfo Huallpa, the web editor of P\u00e1gina Siete. Half of the site\u2019s traffic came from social media, with the lion\u2019s share of that from Facebook, he said. Since Explore was introduced, overall web traffic to the site has dropped 20 percent.The loss of visitors from Facebook was readily apparent in October, and Mr. Huallpa could communicate with Facebook only through a customer service form letter. He received an automatic reply in return.After complaints from other outlets, Facebook eventually released a statement on a blog in Spanish explaining the Explore feature and the testing being done in Bolivia and other countries. But Facebook offered no means to contact it, Mr. Huallpa said.\u201cWe can\u2019t talk to Zuckerberg, we can\u2019t even talk to a customer service representative,\u201d said Isabel Mercado, the editor of P\u00e1gina Siete, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.The Explore experiment has reduced traffic by 30 to 60 percent at the website of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of Cochabamba, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, said Fabiola Chambi, the publication\u2019s web editor.Ms. Chambi, however, fears the main consequence of the Explore function will be deepening polarization in a country already divided by ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see things from your friends and your family, but there needs to be diversity of information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe miscellany is good.\u201dBolivia has also seen an increase in fake news as the established news sites are tucked behind the Explore function.During nationwide judicial elections in December, one post widely shared on Facebook claimed to be from an election official saying votes would be valid only if an X was marked next to the candidate\u2019s name. Another post that day said government officials had put pens with erasable ink in the voting booths.Vladimir Tirado, a social media expert in Bolivia, said the government might simply begin paying for posts to appear on users\u2019 News Feeds, an option that he said most newsrooms could not afford.\u201cWhoever has more money will appear more,\u201d Mr. Tirado said. \u201cIn this sense, the government will certainly win.\u201dMs. Chambi of Los Tiempos said her newsroom hardly had enough money to pay its journalists to report stories, let alone to distribute them as paid posts on Facebook. The situation has left her uneasy about the role that the tech giant may play in her country.\u201cIt\u2019s a private company \u2014 they have the right to do as they please, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the first question we asked is \u2018Why Bolivia?\u2019 And we don\u2019t even have the possibility of asking why. Why us?\u201dSheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco; Nicholas Casey from La Paz, Bolivia; and Paul Mozur from Shanghai. Monica Machicao contributed reporting from La Paz.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tackling the Internet\u2019s Central Villain: The Advertising Business", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSo who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online?This isn\u2019t that hard. You don\u2019t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It\u2019s the advertising business, stupid.And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain \u2014 and perhaps even reform.But the online ad machine is also a vast, opaque and dizzyingly complex contraption with underappreciated capacity for misuse \u2014 one that collects and constantly profiles data about our behavior, creates incentives to monetize our most private desires and frequently unleashes loopholes that the shadiest of people are only too happy to exploit.And for all its power, the digital ad business has long been under-regulated and under-policed, both by the companies that run it and by the world\u2019s governments. In the United States, the industry has been almost untouched by oversight, even though it forms the primary revenue stream of two of the planet\u2019s most valuable companies, Google and Facebook.\u201cIn the early days of online media, the choice was essentially made \u2014 give it away for free, and advertising would produce the revenue,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association that represents companies in the digital ad business. \u201cA lot of the things we see now flow out from that decision.\u201d\u201cTechnology has largely been outpacing the ability of individual companies to understand what is actually going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really an unregulated stock market effect to the whole thing.\u201dThe company also pointed to several steps it had taken recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our ad policies, hired more ad reviewers, and created a new team to help detect and prevent abuses,\u201d said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising. \u201cWe\u2019re also testing a tool that will bring more transparency to ads running on our platform. We know there is more work to do, but our goal is to keep people safe.\u201dA spokesman for Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, said it was constantly policing its ad system, pointing out recent steps it has taken to address problems arising from the ad business, including several changes to YouTube.The role of the ad business in much of what\u2019s terrible online was highlighted in a recent report by two think tanks, New America and Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The report chronicles just how efficient the online ad business has become at profiling, targeting, and persuading people. That\u2019s good news for the companies that want to market to you \u2014 as the online ad machine gets better, marketing gets more efficient and effective, letting companies understand and influence consumer sentiment at a huge scale for little money.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEither you have a brilliant technology that permits microtargeting to exactly the people you want to influence at exactly the right time with exactly the right message \u2014 or you\u2019re only reaching a small number of people and therefore it couldn\u2019t be influential.\u201dThe tinkering continued on Tuesday, when Facebook also said it would ban ads promoting crypto currency schemes, some of which have fallen into scammy territory.Yet these are all piecemeal efforts. They don\u2019t address the underlying logic of the ad business, which produces endless incentives for gaming the system in ways that Google and Facebook discover often only after the fact. Mr. Rothenberg said this was how regulating advertising was likely to go \u2014 a lot of fixes resembling \u201cWhac-a-Mole.\u201dOf course, there is the government. You could imagine some regulator imposing stricter standards for who has access to the online ad system, who makes money from it, how it uses private information and how transparent tech companies must be about it all. But that also seems unlikely; the Honest Ads Act, a proposal to regulate online political ads, has gone nowhere in Congress.I stand by that view, but now I also regret dismissing his warning so cavalierly. Socially, politically and culturally, the online ad business is far more dangerous than I appreciated. Mr. Cook was right, and we should have listened to him.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s still a good idea to clerk somewhere, either a print newsroom or TV network. But you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of grunt work for not a lot of pay early on. It was always a difficult field to get into. It\u2019s harder now.What\u2019s your best advice for a young journalist?Basically, outwork everybody: Start out earlier and end your day later. Go to every stakeout that you can on a story. Always make the additional phone call. When a rival beats you on a story, try to figure out how they got it and go from there. Meet with whoever asks to meet with you, although we\u2019re in a bit of a \u201cgotcha\u201d environment now, so you have to be more careful.How do you avoid burnout?I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very tired (laughs). But we\u2019re all very tired. I think that the demands of reporters now are very different. The only way to avoid burnout is to take cues from your body and your brain. If you\u2019re making mistakes in your copy, take a few extra minutes and look it over a few extra times. Double-check yourself. That doesn\u2019t really deal with the feeling of \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d but if you need to take a break, take a break.What\u2019s something that newcomers to the industry might not understand about your job?There\u2019s a difference between letting your sources take advantage of you and having good sources.What are the most important qualities in a journalist today?Not being afraid. A lot of times people are afraid of writing something because someone will get mad or they\u2019ll lose access. That can never be a concern. Ever. That was true 50 years ago, and even more so now because the culture of bullying reporters has become more intense.Here\u2019s what else is happening:There\u2019s been a lot of talk in these parts lately about marijuana.But we\u2019d like to know what you think: Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana in New York?

But its use has been restricted to small, private vehicles.President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced on Wednesday that he had instructed his minister of transportation and communications, Bruno Giuffra, to stop buses from using the hazardous road and to increase the capacity of the alternative route to accommodate buses.Inequality and poverty in Peru are high, meaning that those who rely on buses are often low-income Peruvians, while better-off people can afford to drive smaller vehicles, or share rides in them.\u201cWe\u2019ve been building roads for those who can afford cars, not for the people,\u201d said Mariana Alegre, a transit advocate who leads the organization Lima C\u00f3mo Vamos.For all its danger, the Coil of Pasamayo is an almost unavoidable part of life in Peru. It is part of the country\u2019s main highway, the Pan-American Highway, which stretches along the entire western edge of the country. This particular stretch dates to the 19th century, when it was built as a railway.Norvial did not respond to a request for comment about the condition of the roads.Lorenzo Orrego, who runs Sutran, the agency that regulates vehicular transportation, said speed was a factor in the accident on Tuesday as was a tractor-trailer that drove into the lane occupied by the bus.Mr. Giuffra, the transportation minister, said that both vehicles were moving in excess of the speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour, or about 37 miles per hour.According to statistics maintained by Luz Ambar, a transportation safety organization, eight to 10 Peruvians die each day from traffic accidents.Kevin Villalobos Rojas, 27, who was returning home on the bus after spending New Year\u2019s Day in the city of Huacho, was one of just a few survivors from the accident. Reached by phone, his brother Eric said that Mr. Villalobos was in intensive care at a hospital.\u201cThe company hasn\u2019t called us, it hasn\u2019t come to the hospital,\u201d Eric Villalobos said. \u201cAnd the government hasn\u2019t done anything either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But when I read this chilling passage \u2014 \u201cI am dementing. I am dementing. I am dementing.\u201d \u2014 from Gerda Saunders\u2019s recent memoir \u201cMemory\u2019s Last Breath: Field Notes on My Dementia,\u201d I found myself starting to panic.In a world increasingly dominated by the Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon hegemony, we hear a lot about the threat to privacy. But isn\u2019t memory just as vulnerable? Now that, as the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer writes in \u201cWorld Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech,\u201d \u201cour phone is an extension of our memory; we\u2019ve outsourced basic functions to algorithms,\u201d doesn\u2019t the world seem like an ever-larger parking lot that has mysteriously swallowed our Toyota?

Recent books by Robert Sapolsky, Michael Lemonick, Felicia Yap, Emily Barr, Dale Bredesen, Val Emmich, Oliver Sacks and Elizabeth Rosner, among others, have addressed the theme of non-historical memory. Last July alone, more than a dozen books specifically about the topic, most of them self-published, were released.You\u2019d expect the themes of amnesia or powers of recall to be prevalent in thrillers or in memoirs by trauma survivors or over-beveraged rock stars, but even literary fiction is getting in on the act. In Rachel Khong\u2019s sly, diaristic \u201cGoodbye, Vitamin,\u201d a 30-year-old who moves back home learns she has to care for a dementing father who has started leaving his pants in trees.

I recently spent a month trying to follow the dictates of two of them, both written by doctors: Daniel G. Amen\u2019s \u201cMemory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss and Remember What Matters Most\u201d and Andrew E. Budson and Maureen K. O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cSeven Steps to Managing Your Memory: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not, and What to Do About It.\u201dThe first thing I noticed about these two workbook-type tomes is, because they\u2019re not intended to be read straight through, they repeat information so frequently as to render a reader frantic about his mental health. I kept wanting to ask Dr. Amen, a physician with his own chain of clinics: Didn\u2019t you pimp turmeric 10 pages ago? Before reading the books, I\u2019d taken eight memory tests that I\u2019d found on various websites, to get a baseline of my powers of recall.

Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor, who teach neurology at Boston University, don\u2019t even stipulate that it needs to be unsweetened.)For me, the doctors\u2019 bodily prescriptions fell into two categories: Things I Already Do, and Things I Can\u2019t Be Bothered to Change. On the former front: I dance two hours a week, walk briskly 30 minutes a day and consume a lot of vegetables and water but not much alcohol or butter. On the latter: Hands off my trusty colleagues caffeine and baked goods, not to mention my occasional visitors, Mr. Charred Meats and Ms. Marijuana.When it came to recommended activities, this Scrabble enthusiast was dismayed to learn from Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor that \u201cthere is not currently strong enough evidence for us to suggest the use of brain-training games.\u201d Rather, they encourage you to learn new skills or information while being social. To this end, I took an Iyengar yoga class. I chatted up a friend about the recent Mayweather-McGregor boxing bout. I had a CVS employee show me how to use a price scanner, and a church employee tell me what an undercroft is. (\u201cAre we in the undercroft now?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes, we\u2019re in the undercroft,\u201d he told me. I felt like I\u2019d wandered into a young adult novel about hot, troubled teens who foil the time-space continuum.)In a similar vein, Dr. Amen encourages you to undertake various activities while using your non-dominant hand. Slight splattery mayhem ensued in my kitchen one night when I tried to slice 30 or so cherry tomatoes in half with my left hand for a salad. It looked like an audience at La Scala had had very strong feelings about our floor tiles.Two of the books\u2019 dictates seemed like they were demonstrably working. First, Dr. Amen recommends that you spend 15 minutes a day in deep prayer or meditation, which \u201creliably activates the prefrontal cortex.\u201d Of the 30 days I tried meditating \u2014 I stare at a spot on the wall, and repeatedly clear my mind \u2014 I was unable to focus eight times and fell asleep once. But two of the sessions led to the most productive workdays I\u2019ve had all year.I also noticed good results with memorization techniques wherein you create images in your mind. One of these is a rhyme that runs, \u201cOne is a bun, two is a shoe, three is a tree\u201d and so on up to 10. Thus, if given a list of words to memorize that starts \u201csally, smokey, desperate,\u201d I\u2019d first imagine the \u201cAll in the Family\u201d co-star Sally Struthers bursting from a hot dog bun; then a pair of shoes being barbecued; and then a tree whose roots spell out \u201ckill me now.\u201d Equally effective was imagining walking through our apartment and finding the 10 words, in groups of two or three, in various rooms. So, I\u2019d imagine opening our front door and finding Sally Struthers, on fire, playing a nonspeaking juror on \u201cLaw and Order.\u201dIn the end? I will probably keep meditating. I will definitely keep imagining 1970s sitcom stars emerging from breadstuffs. To celebrate my gains, I thought about buying Robert Wright\u2019s \u201cWhy Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.\u201d But, given my attention deficit, the better bet might be Mike McCormack\u2019s much-lauded novel \u201cSolar Bones,\u201d about an Irishman ruminating, Molly Bloom-style, on his whole life: It\u2019s written as one sentence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of the Federal Government in the Ranchlands of Oregon", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "FeatureTwo years after the standoff at the Malheur Refuge, many people in the region remain convinced that their way of life is being trampled.Supported byThe ground was snow-covered when I visited John Day last winter and the temperature below freezing. I was there to attend a meeting organized by Jeanette Finicum, the widow of LaVoy Finicum, an Arizona rancher who was shot and killed by government agents a year earlier. LaVoy was a leader of the Malheur occupation. He left the refuge for a speaking engagement in John Day with plans to return, but he was shot three times at an F.B.I. roadblock. For that reason, his widow was calling this event \u201cThe Meeting That NEVER Happened.\u201dThe town of John Day isn\u2019t much more than a two-lane road through end-of-frontier brick buildings and is barely two square miles in size. A \u201cclosed\u201d sign hung from the Ranch and Rodeo Museum, and the only vacancy was at a motel called Dreamers Lodge. Just west of town, off the Journey Through Time Scenic Byway, were the John Day fossil beds, where the remains of saber-toothed tigers and small horses were dug up from 30-million-year-old volcanic ash. To the east, replicas of covered wagons stood on the side of the road.I pulled up next to a minivan in the parking lot of Americas Best Value Inn. Three women stepped out. The driver wore American flag earrings and a Christmas sweater, her hair piled on her head. She was a candy-company representative in Boise and had driven to John Day with a trunk full of Mentos. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the media is absolute crap,\u201d the driver said. We walked down the street, to the Outpost restaurant, and over lunch, she described what was happening in eastern Oregon as a \u201ctruth insurrection.\u201d One of her companions, a delicate, elderly lady with long white hair, told me that she attended protests during the federal siege at Ruby Ridge, followed the killings at Waco and took an interest in the Bundys during the occupation. All three believed the government could come to their homes anytime and shoot them. \u201cSomeone please needs to get this story right,\u201d the elderly lady said. When I showed her my tape recorder, she gave me a high five. She figured I couldn\u2019t twist her words now. \u201cSometimes it happens,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth will end up in The New York Times. But your editors will probably mess it up.\u201d I asked what truth she had in mind. \u201cWell, for one thing,\u201d she said, \u201cLaVoy was not \u2018killed\u2019; he was \u2018murdered.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe meeting was up the road at the Grant County Fairgrounds, in a building called the Trowbridge Pavilion, where every summer local residents gathered to show prizewinning livestock. The parking lot was crowded with pickup trucks mounted with Don\u2019t Tread on Me flags and decorated in stickers that read, \u201cLaVoy\u201d or \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d The crowd was all white, a mix of ranchers, farmers, loggers, miners, firefighters and hard-right Mormons from Idaho, Utah and Arizona. There were as many women as men, lots of families and children. People wore T-shirts that read #libertyrevolution. A few dozen self-proclaimed militia members, mostly representatives from the Oath Keepers and the Oregon Three Percenters, were there, as well as members of the Finicum family and the Bundy family. I recognized occupiers from their mug shots. A few people carried guns to show their support of the Second Amendment. Many had traveled from out of state, and some had driven through the night, on bad roads and through dangerous weather, and spent money on hotels and food they could not really afford, they said. Why? They told me their livelihood was at stake.A long line formed to get in the door, and I started a conversation with Robin Olson and her 18-year-old daughter, Emily. Robin had long hair and bangs that brushed against the frame of her glasses. The Olsons lived in Powell Butte, a town of less than 2,000 people in central Oregon, not far from where I grew up. \u201cThis is the West,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is the real West. If only everyone could see it.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I asked.\u201cTo support the ranchers and farmers who feel like the people they are feeding are trying to destroy them. The people in the cities and suburbs just don\u2019t get it.\u201dEmily was a member of the Central Oregon Patriots (COP), a conservative grass-roots organization that rose out of the Tea Party. Its members intended to push back against environmental regulations that they believed hindered economic growth. They wanted the local community to make the decisions, not the federal government. \u201cWe are not a militia,\u201d Emily said, \u201cbut everyone calls us a militia. I\u2019m probably the only person under 60 in the group, and I\u2019ve been called a terrorist. Can you believe it?\u201dThe building was about the size of a gymnasium, and inside an American flag that looked big enough to be a parachute hung behind a small stage equipped with a podium and a projector screen. In exhibit booths, people bought copies of books on patriot ideology, including an end-times novel by LaVoy Finicum and a biography of the rancher Cliven Bundy, Ammon\u2019s father, by Shawna Cox, another Malheur occupier. \u201cThe rural people don\u2019t have power to stand up against this mighty army that\u2019s coming up against them,\u201d Cox told me.The Finicum family sat on one side of the stage and the Bundys on the other. Three members of the Bundy family \u2014 Cliven, Ammon and his brother Ryan \u2014 were at the Nevada Southern Detention Facility in Pahrump. After the Malheur occupation, 26 of the occupiers were charged with federal conspiracy. The Bundy brothers and five others were acquitted in October 2016, but the Bundys and their father were in detention for their role in a 2014 standoff with the Bureau of Land Management at the Bundy ranch. Each faced more than a dozen charges for stopping a federally mandated impoundment of Cliven\u2019s cattle as payment for fines and fees, including conspiracy, assaulting and threatening federal officers and obstruction of justice. Ammon\u2019s mother, Carol, was in attendance at the meeting, as was his wife, Lisa, who had told me she didn\u2019t know that Ammon intended to occupy the refuge until she saw a livestream on YouTube. In the video, her husband stood on the back of a truck bed and told a crowd about his plans. Lisa got Ammon on the phone. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Just trust me, honey, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything that God didn\u2019t tell me to do.\u2019\u2009\u201dAbout 650 people showed up at the meeting that afternoon, and tens of thousands of viewers watched on Facebook Live. The building was dimly lit, and cold air blew through door. The evening\u2019s M.C. was Trent Loos, a sixth-generation farmer from central Nebraska, best known among patriots for hosting \u201cLoos Tales Podcasts\u201d and \u201cRural Route Radio,\u201d shows about rural America. Loos wore a red neckerchief and a leather vest over a button-down shirt tucked into jeans that fit snugly over riding boots. He spoke in the quick, clipped manner of an auctioneer.These patriots were right-wing populists who felt they were losing power. Many in the crowd expressed excitement about President Donald Trump and advocated for the transfer of federal lands to local control. They blamed environmentalists for the decline of rural culture and talked about the Endangered Species Act as a government conspiracy meant to drive ranchers off the land.LaVoy\u2019s widow, Jeanette Finicum, had thick white hair with a fringe of bangs. Her loose black T-shirt read, \u201cIt matters how you stand,\u201d a quote from LaVoy. A pin near her breast read, \u201cI am the virus,\u201d referencing a quote from Oregon\u2019s longtime Democratic senator Ron Wyden, who described the ideology of the occupiers as a virus after they were arrested. She was a soft-spoken mother of 12, and at one point, she stepped onstage to share a video montage that included images of armed federal agents and burning cars, followed by \u201cpeaceful\u201d images of cowboys, including LaVoy and Ryan Bundy. \u201cI ask: Who are the real terrorists?\u201d she said to the crowd.KrisAnne Hall, a 48-year-old lawyer and former prosecutor, was the evening\u2019s keynote speaker. Hall averages 260 speaking engagements a year; the Southern Poverty Law Center once included her on its list of 998 anti-government groups and figures in the United States. She teaches that almost every federal agency, other than the military, is unconstitutional. \u201cDo you think the federal government is out of control?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe need to wake up. Nothing needs to happen except America needs to have a revolution of the mind.\u201dKate Dalley of a Utah affiliate of Fox News Radio wore heels and a red trench. \u201cI want to talk about truth in media,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI know you laugh when I say that, because it\u2019s kind of an oxymoron.\u201d The media, she told us, was controlled and infiltrated, and the scripts were already written by the powers that be. She talked about the history of journalists working for the C.I.A. \u201cThey included journalists from The New York Times, Time magazine, which was already bought and sold by the elite anyway, The Washington Post, TV networks like CBS.\u201d Robin Olson leaned forward and gave me a pat on the arm. \u201cIt will be O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still like you.\u201dI thought about this photograph when I first returned and began speaking with the people. After only a few generations living here, what made them feel the land so completely belonged to them?Robin Olson told me that a lot of the region\u2019s thinking about politics in the West originated from a publication called Range magazine. \u201cWhat you will find,\u201d she told me, \u201cis that it was never about the sage grouse, never about the spotted owl and never about the wolf. It was about getting people off the land.\u201d I asked Robin about the sage grouse, whose population had plummeted from 16 million to a few hundred thousand, and she told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think they are really endangered.\u201d The sage grouse \u201cjust happened to live in almost every Western state\u201d and that\u2019s why \u201cthe government chose it.\u201dRange could be found in almost every grocery and tack store in rural Oregon. The glossy quarterly claims a readership of around 170,000, half of them ranchers and farmers in the rural West. Range, its website says, is \u201cdevoted to the issues that threaten the West, its people, lands and wildlife,\u201d and it intends to \u201chalt the depletion of a natural resource, the American cowboy.\u201d In an article from 2012, the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl are described as tools \u201cused by radical environmentalists and government agents to destroy the timber industry in the 1990s.\u201d The publication calls Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cSilent Spring\u201d a work of liberal propaganda. It is critical of the concept of global warming and suggests the real concern is global cooling. The magazine published features on the Malheur occupation and articles supporting the Bundys\u2019 fight against the federal control of Western land.In many ways, it seemed, the people were constructing their ideas of the land upon a fantasy of the past. In the 2003 book \u201cWhere Land and Water Meet: A Western Landscape Transformed,\u201d Nancy Langston, an environmental historian, writes about how each wave of white settlers to the Malheur ignored the history preceding their own. When Peter French first arrived in 1872, Langston writes, \u201cthe place had seemed nearly empty to him, and indeed it was this apparent emptiness that made the watershed such a fine place to establish an empire.\u201d Of course, the land was not empty at all, but belonged to the Paiute Indian tribe, which had been living in the region for at least 13,000 years. In the decades after the land was designated a wildlife refuge in 1908, under the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, conservationists built dikes, storage dams, canals, ditches and channels, and sprayed rotenone, an aquatic poison, to kill invasive carp. All these manipulations were done to make the Malheur seem wild again, the way it was before white settlers arrived.In the 1970s, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act shifted the focus of the Bureau of Land Management from resource extraction to conservation. The policy marked the beginning of the Sagebrush Rebellion, a grass-roots revolt among ranchers, loggers and miners against environmental laws, like the 1964 Wilderness Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Rural communities believed these new restrictions and regulations undermined their prosperity and shifted the fate of small-town economies into the hands of the federal government. If an endangered species lived on the range, for example, the bureau could decide to cut cattle numbers. Such protections fueled theories that the government was trying to eliminate ranchers to control the land.The history of Oregon is filled with stories of violent and racist groups. Communes, cults, alternative religious communities, militias: The state has been home to nearly 300 of them since 1856, including the Christian Identity movement, Posse Comitatus, Aryan Nations and the Roy Masters\u2019 Foundation of Human Understanding. African-Americans were legally barred from residence in Oregon until 1926; the state, according to some historians, was essentially founded as a kind of white utopia. No one in my family, three generations of Oregonians, had ever heard about that.When my mother revised her understanding of the past, her romance with the West came to an end. A few years ago, she decided to start using the word \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the fate of the American Indians at the hands of white settlers. My grandparents had been involved in cults and fringe religious groups, and my mother and father attended past-life readings. One day she handed me a stack of these readings. On these pages was a story scribbled in the curvy cursive loops of the religious leader who told my mother that she had once been a brave pioneer on the edge of the Western frontier defending hard-won land from the onslaught of Indians.For many years, my family made it a habit to drive out to places like the Malheur and other remote areas. We carried rock picks. We found artifacts and fossils in the cracked mud of dry lake beds. We searched behind the high school baseball diamond in Fossil for the imprints of ancient ferns and crawled through buildings abandoned by the cult of the Rajneeshee. We saw arrowheads scattered on land where scientists uncovered the bones of ice-age sloths. We dug up an agatized root and dragged it home. We slept under the stars or in a trailer my father sometimes hitched to the truck. My mother filled my backpack with survival gear, and my father always carried a loaded gun. We cut down trees where we saw one; built a fire where we wanted one; slept on the ground in the valleys, among the sagebrush, near Indian burial sites. The eastern Oregon desert felt like a world that belonged to me. I felt antipathy toward visitors; even a lone hiker on the trail felt like a disturbance. In these moments, I figured that I, too, had arrived to an empty place. The rest of the world, the rest of America, were distant news.At 7 a.m. one day last January, there were more tractors on the road than cars. Cattle huddled in the snow-covered fields. I drove beneath a wood ranch gate, fitted with steer horns, and Cronin stepped out of his house to greet me in the driveway. He was a blue-eyed, 68-year-old, with a white goatee, wearing a plaid Elmer Fudd hat, baggy bluejeans and a mossy-oak camo coat with matching gaiters. His wife, Gay, made coffee in the kitchen, and their son Dirk loaded frozen hay bales onto a tractor bed. This was Cronin\u2019s \u201chome ranch,\u201d where he housed his cattle in the winter and provided shelter for their newborns. In the spring, he gathered the cattle in trailers the size of semis and hauled them north, into the Malheur National Forest, where he owned 320 acres of land. He also had a permit that allowed him to graze his cattle for five and a half months of the year, usually June to October, on lands in the Malheur managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Every year he and Gay attended a required meeting to discuss the terms of their permit. Usually, the Forest Service decided how many cattle he could let out on the range and for how long. If an endangered species lived on the federal land, the terms of the permit were subject to change.Cronin told me that he wasn\u2019t at the Meeting That NEVER Happened because he was advised by his lawyer not to attend. He called the Bundy takeover of the refuge a protest and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that. He was quiet for a minute. \u201cWell, they probably shouldn\u2019t have taken over that refuge, but what I liked about it was that it got this conversation going about government overreach. People wouldn\u2019t believe it otherwise.\u201d He remembered the day the F.B.I. came to Burns and barricades went up at the courthouse. The school turned into a staging ground. He said the town looked like \u201csomething out of that \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 movie, for Christ sakes\u201d and that \u201cit was World War III in Harney County.\u201dJoe and Gay didn\u2019t travel much because the cattle always needed to be looked after. In Burns, they didn\u2019t have a local radio station, and they got their news when they could from television. Cronin didn\u2019t attend college, and the farthest east he had traveled was Boise, Idaho. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out here all my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my degree.\u201d Joe had the sleep cycle of a lumberjack, waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning and going to bed around 7 in the evening. It was what his family had always done. In 1955, Joe\u2019s dad took a job at the Edward Hines sawmill, which purchased a 67,400-acre tract of timber in the Malheur National Forest. Burns was a vibrant timber town until around 1973 when the mill started laying off workers, and the unemployment rate in Harney County reached 30 percent. The mill closed after the Forest Service restricted the cutting of old-growth forest in the mid-1990s. For-sale signs went up and people moved away. Cronin graduated from high school in 1968 with about 120 people in his class, and his grandson\u2019s class will graduate with about half that many. The biggest employers in the region are now the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and other government agencies. Cronin was in the logging business for years, but it was hard to make ends meet. He bought a small ranch in 1994. He started with four cows, and after 10 years those four cows turned into a 600-head operation. He didn\u2019t use antibiotics or hormones, and his cattle were grass-fed, no fertilizers in the field. Each calf was born into his open arms.After he fed the cows, he took me for a drive on some icy back roads. Near Rattlesnake Creek, we stopped to gaze at a herd of half-starved mule deer. \u201cOur main problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis with the Fish and Wildlife Service.\u201d A few years ago the agency found the bull trout was vulnerable, including on the river that runs through Cronin\u2019s land and determined grazing cattle endangered the fish\u2019s spawning grounds.\u201cThey say the cows are killing the fish,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a vehicle to remove cattle off national forest. I can\u2019t see anything wrong with that river. I think the government science is slanted.\u201d Cronin asked a riparian ecologist who had been at the University of Montana to run an independent analysis of Little Crane Creek, where his livestock grazed. \u201cHe said that it was one of the healthiest riparian areas he\u2019s ever studied,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cExcellent shape.\u201d The ecologist sent a copy to Cronin and another to the Forest Service office in John Day. \u201cNever heard anything about it,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hurting that stream, I want to know about it. I just don\u2019t understand it. They are saying the numbers are down. I think there ought to be an independent study. We just get the feeling that the science is out of touch all together.\u201dCronin\u2019s friend David Torrence came up the road in a pickup. People called him \u201cBig Hat.\u201d He wore a gray hoodie and a pretty big hat. There were two Chihuahuas in the passenger seat. He and Cronin caught up on the weather and chatted about the bald eagles in the canyon. \u201cThe Forest Service didn\u2019t let us haul logs in the canyon,\u201d Cronin told me, \u201cbecause of those birds. They said the trucks were waking up the birds. Look at all of them.\u201dBig Hat asked about me. Cronin looked my way. \u201cShould I say it?\u201d he said. He meant my New York Times affiliation. Big Hat got out of his truck, stuck his sun-wrinkled face in the open window and folded his arms over the door. He asked about the meeting I attended in John Day. \u201cWas there any violence or anything?\u201d he said.\u201cThere was no violence,\u201d I said.\u201cYou know, Trump,\u201d Big Hat said, \u201che has been having all this with the media, you know? How they twist [expletive] up and everything? I was watching the news, and it showed a local reporter who was at the meeting. She told Jeanette [Finicum] she was expecting violence and demonstrations, you know? Jeanette was all teary-eyed, and she said: \u2018Hey, we are not outlaws. We are not criminals. We are full-blooded American ranchers. We don\u2019t want no violence.\u2019\u2009\u201d He pointed at me. \u201cYou people are talking about violence and the meeting hasn\u2019t even started? We just think that the government got too much control.\u201d He opened his mouth and shook his head. \u201cWe just want to live our lives.\u201d\u201cI told her my story,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI get up at 3 a.m. and start watching Fox News. I\u2019m so pissed off by 5 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cFox News is a good channel.\u201d Big Hat said he voted as a Democrat until Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cTrump has been the best guy we\u2019ve dealt with in 30 years,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cI voted for Trump. But all my sisters and stuff are all pissed off at me because I\u2019d been a Democrat.\u201dCronin switched parties because of gun control in the \u201980s. \u201cI went right up to the courthouse and changed to a Republican.\u201d He tapped the gun on the dashboard: a .22 Magnum he\u2019d packed for 30 years. \u201cI don\u2019t have a permit to carry concealed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those guys who wants you to see my goddamn gun. See where it\u2019s at. Almost put it away for you but thought, No, she just needs to see me the way I am. It\u2019s part of our lifestyle.\u201dCronin brushed some hay from his shoulder. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI know The New York Times, they don\u2019t like anything Trump does. When he was elected though, oh, my God, maybe something will start happening to help us out here. I\u2019m just looking at natural-resource uses. Out here, no one has ever done anything for us. We are saying what\u2019s happening and nobody is listening and nobody cares. Nobody back East loses one second of sleep over two ranchers. They said we\u2019re bad guys.\u201dLater that day, Cronin and his wife took me to see the spot where LaVoy Finicum was shot. There were elk tracks in the thickets and ice on the roads. He pointed out the dying trees with bare branches and yellow needles. \u201cThe forest doesn\u2019t look like this on our property,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s side of the fence looks like [expletive].\u201dCronin stopped the truck. He pointed to a smear of red spray paint in the snow.\u201cThat\u2019s probably where he died right there.\u201dMy parents ended up here only because they were hippies who wanted to live off the land. My induction to the land began with my parents, but my introduction to the culture began at Tumalo Elementary School. The kids were sons of farmers and ranchers, and they wore work boots to school and talked about their heads of cattle, their prize livestock for breeding, their acres of wheat. I wanted nothing more than to become like them. After school, I attended 4-H meetings, learned to shoot a rifle and traveled door to door with my Christian friend to warn neighbors that if they didn\u2019t believe in Jesus they might burn in hell. Despite my efforts, I never felt fully part of the culture. I tried to hide my liberal parents, who refused to buy me livestock, any livestock, for 4-H competitions. I was stuck showing guinea pigs. Every week I visited the guinea-pig lady\u2019s house to learn how to brush and clean prizewinning rodents. At the fair, my guinea pig won nothing. In fifth grade, I wanted to try rodeo. All the kids started with mutton busting, which meant sitting on a sheep while it ran. I tried riding a sheep that my friend found in a field, but I got bucked from it and broke my wrist. After that, the kids praised me. I associate those years most fondly with thrill and violence: that wrist bone I cracked beneath the weight of a sheep, the electric horse fence I gripped in the rain, the day I put my hand inside a pregnant, laboring sheep and pulled out a living creature.After a three-hour drive west on Highway 20, I was back in Tumalo. It was still a quaint town, dotted with juniper trees, centered on the general store, but it had been overtaken by a fancy coffee house and a yoga studio. I wanted to cry. I visited my elementary school and took a few pictures of the playground, but a man chased me off. I felt a kind of native antipathy toward Bend, which had more than doubled in population since I was a kid and spurred the growth of nearby towns.That week, Robin Olson, from the meeting in John Day, had invited me to a high-school wrestling match in Redmond, not far from Tumalo. It was Crook County versus Redmond, longtime rivals. The gymnasium of Redmond High School was dark. The bleachers were crowded with ranchers, miners and loggers. A single lamp hung over a vinyl wrestling mat. Some of these kids get up at 4 a.m. to work the ranch, go to school and then wrestle at night. I\u2019d been to this gymnasium before to watch family and friends wrestle on the mat.Robin\u2019s nephew was going to wrestle that night. She told me that they had been on their way to a wrestling tournament at Burns during the occupation at the wildlife refuge the night her son, Daniel, decided he wanted to meet Ammon Bundy. They drove to Malheur, and Daniel asked Bundy to autograph a pocket constitution. At the gym, about halfway through the night, her nephew stepped onto the mat. The Crook County boys pointed their arms at the mat to send energy into the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much wrestling,\u201d Olson explained, \u201cas it is a religious experience.\u201d The boys grabbed at each other, wiggled in and out of headlocks. Their skin was luminous with sweat. In the end, her nephew walked off defeated.\u201cWe are just out here trying to survive,\u201d Olson told me. \u201cWe have been preserving the land for the last 100 years, but now you are telling us we won\u2019t preserve it? How do we get along with the people who are trying to take away everything precious to us?\u201dRobin\u2019s daughter Emily had been an active member of 4-H. She once competed in the Crook County Fair. In 2014, she went to New York City for a choir trip, and she thought it was \u201call right.\u201d Most Thursday nights, Emily attended a Central Oregon Patriots meeting at the Calvary Baptist Church off Main Street in Prineville. On Feb. 2, I joined Emily there, along with her mother and her grandparents. It was snowing and 15 below zero. The wind burned your skin. The adult Bible-study room where we gathered was warm and brightly lit. The walls were covered in Jesus posters.A couple of dozen members sat around foldout tables set with vinyl tablecloths. They recited the Pledge of Allegiance and said a prayer thanking God for this day and for the snow. The group had been meeting for six years and every year held a raffle. They raffled a gun once in a while and a freezer full of meat at Christmas. On the Fourth of July they handed out pocket constitutions. Tom Case, the chairman of the group, crossed his arms. \u201cYou might have heard we are a militia,\u201d he said to me. He pointed to Darlene, a woman in her 70s with short gray hair and large prescription glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a dangerous lady,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see her with a broom in her hands.\u201d Everybody in the room laughed.\u201cAnother thing you might hear,\u201d Darlene said, \u201cis that we are trying to take land away from the federal government, and we are not. We just want to work with them. See, if you\u2019re a patriot, you\u2019re automatically evil. You\u2019ve seen that. Look around the table. A lot of us know how to shoot a gun, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\u201cOregon Wild would say we are a shadow government,\u201d Case said. Oregon Wild, a conservation group, had lobbied to expand wilderness and recreation areas in the 845,000-acre Ochoco National Forest near Prineville. The potential of that forest as an engine of economic growth gnawed at the members. To fight federal regulations in the Ochoco forest, the patriots helped form a political-action committee that drafted a proposal called the Crook County Natural Resources Plan, which argued for \u201ccoordination,\u201d a process that would allow state, county and other lower-level governments to give input to federal agencies\u2019 land-use plans. The 59-page resource plan favored extractive use of public lands, called for no reduction in cattle numbers, asked that forests be logged following a wildfire and requested that lands previously open to mining remain open.\u201cWe have to do everything we can to preserve our culture and community,\u201d another said, \u201cso that we all don\u2019t fade away to Portland for a job.\u201dA woman named Kristin Thomas told us she was new to the patriots. She was a vegetarian with long blond hair who read Shakespeare and had attended Juilliard for stage acting.Thomas shared a story about her father\u2019s life as a commercial fisherman on the Indian River in Florida. She told us that his business collapsed after the \u201cban the nets\u201d movement that eliminated the use of gill nets in the 1990s. \u201cThe media twisted everything,\u201d she said, \u201csaying that my father caught dolphins and sea turtles in his nets. We took care of our river, and we didn\u2019t overfish, but we were always the bad guys. The day after \u2018ban the nets,\u2019 my dad\u2019s best friend died of a heart attack, one of my friends hung himself, another shot himself.\u201d The room was quiet. Darlene jumped in with her own story. The Forest Service was going to shut down a ranger station that she had visited every year since she was a child. She lifted her glasses and wiped her eyes.After the meeting ended, the patriots drove to McDonald\u2019s, as they did every Thursday night, because it was the only restaurant open past 9 p.m. They pushed tables together and ate soft-serve ice cream. Everyone ordered vanilla.Robin and Emily were headed home to Powell Butte and suggested that I follow them on the Ochoco Highway until it intersected with Highway 20. Emily rode with me in my passenger seat. When we reached the intersection, Olson called Emily and said she was going to lead me through the snowstorm, to Burns. I tried to stop her. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Emily said. \u201cShe\u2019s going all the way.\u201dWe drove for hours through the dark. I could see nothing ahead but the churning snow and the distant glow of brake lights. The road was straight and flat and populated by rabbits. We heard a thump. \u201cI killed something,\u201d I said. Emily smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bunny,\u201d she said.The Forest Service offices for the Malheur National Forest are on the outskirts of John Day in a building decorated with big topographical maps, Smokey Bear posters and replicas of old skulls in glass viewing cases. The office worked with 60 ranchers, including Joe Cronin. When I sat down with Steve Beverlin, the forest supervisor for the Malheur National Forest, I asked about the ranchers who didn\u2019t trust the government. Beverlin looked surprised. \u201cNone of our permittees attended the Finicum event in John Day,\u201d he said. \u201cOur employees all have a good relationship with all the permittees. They don\u2019t talk like that. They recognize the laws of the United States.\u201dI told Beverlin that I\u2019d spent time with one of his permittees, and he did talk like that. Beverlin asked who it was, and I told him it was Joe Cronin. He shrugged. It was the first he\u2019d heard of it. I asked about Cronin\u2019s riparian report. He said they probably had it somewhere. \u201cThe split caused by the Bundys in Burns will take generations to heal,\u201d he told me.That week, Cronin was out at his summer range, deep in the Malheur National Forest with his cows, sleeping in an old homesteader\u2019s cabin. Blue and violet-colored sagebrush spread east, north, south and west. The nights were cold. There was no internet, no cellphone service, no potable water. The bathroom was an outhouse. It was about as desolate a spot as you could find.I met Cronin and Gay in the town of Seneca, population 197, and followed them down an old logging road for two hours into the woods. Along the way, Cronin stopped his truck, got out and pointed at a sign. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to pay attention to this.\u201d The sign reminded fishermen to release bull trout, which have been listed as \u201cthreatened,\u201d or they would be fined. That was all. Cronin climbed back into his truck.The landscape shifted from dark forests to sunlit meadows. About every half-hour we came across a gathering of cows. There was one spot on a hill where cellphones picked up service. Cronin ran to it in his spurs and cowboy hat, stood on the highest point and caught up on some business. Gay sat in my rental car and led me the rest of the way, over washboard roads that turned into something like a dry riverbed, clotted with boulders and jagged rock. We barely made it.Cronin called the settlement Cow Camp. It was a mix of trailers, trucks, old farm equipment and homesteader shacks. He and Gay slept in the original homestead, a one-room cabin. The wood was gray and cracked. Sparrows built nests in the awnings and small animals burrowed beneath a sagging fence. Inside, bright, buttery pine boards covered the walls. There was a queen bed with a quilt and two gun racks.Cronin searched for his glasses and smoothed a topographical map of the Malheur National Forest over the top of the dining table. On the map, his private property, 320 acres, was marked in blue. It was a small island in a sea of green, which was the public land where he had a grazing permit. Cronin\u2019s allotment of grazing land was divided into eight pastures, and the North Fork of the Malheur River ran through one pasture called Mountain Unit.The Forest Service had just started limiting use on one of Cronin\u2019s pastures to protect bull-trout habitat. The agency wanted Cronin to keep his cattle out of the creek, which is an important spawning grounds for the fish. Cronin tried, but he couldn\u2019t keep the cows out unless he fenced off the whole pasture. He needed that pasture if the calves were going to gain enough weight. Cronin asked the agency if he could fence off the creek instead, and they agreed. But then he would have to find another water source. There were springs running beneath the ground that would be easy enough to dig up. But he needed permission and the process would take months.\u201cIf they are going to take away my permit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I disagree with that, without just compensation. O.K., are you going to compensate me for it? Do you want to buy from us so we are never on there again?\u201dCronin sat down and pulled off his boots. The hardships of ranching showed in his body. Cronin had cracked his neck when a horse bucked him, and two months later he was hit by a tree branch and suffered a concussion.\u201cI just don\u2019t believe the science,\u201d he said.He turned to his wife. \u201cWhat do you think, Gay? Do you think the bull trout is endangered?\u201d\u201cIf they were endangered,\u201d she said, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be able to go out and count them.\u201dJoe Cronin said he contacted Trent Loos, the radio host and M.C. of the meeting in John Day, to talk about regulations on federal land. \u201cI hear that Loos has Trump\u2019s ear,\u201d Cronin told me, \u201cso Trump will know some of the issues out here we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dFor dinner, Cronin cooked a beef brisket the size of a football on an outdoor grill and talked about global warming. In elementary school, the teachers told him that the earth might plunge into another ice age, and the news had scared him, but then the ice age never happened. He thought it would be the same with global warming: It would never happen. He mentioned the petrified oak trees dug up nearby, and he said that oak trees only grow in warm climates. \u201cThe point is,\u201d he said, \u201ca million years ago it was a hell of a lot warmer climate then than now.\u201dCronin poured meat juice on his dogs\u2019 food. \u201cYou got to get that Range magazine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis article on why global warming was a farce had graphs and everything.\u201d In the article, the author accused scientists of installing temperature-monitoring devices near asphalt to record higher temperatures. \u201cI assume it\u2019s all fact-checked,\u201d Cronin said.The day before, white supremacists gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. A man named James Fields drove into a crowd of counterprotesters and killed a 32-year-old woman. I said that the white supremacists had seemed to channel Trump\u2019s vision of America. Had it shifted Cronin\u2019s thinking at all?He and Gay had been out on the range and hadn\u2019t heard about the event.That night I slept in a R.V. trailer next to the cabin. Inside was a cowboy hat, a handgun and some soiled clothes. Cronin told me the wolves in the area didn\u2019t always kill to eat but left whole carcasses behind. I didn\u2019t sleep well. During the night, a fog rolled over Cow Camp, and in the morning before the sun rose, I could barely see. I heard Cronin in the corral, getting the horses ready to ride. They were running in circles. When the sun came out, the fog brightened and it looked heavy like smoke. Cronin was inside it, waving at me. It looked like a dream, like we were all burning alive.In October, the Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, and his team announced their intent to amend 98 science-based sage-grouse management plans in 10 states, a plan that favored resource extraction over conservation. Trent Loos was selected as a member of Trump\u2019s agricultural-advisory team, a committee of rural representatives that intends to mobilize support in communities and reduce environmental regulations. In December, Trump announced the largest federal land reduction in United States history, including almost half of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. Escalante\u2019s once-seamless expanse of protected land was divided into three separate monuments.Kristen Thomas, the member of the Central Oregon Patriots from Florida, had written a letter to Ammon Bundy in prison, and he\u2019d written back. She had chatted to Ryan Bundy over a livestream while he sat in prison. She loved listening to the Bundy boys talk, she told me when we spoke on the phone this summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown a lot deeper,\u201d she said. \u201cThe movement is solidifying.\u201d Thomas had been learning about F.B.I.-informant behavior, training, tactics and goals \u2014 how to go in and implode a movement, how to create chaos, how to divide a people \u2014 because she believed the patriot movement had been infiltrated. \u201cWe are not raping the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not doing the things you are accusing us of doing.\u201dOn Jan. 8, almost a year after the rally in John Day, the Bundys walked free. They had been on trial in Las Vegas for 11 months, before Judge Gloria M. Navarro dismissed the case, citing the federal prosecution\u2019s and the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d and \u201cdeliberate attempts to mislead and distort the truth.\u201d The prosecution withheld more than 1,000 pages from the defense, which included reports that federal snipers surrounded the Bundy family as Bureau of Land Management agents prepared to impound their cattle and that F.B.I. surveillance cameras recorded the Bundy home. Thomas felt vindicated. \u201cI think the Bundys have woken up a lot of people experiencing different versions of federal oppression,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf we pull back and make a smaller federal government, we won\u2019t have as many problems. When the feds have all the power, look at what they do.\u201dIn August, I met Emily and Robin Olson for dinner at Tastee Treet, a vintage hamburger joint in Prineville. We sat in a red vinyl booth, and Robin ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a root-beer float, which Emily described as her mother\u2019s \u201clast meal,\u201d meaning the meal Robin would choose if she knew it would be her final one. While Robin ate, she reflected on the landscape she witnessed on a road trip in July. They drove 5,600 miles through 10 Western states in two weeks. They tried to hit every Western state but missed California and Utah. They never passed a town of more than 20,000 until they reached Fort Collins, in Colorado. \u201cThe rural United States, it\u2019s like eastern Oregon,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s like the entire world.\u201dThey visited Yellowstone National Park and saw, they said, two million acres of natural resources gone to waste. \u201cAt least one day a year,\u201d Robin said, \u201cwe ought to be able to go in and take advantage.\u201dEmily thought the trees were too close together. \u201cDidn\u2019t look healthy,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t log.\u201d\u201cAnd look at all those buffalo,\u201d Robin said. \u201cCan\u2019t some of them be used for meat?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to eat them?\u201d I said.\u201cI was looking at the buffalo and just seeing a steak,\u201d she said.Robin was disappointed in Yellowstone, but she remained hopeful about Trump. \u201cA lot of conservatives were concerned that he wouldn\u2019t be conservative enough.\u201d At home Robin saved a copy of The Bulletin, a local paper in the liberal-leaning town of Bend, with the headline \u201cTrump Victory\u201d because it gave her \u201cenergy\u201d to look at it. \u201cSometimes I look at that headline and think, Right, yes, I feel good.\u201dTwo ranchers, a young husband and wife, walked into Tastee Treet and sat down behind us. They were friends of Robin. \u201cHey, do you guys like The New York Times?\u201d Robin asked.The husband told me that his son came home from school one day and informed him that cow flatulence was contributing to global warming. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just the climate cycle,\u201d he told his son. Emily had had the same teacher. \u201cWhen I learned her teacher was doing stuff on global warming,\u201d Robin said, \u201cthat fired me up.\u201d Robin asked for five minutes of class time to give a counterargument.\u201cI think if people are honest,\u201d Robin said, \u201cthey look at all this and think black helicopters and tinfoil hats, but if you really go deeper, you\u2019ll ask: \u2018What are they doing to take away the forestry, logging and timber industry? What are they doing to take away farming?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cToo much to be a coincidence,\u201d Emily said. \u201cThe spotted owls, the wolves, the sage grouse, the cougar, the frogs.\u201dI tried to suggest a lack of understanding between rural and urban people, but Robin stopped me. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want different things.\u201d The statement was cold and clear. It suggested the end of reconciliation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you breathing down our back,\u201d she said. \u201cBottom line is we don\u2019t trust you. We don\u2019t trust you to look out for our best interests. And in truth we don\u2019t even know that you know how to. A lot of people were saying this was about saving the bunnies and butterflies, but that\u2019s not what this is about.\u201dRobin sat over her empty plate. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people off the land,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s dark.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "FeatureYes, it\u2019s driven by greed \u2014 but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.Supported bylayer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maidOn the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}

At one point, she held her infant daughter to her chest to breast-feed with one hand and checked her phone for updates on a work meeting with the other.\u201cI have to hand her off soon,\u201d said Ms. Limongi Gabriele, 35, pausing to smile at her daughter. \u201cThere are things that I would love to do with her just to bond, a lot of stuff during the week that I can\u2019t do if I\u2019m at work.\u201dThe law offers eight weeks off, paid at 50 percent of the worker\u2019s average weekly wage, with a cap of $652.96 per week. It will phase in over four years, until 2021, when New Yorkers will be allowed to take 12 weeks of paid leave at nearly 70 percent of their average wage. Employers do not pay for the benefit \u2014 instead, it\u2019s financed through a 0.126 percent payroll contribution from all New Yorkers.Ms. Limongi Gabriele is familiar with what unpaid leave feels like.When her daughter, Sofia, was born in March of last year, she and her husband dipped into their savings and charged necessities like groceries to a credit card so she could stretch her time off work to almost four months.\u201cI\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to spend time with my baby,\u201d Ms. Limongi Gabriele said, but the financial instability \u201ckind of had me freaked out.\u201dUnder the new law, parents can take the paid leave any time before their child turns 1, giving Ms. Limongi Gabriele five more weeks with Sofia.\u201cI\u2019m glad that as a society we\u2019re realizing that it\u2019s not only benefiting parents that are having children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes toward helping build a solid foundation for our children, who are going to be contributing members of society someday.\u201dStill, the current law is not perfect, Ms. Limongi Gabriele said.It would be hard for some single parents in New York City to make ends meet, she said, \u201cand what we really need is a national law that covers more people.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s meaningful and a move in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cFour out of 50 states with paid family leave? Baby steps, I guess.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re thawing out.Wind gusts this afternoon could make it feel a bit colder, but stay strong. Tomorrow could jump into the 50s.Electric buses are hitting the streets this week.The vehicles are equipped with Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, and are quieter than traditional gas buses.They\u2019ll be running on the B32 route between Brooklyn and Queens and on the M42 and M50 routes in Midtown Manhattan.If successful, the M.T.A. said it would order 60 more electric buses and expand the program throughout the city.Advertisement"}

While Devumi promises customers \u201c100 Percent Active, English Followers,\u201d virtually all of the followers and retweets the company provides are fake, The Times found. Twitter prohibits buying followers of any kind.The Times found evidence that the information of Twitter users in every state \u2014 including thousands of people in Florida and New York \u2014 had been copied onto bots sold by Devumi or rival companies.At least 55,000 fake accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis. The original accounts list locations in all 50 U.S. states.By The New York TimesDevumi was based in Florida until recently but lists a New York City address on its website.

{"Headline": "Investigate an Accused Ally? New York Senate\u2019s Republican Leader Says No", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 The state capital was riven on Thursday by a bevy of calls from various quarters for an investigation of Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the powerful Senate leader alleged to have forcibly kissed a former staffer and the most significant figure accused of sexual harassment here in years.But the Republican leader of the Senate, John J. Flanagan of Long Island, said that any investigation would not come from his chamber. The Senate, he said, has no mechanism to investigate Mr. Klein, his longtime political partner who leads a rogue group of eight Democratic senators, the Independent Democratic Conference, or I.D.C., who collaborate with the Republicans to create a majority.\u201cAt this point, this is an allegation in which no formal complaint was ever made,\u201d said Mr. Flanagan, in a statement. \u201cWhile it may be within the scope of other entities, an investigation into this matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Senate.\u201dMr. Flanagan called Mr. Klein \u201ca good and decent person who treats others with respect,\u201d while also saying \u201cwe take every allegation of sexual harassment seriously and will continue to encourage everyone to come forward.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden there was a hand on the back of my head and he shoved his tongue down my throat,\u201d she said. Ms. Vladimer left her job shortly after the alleged incident, and said she had spoken out \u201cto help the women who might have been in a similar situation.\u201dMr. Klein, who represents portions of the Bronx and Westchester County, has strenuously denied that the episode occurred, preemptively holding a conference call with reporters on Wednesday alongside his girlfriend, Senator Diane J. Savino, of Staten Island, another member of the I.D.C.Ms. Savino also denied Ms. Vladimer\u2019s allegations. Mr. Klein commissioned a memo from his lawyers outlining their case, accusing Ms. Vladimer of drinking that night and acting peculiarly, something they said was evidenced by the young woman inviting Mr. Klein over that night for a Seder dinner.She added that her experiences in Albany\u2019s culture of sexual harassment were \u201cmore insidious than this one moment in time with this one man,\u201d and called for \u201claws protecting staff from becoming victims.\u201d\u201cBut legislation and rules can only go so far,\u201d Ms. Vladimer wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time to hold our elected officials accountable.\u201dAt the same time, however, what was emerging was another age-old truth about Albany: It takes a lot to change the status quo, particularly where ethics are concerned. As Mr. Flanagan\u2019s statement suggested, there were other possible avenues to investigate Mr. Klein, but none seemed likely to act quickly or, critics said, effectively to address sexual harassment.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that Albany needs an independent ethics watchdog,\u201d said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have one.\u201dOn Thursday evening, Mr. Klein seemingly upped the ante, sending a letter to the acting chairman and executive director of the committee requesting that they open an investigation, saying again that the incident \u201cdid not happen, period,\u201d and citing his lawyer\u2019s own six-day investigation of \u201ccurrent and former staffers present at the time.\u201dSexual misbehavior is hardly a new phenomenon in Albany, where lawmakers once bragged about the \u201cBear Mountain Compact,\u201d an assertion that extramarital liaisons north of the Bear Mountain Bridge, a Hudson River crossing north of New York City, were not to be spoken about in home districts.The Klein scandal also threatened to overshadow the legislative session that began last week, and added intensity to the discussion of possible changes to internal policies and state laws meant to address sexual harassment. In a coincidence of timing, less than 24 hours after the news of Ms. Vladimer\u2019s allegations broke, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor \u2014 the two highest ranking women in state government \u2014 stood before an audience of hundreds of people in the New-York Historical Society\u2019s auditorium in Manhattan to unveil Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2018 Women\u2019s Agenda.Both women heaped praise upon the plans, including the governor\u2019s promise to crack down on sexual harassment in the workplace. But they made no mention of Ms. Vladimer or Mr. Klein, or of the existence of harassment in state government more broadly, even as they stressed women\u2019s courage in coming forward and the importance of believing their stories.\u201c2018 needs to be the year when society responds,\u201d Ms. DeRosa said.On Wednesday evening, Mr. Cuomo issued a brief statement about Mr. Klein, saying that \u201cevery allegation of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously.\u201d But he did not say whether he believed Ms. Vladimer\u2019s accusations nor offer any critique of Mr. Klein, adding only that he agreed with Mr. Klein that the \u201cdisturbing situation\u201d should be investigated.A spokeswoman for the I.D.C., Candice Giove, reiterated on Thursday that Mr. Klein \u201cwelcomes any investigation into this alleged incident.\u201dThe political stakes could be high. Mr. Klein, as the leader of the I.D.C., works with Mr. Flanagan to control the Senate, despite Democrats technically holding a majority. (Another state Senator, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, also sides with Mr. Flanagan and his fellow Republicans.)In an interview Thursday evening with NY1, Ms. Vladimer addressed several of Mr. Klein\u2019s arguments, saying that Seder invite was because her parents grew up in the senator\u2019s district. \u201cA casual thing from one Jewish person to the next,\u201d she said.As for her drinking the night of the incident, Ms. Vladimer conceded she had drinks.\u201cBut honestly, so what?\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that put a green light over my head to anybody to try and shove their tongue down my throat?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Coywolf\u2019 Sightings Grip a Rural New York Community", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONGERS, N.Y. \u2014 Of all the coyotes that roam Dr. Davies Farm, looking for prey on this apple-picking orchard less than an hour from New York City, manager James Higgins says one of the pack stands out: Bigger and with more gray fur than its mates, this wolflike canine is a reason, Mr. Higgins says, there are fewer deer nibbling at Dr. Davies\u2019s stock.\u201cWe love having him here,\u201d Mr. Higgins said as he drove around the property on an ad hoc coyote safari. There were no sightings, but Mr. Higgins ventured a profile of the creature: aloof, calm, uninterested in people.\u201cAnytime he sees any kind of human activity, he bolts,\u201d Mr. Higgins said. \u201cAs long as he stays in his space and we stay in ours, everyone works in harmony.\u201dNot everyone shares Mr. Higgins\u2019 fondness for this supposed hybrid predator, known by some as coywolves, which have spread from upstate to semirural New York and the New Jersey suburbs, and migrated as far into the city grid as Rikers Island and La Guardia Airport \u2014 where officials had one pack euthanized in November 2016 over the objections of animal-rights activists.Some who admire the creatures balk at the portmanteau name.\u201cThe word \u2018coywolf\u2019 is kind of freighted, and frankly most wildlife biologists prefer the term \u2018Eastern coyote,\u2019\u201d said Christopher Nagy, a wildlife biologist and co-founder of Gotham Coyote, a New York City-based research project studying the animals in their new habitats. \u201cBecause these buzzwords have an impact, and the word \u2018wolf\u2019 is one of the most loaded in nature.\u201dBut the name has caught on as the debate intensifies over whether to try to drive them out or let them be, and it is being bandied about in places like Clarkstown, the Rockland County municipality that includes Dr. Davies Farm.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason we say \u2018cry wolf,\u2019 \u201d Patricia McCoy-Coleman, Clarkstown\u2019s animal control officer, said. Yet even she is willing to apply the moniker to the right coyote. Ms. McCoy-Coleman calls one that she sees around town \u201cFrankenstein\u201d \u2014 \u201cFrankie,\u201d for short \u2014 because of its odd proportions. \u201cHe has a head that\u2019s very big for his body, and it looks like someone put different parts together,\u201d she said.Two years ago, a large, gray coyote \u2014 visibly sick with mange and seen repeatedly near one of the town\u2019s busiest parks \u2014 was killed by the Clarkstown police. Ms. McCoy-Coleman sent two DNA samples from the animal to Gotham Coyote, hoping to learn how much wolf and dog there was in the coyote.But the animal\u2019s genetic mix was \u201cout of the scope of my research,\u201d said Carol Henger, a researcher at Gotham Coyote. \u201cAll I could tell her is that it was not related to the N.Y.C. coyotes.\u201dWhatever the animals are called, they are turning up all over Clarkstown, in parks, near schools, on residential streets, and in business and industrial corridors, residents say. They have been seen near Freedom Causeway, walking on frozen sections of DeForest Lake. Workers at Tilcon, a stone quarry in West Nyack, sometimes see them crossing the quarry floor.Neighbors traded stories of close encounters with the coyote \u2014 or coywolf \u2014 at a meeting on Thursday at Clarkstown\u2019s town hall in New City. About 80 people attended the \u201cCoyote Education Seminar\u201d hosted by Clarkstown\u2019s senior elected official, Supervisor George Hoehmann, who said he had to address growing questions and concerns about the coyote population.\u201cThere certainly is a fear factor, and the flames can be fanned by social media or by people talking at the corner deli,\u201d Mr. Hoehmann said. He said it was important to give people sound information \u2014 and perspective, since the last serious episode involving a coyote in Clarkstown was five years ago, when one attacked a dog in a backyard.Noting that Clarkstown also has bald eagles and hawks, Mr. Hoehmann said, \u201cPeople should be more concerned about the birds of prey swooping down and taking away cats and small dogs than coyotes.\u201dThe centerpiece of the meeting was a talk by an amateur naturalist from Mineola, N.Y., Frank Vincenti, who cuts hair for a living and, on the side, operates a nonprofit, The Wild Dog Foundation, which offers tips to municipalities that have become coywolf habitats.Mr. Vincenti, 48, described himself as \u201cpro-coyote.\u201d He said some audiences have reacted with open hostility to his presentation. But this group listened quietly as he related the Eastern coyote\u2019s genetic and geographic history \u2014 \u201cthis is not Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u201d \u2014 as well as its hardiness, smarts and ability to adapt to almost any surroundings, and its relationship to people.\u201cCoyotes want nothing to do with us,\u201d Mr. Vincenti said. But he allowed that coyotes, like any wild animal, can get comfortable around people, especially if they\u2019re indulged \u2014 and worse, fed.Mr. Vincenti and two other speakers, Ms. McCoy-Coleman and the Orangetown animal control officer, Richard Padilla, recommended steps to take with coyotes: Yell at them, run at them, carry umbrellas to wave at them and use ultrasonic, dog-frequency sound blasters \u2014 called Dazers \u2014 or air horns. This goes double, they said, for people walking pets \u2014 which, it should go without saying, should be leashed.Ann Rosenberg, a retired New York City schoolteacher, said that coexistence was not a realistic option for developmentally disabled children and young adults at the Jesse J. Kaplan School in West Nyack, which abuts a nature path used by the school.The children there can react badly, sometimes violently, even to leashed dogs, Ms. Rosenberg said. The thought of them encountering feral canines on their outdoor walks left her fearful for the students and the staff, she said.And the risk won\u2019t be lessened \u201cunless they are eliminated,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said of the coyotes. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard truth. I\u2019m not happy it\u2019s the only solution, but it\u2019s the only solution.\u201dDave Sanders contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

While their peers were putting their kitchen skill front and center, through tasting menus or through restaurants where decoration was minimal and amenities were pared back until there was almost nothing left but the plates, they went in the opposite direction.From their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, inside a fake Italian grocery store, their places have been highly distracting in ways that serious chefs tend to shun. The interiors are ornamental and over the top; the servers are dressed in uniforms that we might as well call costumes; the playlists are what your friend for whom entertaining is a life-or-death matter would put together for a highly specific theme party.Mr. Marino apparently wanted to bring the party back. From the top of the stairs just inside the entrance, on East 53rd Street, a scene from Fellini seems to be playing out. A big square lounge in the middle of the room is bounded by zebra-striped panels of white ebony. Spurts and dribbles of paint cover the floor and the black trousers that some of the servers are wearing. It looks as if Jackson Pollock were called back for one last job.On the walls are prints Mr. Marino made from paintings he owns. The originals were painted by Richard Prince, modeled on paintings by Picasso. The Prince Picasso-painting prints have themselves been painted, gone over by Mr. Marino with thick pigment in a completely different style.Marvin Gaye is singing. He wants everybody to know that sexual healing is something that is good for him.Round tables are surrounded by pink lounge chairs that look, from behind, like enormous cartoon lips. The booths are upholstered in a chartreuse camouflage pattern, a useful fabric if the Army ever needs to hide in a green neon jungle.Blending in at the Lobster Club in winter means fur coats and designer sweaters. A man with silver hair, a double-breasted blazer and a pocket square is circling the perimeter, swiveling his head, an eager expression in his eyes, as if he had been told there would be a limbo pole. On the right, a big group is sitting around a skinny table that can be partitioned from the rest of the dining area by drawing a floor-to-ceiling curtain, as in an operating room. The curtain is made of black leather.All the bartenders are dressed like leather daddies.Isaac Hayes is singing now. He has some thoughts to share about a black private dick who\u2019s a sex machine to all the chicks.What kind of Japanese restaurant is this?It would need to be a sensational one to compete with the rest of the goings-on. It is not. In fact, the Lobster Club seems to be making an effort not to be sensational. The cooking, as a whole, suggests Japanese food as seen through American eyes at some point in the recent past.There is no soup, no noodles, no tofu and few vegetables. But there is salmon teriyaki, made more meticulously than any I\u2019ve ever seen, with a dark-pink medium-rare core and a translucent, unsyrupy glaze.My Wagyu skirt steak was a far better product than anything I remember from Benihana. Ditto the teppanyaki king mushroom stems that accompanied it along with more shishito peppers than I needed and more sauces than I can name. The mustard miso was my favorite with steak; for grilled scallops, I would go with the yuzu chimichurri.Two skewered appetizers were among my favorite things on the menu. One is the pork belly, lightly browned on the grill and then half-buried under a chopped pineapple sauce. The other is the tsukune, or chicken meatball, which is richer than you expect thanks to an unadvertised, invisible but very noticeable addition of foie gras.Some of Mr. Murakami\u2019s appetizers struck me as barely Japanese at all. Certain raw fish dishes could be served at any number of New York restaurants, like slices of sea bass showered with brittle strands of fried brussels sprouts, or raw cherry trout twirled around crunchy nests of fried potato threads. Both are fine things to eat, by the way. The one called wok lobster \u2014 battered and fried lobster tail pieces in a sweet-and-sour sauce \u2014 seems very Chinese. It is also very oily, like the fried rock shrimp and the teppanyaki garlic rice, which will ooze oil as you watch.Then again, it is one of the only places in the city where you can end a meal with steamed black-sugar cakes, soft and homey and rarely seen outside their hometown, Okinawa. And it is among the few to serve kakigori, a mountain of shaved ice.

{"Headline": "What Does It Take to Overcome Adversity?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.With much passion, her earlier book, \u201cThe Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter \u2014 And How to Make the Most of Them,\u201d revealed the private quandaries of millennials seeking her out for psychotherapy and exposing a very different side of themselves than their public posts on Facebook. To \u201cSupernormal,\u201d Jay again brings her skill at telling the stories of her patients.There\u2019s Sam, who was 9 when his father walked out on the family; Emily, the child of an alcoholic father; Paul, a nuclear engineer who was bullied as a kid; Jessie, who was dominated by her sister; the doctor-lawyer Elizabeth, whose parents focused on her special-needs brother; Nadia, orphaned in college when her parents were murdered; Martha, emotionally harassed by a mother who constantly criticized her appearance; Michelle, sexually abused by her polo coach; Vera, a daughter of neglect; Jennifer, born into a household marked by domestic violence; and others.Many are the ways that lives can get distressed. Unfortunately, we rarely learn exactly what turns misfortune into resilience. From the story of Emily, whose success at swimming was her ticket out of town, and that of Mara, the daughter of a bipolar mother, we learn that separating from one\u2019s surroundings, in reality or fantasy, is a crucial act of self-preservation \u2014 a necessary, but hardly sufficient, first step in overcoming adversity.Of equal concern is the book\u2019s title, \u201cSupernormal.\u201d Were this merely a case of alighting on a single, spectacular word to both signal the subject matter within and kindle the curiosity to explore it, it would merit little comment. The title, however, encodes the book\u2019s deep muddle.Transcending troubles is an everyday event because most people are resilient. So why does Jay insist on suggesting that resilience is something other than usual, that it requires some superpower?Jay\u2019s labeling is a big deal because the name shapes our expectation of whether hardship is a trauma that flattens us or a challenge we are capable of mastering. Attitude matters too: It literally bends biology. Indeed, studies show that an optimistic approach blunts reactivity to stress, curbing the outpouring of hormones that can debilitate body and mind.Of course, danger lurks in acknowledging the strengths summoned by adversity: There\u2019s always a critic who will see it as an endorsement of suffering. But that is akin to calling someone who recognizes that infection can confer lifelong immunity a cheerleader for mumps.Resilience has been a buzzword in psychology circles the past few years. However, \u201cSupernormal\u201d misses an opportunity to go beyond recounting stories of hardship to explore the countless idiosyncratic, endlessly creative ways in which most people struggle with disruption, find a path through it and come out the better for it.Hara Estroff Marano is the editor at large of Psychology Today and the author, most recently, of \u201cA Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a former intelligence official who was granted anonymity to discuss Mr. D\u2019Andrea\u2019s thinking said the operative did not believe the United States could do anything to bring about regime change in Iran.The Islamic State also played a role, Mr. Montazeri said, without explaining precisely how. He also called on clerics in the holy city of Qum to support the judiciary in a permanent ban on the messaging app Telegram, now closed in Iran.Government officials also blamed internal enemies for instigating the protests, with the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps seeming to imply that a former hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was involved.Whatever Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s role, Iran\u2019s reformist faction has accused hard-liners in the city of Mashhad of organizing the first protests to create political problems for Iran\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani. And hard-liners have, in turn, accused Mr. Rouhani of leaking secret parts of his proposed budget, including details of the country\u2019s religious institutes, in a calculated move to turn ordinary people against religious institutions.\u201cThey all blame each other,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a reformist journalist. \u201cWhat else can they do?\u201dThe death toll from the clashes rose to at least 21, and in the central province of Esfahan, a police officer was reported killed.Unrelated to the protests, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on five Iranian entities over their involvement in developing ballistic missiles, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said additional sanctions \u201ctargeting human rights abuses are coming.\u201dThe protests, meanwhile, seemed to be winding down, though there is no sure way to tell. Fewer videos of what seemed to be demonstrations appeared on social media on Thursday. But many sites have been blocked, possibly obscuring the true extent of the protests.Iran\u2019s government routinely filters websites and apps it deems inappropriate or dangerous, and Twitter and Facebook have been blocked since the 2009 antigovernment protests.

{"Headline": "Tom Brady Gave a Filmmaker Unusual Access to His Private Life", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Brady was leading a tour through a set of fat binders that he keeps in his den, with each one devoted to one of the 18 seasons he has played in the N.F.L. This one, marked \u201c2016,\u201d began with a particular memento.That would be the missive he received from 345 Park Avenue informing him he would be sidelined for the first four games of the 2016 season for his role in the still-hard-to-believe football air-pressure \u201cscandal\u201d known as Deflategate. As the camera focused on Brady, his face became stuck in a smile that could be characterized as something between goofy and satisfied (and with the whiff of a smirk).\u201cThank you,\u201d Brady said, to whom it was not clear exactly. He turned the page, and next thing you know he was winning another ring.The scene transpires early in the first installment of a new documentary series, \u201cTom vs. Time,\u201d which will be posted later this month via Facebook\u2019s mobile video platform, Facebook Watch. The series follows Brady not just as he has pursued his sixth Super Bowl championship in 2017, but also \u2014 as the title indicates \u2014 as he conducts his ongoing subversion campaign against the actuarial tables of quarterback longevity.Filmmaker Gotham Chopra was granted sweeping access to Brady in an array of intimate settings that the inscrutable signal-caller would normally be loath to allow. There is extensive footage of Brady at his Brookline, Mass., home, with his children, with his wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, on family retreats to Costa Rica, on a bro-trip to Montana (with teammates Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola), on a summer tour of China with his son Jack, and in the car during Brady\u2019s commute to and from work in Foxborough, Mass.One venue where Brady is barely seen: Gillette Stadium, or pretty much anywhere in the Patriots\u2019 facilities. For a player who has been the epitome of the Patriots team-first philosophy, Brady would seem an unlikely candidate to open such a close-up lens upon his off-field self, especially during the season \u2014 and especially for a project set to drop during the playoffs. A player not placing undue attention upon himself would constitute a first principle of Coach Bill Belichick\u2019s colorless \u201cDo Your Job\u201d collectivism. That is one of the many remarkable aspects of \u201cTom vs. Time.\u201dIt is unclear if Brady has even told his coach about the project. The Patriots spokesman Stacey James said the team was nominally aware that a Brady documentary was in the works, and tried to be helpful in providing credentials on the few occasions Chopra sought access to home games. Beyond that, the answer of how much Brady\u2019s bosses were informed about \u201cTom vs. Time\u201d remains shrouded in some Patriot-esque mystery.In addition, Belichick is almost completely absent in the series. His offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, rather, is portrayed as Brady\u2019s ever-present coaching foil, making cameos via speakerphone (or video chat) as Brady pores through game film and brainstorms ideas for new plays for upcoming games.Chopra, son of the prolific New Age author Deepak Chopra, grew up a Patriots fan in Lincoln, Mass. He spent several years working as a television journalist around the world before settling in Los Angeles, where he met Brady though mutual friends nearly a decade ago.Chopra had become interested in exploring the spiritual side of sports and competition, the deep connections drawn and emotions elicited around the games we play and watch. He had spoken from time to time with Brady about this, and for years had been trying to get him interested in some kind of film treatment around his obsessive relationship to football.After the odyssey of last season \u2014 with Brady\u2019s Deflategate suspension, his mother\u2019s battle with cancer and the Patriots\u2019 surreal comeback win in the Super Bowl \u2014 Brady finally agreed to participate in a film about his off-season training regimen.\u201cWe thought it would be fun to record what an off-season of training looks like for a 40-year-old athlete,\u201d said Brady, reached by email Monday night.The off-season ended, but Chopra and his camera stuck around into the season. \u201cTom is not a sentimental guy, necessarily,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cBut I do think, as we talked, he was sort of discovering parts of himself. It\u2019s like therapy. It\u2019s the process of saying it and giving voice to it.\u201dPutting aside any significance the series might hold in the broader Patriots Kremlinology, \u201cTom vs. Time\u201d is pure candy for football geeks, celebrity lifestyle voyeurs and pretty much any N.F.L. enthusiast curious about one of sports\u2019 more enigmatic superstars. In the fifth installment (\u201cThe Spiritual Game\u201d), Brady ruminates on the karmic satisfactions he derives through sports.\u201cI do want to know the whys in life,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI do want to know why we\u2019re here, where we\u2019re going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me.\u201dLater in the fifth episode, Brady and B\u00fcndchen sit for a joint interview in which B\u00fcndchen, a Brazilian model, describes what it\u2019s like to have to share her husband with his \u201cfirst love,\u201d football. \u201cIt really is his main love,\u201d B\u00fcndchen says, going further. \u201cFrankly it\u2019s true.\u201d She mentions that when she and Brady first met, he said he only wanted to play 10 years and would have been happy to win one more Super Bowl. But of course, love dies hard.\u201cIt\u2019s effortless because it\u2019s so synonymous with my being,\u201d Brady says of football. \u201cIn front of 70,000 people, I can be who I am. If I want to scream at somebody I can scream at somebody. I can be who I am in a very authentic way.\u201dAs Brady says this, it\u2019s impossible not to extend the thought a beat further \u2014 and then he does so himself: \u201cThat is hard for me when I walk off the field.\u201dOne of the more fascinating scenes involves Brady\u2019s staring like a zombie at a computer screen, intense and serene. It is as if he is linked to the game film he is watching.\u201cYou\u2019re becoming a failure in front of everybody else,\u201d Brady says, using an odd second-person construction while reliving the dormant nightmare in real time. \u201cIt\u2019s a talent show you did when you were a kid. And you\u2019re a failure.\u201dGiven some of the events of this season \u2014 both around the league and with the Patriots \u2014 the first four and a half installments that were available for viewing by The New York Times contained some big elephants that go unmentioned to this point.Chopra said he most likely would cover some of that material in the final installments, though much of it depends on the Patriots\u2019 playoff trajectory. \u201cThere\u2019s still some ground to cover and a lot of the story left to unfold,\u201d he said.Facebook said the release date for the series is uncertain; it depends on when the Patriots\u2019 season ends. The team hosts Tennessee in a playoff game this weekend.Another N.F.L. quarterback no longer alive in the playoffs steals one scene. Brady is at home being put through some massage by Guerrero when his oldest son, Jack, walks into the room. Jack tells his father about some N.F.L. fantasy or simulation game that he and a friend are engaged in.\u201cWho\u2019s your quarterback,\u201d Brady asks. His son is decisive and cold with his answer. \u201cCam Newton,\u201d he says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Push Back After Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures.Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action.\u201cThere tends to be a follow-on effect, particularly when something happens in a big state like California,\u201d said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at nonprofit consumer group, Public Knowledge, which supports net neutrality efforts by the states.Bills have also been introduced in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Washington. The issue has also attracted some support in governor mansions. In Washington, for example, Gov. Jay Inslee reiterated his support for a state law in a speech this week.\u201cWhen Washington, D.C., takes away that protection, we must protect net neutrality for our people, for our businesses and for the virtues of free speech,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said.And any such state law could be challenged in courts. The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new order, which rolled back rules passed in 2015, blocks state and city governments from creating their own net neutrality laws. The commission said different state laws were too difficult for an internet service provider, like Verizon or Charter, to follow because the internet does not recognize state borders and transfers traffic between states.\u201cThe internet is the ultimate form of interstate commerce, which is clearly only within the authority of the F.C.C.,\u201d said Bret Swanson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in telecommunications policy.\u201cPeople should not be intimidated by the F.C.C. simply saying it has pre-emptive authority, and we need to dig into the sources of that claim, which are a lot weaker than the F.C.C. makes it out to be,\u201d said State Representative Drew Hansen, a Democrat who has introduced one of two net neutrality bills in Washington in recent weeks.The Federal Communications Commission declined to comment but pointed to the section of its order that pre-empts states from creating their own net neutrality rules.Supporters of net neutrality are attacking the agency\u2019s repeal of the 2015 rules in other ways as well. On Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced that he had enough support to force a vote on a congressional resolution to bring back the rules. He gained an important Republican supporter, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who said she would vote in favor of it. Such a measure is a long shot in the House, however, and would also need President Trump\u2019s signature.\u201cNet neutrality will be a major issue in the 2018 campaigns, and we are going to let everyone know where we stand and where they stand,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference, warning Republicans to vote in favor of the Democratic-led resolution.In addition, lawsuits against the commission are expected shortly after the policy becomes official. Last week, a lobbying group for big technology companies including Facebook, Google and Netflix announced that it planned to join the lawsuits, giving the opposition substantial new resources. More than a dozen state attorneys general have also announced plans to sue the commission.But state lawmakers say they cannot wait around to see what happens with those efforts.State Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who introduced the other bill in Washington, said net neutrality was an important safeguard for small businesses that might not be able to pay internet service companies for fast speeds. Even though Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the repeal, she said many Republicans in her state supported her bill.\u201cThis is not a partisan issue here,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cEveryone is concerned about equal access to the internet and being able to participate in the 21st-century economy.\u201d\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t protect consumers, the State of California will,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.In New York, Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat, said a few internet service providers already had too much power over the marketplace and should not be given the ability to charge websites more for faster delivery to users.This month, she introduced a bill that would hold back state telecom projects from broadband providers that blocked, throttled or gave priority to sites that paid for faster access. Legislators in Rhode Island and North Carolina have introduced or are considering similar bills that are more focused on government contracts than telecom law, they say.\u201cWe are threading a needle here,\u201d Ms. Fahy said, \u201cbut this is the best way to get at consumer protection, because state projects are huge and this will really affect the internet service providers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sentient-Being Diet", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Two weeks ago I was reading a book by a brilliant writer whose life was cut short by melanoma \u2014 \u201cDying: A Memoir,\u201d by Cory Taylor \u2014 when I noticed a weird little growth on the skin just above my heart. A weird little growth right where long ago I used to slather a baby-oil-and-iodine concoction as I sat on a dorm roof during my college years. A weird little growth that suddenly struck me as almost certainly malignant melanoma.In the midst of a miraculous book, I tend to go overboard on empathy. I walk around inside a little bubble of mirth when I\u2019m reading a really funny essay collection, and I carry a lingering sense of disquiet when I\u2019m in the middle of an unsettling novel. If I read a memoir about dying, pretty soon I will believe I\u2019m dying myself.When that little growth \u2014 really, more of an overachieving mole \u2014 popped up on my skin, I made an appointment with a dermatologist. It seemed like a good idea to ask a person with an actual medical degree to decide whether the irregular mole just above my heart was anything to be concerned about.A memoir about death by malignant melanoma is definitely not good waiting-room reading in a dermatologist\u2019s office, so I studied the posters on the walls. There were ads for CoolSculpting, which can somehow eliminate a double chin in one hour without surgery; stem-cell injections that \u201cHarness the Power of Platelet-Rich Plasma\u201d; a \u201cdermal filler\u201d designed to \u201cplump\u201d inappropriately plumpless areas of the face; saline injections to reduce unsightly veins; a cream offering \u201cfree-radical protection\u201d; and a plan for banishing underarm sweat that leaves patients \u201cclean, confident, carefree forever.\u201d There was also a small pamphlet on Botox, which seemed a little 20th century in the shiny new age of Platelet-Rich Plasma.Looking at this panoply of options for correcting errors of appearance I had carelessly committed with my 56-year-old skin and my drugstore moisturizer, I did not think, \u201cGosh, I should really look into getting myself some free-radical protection.\u201d What I thought was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a luxury to spend any amount of time worrying about underarm sweat?\u201d What I thought was, \u201cI wish I lived in a world where my greatest worry was underarm sweat.\u201dI spent last year in mourning for my country. I volunteered on behalf of people imperiled by the results of the 2016 election. I wrote checks to resistance efforts, hoping they would make a bigger difference than I could make by myself, and blog posts about nature, hoping they would focus my mind on eternal things. The devastations \u2014 to the poor, to the environment, to immigrants, to people of many faiths and races, to our nation\u2019s very institutions \u2014 kept coming anyway. And all because a minority of my fellow citizens, through the auspices of an antique electoral system, had sent a lying, selfish, irrational, jingoistic, uneducable, race-baiting misogynist to the White House.\u201cYou\u2019re a sentient being, and this is a stressful time to be a sentient being,\u201d my longtime primary-care doctor said at my annual checkup in November. Since there is very little he can do to reform American politics, this wonderful doctor has devised an eating plan designed to reduce the flood of stress hormones into the bloodstream. He gave me a handwritten instruction sheet, suggesting I try it for a month after the holiday fire hose of brownies and Brie had shut down for another year.In 2018, I\u2019m resolved to do better at listening to people on every side. Empathy is always the best tool for fighting despair, and since trying to hear what\u2019s behind all this anger and all this fear and all this defeatism is the surest route to empathy, I have unhidden the Bernie-or-busters I cut from my Facebook feed in 2016. And I\u2019m listening to them alongside all the people I know who somehow believe the jury is still out on President Trump. I hope they\u2019re listening to me, too. I hope we\u2019re all listening to one another.The new year arrives in a flash of fireworks and a clink of glasses and a smiling kiss for a beloved. It\u2019s a time for believing anything is possible, for setting out-of-reach goals and trying to reach them anyway, and for today, at least, I\u2019m feeling a tiny little tug of optimism. The old, sad year is gone now, the darkest winter night is past, and the new year is open and whole and waiting. And this is the way the world changes: by trusting it can change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reuters Reporters Are Charged in Myanmar With Obtaining State Secrets", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Two journalists for the Reuters news agency were formally charged in Myanmar with obtaining state secrets, prosecutors said Wednesday, in a case seen as a key test of the country\u2019s nascent political freedoms.The reporters, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo, have been accused of violating the Official Secrets Act, a law dating to the British colonial period that carries a maximum punishment of 14 years in prison.The journalists were brought to court in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, where they were arrested on Dec. 12, almost immediately after being given unidentified documents by members of the police.The army crackdown on the Rohingya began after Rohingya insurgents attacked security posts in late August.Negotiating a scrum of journalists gathered in front of the Insein courthouse in Yangon on Wednesday morning, Mr. Wa Lone struck a defiant pose, raising his cuffed hands and later flashing a thumbs-up sign.\u201cWe are not doing anything wrong,\u201d Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo told journalists after the hearing. \u201cPlease help us by uncovering the truth.\u201dA lawyer for both journalists, U Than Zaw Aung, said that Mr. Wa Lone is suffering from a hernia and back pain but has received no medical treatment while in detention. The next court appearance for his clients will be on Jan. 23, he said.\u201cThe situation is very unclear,\u201d said Ma Pan Ei Mon, Mr. Wa Lone\u2019s wife. \u201cI\u2019m hoping all the time that he will be released soon.\u201dIn a statement, Stephen J. Adler, the president and editor in chief of Reuters, called the move to prosecute the reporters \u201ca wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom,\u201d adding, \u201cWe believe time is of the essence and we continue to call for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo\u2019s prompt release.\u201dHuman rights groups have accused the police of entrapping the two Reuters journalists by giving them documents that were then deemed state secrets. Ms. Pan Ei Mon said her husband never had a chance to look at the papers before he was arrested.Myanmar\u2019s elected civilian government has been accused of acquiescing to a crackdown on the media that belies the commitment to democratic values once espoused by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s governing party, the National League for Democracy. Since the party took power in 2016, at least 32 journalists have been charged with various crimes, according to We Support Journalists, a local media watchdog.Many of the journalists have been imprisoned after reporting on abuses taking place in Myanmar\u2019s ethnic frontier lands, where the military has been fighting various ethnic guerrilla groups for decades.Dozens of new publications emerged from the shadow of censorship in those years. But today, local reporters are uncertain whether their investigations, particularly into military malfeasance, might land them in jail.\u201cNow we don\u2019t have transparency, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening inside the government,\u201d Mr. Swe Win said. \u201cAll we know is that we journalists are always facing problems with the military, which means the civilian government has no power.\u201dHannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Saw Nang from Mandalay, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Winter Salvation, Fresh From the Dumpling Steamer, in Queens", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry CityIn winter, momos are salvation: hot dumplings with swirled pleats, fresh from the steamer, arriving in a cloudy rush of ascending souls.To eat them outdoors in winter, shivering, with numb, fumbling fingers, is even more of a wonder. At the Amdo Kitchen food truck in Jackson Heights, Queens, momos come huddled unceremoniously, eight for $5 on a disposable plate; bow your head over them and the steam kisses your face.Thubten Amchok, the owner and chef, grew up in the Amdo region of Tibet and fled to Nepal and then India before settling in the U.S. in 1995. A former monk, he started selling momos from a pushcart six years ago. Now his truck \u2014 emblazoned with Tibetan and American flags, snow lions alongside stars and stripes \u2014 rolls out daily, weather permitting. (Snowdrifts from the recent storm piled up so high, he couldn\u2019t park on the street for two weeks.)To him, the best momo is just meat and dough. \u201cNot many other ingredients are involved,\u201d he said. His dumplings are loaded with ground beef, loosely packed and tinged with nothing more than scallions, salt and a drop of soy sauce. \u201cWhat makes it delicious isn\u2019t the meat,\u201d he said, but the skin, which he shapes by hand and flattens until it\u2019s almost sheer.He seals the dumplings quickly, furling the dough into topknots, so none of the juices escape. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret, but I think it\u2019s a skill,\u201d he said. One bite and the penned-up broth gushes. If you\u2019re not careful, it\u2019ll spatter your fingers, sleeves and shoes. It\u2019s worth it.Only beef momos were available on my visits, but that was enough. Each plate is anchored by a tuft of radish that Mr. Amchok pickles for a week. Also on hand is a red squeeze bottle of sepen, a scarlet sauce of pulverized chile tempered, just barely, by spring water. The heat is ruthless and consoling at once, a small, steady flame that settles low in the chest.There are no tables, just stools along counters, and orders are placed at a window peeking into the closet kitchen. On a wall of exposed brick hangs a photograph of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the traditional seat of the Tibetan government and winter home of the Dalai Lama, who was forced into exile in 1959.\u201cI lost my country,\u201d said Tashi D. Lama, the owner. He was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal, but has family roots in the Kham region, whose sweep of mountains and grasslands is often described as the Wild West of Tibet, and whose people, Khampas, are historically known for their ferocity in combat.Before he came to the U.S. a few years ago, he was a monk. Now he is a chef, making laphing, slippery bands of steamed dough coiled like cinnamon rolls, glossed with chile at the center; and momos with meticulous pleats, pinched at the neck.9 PhotosHere, the skins are a little thicker, and the beef is suffused with preserved radish, which lends a nicely gamy funk. The beef is packed tight, forming a meatball inside the skin and almost squeaking under the teeth; still, the juices run.Other momos reveal chives stitched through the beef, a garlicky lace, or chives alone, brilliant green and hardly wilted, giving off a whiff of sesame oil. All are best daubed alternately in sepen, fierce enough to halt conversation, and a gentler yellow chutney of crushed tomatoes and sesame seeds, musty with turmeric.As at Amdo Kitchen, momos are eight for $5, with the added benefit of shelter from the storm and a cup of butter tea, dispensed from a tall pink canister. It is close to soup, salty and heavy on the tongue, and for a moment its warmth feels like armor.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of weeks the Amdo Kitchen food truck was unable to park on the street due to snow. It was two weeks, not one. A venue asset with this article also misstated the name of Tashi D. Lama\u2019s restaurant. It is Potala, not Potala Kitchen.Advertisement"}

Rather, \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling like you are supported in the ways that you want to be supported,\u201d she added, and believing that the connections you do have are nourishing and strong.Most people aren\u2019t aware that friendships are so beneficial: \u201cThey think of it as a luxury rather than the fact that it can actually add years to their life,\u201d Dr. Bonior said.The good news is that keeping cherished friendships afloat doesn\u2019t need to be a huge time commitment. There are several things you can do to keep a bond strong even when your to-do list is a mile long.\u201cIf there are certain days or weeks where you are going to be less available, giving your friend a heads up can go a long way toward minimizing misunderstandings or conflicts where somebody feels left out or like they\u2019re being ignored,\u201d she said.Tell your friends how long you expect to be off the radar, how to communicate with you best during this time (\u201cI\u2019m drowning in emails; texts are better!\u201d), and when your schedule is expected to go back to normal.You might be booked from dusk until dawn, but without giving your friend context, that phrase \u201cI\u2019m too busy\u201d can feel like a blowoff.\u201cTherefore, the friendship often just dies, not from lack of anything wrong or anybody even necessarily wanting it to die, but just simply chaotic lives and a lot of distance gets put in there,\u201d she said.Instead of offering vague, blanket statements about your bustling schedule, qualify your busyness: \u201cI\u2019m busy for the rest of the month,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tied up until the end of the year.\u201d Then make a counter offer. If you can\u2019t meet face-to-face anytime soon, suggest a phone date, Skype session, or other way to connect so your friend doesn\u2019t feel abandoned.If you find yourself telling longtime pals you\u2019re too snowed under to connect, it\u2019s time to look at how you truly spend your time.Dr. Bonior agrees: \u201cWhen you feel like you can\u2019t squeeze in a book club or brunch or happy hour, pedicures or whatever it is, maybe assess a little bit more. Like, \u2018O.K., well, how am I spending my time, and might there be a window in some of that time that actually allows for a real phone call or a walk around the block at lunch with one of my co-workers that I really like or whatever it might be?\u201dOnce a clearer picture emerges of how one chooses to spend their time, it becomes possible to make positive, thoughtful changes.Tailored, thoughtful text messages are a low-effort way to keep up connections when you\u2019re short on time. The key is to share little bits of information about your day that your friend couldn\u2019t glean from your Instagram feed or Snapchat story.Ms. Kirmayer suggests making messages as personal as possible to show somebody you\u2019re thinking about them.\u201cSo remembering obviously big life events \u2014 things like birthdays are a given \u2014 but also maybe smaller things like: They had a doctor\u2019s appointment coming up or you know they were going to have a stressful day at work and kind of checking in to see how it went,\u201d she said. \u201cEven a quick text message can go a long way.\u201dAsk questions that invite reveals (\u201cHow was your vacation? How\u2019s your new job going?\u201d) and avoid statements (\u201cI hope you\u2019re having a great day!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re in my thoughts\u201d), which don\u2019t tend to prompt meaningful back-and-forth exchanges.Having a regular hang with your closest confidants can take the guesswork out of scheduling quality time.\u201cIt might sound like you\u2019re not aiming very high if you\u2019re only going to see certain friends once a year, but if you have an annual barbecue or Memorial Day party or something, where it\u2019s kind of a guarantee you\u2019ll see certain friends,\u201d Ms. Flora said, \u201cthat\u2019s actually much better than kind of leaving it up to two people haggling over schedules.\u201dAnother idea is multitask to combine your errands with some valuable BFF facetime. Ask a friend to come to your favorite spin class, join your book club or accompany you to a volunteer gig.\u201cThe more things you can do together, potentially the more often you\u2019ll be able to see each other,\u201d Ms. Kirmayer said. \u201cThese repeated interactions are so important for keeping a friendship going.\u201dAnother way to cement longstanding friendships when things are hectic is to go out of your way to attend any milestone events \u2014 fly in for the baby shower, attend the 40th birthday party, make an appearance at the retirement party. Just show up. There aren\u2019t too many chances to make an impact in someone\u2019s life, but if you move mountains and carve out time for your friend\u2019s event, it\u2019ll sustain a friendship for a long time.\u201cOnce in a while, do a big gesture to those friends who you really, really care about and then that will kind of power the friendship for a while, even if you\u2019re too busy to see each other,\u201d Ms. Flora said. Being that person who comes through will \u201cmake that person feel loved and taken care of even if you\u2019re not in constant contact.\u201dMs. Nelson also suggests being aware of the three areas to measure and evaluate a functional friendship. The first area is positivity: laughter, affirmation, gratitude and any acts of service. The second is consistency, or having interactions on a continual basis, which makes people feel safe and close to each other. The third is vulnerability, which is the revealing and the sharing of our lives.\u201cAny relationship that doesn\u2019t have those three things isn\u2019t a healthy friendship,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. If you\u2019re noticing a cooling with a friend, usually one of these areas needs special consideration.Knowing what makes a friendship tick is important because it allows us to be more effective, especially when time is in short supply. \u201cObviously we wouldn\u2019t want a friendship to live on text messages, but it can certainly survive hectic times if we know where to put our energy,\u201d Ms. Nelson said.While the energy expended to keep contact going may not always be equal, it\u2019s important to be mindful of the attempts your friends make to connect. Reach out to nip resentment in the bud.\u201cIf one person is consistently or chronically putting in more effort, issues can come up,\u201d Ms. Kirmayer said. \u201cLet your friend know that it means so much to you that they\u2019re checking in so often and that you really appreciate it.\u201dShe also recommends piping up if the balance feels off: \u201cIf you want them to kind of tone it down a little bit because you\u2019re not able to respond all the time, you can say you feel really bad that you\u2019re not able to get back to them all the time.\u201d Addressing friends\u2019 bids for attention can mean the difference between having a dear friendship flourish or fade during a frantic time.\u201cMost people just want to know they\u2019re loved and thought of,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. \u201cIf we can, like, give that validation and affirmation rather than just dismissing and saying we\u2019re too busy, if we can kind of combine those things, most people understand and will still feel loved during that time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Gunman Took Elaborate Steps to Hide His Tracks, New Documents Show", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he meticulously planned the Las Vegas attack, the man responsible for the worst mass shooting in modern American history took elaborate steps to stymie the inevitable law enforcement investigation, according to federal court documents unsealed on Friday.The F.B.I. search warrants shed new light on the degree to which the gunman, Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others when he opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October, planned the attack and prepared for the aftermath. One of the warrants described how Mr. Paddock \u201cdestroyed or tried to hide digital media devices.\u201dInvestigators said he used anonymous communications devices, including a prepaid cellphone, to cover his tracks and employed a \u201clevel of sophistication which is commonly found in mass casualty events.\u201d\u201cPaddock planned the attack meticulously and took many methodical steps to avoid detection of his plot and to thwart the eventual law enforcement investigation that would follow,\u201d the F.B.I. said.Mr. Paddock\u2019s motive for the attack remains unknown.The search warrants, which were approved by judges shortly after the shooting, said three cellphones belonging to Mr. Paddock were found in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, including two that investigators searched and one that they could not unlock. An F.B.I. agent wrote that he believed \u201cif there were any information related to a potential conspiracy, it would be found within\u201d the locked phone, which used a Google operating system.The search warrants detail how law enforcement focused on Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Mr. Paddock. She has not been charged with a crime and has spoken to investigators several times, and her lawyer has said she was not aware of Mr. Paddock\u2019s deadly plans. The investigation is continuing, and the warrants only reflect its early stages.\u201cShe has been identified thus far as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack,\u201d according to one of the documents.She told investigators she occasionally helped Mr. Paddock load magazines. The F.B.I. said there was no evidence that she knew of his plans or had been deceptive, but it cautioned soon after the shootings that she was still the \u201csubject of intensive review.\u201dMs. Danley corroborated much of what had been previously pieced together by investigators, but she has been adamant that she had no prior knowledge of Mr. Paddock\u2019s intention to carry out the mass shooting.According to the documents, it appears that Mr. Paddock relied on the internet to buy many of the items used in the attack, including guns and ammunition, during the 12 months leading up to it.He spent \u201csignificant time and expense prior to the attack purchasing and caching weapons\u201d and other items, such as glass cutters and suitcases. The authorities have said he used the glass cutters so he could fire out of his hotel window at the people below, who were attending a country music concert.Much of what investigators found in the hotel room had already been made public, but the search warrants add additional details. The F.B.I. said there were hundreds of rounds of spent ammunition as well as \u201cpreloaded high-capacity magazines,\u201d found in suitcases that Mr. Paddock had brought to the room. Investigators also found body armor, range finders and a homemade gas mask.Investigators also revealed that Mr. Paddock may have been treated for \u201cunidentified medical conditions.\u201d In October, Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock\u2019s physical and mental health seemed to have deteriorated in recent months.In an affidavit submitted as part of a search warrant application, an investigator said that access to Ms. Danley\u2019s email account could \u201clead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan and Marilou Danley\u2019s possible involvement.\u201d The authorities also requested information about several Instagram accounts that they believed were connected to Ms. Danley.In their requests for data from Instagram, investigators said they were seeking \u201cevidence showing the possession, use, purchase or sale of firearms, firearms accessories, ammunition or explosives by Paddock.\u201d They also sought information about Ms. Danley\u2019s \u201cstate of mind as it relates to the crime under investigation\u201d and the identities of anyone who communicated with her about what would amount to violations of federal weapons laws.Ms. Danley deleted her Facebook account just hours after the attack, investigators wrote in their affidavit. At 12:30 a.m., about two-and-a-half hours after the shooting began, she changed the status of her account to private. By 2:46 a.m., she had deleted the account entirely.In September, the court records suggested, Mr. Paddock ordered from Amazon a holographic weapon sight that investigators believe he ultimately used during the assault. On Friday night, Amazon listed the same model, which was described as \u201cdesigned for close-in combat speed and versatility.\u201d The price is $429, according to the listing, which said the sight \u201cimproves target acquisition, boosts accuracy and increases control.\u201dThe F.B.I. also discovered emails between two accounts connected to Mr. Paddock. One from early July indicated that Mr. Paddock had begun taking steps to carry out the attack, referring to a \u201cbump stock,\u201d an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster.In an email Mr. Paddock sent on July 6 to an account that also may have belonged to him, he wrote: \u201ctry an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area.\u201d Another email sent between the accounts read, \u201cfor a thrill try out bumpfire ar\u2019s with a 100 round magazine.\u201d By \u201car,\u201d Mr. Paddock appeared to be referring to rifles.The affidavit later adds that \u201cinvestigators have been unable to figure out why Stephen Paddock would be exchanging messages related to weapons that were used in the attack between two of his email accounts,\u201d and that it was possible that someone else was controlling one of the accounts. If that was the case, the investigator said, the F.B.I. needed to identify that person. Receiving a search warrant for that account \u201cwill lead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan,\u201d an F.B.I agent wrote to the judge.Alan Blinder and Mitch Smith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Get Medicaid in Kentucky, Many Will Have to Work. Advocates for the Poor Say They Will Sue.", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvocates for the poor threatened lawsuits, while Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, celebrated the approval as \u201cthe most transformational entitlement reform that has been seen in a quarter of a century.\u201dPregnant women, full-time students, primary caretakers of dependents and the chronically homeless will be exempt from the work requirement, as will people deemed medically frail. But the Bevin administration still expects about 350,000 people to be subject to the requirement, which will be phased in around the state starting in July. About half of them already meet it, according to the administration.\u201cWe are ready to show America how this can and will be done,\u201d Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. \u201cIt will soon become the standard and the norm in the United States of America, and America will be better for it.\u201dRoughly 500,000 adults have joined Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid rolls since the state expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. Mr. Bevin has consistently attacked the expansion as a waste of money, questioning why \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults should be given free government health care that used to be largely limited to children, the elderly and the disabled.He filed for federal permission to impose work requirements in 2016 \u2014 notably, instead of seeking to end the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion altogether. And since then, more than a dozen other states have also sought work requirements or said they plan to. Several sought Medicaid work requirements during the Obama administration but were rebuffed.Under its plan, Kentucky will also require many adults who aren\u2019t elderly or disabled to pay premiums of $1 to $15 a month, depending on their income. And it will disenroll people from Medicaid for up to six months if they fail to report changes in income or work status. Those who qualified for Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion will also have to \u201cearn\u201d dental and vision benefits, which they have been able to access freely until now, through activities like taking a financial literacy course or getting a GED.The Bevin administration has estimated that the plan will result in 100,000 fewer Medicaid recipients after five years and save $2.4 billion, mostly in federal Medicaid funds. But Mr. Bevin couched the policy change as a moral rather than a fiscal decision, saying he did not care about the savings and saw it as an opportunity for Kentucky\u2019s poor \u201cnot to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves.\u201dAdvocates for Medicaid beneficiaries said they disagreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assertion, in approving Kentucky\u2019s plan, that work requirements were consistent with the goals of Medicaid because work could improve people\u2019s health.\u201cConsidering that it will seriously harm over 100,000 Kentuckians, in violation of numerous provisions of Medicaid law, we are very seriously considering taking legal action \u2014 and as we analyze the meager legal rationale in the approval itself, it seems inevitable,\u201d said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for the poor.Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group, said the state had provided little information about how it would make sure people were complying with work requirements, how exemptions would be determined and other details.\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating Kentuckians by and large are going to be extremely confused and worried about what they\u2019re going to face and whether or not they\u2019ll continue to have coverage,\u201d Ms. Beauregard said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be looking to advocates and enrollment assisters and their providers for answers, and at this point we don\u2019t have any.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe idea that we are encouraging work and independence, then taking away the health care that makes people more employable and better able to function \u2014 none of this adds up to something that\u2019s going to be good for Kentuckians or our economy.\u201dBut Hal Heiner, Kentucky\u2019s Education and Workforce Development secretary, said during Mr. Bevin\u2019s news conference that there was \u201can abundance of jobs\u201d available to Medicaid recipients, as well as resources to prepare them.\u201cWe have the jobs, we have the tuition resources, we have the job coaches in our career centers all across the state,\u201d he said, \u201cand now we\u2019ll be able to connect the dots.\u201dOther state officials said the state was building an IT system to track people\u2019s compliance with the work and premium requirements and participation in activities, like taking the financial literacy course, that would earn them points toward dental and vision care. They did not, however, provide a cost estimate for building and maintaining the administrative infrastructure necessary to monitor compliance with the new requirements.\u201cThe idea that we should keep doing what we\u2019re doing is an insult to the people of Kentucky,\u201d he said.Sheila Schuster, a longtime health care advocate in the state, said she saw it differently.\u201cThe administration has their chicken-and-egg story completely wrong \u2014 they say people need to work to get healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all know that health is the foundation from which people go to school, go to work and keep their employment. So I\u2019m afraid the administration is not only going backward, but doing it for completely the wrong reasons.\u201d\u201cI feel this is wrong,\u201d another said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t they not be in Medicaid if they could get a job?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Kid\u2019s First Lesson in Realpolitik", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSurprisingly, playgrounds in Switzerland are lawless zones. Twenty-five years ago, when I moved to Zurich from the United States in the fifth grade, I was mercilessly bullied by my classmates. They changed the indiscriminately terrifying name of the favored playground game \u201cAlle Gegen Alle\u201d (\u201cEveryone Against Everyone\u201d) to \u201cAlle Gegen Annie\u201d (\u201cEveryone Against Annie\u201d). The game consisted of throwing a handball at somebody as hard as humanly possible. The rest of the students jumped at the chance to pummel the newcomer with all their pent-up, prepubescent rage. Frantically, I looked around for assistance, but there was no grown-up in sight.Until then, I had never really known conflict; I had not learned to defend myself. At even a whiff of drama on the playground of my Missouri public school, the monitor would race over with her whistle hanging commandingly around her neck. In contrast, Swiss parents believe that if children learn to resolve their own conflicts early on, they will be more autonomous and confident later in life. According to the author Sara Zaske and others who advocate German parenting models, this laid-back approach was a deliberate move away from the strict child-rearing practices associated with authoritarianism.Eventually, my mother could no longer endure my suffering and, on one fateful day, unbeknown to me, marched to my school to lecture my tormentors. After that, I was left alone, but nobody ever invited me to take part in another birthday party or game of mutual destruction.The presidency of Donald Trump shows me just why it is so important to expose ourselves \u2014 especially our children \u2014 to conflict. If you examine him through the lens of playground politics, you will recognize Mr. Trump as a thin-skinned bully who seems incapable of stomaching criticism or opposition. At the same time, he postures as a victim, vacillating between venomous outcries at his foes and the desperate need for validation from his fans.The problem with America \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s playground \u2014 is that we\u2019ve developed an insular, conflict-averse culture. The president\u2019s trolling is so effective, in part, because many of us have not learned how to deal with interpersonal conflict, starting with the playground. We must learn to defend ourselves so that when Donald Trump or any other bully taunts us, we can rise to the occasion.Most of us, liberals and conservatives alike, live in well-insulated echo chambers where Rachel Maddow or Sean Hannity deliver more eloquent renditions of our own opinions in hyperbolic form. No wonder the American political system is suffering from an epic communication breakdown. Ensconced in our cocoons, we have lost the ability to talk to people with different views.I was as shocked as many people were when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election. As one of my friends mused: \u201cHow could Hillary lose? All my Facebook friends voted for her.\u201d This monumental distortion of perspectives has culminated in the Trump administration\u2019s genius postmodern claim that any unfavorable facts are \u201cfake news.\u201d But many liberals woke up on Nov. 9 also declared the election fake news.One of the hardest choices parents face is when to intervene in our children\u2019s lives. Each day we are forced to make countless micro decisions that, en masse, add up to a de facto parenting philosophy.My daughter\u2019s taunts sounded so familiar \u2014 the trolling of an innocent victim who happened to draw the ire of a powerful, vocal bully. I wanted to let the children learn to deal with conflict on their own terms. But when Nina looked about to cry, I relented: \u201cGuys, please apologize to Nina for hurting her feelings.\u201d It was, after all, America, and I wanted my daughter to have friends.Kids don\u2019t live in a bubble, so why do we try to shelter them from conflict? One of the earliest lessons you learn at school is about the boundless cruelty of other children. And that bullies can win. Yet contrary to these early playground lessons in realpolitik, children are consistently taught to avoid conflict by well-meaning parents, teachers and caregivers because that\u2019s how we want the world to work. We raise our children in gilded playpens, shielding them from criticism and alternative views.Mr. Trump has convinced me to give my daughter some tough love. To expose her to critical opinions, to make her listen to views she might not like or agree with. I don\u2019t want her to lose it when somebody like Donald Trump is elected. More than anything, I want her to be able to defend herself and fight back.I want my daughter to learn to say no confidently and unapologetically. Dealing with conflict is also about standing up for yourself as a woman, whether a man is talking over you at a meeting or trying to engage in unwanted sexual behavior. If we learn early how to have difficult or uncomfortable conversations up front, we don\u2019t need others to fill in the gaps, make our decisions or read our minds. But if we can\u2019t stand up to conflict, we risk becoming the snowflakes that the Donald Trumps and the wagging tongues on the right make us out to be.Finally, I want my daughter to think about the larger world, beyond the echo chamber that narrowly reflects her own experiences and views. I want her to think beyond the \u201cme\u201d in #MeToo. I want her to think about women, but I also want her to think of men, of the poor, minorities and the people who might not be part of the most trendy Instagram hashtag.Because all I\u2019ve heard for the past 18 months is about Donald Trump.Annie Pfeifer is an assistant professor in the department of international literary and cultural studies at Tufts University.Advertisement"}

Today we are celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Agnes Davidson and Zhouqin Burnikel collaborated to make a lovely puzzle to honor him.King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, delivered from the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, was made as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, so it\u2019s fitting that we solve a puzzle about that subject today.Four theme entries that end in a synonym for the hint at 61A are packed into Ms. Davidson and Ms. Burnikel\u2019s puzzle, and while it was relatively easy to figure out, it still left me with a lump in my throat. I was a baby when King was assassinated, but I still remember my mother crying when the news came out.At 17A, for example, we have the phrase NEW RELEASE, and RELEASE is a synonym for the word FREE in the 61A revealer, FREE AT LAST.Now you go set the others free.29A: I wasn\u2019t thinking about zodiac symbols when I read this clue, but LEO for \u201cLion in summer?\u201d makes perfect sense.42A: Wordplay alert! If you put the phrase TO GO together, it becomes the country of TOGO in West Africa.The seventh annual Monthly Music Meta contest held by puzzle maker Pete Mullerbegins on Tuesday, January 16, with monthly puzzles released on the first Tuesday of each month.

{"Headline": "Tapping Technology to Advance the Future of Journalism", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor at The Times who oversees digital initiatives, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You oversee podcasts, virtual reality and other new digital efforts. What does a typical day look like for your media consumption?I used to begin the day scrolling through my phone while still in bed. Recently I\u2019ve gotten better at leaving my phone in another room while I sleep \u2014 which means that now the first thing I do when I wake up is make a mad dash to retrieve my phone from the living room.I read several email newsletters, then I read The Times\u2019s front page in print, flip to the Opinion pages and scan for other articles to read on my phone during the commute.My 7-year-old daughter will usually ask Alexa to play a terrible song \u2014 the democratization of music choice is one of the untold perils of the modern era. Then, Alexa will thankfully interrupt with an alarm that it\u2019s time to leave for the bus.At night, my wife and I will often watch a streaming show. We just started \u201cWormwood\u201d on Netflix. And then I read actual physical books before going to sleep.You study new opportunities for The Times to distribute its journalism. How do you decide which ventures are worth pursuing? Lots of people have referred to this past year as a \u201cmedia apocalypse\u201d because of the harsh realities of digital advertising. But from a different angle, there\u2019s never been a more exciting time to tell important stories and reach more people in more ways. Our mission at The Times is to help people understand the world, so we pursue opportunities where we can further that in new ways.And then we made a major push into audio because we saw a giant opportunity to reinvent our journalism in a medium that is quickly rising in importance. We are living in a world where the mobile phone is dominant, and audio, which doesn\u2019t require your eyes or your hands, is the ultimate mobile medium. We launched The Daily in February, and it immediately became our best push toward rebuilding the daily habit of print reading. It\u2019s really working. The Daily was the top downloaded podcast in Apple podcasts in 2017.We\u2019ve got more to come in 2018, but look for those common threads. We\u2019ll go to places where lots of people are already spending their time and mediums that allow us to help people understand the real world in new ways.What are some of your favorite new publishing strategies that you see The Times or other outlets experimenting with?I know some people find push alerts to be intrusive, but I\u2019m fascinated by them. I watch N.B.A. highlights right from my phone\u2019s lock screen: The great Bleacher Report app sends out push alerts with embedded videos of the key moments from the games, often in real time. I never even open the app, but it has totally changed how I watch basketball.I\u2019m also seriously interested in newsletters as a lo-fi way to form a deep relationship with readers. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been to the Axios site, but I spend more time with Mike Allen\u2019s newsletter every week than I do with most publishers\u2019 home pages.Finally, streaming TV feels like a new frontier where old rules about length, format and expectations are exploding in real time. When you\u2019re not locked into 30 minutes with commercial breaks, what other conventions can you throw out?What is your advice for people who aspire to become reporters? What new digital tools should they start using today?Reporters of the future should master the building blocks of traditional journalism. The coin of the realm, no matter the medium, is the ability to find out new facts and to uncover things that someone doesn\u2019t want you to uncover. If you can get inside the room and explain to people what happened there, and if you can do it quickly and reliably, you\u2019ll become a strong reporter no matter how or where you tell your stories.You should start your own newsletter. You\u2019ll want to understand what makes for a good podcast, and what makes for a good video \u2014 all the better if you develop skills to make them yourself.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your personal life?What are some of your favorite podcasts other than The Daily?One of the Daily producers turned me on to an insane podcast called Dissect, where a guy analyzes, at very great length, every song on a Kanye West record. It\u2019s like going to Kanye School, which I didn\u2019t expect to do.I\u2019m enjoying Slow Burn, Slate\u2019s new podcast about what it was like to live through Watergate. I loved Ear Hustle, a sharp and humane series about prison life. And \u201cThis American Life,\u201d of course, still offers a master class in storytelling every week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Book of Clare: Givenchy\u2019s Powerful Return to Couture", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewClare Waight Keller did not invite a lot of people to the Givenchy couture show \u2014 her first ever couture show, and the first for the brand in eight years.She did not ask any celebrities. She didn\u2019t really gussy up the rooms in the National Archives where the show was held \u2014 just pushed some chairs against the walls, so any light shining through the towering windows created striations on the bare wood floors and cast shadows across the audience. She didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it beforehand on Instagram or Facebook, though she did send chunky, hardback books, all in black, as her invitations, with the title of her show, \u201cMysteries of a Garden at Night,\u201d etched in gold on the spine.Books! In the age of the Kindle. Inside, the pages were blank.At a time when there\u2019s much talk in fashion about \u201cnew chapters,\u201d mostly as a way to frame the seemingly endless and increasingly problematic entrances and exits of designers, it was both a pointed commentary and a dare, given that paper and couture are regularly declared dead.Really? You think so? Ms. Keller has a different idea. Sometimes, you have to write your own prosody and let people discover it for themselves.40 PhotosOn Tuesday, in an entirely assured debut, she did exactly that.She mixed men\u2019s wear tailoring \u2014 sharp and sleek of line \u2014 with fringe and fancy, throwing military greatcoats faced in d\u00e9grad\u00e9 feathers over gowns dripping in silver; transparent latex trench coats over tiers of rough-cut silk; leotard tops with square shoulders and exposed backs over a swirling rainbow skirts. She added men\u2019s couture in similar materials, silhouette and silver. Hems were long and body parts mostly covered. That didn\u2019t make it any less sophisticated or alluring.There\u2019s a lot of that going around, in high fashion as in vampire romance. All those tales about millennials and the rise of gym wear and social media are muddying the classic narratives.Or so it seemed, anyway, in Giorgio Armani\u2019s Priv\u00e9 show, a meditation on the sky in all its cloudy metamorphoses by way of \u2014 athcouture.Which is to say: 50 shades of evening shorts. In watercolor silk, paired with elaborately swagged bustier tops or single-button jackets. In cumulus organza, with matching camisoles and anoraks speckled with sequins. In paillette-covered bloomers and sequined biker styles. Oh, and when there were no shorts, there were beaded sweats and crystal leggings.63 PhotosAlso some lovely iridescent strapless soap-bubble dresses, understated trousers and executive jackets, and a pair of elegant gowns in gleaming silk. But shorts were the dominant theme. You can understand the idea: It\u2019s a way to get out your legs for night and not be hampered by any practical concerns. The problem was that, on the runway, in front of such Armani-ites as Diane Kruger, Isabelle Huppert and Marion Cotillard, they read like a confusing subplot \u2014 albeit one with its own sense of direction, unlike Elie Saab\u2019s ode to Paris in the 1920s by way of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and their cohort.If \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d had been rewritten in purple prose and bedazzled, with a flowing chiffon cape and a feather fillip for good measure, that is what it might look like.It was a different story, however, at Maison Margiela. There, in a kaleidoscopic, Kerouacian collection, John Galliano took the brand on the road via special holographic fabric developed in China that looked like oily black nylon when viewed with the naked eye, but that turned iridescent in the light of an iPhone\u2019s flash; silvery oversize parka layers shadowing ornate brocade; and a long, spaghetti-strap gown veiled in lace and trapped under a PVC bustier.There was an apple green cable coat crafted from molded rubber; a flouro pink slipdress encircled by acrylic swirls like Saturn\u2019s rings; and a skirt made entirely of multicolor, clacking plastic tags. Not to mention denim, fishnet, rhinestones and Chantilly lace; past and techno present layered one atop the other in a masterful display of sartorial free association with a sneaker underpinning. Wearability went out the window and it didn\u2019t matter one whit.The effect was novel, in every sense of the word.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Burning Man", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "Driving converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, \u201cskoolies\u201d and the odd Prius, a few thousand gather in defiance of consumerist society.Supported bySkoolies are school buses that have been turned into houses on wheels, and the Blacks, who bought theirs through Craigslist for $7,500 and have been on the road for a year, are new members of a sprawling and disparate tribe of vehicular nomads that flock to this dusty desert town each winter. They come for the boondocking \u2014 nomad vernacular for free or low-cost camping \u2014 on the thousands of acres of federal land that are adjacent to the place, and for the community, particularly that found at a two-week-long rally called the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous.Organized by Bob Wells, a 62-year-old van-dwelling evangelist who has been living on the road for over two decades, the RTR drew just 45 people when it began in 2010. This year, Mr. Wells said, rangers estimated the crowd at over 3,000. Often called a Burning Man for retirees, the RTR is starting to skew younger, at least by anecdotal measures.Melody Tilton, a 31-year-old massage therapist, said she had been inspired by Mr. Wells\u2019s YouTube videos to take to the road last fall with her husband, Kyle, also 31, who had worked in information technology, in a white \u201997 Roadtrek, though she hankered for a skoolie. (Roadtreks are easier to park.) They sold their house in Minnesota, and are running on the proceeds. \u201cI had been looking for ways to be a full-time hobo,\u201d Ms. Tilton said. \u201cI thought you had to be retired.\u201dCommitted nomads come to share tips on solar power, stealth overnights in parking spots on city streets, van conversion, mail, hygiene, finances and low-cost dental care, which can be found over the border in the Mexican town of Los Algodones, an hour and a half away. Aspirational nomads come to test the waters, in rented mini-Winnies and camper vans. And they come to meet Mr. Wells, a celebrity here. With his abundant gray hair, lustrous beard and mellifluous voice, he is an amiable philosopher-elder of the road: Bruce Chatwin in a GMC cargo van.Twenty-three years ago, Mr. Wells went through a bitter divorce that upended his finances. He couldn\u2019t afford to rent an apartment on his own; with his last $1,500 in savings, he bought a box van and moved into it, stealth-parking on the streets of Anchorage, where he worked at a Safeway and where his ex-wife and two sons lived. The first nights, he cried himself to sleep. \u201cI came into the van life kicking and screaming, but I fell in love with it,\u201d he said.The pressures of sticks-and-bricks living, as nomads call traditional dwellings \u2014 the mortgage, the taxes, the maintenance \u2014 currently holds no allure for Mr. Wells. \u201cThe Titanic is going down,\u201d he said, alluding to the general state of the economy and environment, \u201cand this is a lifeboat. This is a hope, a promise of a better, more meaningful life.\u201dThe road from Quartzsite to the site of this year\u2019s RTR was pocked with muffler-scraping craters. (\u201cEnd Arizona Dept. of Transportation Maintenance,\u201d read a helpful sign.) Most nomads left the rutted tarmac for the dusty shoulder, bucketing along until they hit a dirt track. It wasn\u2019t easy to discern the shape and scope of the rally, or figure out where it actually began.Converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, skoolies and even a few cars (Mr. Wells likes to say that those who are living in Priuses are the saints of the community) were camped along the washes at decorous intervals from each other, in distinct contrast to the more conventional RV campgrounds that also surround Quartzsite, where gleaming Winnebagos park nose to tail and side by side.The Rubber Tramp Rendezvous agora was a centrally located patch of chalky ground ringed by creosote bushes and giant saguaro. There were seminars on creating YouTube videos; a tin can Q. and A., and show-and-tells of favorite gadgets. Two tarps were neatly arrayed with books, clothing, housewares and personal care products. Attendees could leave unwanted goods from decluttering their rigs or pick up needed items for free.One afternoon, the faint smell of charcoal briquettes wafted over the crowd, sunburned men and women planted in camp chairs and trying to keep snuffling dogs not used to leashes to heel. As Mr. Wells was extolling the virtues of camping above 7,000 feet, a late visitor wondered why.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to get hot,\u201d one woman whispered.A man raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re an introvert. So what are we doing here?\u201dMr. Wells nodded and asked all the introverts in the crowd to raise their hands. Mostly everyone did.\u201cGood question,\u201d Mr. Wells said. \u201cWhy have we driven thousands of miles to be together? It\u2019s because we need each other so much. Even the most introverted of us knows that. We\u2019re looking for like-minded people who will let us be our authentic selves. Together, at a distance. Humans are funny things. Don\u2019t worry. The RTR is going to end, and you\u2019ll be alone again soon.\u201d\u201cAre you dating?\u201d a woman in the crowd asked.They are not, though they like to tease their audience.\u201cThe world stigmatizes people who live differently,\u201d Ms. Bruder said. \u201cThe RTR is full of kindred spirits, like a non-blood family. People there feel heard and understood and valuable. There can be a sense of isolation out there in the world. When they get to the RTR, it melts away.\u201dWhile van culture may be growing because more and more people are caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of flat wages and rising home prices, Ms. Bruder added, \u201cI also think people are frustrated by consumer culture and what they are supposed to want. People who are constrained by economics are also saying, \u2018I can opt out.\u2019 I think that can be tremendously liberating.\u201dFor her research, Ms. Bruder bought a white GMC Vandura, named it Halen, for the 1980s hair band, and learned to correct for its sideways drift on the highways. Despite aching shoulders from keeping it on course, she loved being out in her van, she said. \u201cThere was one day when we were driving in a caravan, like horses galloping across the desert. I was following a 70-year-old woman named Swankie, and we were on our way to see an ancient earthwork in a petrified forest. My heart was in my throat. That sense of constant motion on the road, when everything feels new. The mythos of the desert landscape. It got me.\u201d\u201cI think a lot of women my age have a feeling they\u2019d like to take control,\u201d Ms. Higgins said, noting that her videos seem to have struck a chord. \u201cMaybe they are recognizing that mainstream society doesn\u2019t feel safe anymore.

{"Headline": "\u2018Interrupters\u2019 Peek at Social Media to Stop Street Violence", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one Facebook post, two teenage boys posed in a photo with handguns on each of their laps.In another, a group of young men threatened to attack another man whom they believed had cooperated with detectives investigating a string of robberies.In each case, someone beyond family and immediate friends was watching.Those extra eyes belonged to workers trained in mediating conflicts and mentoring at-risk young people.In the situation involving threats, workers learned that the young man who had been threatened had actually not assisted the police, so they reached out and told the men who were making the threats. In an instant the conflict was resolved.\u201cThe kid\u2019s life was in danger. We cleared his name,\u201d said Felix Polanco, a program supervisor at True2Life, a group at Central Family Life Center on Staten Island. \u201cOur job is to save lives.\u201dBut stopping crime is as tricky online as it is on the streets. In the case of the boys with the guns, a worker reached out to the father of one boy \u2014 whom he knew personally \u2014 and the picture came down. But the boy ended up getting shot a week later.The workers who jumped into these simmering online situations are known as \u201cviolence interrupters,\u201d and their interventions were part of an initiative known as E-Responder. Its goal is to identify and de-escalate social media conflicts before they erupt into violence on the street.The program, developed by the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City in partnership with New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Development, was first tested in 2016. It expanded a year ago.Under the program, the violence interrupters spend at least two hours a day monitoring social media for signs of risky behavior, like threats of violence, photos with weapons or expressions of grief or emotional stress, Mr. Polanco said. They focus on people ages 16 to 25. If an alarming post or photo is found, a worker reaches out to the young person.During the pilot program, youth workers interrupted 154 social media feuds; more than half were described as medium or high risk, according to the Citizens Crime Commission.In all last year, the city\u2019s Cure Violence sites \u2014 organizations, including True2Life, that treat violence as a public health concern \u2014 intervened in 5,273 street and online conflicts, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which maintains the data. The agency did not have data on what percentage were online interventions. The Citizens Crime Commission is currently working to compile that data.On Staten Island, True2Life interrupters focus their outreach on youth in parts of Mariners Harbor and Stapleton, where nearly a third of the residents live below the poverty level, according to a New York City Department of Planning 2016 report.Michael Perry, 37, a violence interrupter and program supervisor at True2Life, came of age in the 1990s in the Richmond Terrace Development, 10 minutes from Stapleton, where he sold drugs, carried firearms, was arrested, had friends felled by gun violence and was nearly killed himself. It was where \u2014 when Mr. Perry was 9 years old \u2014 his father, who peddled drugs to feed his own addiction, was stabbed to death in a drug feud. Ultimately, Mr. Perry, now a father of two, also found redemption there after praying for a way out.Since joining True2Life four years ago, Mr. Perry has tried to lead by example, telling young people engaged in violence and risky behavior that they, too, can change. In the two years since the pilot launched, Mr. Perry said he intervened in up to 60 online fights that could have led to violence.Most social media interventions \u2014 97 percent \u2014 performed during the pilot in 2016 had positive outcomes, according to the Citizens Crime Commission.To assist in sorting through hundreds of social media posts, the Citizens Crime Commission is awaiting approval from Facebook to use software they developed that will review, analyze and provide real-time alerts about posts containing violent language.But for now the workers manually browse through social media profiles and, at times, other young people alert them to potentially dangerous messages and photos.It was Mr. Perry who spotted the photo on Facebook of the two teenage boys with firearms in May. He recognized one of them as the son of a childhood friend. A week after the disturbing post, the boy was shot in the leg. Mr. Perry visited him at the hospital and has stayed in contact with him. He hopes that in time he can steer the teenager away from a seemingly violent path.\u201cYou don\u2019t go preaching \u2014 you build relationships and bond with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time.\u201dFrom 2012 to 2015, at least 240 shootings and 24 homicides in New York City started as arguments on social media, according to the Citizens Crime Commission, which examined indictments during that period.\u201cPeople who feel they\u2019ve been disrespected on social media will take it to the streets,\u201d said Jeff Butts, director of the Research and Evaluation Center at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who has evaluated violence prevention programs in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s about pride and respect.\u201dSimilarly, during that same time more than 700 people were indicted based on evidence found on their social media pages.Young people commonly use social media to threaten their rivals, and online feuds can lead to retaliation, experts said.Stephanie Ueberall, director of violence prevention at the Citizens Crime Commission, said E-Responder includes a 12-week youth leadership program that encourages participants to engage in positive social media exchanges and activism, while teaching them self-empowerment and how to express and manage their emotions.\u201cSocial media can greatly accelerate violence,\u201d Ueberall said. \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t have the direction or support they need to get into a healthy lifestyle. The main task is to change the way they think.\u201dFollow Jan Ransom on Twitter: @Jan_RansomAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Even on the Internet, What\u2019s Old Is New Again", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryIt is indisputable that the internet \u2014 facilitated by both vast improvements in access and computing power \u2014 has had a disruptive impact on not just business but politics and many aspects of our daily lives. Demonstrating precisely what that impact is, however, has been remarkably challenging. Pronouncements on the topic have a tendency to be overblown. \u201cTransformational,\u201d \u201cexponential\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d are increasingly favored adjectives, whether they are applicable or not.The impression that the world is changing faster today than ever before has become conventional wisdom. Yet the magnitude of change that occurred between when America galloped into World War I on horses and dropped the atomic bomb feels more significant than that undergone since the first dot-com domain name was registered. This observation is not meant to diminish the importance of the seismic changes wrought by the digital age, but rather to suggest the relevance of historical context often absent from the conversation.The internet itself is a network of networks. The ability to communicate and transact across its vast reach is indeed unprecedented and represents the basic infrastructure of what has been termed the \u201cnetwork society.\u201d Mr. Ferguson\u2019s book does far more than simply track the use of the word \u201cnetwork\u201d from its introduction in English language publications in the late 19th century, when it \u201cwas scarcely used,\u201d to the modern day, when he points out that it appeared in 136 articles in The New York Times during just the first week of 2017. Rather he seeks to reframe the entirety of human history as an endless tug-of-war between eras in which powerful hierarchical institutions predominate (the Tower of the title) only to be undermined by the influence of emerging networks (the corresponding Square). In Professor Ferguson\u2019s telling, these networks are invariably co-opted by reconstituted hierarchies and the process begins again.The new industrial, financial and communications networks that emerged during this time did not, however, overturn the hierarchical nature of things. This dominant structure survived both world wars, according to Professor Ferguson, with the mid-twentieth century actually representing the \u201czenith of hierarchy.\u201d His account shows how the ability to navigate and influence these and other nascent networks determined which empires thrived in the reconfigured hierarchical orders.One does not have to completely buy in to the book\u2019s reframing of key social and political turning points to find the narrative both captivating and compelling. Whether describing the surprisingly ineffective 18th century network of the mysterious Illuminati that continue to be the subject of crank conspiracy theorists or the shockingly effective 20th century network of Cambridge University spies working for the Soviets, Professor Ferguson manages both to tell a good story and provide important insight into the specific qualities that power successful networks.Attempting to cover so much ground in such short space (\u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is less than half the length of Professor Ferguson\u2019s recent biography of Henry Kissinger) risks fatal oversimplification. The book\u2019s most impressive accomplishment is to avoid such a fate. Professor Ferguson provides a credible summary of contemporary network theory and makes clear that \u201ca hierarchy is just a special kind of network\u201d in which nodes communicate up and down but never connect laterally. There are no true pure hierarchies \u2014 Stalin\u2019s Russia probably comes closest \u2014 and the greatest strength of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that it generally avoids caricature. Instead, it emphasizes the critical questions of what distinguishes network effectiveness and what happens when networks interact.Professor Ferguson brings us up to the present with a discussion of the technology giants that have emerged in the last few decades. His focus is on their political and economic influence. He includes an interesting discussion of the similarities and differences between the impact of the internet and the printing press.There is a burgeoning literature in management journals and business books that focuses on the internet\u2019s influence on business strategy rather than politics. In some ways, this work reflects a variation on the paradigm described by Professor Ferguson. Corresponding to the discussion of \u201cold hierarchies\u201d are businesses that rely on high fixed costs to build barriers to competitive entry, whereas the disruptive \u201cnew networks\u201d are constructed on digital platforms made possible by the internet. These new businesses, it is argued, fuel so-called \u201cnetwork effects\u201d that lead inevitably to winner-take-all marketplaces.These analyses, however, have lacked the historical perspective of \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d In place of the nuanced discussion of how hierarchies and networks interact, is a broad-brush assertion that scale achieved through network effects is inherently superior to that based on old-fashioned fixed costs.In fact, platforms are no more a peculiarly modern phenomenon than networks are, and their digital incarnations are not necessarily better businesses than those that came before. Analog malls had the benefit of their shoppers being many miles away from competing malls and their retail tenants being committed to long-term leases. On the internet, platform competitors are only a click away and relationships are notoriously transactional.The important lesson of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that the existence of a network, or network effects for that matter, should be the beginning not the end of the analysis. The critical questions relate to the network\u2019s key characteristics and how it interacts with other networks and hierarchies.The same is true of platform businesses, which are of highly diverse quality depending on their structural attributes and the ecosystems within which they operate. It is not a coincidence that the two largest and most enduring purely digital platforms \u2014 Google and Amazon \u2014 are not primarily network-effects businesses, but instead are companies that benefit from leveraging multiple, complementary sources of competitive advantage including, notably, traditional fixed-cost scale.Predicting the viability of new business models requires a careful understanding of both history and industry structure. If \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d encourages digital business strategists and venture capitalists to take this to heart, it will have made an important, if unexpected, contribution.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Home to Hawaii in Search of Poke", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookHONOLULU \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the first time I tasted poke, because in Hawaii, where I grew up, it was always there \u2014 in a plastic tub from Foodland or Tamura\u2019s or Tamashiro\u2019s, tossed on the table as a snack or a side dish. Never the main event, but always essential: pieces of raw fish seasoned simply, with a few strong ingredients to draw out the taste of the sea.What finally sent me over the edge was a highly lauded poke spot in Los Angeles. The fish was dropped into a bowl of marinade, and then the whole bowl was tipped over the rice. The dark stain of soy sauce soaked through, turning everything to salt.It made me sad to think that this is the only poke some mainlanders will ever know. So on a recent trip home, I decided to try to trace poke to its source: where it comes from, who makes it and how we eat it. I\u2019m not arguing for some kind of authenticity or a return to the \u201ctrue\u201d poke. There isn\u2019t one; grocery stores in Hawaii offer as many as four dozen varieties.But poke wouldn\u2019t exist without the islands\u2019 meld of cultures and reverence for the ocean, passed down by the ancients. To learn the history of the dish is to begin to understand a way of life.Her shoyu ahi is a marriage of Hawaii and Japan, given a sheen of sesame oil and a \u201csecret shoyu\u201d made with premium soy sauce and ingredients known only to her and Ms. Brug, and seasoned with skinny, snaking strands of limu, inamona and a faint but menacing tattoo of chile. Better yet is the spicy ahi, veiled in mayonnaise with a streak of heat. Half the kick comes from ginger, and the pop from tiny beads of masago (capelin roe).Fresh ahi is delivered daily and turned into heaps of translucent ruby cubes. (Tako, or octopus, poke is also available.) Order a \u201cbowl,\u201d and you receive a foam box of rice and poke, no more, no less. The rice itself is impeccably fluffy and exhaling warmth, just enough to leave the fish in a cool blush. Toppings are do-it-yourself from a case by the counter, stocked with seaweed salad, pickled onions, Korean taegu (spicy-sweet dried cuttlefish), tsukemono (Japanese pickles) and boiled peanuts. But you don\u2019t need them.For Mr. Schade, poke is inextricable from his life as a fisherman and all its risks. Two summers ago, his boat sank. It was the Fourth of July; no one saw the flares. He swam two miles home in the dark, and brought the Coast Guard back to rescue his father and two uncles.From the moment the fish leaves the boat to the moment it\u2019s served, at most two days pass. Its flesh is a barely muted incarnadine, sliced in larger hunks than typically found elsewhere, and beautifully tender.Any of a dozen types of poke may be on hand, including shoyu garlic with crisp, clarifying arcs of white onion; pake, Hawaiian for Chinese, contoured with ginger and scallions; and \u201clunatic,\u201d named after Ms. Luna (\u201cif you had to live with her, you\u2019d know,\u201d Mr. Schade said) and essentially spicy ahi, only with sriracha untempered by mayonnaise.Ahi Assassins was supposed to be just a fish store. (There are no tables.) But after the owners invited the neighborhood to an opening-day blessing in the parking lot, with food and poke for everyone, people came by looking for more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the food,\u201d Mr. Schade said. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling like you walked into my house.\u201dThe recipes lean Japanese, with flavors like ume-shiso, tangy and bright from salted plum, and a tumble of hamachi (yellowtail) stung by wasabi. The brothers\u2019 take on spicy ahi is creamier, with more sweetness to the mayonnaise and a milder, if persistent heat. But they, too, honor Hawaiian tradition in a version strewn with little pronged fronds of limu. It tastes brinier than others around town, and closer to the sea.They were prescient: The address is just a mile from what is today the Honolulu Fish Auction, where the Tamashiro brothers buy seafood before dawn six days a week. They make poke from almost everything they get their hands on: surf clams, kajiki (blue marlin), nairagi (striped marlin) and kawa kawa (mackerel tuna), whose flesh is the lushest red.Strong flavors are ascendant here, with nuances that only a kamaaina might understand, like ahi with white onions (clean and sweet) versus ahi with green onions (mellower). Their tako poke, made with octopus caught in local waters, is lovely: The octopus is first lomi-ed, or massaged, with salt, then steamed into submission.Recipes are straightforward, with minute shadings. Here is ahi with inamona and sea salt; there, ahi with limu and sea salt. Shoyu is calibrated with little more than ginger. As for \u201cTamura\u2019s secret sauce,\u201d the manager I spoke with laughed and said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201dThe Foodland near my mom\u2019s house, one of more than two dozen statewide, has a sign over the poke counter that says \u201cHawaii\u2019s home for poke,\u201d and it is \u2014 the never-fail poke you run to the store for when friends announce they\u2019re stopping by.There\u2019s nothing ceremonial about his approach. He uses ingredients like sea asparagus, truffle oil and gochujang, and makes a deconstructed California-roll poke with avocado, furikake and sriracha, one of the stores\u2019 best-sellers. And he\u2019s not against the mainland poke craze, \u201cso long as you take time to understand the history and apply common sense and restraint.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s amazingly delicious \u2014 \u201d he said, and trailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country.\u201dAHI ASSASSINSFOODLANDMAGURO BROTHERSONO SEAFOODTAMASHIRO MARKETTAMURA\u2019S FINE WINE & LIQUORScookingAdvertisement"}

He has been the most valuable player in four of them, and recently he was selected to his 13th Pro Bowl. But throughout another dominant N.F.L. season, which continues Saturday night with a divisional round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans, Brady has taken the poet Dylan Thomas to heart and refused to go gentle into that good night.With the help of a book, a controversial side business and a new documentary series \u2014 coming soon to a smartphone near you \u2014 his midlife crisis is unfolding before packed stadiums, millions of television viewers and social media followers, and an eager news media horde.Still, something just feels different about the latest Patriots-Brady chatter, which has produced consternation and uproar in Patriots Nation and the N.F.L. at large.Between Brady\u2019s embrace of the New Age and news reports out of Foxborough, Mass., that his business partner and best friend, Alex Guerrero, might have become a divisive enough figure to be banished from the team\u2019s training facilities and sideline, Patriots Kremlinologists have been in a tizzy about whether Brady and Coach Bill Belichick are feuding \u2014 and whether that might imperil one of the N.F.L.\u2019s greatest dynasties.Yet on WEEI\u2019s \u201cKirk & Callahan\u201d radio show this week, Brady did not exactly dismiss reports that all was not well in the New England organization.\u201cEveryone has different truths,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you talk about the way I see things, the way you guys see things, the way the writer may see things, the way Coach Belichick may see things, everyone has different truths based on their perspectives. I feel like I go about my business like I have every year, and again, I like to speak for myself, because that\u2019s how \u2014 I don\u2019t want to speak on someone else\u2019s behalf or what their experiences are. I try to do the best I can do, like I\u2019ve always done.\u201d\u201cFate whispers to the warrior, \u2018You cannot withstand the storm.\u2019 The warrior whispers back, \u2018I am the storm.\u2019 \u2014 Unknown\u201d was the cryptic message that greeted Brady\u2019s 3.3 million Instagram followers one day this week.In \u201cTom vs. Time,\u201d Brady is not only burnishing his own legend, however; he is also aligning himself with one of the world\u2019s foremost tech giants to spread his gospel.\u201cI do want to know the whys in life,\u201d Brady said in one of five episodes screened by the New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich. \u201cI do want to know why we\u2019re here, where we\u2019re going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me.\u201dIt is unlikely Tony Robbins is hearing footsteps.But after pointing out a few of the holes in the episodes that he watched \u2014 Belichick is almost entirely absent, and the Garoppolo and Guerrero affairs do not get a single mention \u2014 Leibovich gave the series a thumbs up as \u201cpure candy for football geeks, celebrity lifestyle voyeurs and pretty much any N.F.L. enthusiast curious about one of sports\u2019 more enigmatic superstars.\u201dGive it to Brady.

{"Headline": "Vowel Play", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySUNDAY PUZZLE \u2014 UPDATE: The earlier version of the web puzzle has been fixed. If you are solving on iOS and you loaded the puzzle at 6 p.m., you can get the update by going to the Archive page, long pressing today\u2019s date, say \u201cYes\u201d when it asks if you want to update the puzzle. Updating the puzzle should allow users to put in the OU in the section. Thank you for your patience.First, let\u2019s get the housekeeping out of the way. There are two things solvers need to know about this puzzle by David Steinberg:I know. It\u2019s been a tough week, solvingwise. So, why not settle down with a nice, predictable Sunday puzzle, where absolutely nothing is a surprise and you know all the answers?It will also help you understand what you need to do in order to solve today\u2019s puzzle.The name of the game is Vowel Play, so you know you\u2019re going to be \u2014 wait for it \u2014 playing with vowels. Mr. Steinberg has pulled off a true feat of construction that combines the best of Split Decisions and Schr\u00f6dinger puzzles, and his grid is packed with this theme material.There are two clues for each theme entry, your first hint that something is up. Your job will be to solve both clues so that the consonant squares and the (slashed or circled) vowel squares make two different words or phrases. For example, at 22A, the two clues are \u201cRichard Simmons diet regimen / London tabloid.\u201d The answers to those clues would be DEAL A MEAL and DAILY MAIL, which conveniently both fit, if you put the vowels for each answer in one square apiece, like so:If you are solving in print, you can write each vowel on either side of the slash in the square. If you are solving online or in the app, you should be able to enter a variety of rebus combinations. For example, for the E/A combination at the beginning of 22A, you can enter E/A, but they will also count the square as correct if you enter E, A, EA, AE, E/A or A/E. If you have any issues with this, please write to NYTCrossword@nytimes.com and let them know.What, your brain doesn\u2019t hurt enough yet? My best advice is to start with what you know. JULy is the \u201cStart of the third.\u201d The \u201cO.J. Simpson trial judge\u201d was Lance ITO. The \u201cActor Patel\u201d is DEV. There are many more.Keep chipping away at it, and try to focus on solving the squares that contain the consonants in the split theme entries. That will make it easier to solve the theme squares.And, for my money, the clue \u201cSin subject?\u201d for TRIG was worth the price of admission alone.This puzzle has an unusual construction story: I didn\u2019t come up with any of the theme entries! At least not directly. All I had was an idea, which came from \u2014 wait for it \u2014 a Facebook chat! It all started when my friend Trenton Charlson messaged me an awesome, hand-constructed vowelless crossword he\u2019d been working on. He ultimately got stuck on a couple of corners, but fortunately, I was able to help: I put on my computer science major hat and taught him what I know about regular expressions. After that, he was off and rolling.This whole interchange got me thinking. What if I made a puzzle whose theme entries had the same consonants but different vowels? I couldn\u2019t think of any long examples, but I figured there must be a way to write a program to find some, if they existed. A few hours later, I had a working program, and there were actually a lot of possibilities. In fact, there were so many that I decided to constrain the theme to entries where a) the vowels are in the same positions and b) all the vowels are different.The next challenge was figuring out how to present the puzzle. Should it be a crossword or some sort of variety puzzle? Definitely a crossword. Daily or Sunday? Go big or go home, dude! Separate or merged theme entries? Merged seemed more interesting. Schr\u00f6dinger squares or rebuses? Rebuses, since I\u2019d probably need slashed clues anyway.Moral of the story: The hours I spend on social media are OBVIOUSLY worthwhile. Hope you enjoy the puzzle.Happy Sunday, everyone.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

The \u201cLandscape with Figures\u201d piece was particularly desirable because it combined the idiosyncratic artist\u2019s favorite motifs of surreal figures and strangely foreboding countryside.The London Art Fair this year featured 131 galleries with most of the higher-value works being offered by Modern British specialists in the central mezzanine level of the venue at the Business Design Center. It was also a predominantly British crowd sipping the free gin and tonics at the private evening view.\u201cIf it were by an American artist, it would have another zero,\u201d said Tania Sutton, a director at Osborne Samuel. The gallery had four confirmed sales at the private view, ranging in price from \u00a310,000 to \u00a335,000, according to Ms. Sutton.By that time, the Islington fair had lost its reputation for being a place where City of London bankers spent their bonuses, according to Ms. Sutton of Osborne Samuel.At Sotheby\u2019s, American buyers have accounted for about 14 percent of those totals since 2015, the auction house said. A few blue-chip names aside, \u201cMod Brit\u201d remains, by and large, a British taste.The market for new international contemporary art in London\u2019s galleries has a different dynamic.But again, Britain\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union are casting a shadow, even over successful dealer shows.

Mr. Da Corte featured in four museum shows in America and Europe in 2017, giving international collectors the confidence to spend as much as $65,000 on his distinctive neon works.In the case of the Friedman and Lilley exhibitions, gallery prices for the new works were above the current auction highs for both Mr. Wiley and Mr. Da Corte, according to Artnet. But those highs were achieved late last year, suggesting that the resale market for both artists has upward momentum.\u201cBrexit makes a difference,\u201d said Mr. Lilley. \u201cSome of my wealthiest clients are spending less time in London and more time in places like Monaco.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThe geography isn\u2019t going to change. Any successful person is going to come through London. I\u2019m just going to see them less often in the gallery.\u201dMs. England recalled that she originally made contact with the Chilean artist when they were both in London in the early 1970s.\u201cIn those days, London had a generous creative spirit,\u201d Ms. England said. \u201cIt was a place for citizens of the world.\u201dThe fear now is that changes like Brexit could damage that spirit, diminishing Britain as a hub \u2014 for national and international art.Advertisement"}

If you\u2019re not familiar with Italian recipes for Bolognese, be warned: It is not the traditional Italian-American meat sauce, punctuated by strong notes of tomato, garlic and oregano. Hers is influenced by the flavors of northern Italy (particularly the city of Bologna), so there is no garlic or olive oil, but there is milk and butter and a hint of nutmeg. It might seem like an odd combination, but the milk and butter mellow the intensity of the acidic tomatoes. The wine, nutmeg and vegetables create a complex flavor profile that transforms this sauce into something truly spectacular.Keep in mind that the finished sauce is very rich, so when serving, dole it out with a light hand. As one NYT Cooking reader wrote: \u201cThe noodles should show under a coating of sauce, like varnish rather than paint.\u201dMs. Hazan called for using ground beef, or a mixture of beef and pork, but some readers have had happy results using a mixture of veal, beef and mild Italian sausage. The sauce also freezes well, so consider making a double batch.Finally, you\u2019ll need at least four hours to make it (some readers prefer to let it simmer for at least five), so set aside a weekend afternoon \u2014 preferably a chilly one \u2014 when you have plenty of time to allow it to simmer to perfection.

Seventeen people have been declared dead.

The law prevents rent control on units built after 1995, and prohibits cities from limiting rent increases on units after they are vacated.Depending on where you sit on the spectrum, the law either hurts tenants by allowing landlords to impose huge rent increases or is a much-needed restraint that prevents California cities from shutting down growth by passing draconian price controls. Either way, as the state\u2019s housing crisis deepens, the law has increasingly become a target.\u201cWe not only have a housing crisis in California, we have a tenant crisis,\u201d said David Chiu, a San Francisco assemblyman who co-authored the bill to repeal Costa Hawkins, in a Facebook post after the vote. \u201cWhile tenant bills have always been difficult to pass in the Legislature, I am disappointed that AB 1506 did not receive enough votes in committee today to advance.

{"Headline": "California Today: Thousands of Volunteers Count the Homeless in Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Across Los Angeles, they sleep in tents, under tarps or out in the open air, and their numbers are growing. Last year the population of homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles increased 23 percent, and officials believe the numbers have continued to rise.This week the city will start to find out just how much.Starting Tuesday night in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San Gabriel Valleys, thousands of volunteers fanned out to neighborhoods to count the homeless, an annual three-day exercise that in recent years has confirmed an alarming crisis in Los Angeles County.The count, along with demographic surveys, will help policymakers decide how to spend public money: $355 million per year raised by Los Angeles county from a special sales tax, and a $1.2 billion city bond issue to build housing for the homeless.Once mostly associated with Skid Row, the vast tent encampment in downtown Los Angeles, the homeless are now spread out across the city, setting up tents under highway overpasses and moving into affluent neighborhoods like Bel-Air, where a wildfire that threatened the area\u2019s mega-mansions was sparked last year by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment.As the homeless population has grown, the old stereotypes \u2014 of single men, mentally ill or addicted \u2014 have been upended. Now the crisis, not just in Los Angeles but across California, is closely connected with another of state\u2019s challenges: an overheated housing market. Many of those who have recently fallen into homelessness have jobs, but have been pushed to the streets by skyrocketing rents.\u201cI think the causes are pretty clear and explicit,\u201d said Peter Lynn, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. \u201cLos Angeles is absolutely at the center of a crisis of housing affordability.\u201dAre you one of the volunteers?

{"Headline": "Rise of Bitcoin Competitor Ripple Creates Wealth to Rival Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world\u2019s richest people into disarray.Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks.Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week \u2014 and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin.While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires \u2014 albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies.Mr. Larsen\u2019s soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple \u2014 and his Forbes ranking \u2014 dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO.\u201cThis is beyond insane,\u201d said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation.\u201dRipple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens \u2014 including Einsteinium and Byteball \u2014 that rose more than Bitcoin\u2019s remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider.Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion \u2014 when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value \u2014 despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading.Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history.Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software.Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday\u2019s prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.)Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens \u2014 known as Lumens \u2014 worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency.In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion.Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens \u2014 and his riches.Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases.Mr. Larsen was Ripple\u2019s chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company\u2019s executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate.Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company\u2019s technology, including American Express and Banco Santander.But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple\u2019s software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens.Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple\u2019s software, but not its tokens.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP\u2019s valuation,\u201d said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital.Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple\u2019s chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using \u2014 or looking at using \u2014 XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements.Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company\u2019s growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,\u201d he said.Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse\u2019s company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge.But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company\u2019s board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple\u2019s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices.But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn\u2019t mean Ripple\u2019s price won\u2019t keep ascending. Why? \u201cBecause this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

After a few weeks, they literally fall apart \u2014 the haze disappears as their proteins fall out of suspension, destroying the hop flavors and, in most cases, rendering the beer fit for the drain.\u201cHazy I.P.A.s are pretty tough to make if you\u2019re hoping to distribute nationally,\u201d said Bill Manley, who helped develop Sierra Nevada\u2019s recipe for Hazy Little Thing before leaving the company in November. \u201cThe haze that\u2019s in beer is, by and large, pretty darn unstable.\u201dBut the big brewers think they can guarantee freshness, win over the skeptics and appeal to parts of the country that this young style hasn\u2019t reached.\u201cThere are still many drinkers who have yet to experience the hazy, citrusy brew,\u201d said Meaghan Quinn, a spokeswoman for Samuel Adams.The fervor around these beers is ripe with hyperbole, but in the best examples, it\u2019s warranted. Hazy I.P.A.s offer lush, juicy flavors that beers have never had before. Brewers are harnessing the citrus and tropical notes of new hop varieties while eschewing their characteristic bitterness, a trick they achieve by loading their hops late in the brewing process, and in huge quantities.These beers seem to defy large-scale production and cross-country shipping; many brewers intentionally keep batches small to ensure freshness through high turnover. But Sierra Nevada in particular has consistently made world-class beers in big volume, and these ephemeral I.P.A.s will be its biggest test.The beers\u2019 haze has traditionally come from hop particles that mix with yeast in suspension. The result is hop flavors that, rather than wafting up to your nose from the glass, burst in your mouth after each sip.As the New England style has proliferated, breweries have turned to high-protein grains, like oats and unmalted wheat, to build a more stable haze for their beloved hops to nest in. Others use additives like pectin or even flour, igniting debate in the most fervent corners of the craft-beer world.Sierra Nevada uses oats in its recipe for Hazy Little Thing. But it also employs other tricks for quality control, including one common among wheat beer producers: When sending kegs to restaurants and bars, the company instructs distributors to ship them upside down. That way, the bartender is forced to flip them upon delivery, stirring up the proteins and restoring the haze.Mr. Kimmich is the creator of Heady Topper, the ale that popularized the style and still sells out hours after a shipment hits New York City. His beer brims with flavors of tropical fruit and pine, balanced with a keen, citrus-peel bitterness. When he began brewing Heady Topper in 2004, his goal was to load up on hop flavors using \u201cdry hopping,\u201d or adding hops during fermentation rather than during the boiling process. This coaxes more aroma than bitter flavor from the hops; the sheer volume of hops happened to turn the beer hazy.Like many brewers of this style, Mr. Kimmich is intent on keeping his operation and availability regional. In true Vermont fashion, it doesn\u2019t take much to get him started about corporate greed and his allegiance to helping the local community.Some might question the need to sell a beer this perishable nationwide. Fresh, locally made beer is readily available these days in most metropolitan areas.But the hazy-I.P.A. trend hasn\u2019t swept the middle of the nation yet, and Samuel Adams hopes to bring some people their first taste of the style. The company is keeping an eye on distributors to ensure that consumers get their beer fresh.\u201cNo beer is ever going to be as good as it is five days out of the brewery,\u201d said Megan Parisi, the head brewer at the Boston nanobrewery where Samuel Adams researches and develops new recipes. But the company is banking on the beer\u2019s staying good for a while; it is setting an expiration date of three months for its New England I.P.A.Mr. Kimmich is most excited about the new beer from Sierra Nevada, a company he idolized early in his career, as a brewer in the 1990s at the Vermont Pub and Brewery.\u201cSierra Nevada? Those guys,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many countless beers have they inspired with their pale ale?\u201dNew England-style I.P.A.s walk a spectrum from bitter to sweet. This is a case where balance isn\u2019t always preferred: If you already love I.P.A.s, there are many bitter ones to satisfy you. If you don\u2019t, the sweet variety could be your gateway drink.In terms of flavor, both are a tier below their small-batch counterparts, missing the vibrant fruitiness that distinguishes the best of breed. Samuel Adams\u2019s beer evokes citrus but not in the literal, tastes-like-juice way that is the New England style; it\u2019s scarcely different from an ordinary I.P.A.The Sierra Nevada beer has more pleasant flavors of dried apricot and dried pineapple, and is the better choice if you can\u2019t find something fresh and local.Mr. Kimmich, Alchemist\u2019s brewer, calls it \u201cbalanced,\u201d and hopheads will attest to that. It won\u2019t bring new fans to hoppy beers, but it\u2019s a treat for the already converted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Cafe Booqoo, New Orleans Favorites, Spicy and Sweet", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosA friend once tried to order beignets in New Orleans that were \u201clight on the sugar.\u201d The waitress was perturbed. When the beignets arrived, they came with sugar on the side, in a bowl, two inches deep.Indigenous to New Orleans, beignets are of the same genus as doughnuts but a separate species: pieces of puffed-up fried dough with an airiness somewhere between buoyancy and levitation. They leave drifts of confectioners\u2019 sugar in their wake.Matt Pace, who grew up in New Orleans East and moved to New York a decade ago to make a life as a painter, started frying up his hometown treat at outdoor food markets in 2014 under the name Booqoo Beignets. He taught kickboxing on the side (\u201cI\u2019ve had many lives,\u201d he said with a laugh) and saved money toward opening a restaurant, which he finally did last August: Cafe Booqoo, on the border of Carroll Gardens and Gowanus in Brooklyn.\u201cYes indeed!\u201d proclaims the front wall in electrified letters, backed by ads for old-time New Orleans goods like Sum-Good coffee and chicory, and Charles E. Erath\u2019s Red Hot Creole Pepper Sauce, concocted in 1916. Next to the posted menu, a handwritten \u201cCreole cheat sheet\u201d defines terms like po\u2019 boy and booqoo: \u201cslang version of the French \u2018beaucoup\u2019 \u2026 meaning \u2018a lot\u2019 or \u2018very good.\u2019 \u201d Neon-bright Big Shot sodas, typically found only in stores down South, line the counter.Mr. Pace\u2019s menu has expanded to include mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese rich from a roux spiked with Crystal hot sauce (first bottled on Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans) and larded with crawfish tails. Here, too, is jambalaya crimson from tomato paste, with buried nubs of chicken and smoky andouille. The rice is swollen and clingy, drunk on chicken broth and vegetable stock, thick enough for a spoon to stick straight up. The heat \u2014 cayenne, full force \u2014 is sanctifying.Gumbo starts with a simple roux of butter and flour and the \u201choly trinity\u201d of onion, celery and bell pepper. Sweetness leaches from shrimp, heat from andouille. Okra is banished. \u201cI had a very traumatizing experience with okra in childhood,\u201d Mr. Pace said. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends.\u201d Instead, he thickens the dish with fil\u00e9, ground dried sassafras leaves, a legacy of the Choctaw tribe in Louisiana. There\u2019s just enough of its camphor undertone to bring dimension, without smacking of medicine.These dishes are relegated to \u201csides\u201d on the menu, but they were my favorites. The po\u2019 boys are more low-key in flavor, built on bread shipped from Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans \u2014 not always in peak condition, but when it is, a lovely compact of whisper-thin crust that fissures at the touch and an interior half air.For the Grandaddy, a meld of beer, butter and Worcestershire sauce is squeezed over shrimp as they seethe on the grill. They achieve a perfect char, but the slather of onion jam gets sweeter with each bite.In the morning, there are sweet-potato waffles and slightly soupy grits, oversweet from a spill of barbecue sauce. Better are the biscuit sandwiches, for which Mr. Pace gently kneads the dough in a double boiler set over ice, to keep the butter as cold as the grave; and a pecan pie muffin, which tastes like a psychological trick, as dense and lush inside as pecan pie \u2014 too rich to take more than one bite, yet you do.And at any time of day: beignets, fried swiftly in oil kept at a steady 375 degrees. Some of my fellow diners, pining over memories of Cafe du Monde in the French Quarter, grumbled that these were too puffy, or not puffy enough, and round instead of square. No matter: The beignets disappeared, and we shed sugar like snow all the way home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Follower Factory", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "\n  \n    Photo illustration by Adam Ferriss\n  \nBut on Twitter, there is a version of Jessica that none of her friends or family would recognize. While the two Jessicas share a name, photograph and whimsical bio \u2014 \u201cI have issues\u201d \u2014 the other Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments, cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography, retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200 million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.The accounts that most resemble real people, like Ms. Rychly, reveal a kind of large-scale social identity theft. At least 55,000 of the accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis.\u201cI don\u2019t want my picture connected to the account, nor my name,\u201d Ms. Rychly, now 19, said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone would even pay for it. It is just horrible.\u201dIn November, Facebook disclosed to investors that it had at least twice as many fake users as it previously estimated, indicating that up to 60 million automated accounts may roam the world\u2019s largest social media platform. These fake accounts, known as bots, can help sway advertising audiences and reshape political debates. They can defraud businesses and ruin reputations. Yet their creation and sale fall into a legal gray zone.\u201cThe continued viability of fraudulent accounts and interactions on social media platforms \u2014 and the professionalization of these fraudulent services \u2014 is an indication that there\u2019s still much work to do,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the spread of fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.Despite rising criticism of social media companies and growing scrutiny by elected officials, the trade in fake followers has remained largely opaque. While Twitter and other platforms prohibit buying followers, Devumi and dozens of other sites openly sell them. And social media companies, whose market value is closely tied to the number of people using their services, make their own rules about detecting and eliminating fake accounts.Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, denied that his company sold fake followers and said he knew nothing about social identities stolen from real users. \u201cThe allegations are false, and we do not have knowledge of any such activity,\u201d Mr. Calas said in an email exchange in November.The Times reviewed business and court records showing that Devumi has more than 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors and models. In most cases, the records show, they purchased their own followers. In others, their employees, agents, public relations companies, family members or friends did the buying. For just pennies each \u2014 sometimes even less \u2014 Devumi offers Twitter followers, views on YouTube, plays on SoundCloud, the music-hosting site, and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional-networking site.The actor John Leguizamo has Devumi followers. So do Michael Dell, the computer billionaire, and Ray Lewis, the football commentator and former Ravens linebacker. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who today presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, has hundreds of thousands of fake Devumi followers, as does Akbar Gbajabiamila, the host of the show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d Even a Twitter board member, Martha Lane Fox, has some.At a time when Facebook, Twitter and Google are grappling with an epidemic of political manipulation and fake news, Devumi\u2019s fake followers also serve as phantom foot soldiers in political battles online. Devumi\u2019s customers include both avid supporters and fervent critics of President Trump, and both liberal cable pundits and a reporter at the alt-right bastion Breitbart. Randy Bryce, an ironworker seeking to unseat Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, purchased Devumi followers in 2015, when he was a blogger and labor activist. Louise Linton, the wife of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, bought followers when she was trying to gain traction as an actress.Devumi\u2019s products serve politicians and governments overseas, too. An editor at China\u2019s state-run news agency, Xinhua, paid Devumi for hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter, which the country\u2019s government has banned but sees as a forum for issuing propaganda abroad. An adviser to Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, bought tens of thousands of followers and retweets for Mr. Moreno\u2019s campaign accounts during last year\u2019s elections.Kristin Binns, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not typically suspend users suspected of buying bots, in part because it is difficult for the business to know who is responsible for any given purchase. Twitter would not say whether a sample of fake accounts provided by The Times \u2014 each based on a real user \u2014 violated the company\u2019s policies against impersonation.\u201cWe continue to fight hard to tackle any malicious automation on our platform as well as false or spam accounts,\u201d Ms. Binns said.Unlike some social media companies, Twitter does not require accounts to be associated with a real person. It also permits more automated access to its platform than other companies, making it easier to set up and control large numbers of accounts.Tweets from a Twitter bot look just like those of a normal user, but a bot\u2019s tweets are generated by a computer program, rather than a person. Below are three examples of common bot types you might encounter on Twitter and an approximation of the code controls them.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cSocial media is a virtual world that is filled with half bots, half real people,\u201d said Rami Essaid, the founder of Distil Networks, a cybersecurity company that specializes in eradicating bot networks. \u201cYou can\u2019t take any tweet at face value. And not everything is what it seems.\u201dIncluding, it turns out, Devumi itself.Last year, three billion people logged on to social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and China\u2019s Sina Weibo. The world\u2019s collective yearning for connection has not only reshaped the Fortune 500 and upended the advertising industry but also created a new status marker: the number of people who follow, like or \u201cfriend\u201d you. For some entertainers and entrepreneurs, this virtual status is a real-world currency. Follower counts on social networks help determine who will hire them, how much they are paid for bookings or endorsements, even how potential customers evaluate their businesses or products.High follower counts are also critical for so-called influencers, a budding market of amateur tastemakers and YouTube stars where advertisers now lavish billions of dollars a year on sponsorship deals. The more people influencers reach, the more money they make. According to data collected by Captiv8, a company that connects influencers to brands, an influencer with 100,000 followers might earn an average of $2,000 for a promotional tweet, while an influencer with a million followers might earn $20,000.Genuine fame often translates into genuine social media influence, as fans follow and like their favorite movie stars, celebrity chefs and models. But shortcuts are also available: On sites like Social Envy and DIYLikes.com, it takes little more than a credit-card number to buy a huge following on almost any social media platform. Most of these sites offer what they describe as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d followers, never quite stating whether real people are behind them. Once purchased, the followers can be a powerful tool.\u201cYou see a higher follower count, or a higher retweet count, and you assume this person is important, or this tweet was well received,\u201d said Rand Fishkin, the founder of Moz, a company that makes search engine optimization software. \u201cAs a result, you might be more likely to amplify it, to share it or to follow that person.\u201dTwitter and Facebook can be similarly influenced. \u201cSocial platforms are trying to recommend stuff \u2014 and they say, \u2018Is the stuff we are recommending popular?\u2019\u201d said Julian Tempelsman, the co-founder of Smyte, a security firm that helps companies combat online abuse, bots and fraud. \u201cFollower counts are one of the factors social media platforms use.\u201dTo better understand Devumi\u2019s business, we became a customer. In April, The Times set up a test account on Twitter and paid Devumi $225 for 25,000 followers, or about a penny each. As advertised, the first 10,000 or so looked like real people. They had pictures and full names, hometowns and often authentic-seeming biographies. One account looked like that of Ms. Rychly, the young Minnesota woman.But on closer inspection, some of the details seemed off. The account names had extra letters or underscores, or easy-to-miss substitutions, like a lowercase \u201cL\u201d in place of an uppercase \u201cI.\u201dDevumi claims to use its own \u201cprivate network of hand-picked real and active Twitter users and influencers\u201d. In reality, it sells bots with stolen profiles. Here are the details that give them away.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusThe next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: no profile pictures, and jumbles of letters, numbers and word fragments instead of names.But company records reviewed by The Times revealed much of what Devumi and its customers prefer to conceal.Most of Devumi\u2019s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. In interviews, their explanations varied. They bought followers because they were curious about how it worked, or felt pressure to generate high follower counts for themselves or their customers. \u201cEveryone does it,\u201d said the actress Deirdre Lovejoy, a Devumi customer.While some said they believed Devumi was supplying real potential fans or customers, others acknowledged that they knew or suspected they were getting fake accounts. Several said they regretted their purchases.\u201cIt\u2019s fraud,\u201d said James Cracknell, a British rower and Olympic gold medalist who bought 50,000 followers from Devumi. \u201cPeople who judge by how many likes or how many followers, it\u2019s not a healthy thing.\u201dMs. Ireland has over a million followers on Twitter, which she often uses to promote companies with whom she has endorsement deals. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance, for example, said that the former model was one of its most influential Twitter \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d celebrities who are paid to help promote products.But in January last year, Ms. Ireland had only about 160,000 followers. The next month, an employee at the branding agency she owns, Sterling/Winters, spent about $2,000 for 300,000 more followers, according to Devumi records. The employee later made more purchases, he acknowledged in an interview. Much of Ms. Ireland\u2019s Twitter following appears to consist of bots, a Times analysis found.A spokeswoman said that the employee had acted without Ms. Ireland\u2019s authorization and had been suspended after The Times asked about the purchases. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thought he was fulfilling his duties, but it\u2019s not something he should have done,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Rona Menashe.Several Devumi customers or their representatives contacted by The Times declined to comment, among them Mr. Leguizamo, whose followers were bought by an associate. Many more did not respond to repeated efforts to contact them.A few denied making Devumi purchases. They include Ashley Knight, Mr. Lewis\u2019s personal assistant, whose email address was listed on an order for 250,000 followers, and Eric Kaplan, a friend to Mr. Trump and motivational speaker whose personal email address was associated with eight orders. A Twitter account belonging to Paul Hollywood, the celebrity baker, was deleted after The Times emailed him with questions. Mr. Hollywood then sent a reply: \u201cAccount does not exist.\u201dMany of these celebrities, business leaders, sports stars and other Twitter users bought their own followers, records show. In other cases, the purchases were made by their employees, agents, family members or other associates.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusOver two years, the Democratic public relations consultant and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen bought more than a half-million fake followers from Devumi. Ms. Rosen previously spent more than a decade as head of the Recording Industry Association of America. In an interview, she described the purchases as \u201can experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked.\u201d She made more than a dozen purchases of followers from 2015 to 2017, according to company records.Other buyers said they had faced pressure from employers to generate social media followers. Marcus Holmlund, a young freelance writer, was at first thrilled when Wilhelmina, the international modeling agency, hired him to manage its social media efforts. But when Wilhelmina\u2019s Twitter following didn\u2019t grow fast enough, Mr. Holmlund said, a supervisor told him to buy followers or find another job. In 2015, despite misgivings, he began making monthly Devumi purchases out of his own pocket.\u201cI felt stuck with the threat of being fired, or worse, never working in fashion again,\u201d said Mr. Holmlund, who left in late 2015. \u201cSince then, I tell anyone and everyone who ever asks that it\u2019s a total scam \u2014 it won\u2019t boost their engagement.\u201d (A Wilhelmina spokeswoman declined to comment.)Several Devumi customers acknowledged that they bought bots because their careers had come to depend, in part, on the appearance of social media influence. \u201cNo one will take you seriously if you don\u2019t have a noteworthy presence,\u201d said Jason Schenker, an economist who specializes in economic forecasting and has purchased at least 260,000 followers.Not surprisingly, Devumi has sold millions of followers and retweets to entertainers on the lower and middle rungs of Hollywood, such as the actor Ryan Hurst, a star of the television series \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d In 2016 and 2017, he bought a total of 750,000 followers, about three-quarters of his current count. It cost less than $4,000, according to company records. Mr. Hurst did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Mr. Aiken and Ms. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.More than a hundred self-described influencers \u2014 whose market value is even more directly linked to their follower counts on social media \u2014 have purchased Twitter followers from Devumi. Justin Blau, a popular Las Vegas-based D.J. who performs as 3LAU, acquired 50,000 followers and thousands of retweets. In an email, Mr. Blau said a former member of his management team bought them without his approval.At least five Devumi influencer customers are also contractors for HelloSociety, an influencer agency owned by The New York Times Company. (A Times spokeswoman said the company sought to verify that the audience of each contractor was legitimate and would not do business with anyone who violated that standard.) Lucas Peterson, a freelance journalist who writes a travel column for The Times, also bought followers from Devumi.But her Twitter account \u2014 and her brother\u2019s \u2014 are boosted by thousands of retweets purchased by their mother and manager, Shadia Daho, according to Devumi records. Ms. Daho did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her by email and through a public relations firm.Mr. Pallen at first denied buying those followers. After The Times contacted Ms. Greiner, Mr. Pallen said he had \u201cexperimented\u201d with the company but \u201cstopped using it long ago.\u201d A lawyer for Ms. Greiner said she had asked him to stop after learning of the first purchases.Still, records show, Mr. Pallen bought Ms. Greiner more Devumi followers in 2016.Marketing consultants sometimes buy followers for themselves, too, in effect purchasing the evidence of their supposed expertise. In 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, a former adjunct professor at the University of Southern California who calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading celebrity branding authority,\u201d began buying hundreds of thousands of fake followers from Devumi.He did not respond to requests for comment. But in his recent best-selling book, \u201cThe Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells,\u201d he had a different explanation for his rising follower count. \u201cMy social media following exploded,\u201d Mr. Sehdev claimed, because he had discovered the true secret to celebrity influence: \u201cAuthenticity is the key.\u201dAmong the followers delivered to Mr. Sehdev was Ms. Rychly \u2014 or at least, a copy of her. The fake Rychly account, created in 2014, was included in the purchase orders of hundreds of Devumi customers. It was retweeted by Mr. Schenker, the economist, and Arabella Daho, the teenage influencer. Clive Standen, star of the show \u201cTaken,\u201d ended up with Ms. Rychly\u2019s stolen social identity. So did the television baker Mr. Hollywood, the French entertainer DJ Snake and Ms. Ireland. (DJ Snake\u2019s followers were purchased by a former manager, and Mr. Standen did not respond to requests for comment.)The fake Ms. Rychly also retweeted at least five accounts linked to a prolific American pornographer named Dan Leal, who is based in Hungary and tweets as @PornoDan. Mr. Leal, who has bought at least 150,000 followers from Devumi in recent years, is one of at least dozens of customers who work in the adult film industry or as escorts, according to a review of Devumi records.In an email, Mr. Leal said that buying followers for his business generated more than enough new revenue to pay for the expense. He was not worried about being penalized by Twitter, Mr. Leal said. \u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dDevumi has sold at least tens of thousands of similar high-quality bots, a Times analysis found. In some cases, a single real Twitter user was transformed into hundreds of different bots, each a minute variation on the original.Individually, fake accounts are hard to detect. Study their group behaviour, and incriminating patterns begin to emerge.By Richard Harris and Mark HansenThese fake accounts borrowed social identities from Twitter users in every American state and dozens of countries, from adults and minors alike, from highly active users and those who hadn\u2019t logged in to their accounts for months or years.The fake account remained dormant until last year, when it suddenly began retweeting Devumi customers continuously. This summer, the fake Mr. Dodd promoted various pornographic accounts, including Mr. Leal\u2019s Immoral Productions, as well as a link to a gambling website.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019d take my identity \u2014 I\u2019m a 20-year-old college student,\u201d Mr. Dodd said. \u201cI\u2019m not well known.\u201d But even unknown, Mr. Dodd\u2019s social identity has value in the influence economy. At prices posted in December, Devumi was selling high-quality followers for under two cents each. Sold to about 2,000 customers \u2014 the rough number that many Devumi bot accounts follow \u2014 his social identity could bring Devumi around $30.The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi\u2019s brand. The high-quality bots are usually delivered to customers first, followed by millions of cheaper, low-quality bots, like sawdust mixed in with grated Parmesan.Some of Devumi\u2019s high-quality bots, in effect, replace an idle Twitter account \u2014 belonging to someone who stopped using the service \u2014 with a fake one. Whitney Wolfe, an executive assistant who lives in Florida, opened a Twitter account in 2008, when she was a wedding planner. By the time she stopped using it regularly in 2014, a fake account copying her personal information had been created. In recent months, it has retweeted adult film actresses, several influencers and an escort turned memoirist.\u201cThe content \u2014 pictures of women in thongs, pictures of women\u2019s chests \u2014 it\u2019s not anything I want to be represented with my faith, my name, where I live,\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, who is active in her local Southern Baptist congregation.Other victims were still active on Twitter when Devumi-sold bots began impersonating them. Salle Ingle, a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Colorado, said she worried that a potential employer would come across the fake version of her while vetting her social media accounts.\u201cI\u2019ve been applying for new jobs, and I\u2019m really grateful that no one saw this account and thought it was me,\u201d Ms. Ingle said. Once contacted by The Times, Ms. Ingle reported the account to Twitter, which deactivated it.After emailing Mr. Calas last year, a Times reporter visited Devumi\u2019s Manhattan address, listed on its website. The building has dozens of tenants, including a medical clinic and a labor union. But Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, do not appear to be among them. A spokesman for the building\u2019s owner said neither Devumi nor Bytion had ever rented space there.Like the followers Devumi sold, the office was an illusion.In real life, Devumi is based in a small office suite above a Mexican restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., overlooking an alley crowded with Dumpsters and parked cars. Mr. Calas lives a short commute away, in a penthouse apartment.Mr. Calas, who is 27, grew up in South Florida, where as a teenager he learned web design and built sites for local businesses, according to earlier versions of his personal web page available on the Internet Archive.Eventually he taught himself techniques for search engine optimization \u2014 the art of pushing a web page higher in search results. While in high school, he began taking classes at Palm Beach State College, where he earned an associate degree in 2012, according to a school spokeswoman. Within a few years, Mr. Calas was claiming to have built dozens of online businesses serving 10 million customers, now under the Bytion umbrella.\u201cI started this company with a thousand dollars in the bank, without investors, and only the burning passion for success,\u201d Mr. Calas wrote last year on the job-listing site Glassdoor.According to former employees interviewed by The Times, turnover was high at Devumi, and Mr. Calas kept his operation tightly compartmentalized. Employees sometimes had little idea what their colleagues were doing, even if they were working on the same project.Dozens of Devumi\u2019s customer service and order fulfillment personnel are based in the Philippines, according to company records. Employing overseas contractors may have helped Mr. Calas hold down costs. But it also appears to have left him vulnerable to a kind of social identity theft himself.His copycat company used a similar name \u2014 DevumiBoost \u2014 and copied the design of Devumi\u2019s website, Mr. Calas alleged. The fake Devumi even listed the same phantom Manhattan address. Over a stretch of days last July, Mr. Boado, posing as a Devumi employee, emailed hundreds of Devumi customers to inform them that their orders needed to be reprocessed on DevumiBoost. Then he impersonated the customers, too, emailing Devumi under different aliases to ask that Devumi cancel the original orders. Mr. Boado, according to Mr. Calas, was trying to steal his customers. (Mr. Boado did not respond to emails seeking a response to Mr. Calas\u2019s claims.)Mr. Calas\u2019s lawsuit also revealed something else: Devumi doesn\u2019t appear to make its own bots. Instead, the company buys them wholesale \u2014 from a thriving global market of fake social media accounts.Scattered around the web is an array of obscure websites where anonymous bot makers around the world connect with retailers like Devumi. While individual customers can buy from some of these bare-boned sites \u2014 Peakerr, CheapPanel and YTbot, among others \u2014 they are less user-friendly. Some, for example, do not accept credit cards, only cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.But each site sells followers, likes and shares in bulk, for a variety of social media platforms and in different languages. The accounts they sell may change hands repeatedly. The same account may even be available from more than one seller.Devumi, according to one former employee, sourced bots from different bot makers depending on price, quality and reliability. On Peakerr, for example, 1,000 high-quality, English-language bots with photos costs a little more than a dollar. Devumi charges $17 for the same quantity.The price difference has allowed Mr. Calas to build a small fortune, according to company records. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $6 million in sales during that period.Last month, Mr. Calas asked for examples of bots The Times found that copied real users. After receiving the names of 10 accounts, Mr. Calas, who had agreed to an interview, asked for more time to analyze them. Then he stopped responding to emails.Ms. Binns, the Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not proactively review accounts to see if they were impersonating other users. Instead, the company\u2019s efforts are focused on identifying and suspending accounts that violate Twitter\u2019s spam policies. In December, for example, the company identified an average of 6.4 million suspicious accounts each week, she said.All of the sample accounts provided by The Times violated Twitter\u2019s anti-spam policies and were shut down, Ms. Binns said. \u201cWe take the action of suspending an account from the platform very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we want to aggressively fight spam on the platform.\u201dThe company also suspended Devumi\u2019s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.Yet Twitter has not imposed seemingly simple safeguards that would help throttle bot manufacturers, such as requiring anyone signing up for a new account to pass an anti-spam test, as many commercial sites do. As a result, Twitter now hosts vast swaths of unused accounts, including what are probably dormant accounts controlled by bot makers.Former employees said the company\u2019s security team for many years was more focused on abuse by real users, including racist and sexist content and orchestrated harassment campaigns. Only recently, they said, after revelations that Russia-aligned hackers had deployed networks of Twitter bots to spread divisive content and junk news, has Twitter turned more attention to weeding out fake accounts.Leslie Miley, an engineer who worked on security and user safety at Twitter before leaving in late 2015, said, \u201cTwitter as a social network was designed with almost no accountability.\u201dSome critics believe Twitter has a business incentive against weeding out bots too aggressively. Over the past two years, the company has struggled to generate the user growth seen by rivals like Facebook and Snapchat. And outside researchers have disputed the company\u2019s estimates for how many of its active users are actually bots.Small design changes over a number of years has placed an increasingly greater focus on user engagement with replies, retweets and likes in Twitter\u2019s timeline.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cWe\u2019re working with completely unregulated, closed ecosystems that aren\u2019t reporting on these things. They have a perverse incentive to let it happen,\u201d said Mr. Essaid, the cybersecurity expert. \u201cThey want to police it to the extent it doesn\u2019t seem obvious, but they make money off it.\u201dIn January, after almost two years of promoting hundreds of Devumi customers, the fake Jessica Rychly account was finally flagged by Twitter\u2019s security algorithms. It was recently suspended.But the real Ms. Rychly may soon leave Twitter for good.\u201cI am probably just going to delete my Twitter account,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa and Felipe Villamor.

They said his description undermined American interests across the continent that has the world\u2019s fastest growing population and five of the 10 fastest growing economies.\u201cWe hope that you will reassess your views on Africa and its citizens,\u201d the letter pleaded.Steve Goldstein, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for public affairs, acknowledged that the president\u2019s remarks had made diplomats\u2019 jobs more difficult.\u201cI\u2019ve advised people to keep their heads down and focus on the job at hand,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201dHistorically, few jobs are better than those given to United States ambassadors. Meals come on white tablecloths, maids do the laundry and a car and driver are always waiting to whisk them away to important meetings or glittering parties. They even get the glorious title of plenipotentiary, or all-powerful.No longer.Pakistan\u2019s foreign office summoned Ambassador David Hale early this year for a dressing down after Mr. Trump threatened in a tweet to cut aid over Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies & deceit.\u201d And in Panama, Ambassador John Feeley quit last month, saying he no longer could serve under Mr. Trump.Those who have decided to stay are in the awkward position of defending policies that, in some cases, hit close to home.\u201cI think I can speak for many of my senior colleagues when I say that, while we\u2019ve all faced challenges, what\u2019s different now is that the president\u2019s rhetoric is so disrespectful that we\u2019re losing the respect and relationships that we have spent decades building,\u201d said Dana Shell Smith, who resigned in June as ambassador to Qatar after tweeting her disagreements with the president.It is not new, or even all that uncommon, for foreign service officers to disagree with a president. Many opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Others disagreed with President Barack Obama\u2019s passivity in Syria in 2013. But it is not Mr. Trump alone that has inspired the rampant unhappiness across the department.Career diplomats also complain that Mr. Tillerson has paralyzed decision-making, failed to recruit vital leadership, ignores entire continents and surrounds himself with a small cadre of aides instead of talking to department veterans.\u201cI never briefed the secretary and many of my counterparts never briefed him either,\u201d said Patricia Haslach, who served as the acting assistant secretary of economic and business affairs until Nov. 30.On Wednesday, more than 80 former ambassadors to African nations over the last several decades sent a letter of protest to President Trump for his remarks last week when he derided \u201cshithole\u201d African countries during an immigration debate.Hopes for Mr. Tillerson within the department were once high. The former chief executive of Exxon Mobil was seen as the most impressive of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and his plans for a top-to-bottom departmental reorganization was almost universally seen as needed.\u201cI defended him for months,\u201d said Virginia Bennett, the former acting assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, who retired on Nov. 30 after also never having briefed Mr. Tillerson. \u201cBut he has tied the department in knots.\u201d\u201cEverything he listed we\u2019d already identified as a problem before he arrived, and were working on fixes that he froze to do his reorganization,\u201d said Alex Karagiannis, who retired in November from a senior position in the bureau of human resources. \u201cHe made everything worse.\u201dMr. Tillerson said this week that he is not warned ahead of time when the president tweets, and that it usually takes him at least an hour to gauge reaction and decide how to respond.\u201cIt allows me to begin to think about: \u2018How do we take that?\u2019\u201d he said.Reuben E. Brigety II, an ambassador to the African Union during the Obama administration, said it is highly detrimental \u2014 and unusual \u2014 for the \u201csecretary of state to be alienated both from the president and the professional diplomatic corps at the same time.\u201d\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s never happened before,\u201d Mr. Brigety said. \u201cThis has to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what Wall Street analysts are expecting, courtesy of FactSet.\u2022 All 11 sectors are forecast to report earnings growth.\u2022 The index\u2019s energy companies are expected to show the biggest jump, up 132 percent. That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs\u2019s Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four.\u201cDecember\u2019s relatively weak jobs and wage growth figures give policymakers a breather. But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201dVia Recode:\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify.\u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201dThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales.

{"Headline": "Year One in Donald Trump\u2019s World", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, finally lost it this month. After a year of bamboozling signals from President Trump, including a cordial White House meeting last May followed by a blowup in Bethlehem weeks later, Abbas dismissed Trump\u2019s peace efforts as the \u201cslap of the century.\u201d He ruled out American mediation.He called the American ambassador to Israel an \u201coffensive human being\u201d and pronounced the Oslo Accords dead. His tirade was as much an expression of Palestinian impotence as resolve. All Abbas has left is words. Still, it was a striking requiem for the Israeli-Palestinian \u201cultimate deal\u201d that Trump promised.So it goes with a president whose foreign policy watchword is \u201cincoherence,\u201d when it\u2019s not outright indecency of the \u201cshithole\u201d variety. Trump has honed offensiveness to a fine art. A diplomatic deal is built with stubborn persistence, not conjured through insult. Only the genius in chief can know how it made sense, a year into Jared Kushner\u2019s Middle Eastern diplomatic labors and before they had yielded a peace plan, to torpedo his efforts.That is what Trump\u2019s recognition last month of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and subsequent tweeted boast that he\u2019d taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table,\u201d achieved. It was a provocation. To address Jerusalem, city of passions, with such truculence was to invite disaster, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis tried to impress on a president captive to his impulses.The Palestinians have seen the president in all his facets. \u201cTrump was so agitated at the Bethlehem meeting, shouting, accusing Abbas of incitement, saying Abbas was not the nice man he\u2019d believed \u2014 it was awful,\u201d Muhammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Fatah Central Committee, told me. \u201cBut at their next meeting in September, things were fine. Then, all of a sudden, we get this unilateral Jerusalem measure that sabotages everything. So, for us, what sort of message is the president sending?\u201dOne year into the Trump presidency, a lot of people around the world are asking that question. A nation of erratic disruption and \u201cAmerica First\u201d belligerence has supplanted the underwriter of the post-1945 global order. The multilateral institutions of that order \u2014 from the United Nations to NATO \u2014 are mistrusted by the president. A void has opened up. Neither chaos nor China has quite filled it yet. In Gramsci\u2019s words, written between the 20th century\u2019s two global conflagrations, \u201cThe old is dying, and the new cannot be born.\u201dTrump\u2019s universe is a place of dread, not deals. If there was no catastrophe in the first year, the possibility of one in the second was ratcheted up, from North Korea to Iran. In the National Security Strategy published in December, the subheading under \u201cDiplomacy and Statecraft\u201d is \u201cCompetitive Diplomacy\u201d \u2014 not cooperation. Money is apparently no object to ensure \u201cweapons systems that clearly overmatch\u201d in \u201clethality.\u201d Diplomacy, by contrast, requires \u201cefficient use of limited resources.\u201d The evisceration of the State Department and big increases in military budgets reflect Trump\u2019s mind-set.But Trump is deaf to reason. He talks of revived American greatness. Yet, as president, he has not set foot in California, where American technology and innovation create companies that capture the world\u2019s imagination. All that interests him is that Californians tend to dislike him. Disrespect, whether domestic or foreign, is intolerable to him.A global power shift long preceded Trump; China\u2019s share of global output rose to about 15 percent from less than 4 percent in the past two decades. The Obama presidency talked down American greatness. In Syria, Barack Obama\u2019s abdication was complete. But through dereliction, President Trump has fast-forwarded this American retreat.Of course, mistrust of America\u2019s rivals is not misplaced. Russia and China, ideological foes, are in an assertive and expansionist mood. Russia has won in Syria. It has not retreated in Ukraine. European nations, including Hungary, have proved susceptible to Vladimir Putin\u2019s democratic authoritarianism. Russian cyberattacks on Western democracies have proved disruptive, especially in the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, in a speech late last year, offered his nation\u2019s model as \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d This amounted to a remarkable expression of self-confidence. It is of a piece with the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, an attempt to weave other countries\u2019 fates into China\u2019s growing ambitions.As the Cold War demonstrated, such challenges to American interests are best confronted through coherent strategy backed by a credible threat of force and a clear set of values. This, however, is not Trump\u2019s thing. Value-free outbursts are. The president is \u201cso boxed in on Russia that he\u2019s deprived of any ability to conduct a policy, and that paralysis is dangerous,\u201d Jonathan Eyal, a London-based strategic analyst, told me. On nuclear weapons and on Syria, the United States has no mechanism for dialogue with Russia at the highest level because Trump is frozen in genuflection to Putin, his own National Security Strategy notwithstanding.With China, too, policy has veered: trade bellicosity one moment, blandishments designed to enlist Beijing\u2019s help in squeezing North Korea the next. Xi, deploying pomp and flattery during the president\u2019s visit last year, knows how to get Trump where he wants him. America First makes China look like the more responsible global power. Tillerson labors to open diplomatic channels to Pyongyang; Trump tells his secretary of state he\u2019s \u201cwasting his time.\u201d In the end the confidence of both China and Russia is buttressed by Trump\u2019s wackiness and compromised hesitations.Last September, Trump met with Emmanuel Macron, the young president of France, who, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has a relationship with him. Syria came up. Trump said he\u2019d hit Syria with 50 missiles after the chemical-weapons infringement. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked his aides who, in cowering unison, confirmed he had. Iran came up. Macron, like other European leaders, is concerned that the nuclear deal Trump opposes be upheld. Trump was uninterested. He veered off on a bizarre tangent about the trade France does with Iran.It\u2019s tough to do business with Trump \u2014 not least for those who serve him. This month offered the extraordinary spectacle of the United States ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, rebuffing Trump over the new American Embassy that the president had described as being in an \u201coff location\u201d and costing $1.2 billion. It didn\u2019t \u201ccost the U.S. taxpayer a cent,\u201d Johnson retorted. Trump was really looking for a reason to cancel a British trip that would have provoked protests. It has come to this: an American president who\u2019s unwelcome in London!The unthinkable is now commonplace. Perhaps that\u2019s what Trump wanted above all: to shake up Western complacency over how the world could, and could not, be run. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The anger he intuited among the losers from globalization was real. His words have been worse than his deeds. The global economy is purring. The terrorists of the Islamic State have taken a devastating blow. In a best-case scenario, his wild North Korean threats are just a bad-cop show.But something terrible, and perhaps irreparable, has happened. The idea of America has been sullied. It has fallen victim to Trump\u2019s untruth, indecency, racism and contempt for the values without which American greatness is inconceivable. The president is at home with despots because he sees himself in them.Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to Washington, told me: \u201cI cannot explain to my 13-year-old daughter, who was born in the United States, that for her, President Trump should be the symbol of the values we stand for: human dignity, personal freedom and so on. A fundamental anchor has been lost.\u201dThe disarray Trump has engendered reflects the degree to which he has turned the meaning of the word \u201cAmerica\u201d on its head. He has empowered bigots, thugs, bullies, racists, nationalists and nativists the world over.In Israel, I asked Hannah Pollin-Galay, a senior lecturer in Yiddish literature at Tel Aviv University, what she thought of Trump\u2019s Jerusalem declaration. \u201cIt destroyed hope on both sides,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives right-wing nationalists the stage and sense they are right. Look! The rightist strategy works. You are rewarded for not listening to the Palestinians, for not sharing holy ground. That is disastrous, the most dangerous thing imaginable.\u201dGramsci thought the perilous interregnum between world orders was a time of \u201cthe most varied morbid symptoms.\u201d Trump\u2019s second year will show whether those he has unleashed, and nurses within himself, can still be contained short of what he calls \u201cfire and fury.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of the Social News Era? Journalists Brace for Facebook\u2019s Big Change", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cNobody knows exactly what impact it\u2019ll have, but in a lot of ways, it looks like the end of the social news era,\u201d Jacob Weisberg, the chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group, said on Friday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Facebook traffic has been declining all year, so they\u2019ve been de-emphasizing news. But for them to make such a fundamental change in the platform \u2014 I don\u2019t think people were really anticipating it.\u201dAlthough Facebook users craved conversation and journalists gave them things to talk about, the relationship between the platform and media outlets was imperfect from the start.Facebook became a news powerhouse with reluctance, and journalism executives allied themselves with it mostly out of necessity, given the two billion Facebook users who were often a screen-tap away from an article or video.Over the years, as Facebook and media companies entangled themselves with each other, users\u2019 feeds that had once been filled with chatter about graduations, changing relationship statuses and other subjects belonging to the private sphere morphed into digital spaces rife with public matters \u2014 news! \u2014 and the endless and endlessly contentious comment threads that went with them.The uncle you once looked up to, it turned out, had a habit of sharing rude memes that you did not want to see, much less Like.That led to a problem for Facebook, which needs its users to linger, so that it can deliver more highly targeted ads \u2014 that\u2019s how the company made a net profit of $10.2 billion in 2016.Facebook says its changes will improve the \u201cwell-being\u201d of its users. In an effort to usher in this new mood of online pleasantness, its product teams will drop the former goal of helping people find \u201crelevant content\u201d as they test the \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d thesis.The shift in strategy comes, not coincidentally, after a year in which Facebook came under governmental scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech. Mr. Zuckerberg gave his interview to The Times as his company was preparing for a Jan. 17 hearing, the second Capitol Hill inquiry into the online spread of extremist propaganda. During hearings last fall, Facebook told Congress that agents working for a Kremlin-linked company had disseminated content that reached an estimated 126 million users in the United States in 2016.As a result of Facebook\u2019s attempt to distance itself from an overheated news cycle and make a return to its friends-and-family roots, publishers who depended on it for traffic are likely to find themselves in trouble.News outlets that have built a strong bond with readers and viewers through other means will be watching closely, to see whether the size of their audiences \u2014 and corresponding advertising dollars \u2014 will shrink in the coming months.\u201cChanging the terms rapidly is really bringing into focus just how powerful the platforms have become and how the infrastructure is a very difficult place for publishers to operate and navigate,\u201d John Ridding, the chief executive of The Financial Times, said. \u201cThat has big implications for how people receive news, where they find it and what the quality of their news is.\u201dJonah Peretti, the chief executive of BuzzFeed, highlighted the tensions between media organizations and the internet giants Facebook and Google in December, when he publicly criticized the mega-platforms that have fueled the site\u2019s success.\u201cGoogle and Facebook are taking the vast majority of ad revenue, and paying content creators far too little for the value they deliver to users,\u201d Mr. Peretti wrote in a memo published on BuzzFeed.\u201cFacebook is just desperate to get into China, and it will never do that unless it censors news \u2014 and this is actually a neat solution to that,\u201d Mr. Weisberg, the Slate chairman, said. \u201cIf you only have news on the platform shared by users, users who live under repressive regimes don\u2019t have access to real news and can\u2019t share it, because it\u2019s legally prohibited.\u201dAs the site is now, every Facebook user sees a different set of posts and ads. These are ranked and tailored to what their online habits have suggested about their interests. Although Facebook prioritizes certain material \u2014 like those birth announcements that quickly draw Likes and comments \u2014 there are no firm rules for what pops up high in a given feed. In the coming weeks, though, users are likely to notice a reduction in how many posts appear from media organizations.\u201cBecause space in News Feed is limited, showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means we\u2019ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers,\u201d Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook\u2019s News Feed, wrote in a blog post on Thursday.Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The Times, was skeptical of the Facebook plan.\u201cIf this change is as significant as they describe it, news organizations will go out of business or succeed based on a change that they didn\u2019t necessarily have input on,\u201d Mr. Kint said. \u201cIt reads as something that will drive up engagement and probably push away policy risk, because they\u2019re not allowing news properties to have the same sort of presence in their feeds.\u201dMr. Kint added that he had hoped that it would have found a way to weed out hoaxes and made-up news stories that did not penalize publishers.Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said he was expecting the changes to kick in any day. He added that he had not heard from Facebook about what it will mean for his company and, like others in the media industry, he suggested that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s company should be less mysterious.\u201cAs always, it would be good to see transparency from any platform, particularly Facebook, as to how they are going about deciding what constitutes quality,\u201d Mr. Narisetti said.For media companies, a reliance on the company as a driver of traffic has proved an unreliable business model. A Facebook campaign against clickbait, for instance, sent click-dependent publishers like Upworthy into a tailspin several years ago.The algorithm changes will almost certainly affect ad-supported media companies like BuzzFeed and Bustle, which depend in part on Facebook for eyeballs. Publishers that have lately persuaded readers to pony up for subscriptions, including The Washington Post and The Times, will also have to confront likely declines in traffic.As he has at the start of each year since 2009, Mr. Zuckerberg began 2018 by letting his audience in on the personal challenges he hoped to conquer. The chief one he mentioned in his Jan. 4 Facebook post was making the site he co-founded in 2004 a force for good. His company\u2019s return to its scrapbook roots seems to be part of his attempt to live up to that aim.\u201cThe world feels anxious and divided,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cand Facebook has a lot of work to do \u2014 whether it\u2019s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New School of Pastry Chefs Got Its Start in Architecture", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are no large chunks of fruit oozing rustically out of a thick band of pastry, no errant raisins or drips of sugary apple juice dotting the plate. The dough is laced with cardamom sugar, oat streusel, apple compote and clarified butter, but from the outside all that\u2019s visible is thin, delicate pastry, rising in a crinkled, cylindrical whirl. When a spoon makes contact, the structure shatters pleasantly, revealing a wayward interior spiral, whose layers encase perfect proportions of fruit to pastry to streusel.The dish is the calling card of C. Ellet\u2019s pastry chef, Jennifer Yee, who makes desserts that are not only visually arresting but purposeful \u2014 where every shape and cut serves to build an ideal bite, to create a sense of wonder and surprise.The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d\u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201dConsider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.\u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d\u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201dThe lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201dTo pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.\u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d\u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201dBoth pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201dOne of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201dSince 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201dMr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.\u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context. Architects are the opposite \u2014 we\u2019re invested in the process.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the flavor of a cake made by Dinara Kasko. It is pistachio cake, not cherry cake.Advertisement"}

Her death is not being treated as suspicious.In the band, her voice \u2014 high and breathy, but far more determined than fragile \u2014 rode atop a rich wash of electric guitars. Her unmistakable Irish accent and the Celtic inflections of her melodies gave her singing a plaintive individuality and a flinty core.The Cranberries were formed in 1989 as the Cranberry Saw Us and renamed the Cranberries after Ms. O\u2019Riordan took over as lead singer in 1990. Along with the brothers Noel Hogan on guitar and Mike Hogan on bass, the band includes the drummer Fergal Lawler.The group arrived during the early 1990s ascendance of alternative rock: tuneful, punk-derived, guitar-driven songs that often made their way from college-radio playlists to commercial radio.Four of the group\u2019s albums reached the Billboard Top 20.Female rock singers like Sinead O\u2019Connor and Harriet Wheeler of the Sundays had recently preceded the Cranberries on the pop charts, and the band also drew deeply on the musical example of the Smiths, the 1980s band that propelled warm, rounded guitars and confessional lyrics with post-punk drumming. The Cranberries\u2019 1993 debut album, \u201cEverybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?,\u201d which included the career-making hits \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cDreams,\u201d and the 1994 album \u201cNo Need to Argue,\u201d with \u201cZombie,\u201d were both produced by the Smiths\u2019 producer, Stephen Street.After \u201cZombie,\u201d the Cranberries lost much of their pop audience as their late-1990s albums grew harsher and more concerned with sociopolitical messages than with love songs. The Cranberries disbanded in 2003. In 2007 Ms. O\u2019Riordan released her first solo album, \u201cAre You Listening?\u201dMs. O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death was also announced on the group\u2019s Twitter account, where fans shared messages of mourning and of the impact that the group\u2019s music had on their lives.\u201cShe was part of my DNA, the soundtrack to my life,\u201d wrote one, Michael Traboulsi.Ms. O\u2019Riordan was born on Sept. 6, 1971, and grew up in the Ballybricken area of County Limerick, Ireland. In 1994, she married Don Burton, a former tour manager for Duran Duran; the couple divorced in 2014. She is survived by her three children, Taylor, Molly and Dakota, and her mother, Eileen O\u2019Riordan.Six years after the Cranberries\u2019 split, the group reunited and began touring again. But last year, the band canceled dates on its European and North America tours because of Ms. O\u2019Riordan\u2019s ongoing back problems.The Cranberries released the acoustic album \u201cSomething Else\u201d in 2017 and had plans to perform shows in Europe and North America.

{"Headline": "In Vancouver, a Door to a Parallel Culinary World", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s Notebook10 PhotosVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 My introduction to Kissa Tanto\u2019s universe began with a framed sign just inside the door. \u201cPlease fix your hair, and remove the mud from your boots,\u201d it read, as if I\u2019d just arrived at the end of a long journey on the back of a horse.After doing what I could to make myself presentable, I climbed the steep staircase, ducked through blue curtains, and entered the restaurant. Once I was in, I wanted to stay all night.The host who met me at the head of the stairs wore a pressed white shirt and a trim little bow tie. Most of the people at the tables and the long bar were neatly dressed, too, without the straitjacketed stiffness you sometimes see at more expensive restaurants. Everybody seemed to have gotten dolled up just for the fun of it.This is a rarity in the Pacific Northwest. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s especially common in Los Angeles or New York right now, either. But after a decade or so of tumbling into no-reservations gastro pubs and ramen counters wearing rumpled morning-after T-shirts, diners seem to be growing curious about restaurants that offer a bit of costume drama, and invite some in return.The world Kissa Tanto dreams up is so much more appealing than the one I\u2019d left behind that I can understand why reservations usually have to be made two months out, when you can find them. In the year and a half the restaurant has been in business, drawing national attention, tables have not gotten much easier to come by, and the few that are set aside each night for walk-ins tend to be claimed minutes after the doors open at 5:30 p.m.What they will be eating could be described as Italian food made with Japanese sensibility and ingredients. Marriages of this sort are rumored to be successful in Japan, but for some reason they tend to fall apart almost anywhere else. (In Italy, Italian food is made with Italian ingredients, Japanese food with Japanese ingredients, and to suggest a different arrangement would be like bringing scuba gear to a ski slope.)Mr. Watanabe, the executive chef, and Alain Chow, his sous-chef, never seemed to be forcing flavors to do things against their will. Three fried croquettes filled with mashed eggplant were perfectly at ease with smoky shavings of skipjack tuna and a chilled bed of gribiche sauce, lightly tart with yuzu. This was lovely.So was a salad of eggplant, lightly fried, like calamari, and arranged with pickled daikon over a smooth green chile-parsley sauce. These dishes were neither Japanese nor Italian but some third thing invented by Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Chow.The only small bumps of the night came with the pasta course. The porchetta stuffing inside agnolotti needed a little more lubrication, and a lasagna never came together; instead of the \u201crag\u00f9\u201d of sesame sausage promised by the menu, the sheets of buckwheat pasta were layered over big, flat, dry chips of sausage.Hand-cut tajarin pasta in melted butter and mushrooms was virtually perfect, though, obviously made by a chef who understands that simplicity can be luxurious.Fried whole fish served, in the style of tempura, with soy sauce and grated daikon, has become one of Kissa Tanto\u2019s signature dishes. I could see why; the skin, which belonged to an ocean perch the night I was there, was beautifully fried and slightly chewy, while the white flesh was absolutely tender. I was just as impressed by the cooking of a slab of sable, or Pacific cod, roasted to a golden sheen that left all the natural oils intact.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.Whatever they were, it was something new in Chinatown. This is one of the only areas of Vancouver with low-rise buildings that have been standing for more than a century. Some still have the original recessed upper-story balconies that made the neighborhood\u2019s architecture stand out.Chinatown was a major night-life destination in the mid-20th century, when Foo\u2019s Ho Ho, the Marco Polo and other places lured people for dinner and a show. These places were gone by the time Bao Bei came along. Chinatown\u2019s streets were dark, and its many back alleys were full of people doing the things people always do in back alleys. Anyone looking for serious Chinese food was likely to seek it in other parts of the city.Bao Bei\u2019s success, not to mention the crowds looking for somewhere to kill time while waiting for a table there, inspired a night-life revival in Chinatown.One of the nicest things about Kissa Tanto is that it inhabits the neighborhood respectfully. It continues the long tradition of second-story restaurants unobtrusively tucked up above the street level. Like those vanished midcentury places, it announces its presence in neon \u2014 purple, in this case.I haven\u2019t been able to locate a cocktail menu from Foo\u2019s Ho Ho, but I imagine it had a Singapore Sling, as Kissa Tanto does. I\u2019d also be willing to bet that Kissa Tanto\u2019s is better; the cocktails are meticulously grounded in the proper techniques and ingredients.The third partner in Kissa Tanto with Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Chow is a former bartender named Tannis Ling. Ms. Ling is the founder of Bao Bei, and it\u2019s no accident, I think, that both places display a cocktail bar-like finesse about lighting, music and other atmospheric details.In Mr. Watanabe she has found a talented partner to take charge of the kitchen, but I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t try to make Kissa Tanto into a chef\u2019s showpiece. There are so many of those these days, and they all start to look alike after a while, given that chefs tend to have more ideas about cooking than interior design. Their imaginations are stuck in the kitchen.At Kissa Tanto, there\u2019s imagination all over the place. It\u2019s a restaurant to get lost in.Kissa Tanto, 263 East Pender Street, Chinatown, Vancouver, British Columbia; 778-379-8078; kissatanto.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kindest Cut of All: A Pork Rib With Slow-Cooked Comforts", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to pork, most home cooks know the chop, the tenderloin, the loin roast, even the Boston butt. But because I am a sucker for the underdog and the oddball, I have a new favorite cut of pork: the country-style rib.Why oddball? First, it suffers from something of an identity crisis, since despite its name it\u2019s not really a rib. Second, it has an indeterminate composition, consisting of both light and dark meat. Finally, it has a tendency to slide into disreputable territory, since its name is sometimes appropriated for less desirable cuts.But like any good antihero, the country-style rib has hidden virtues. It has rich, deep pork flavor; it is generally the most inexpensive cut of pork at the meat counter; and it is ideal for those slow-cooked dishes we crave in cool weather.To understand this cut, you first need to know the blade pork chop. This chop is cut from the two ribs at the shoulder end of the pork loin. Because it comes from the intersection of the tender loin and the more fat-laden and gnarly shoulder, it has qualities of both.Butchers used to have difficulty selling this chop, because it didn\u2019t look as lean and smooth as those from the center of the loin. So it generally ended up as an ingredient in sausages or, less reputably, secreted at the bottom of a wrapped package of \u201cloin chops.\u201dYou can recognize these traditional country-style ribs by the slender section of rib that curves prettily along the bottom. I asked butchers in New York and Boston to cut me country-style ribs, and both did it this way.Sometimes instead of a curving rib bone, you\u2019ll find a flat little two- or three-inch section of bone lurking along one edge of your country-style ribs. This means the chop was cut from the section of the shoulder just adjacent to the ribs; the bone is a piece of the scapula. But this is really not a big deal. Ribs fabricated in this fashion will have somewhat more fat and connective tissue and more dark meat, but are still close cousins of the more traditional cut, and cook up the same way.That\u2019s not the end of it, though. Some butchers will cut the lower part of the pork shoulder into strips and label them \u201cboneless country-style ribs.\u201d They are still tasty and work well in long-cooking recipes, but you have to pay closer attention to what you\u2019re getting and avoid those with excess amounts of fat and gnarl.Then there\u2019s the higher-class impostor. Sometimes boneless rib-eye chops are fashioned into long, slender pieces and called country-style ribs. You can tell them clearly from their much lighter color and higher price \u2014 usually twice as expensive as the real thing. But since this portion of the pig is much leaner and therefore cooks differently, we\u2019ll bypass these ersatz ribs for now.Any of the other versions, though, will work just fine, particularly in stews and braises.In addition to its proportion of lean meat to fat and collagen, the country-style rib also has a shape that makes it ideal for stews. It\u2019s hard to find pre-cut pork stew meat in the supermarket, and even if you do it\u2019s not a good idea to buy it, since it usually consists of ragged little odds and ends from around the pig.So the usual drill is to buy a Boston butt and butcher it, which is a considerable amount of work. Country-style ribs, on the other hand, have considerably less fat and gnarl than the butt and come in neat pieces that are easily sliced up.In a similar way, country-style ribs brown quickly and fit neatly into a Dutch oven for long, slow braising.I don\u2019t often go for pre-salting meat, because I rarely think far enough ahead to do it. But these ribs do benefit from the process, which somehow evens out the cooking times of the darker and lighter sections, so I recommend it.If you forget it, though, forge ahead. The results will still be delicious.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Questions as Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan Take on Health Care: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital.\u2022 JPMorgan has (and hasn\u2019t) clarified its succession plans.\u2022 What should we expect in tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech?Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees.But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.1) What is it?The venture will be an independent company that \u201cis free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won\u2019t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm.

Robert S. Spalding II, the senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council.Elsewhere in techThe recapMr. Weiss was one of Lazard\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking. He worked on InBev\u2019s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E. Master Blenders to JAB, the investment firm that later bought Keurig.)Since thenHe has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank. And he might yet start his own shop.Companies want to go public. But recent news suggests that many want to avoid the initial public offering process.Of course, there will still be I.P.O.s.: Uber, Dropbox and Airbnb are all working toward offerings. But if some companies can avoid the process, it appears they will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s So Hard to Calculate What You\u2019ll Pay for College", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyALONG THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE \u2014 It\u2019s high season for the people with some of the toughest jobs in higher education.No, not the admissions officers and their piles of applications. I\u2019m talking about the people who run what\u2019s come to be known as enrollment management. When they\u2019re not talking to the families writing the tuition checks, they speak in business terms \u2014 of overall discount rates and net tuition revenue.Make no mistake, their field is competitive. \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-sum game,\u201d said John Dolan, who works in this area at Simmons College in Boston. \u201cEvery student I gain I took from some other institution.\u201dTheir tool for attracting students is the scissors they wield to cut the list price of their school, and the discount isn\u2019t just based on what your family can afford anymore. There is also a shadow financial aid system known as \u201cmerit aid,\u201d which is a form of discounting that has little to do with your finances.Most parents planning for college in the first 16 or so years of a child\u2019s life have no idea that this two-track system exists, since it mostly did not when they attended college. And there isn\u2019t much data on how to qualify for these discounts. The schools may not explain the qualifications, or they\u2019ll hide the formula inside complex calculators. Moreover, the raw numbers of students who do get discounts are often listed in reports that are hard to find.It\u2019s frustrating bordering on maddening. Shouldn\u2019t we have as much data about merit aid and discounts as we do when buying a home or a car?To try to decode some of this, I paid a visit to enrollment practitioners from Mount Holyoke, Simmons, Smith and Wellesley Colleges. The schools have a few important things in common besides Bay State geography: They\u2019re relatively small, and their undergraduate divisions are women\u2019s colleges.When it comes to how they give away and talk about merit aid, however, they are very different.But first, a bit of history. For years, most financial aid was based on need. You disclosed your income and assets, and colleges would make their best offer with a package consisting of grants, loans and perhaps a campus job.That system still exists, but starting in the 1980s another one emerged alongside it. It came to be known as merit aid because many of the early discounters started giving out grants to top students. Their hope was that drawing enough of those applicants might improve their colleges\u2019 rankings.Colleges and universities give away merit aid because they believe they must. But there are holdouts; they mostly include schools like Wellesley, which is prestigious enough that a large minority \u2014 42 percent \u2014 of families are willing to pay full price. Its big endowment also helps, since it can be especially generous with financial aid that is based solely on its definition of need.\u201cI think there are people who don\u2019t quite demonstrate financial need that truly need the help,\u201d she said.Smith does not, however, provide much explanation about who may qualify for these discounts or how. I pressed the college for some average SAT scores or grade point averages, but it would not hand any over. \u201cWe don\u2019t admit statistics, we admit individuals, and individuals are infinitely more complex than the sum of their numerical parts,\u201d said Stacey Schmeidel, a college spokeswoman.\u201cDo we leverage this and say, \u2018This is who we are, and everyone is going to get something based on academic performance\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, it\u2019s just kind of icky not to admit it.\u201dIt would not be perfectly predictive, but it would offer a lot more information than many schools currently release. And given how far into the six figures many families will go to pay for college, it doesn\u2019t seem like too much to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad statement that this is like it is,\u201d she said.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Overture Raises Hopes, but Huge Obstacles Loom", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 On both sides of the divided Korean Peninsula, the timing seems right.In a telephone message delivered through the restored cross-border hotline on Friday, North Korea accepted the South\u2019s proposal that the two sides begin talks on Tuesday, South Korean officials said. The talks, to be held in the border village Panmunjom, will be the first high-level inter-Korean dialogue in two years.But if this is a potential opening for a thaw, it is a small one. Skepticism abounds not only in Washington but also among South Koreans.Many in the country are mindful of how the so-called sunshine policy of two previous progressive leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, failed to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, and remain wary of its revival. As Mr. Moon learned from his predecessors\u2019 experiences, any South Korean leader accused of risking the alliance with Washington in trying to improve ties with the North could become a lightning rod of conservative ire.\u201cIf there are still those who think they can solve the North Korean nuclear problem and problems between the South and the North through dialogue, they must be crazy,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, a director of the right wing Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, based in Seoul.While most South Koreans today favor dialogue and peaceful accommodation with North Korea, many also fear that hastily engaging and granting the North economic concessions would throw a lifeline to Mr. Kim just as sanctions are squeezing his government.In his New Year\u2019s Day speech, Mr. Kim offered to send an Olympic delegation to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next month. But he also boasted that his country was now a nuclear power capable of thwarting a United States-led war on the peninsula, and he urged the South to abandon Washington\u2019s campaign for sanctions and to work with \u201cfellow countrymen\u201d for peace \u2014 an opening Mr. Moon seized on.\u201cThe Pyeongchang Olympics and the Paralympics there will become a clarion of peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Mr. Moon said on Wednesday, the day Mr. Kim also restored the telephone hotline that could facilitate such negotiations. \u201cWe must move through the crisis and toward peace like an icebreaker.\u201dWhile many South Koreans support a peaceful resolution to the tensions, many also question Mr. Moon\u2019s approach \u2014 and Mr. Kim\u2019s sincerity.Analysts say Mr. Kim\u2019s strategy is to make his nuclear weapons a fait accompli, while seeking a way to weaken the choking sanctions.\u201cIn 2018, North Korea will likely launch an aggressive dialogue and peace offense and use the improvement of ties with the South to head off the sanctions and pressure,\u201d the South\u2019s government-run Korea Institute for National Unification said in an analysis of Mr. Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s speech. \u201cIt is using the Pyeongchang Olympics to start to implement its approach.\u201dIn his New Year\u2019s speech, Mr. Kim acknowledged that his country faced \u201cthe harshest-ever challenges\u201d because of the sanctions. And the Olympics offered an opening.\u201cKim Jong-un knew that South Korea was desperate for the North to join the Pyeongchang Olympics and resume inter-Korean dialogue,\u201d Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator, said in a Facebook post. \u201cRecognizing the South\u2019s weakness, he is using it to try to undermine the South\u2019s alliance with Washington, drawing it away from the United States and using it as a shield against possible American military action.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that his tough approach was working, saying that it brought North Korea to the negotiating table and that talks \u201care a good thing.\u201dAlso on Thursday, Mr. Moon talked with Mr. Trump and said that he promised to consult fully with Washington during South Korea\u2019s talks with the North, adding that they would help induce dialogue between the North and Washington, the South Korean president\u2019s office said.According to the statement from Mr. Moon\u2019s office, Mr. Trump said the United States supported Mr. Moon \u201c100 percent.\u201d Mr. Trump also accepted Mr. Moon\u2019s proposal that the allies postpone their joint annual military exercises during the Olympics, the statement said.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis played down the significance of the decision to delay the joint military exercises, saying that it was simply a matter of logistical timing and not necessarily a sign of a lessening of tensions.\u201cI would say for us it\u2019s a practical matter,\u201d Mr. Mattis told reporters on Thursday during an impromptu press briefing at the Pentagon. He said the military exercises would be held sometime after the conclusion of the Paralympics, which end March 18.Mr. Mattis also said it was too soon to know whether the North\u2019s recent diplomatic overture to South Korea would bring about broader talks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, because we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a genuine olive branch,\u201d he said.Analysts say the North views its participation in the Olympic Games as a favor to Mr. Moon, and would most likely demand major concessions from Seoul.Lifting such sanctions without clear North Korean movement toward denuclearization would open a crack in the American-led international campaign to pressure the North and cause a fissure in the alliance between Seoul and Washington. It would also prove unpopular in South Korea, especially among its older and conservative population, whose emotions over the ship\u2019s sinking remain raw. The South is set to hold elections for mayors and governors in June.North Korea has already signaled that tough negotiations loom.Mr. Moon has expressed a willingness to accommodate the North, particularly with his proposal to postpone the joint American-South Korean military exercises until after the Olympics in February and the Paralympics in March. But the North wants a longer-term halt.\u201cOnce the joint exercises resume in April, the South-North relations will chill again,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. \u201cThere are reasons to believe that things will get much worse in the second half of the year.\u201dAnd South Koreans are mindful of Mr. Kim\u2019s past behavior. In his New Year\u2019s speech in 2016, Mr. Kim said he was willing to improve ties with the South. Several days later, the North conducted its fourth nuclear test. This year, Mr. Kim threatened to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles. He also called for an ability to launch an \u201cimmediate nuclear counterattack.\u201dIf North Korea conducts more weapons tests, Mr. Cheong said, whatever thaw would be created by the North\u2019s Olympic participation would prove to be only \u201ctemporary.\u201dHelene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eyal Shani, an Israeli Celebrity Chef, Makes His New York Debut", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhole roasted cauliflower as interpreted by Eyal Shani, an Israeli celebrity chef, is about to make its debut in New York. The chef\u2019s signature dish will be on the menu at a branch of Miznon, his global group of casual counter-service restaurants, opening at Chelsea Market in a couple of weeks.The burnished head of cauliflower, first boiled in salt water that\u2019s \u201calways moving, like the sea,\u201d as the chef put it, then gently massaged with olive oil and roasted, becomes a meltingly tender, pull-apart dish. Mr. Shani claims to have been the first to create it after noting a roasted head of cauliflower at the home of Shahar Segal, a filmmaker and advertising executive who is his partner at Miznon.Whether or not he was first, whole cauliflower and cauliflower steaks have become popular around the world. And to hear this 59-year-old chef with impressively sculpted hair tell it, the cauliflower is only one of his achievements, including, as he claims, inventing \u201cthe first carpaccio in the world made from fish.\u201d He also boasts about his tomato sashimi. \u201cThe world started copying me, and nobody gave me credit,\u201d he said.A self-taught chef who started his career in Jerusalem in 1989 with the high-end seafood restaurant Ocean, Mr. Shani became known for his bouillabaisse. \u201cIt was the best bouillabaisse because it was straight out of Julia Child\u2019s book,\u201d he said.He eventually closed Ocean and spent several years consulting, catering and being a television celebrity chef.With Mr. Segal, he opened Miznon in Tel Aviv in 2011. It now has a dozen locations, in Tel Aviv; Paris; Vienna; Melbourne, Australia; and now New York. He saw it as a way to bring his food to a younger, more budget-minded audience.\u201cYoung people did not come to my other restaurants because they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d he said.\u201cI decided to give them street food, pita, with a difference, not with the usual shawarma and falafel but with fillings like shrimp in cream sauce and seared rib-eye,\u201d he said. Traditional garnishes like onion slices, pickles and tahini sauce are added.In New York, Miznon, whose partners include Moish Ziv, an owner of Ronnybrook Farm Dairy, is finished in wood and tile and has a long counter in front of an open kitchen. There\u2019s seating at tables in the restaurant and outside in the concourse, and on stadium-style benches. There will be no waiter service, but runners will bring orders to those who opt to eat in.The menu, in addition to the cauliflower, includes \u201cRun Over Potato,\u201d a baked potato flattened like a carpaccio using a meat pounder and served with sour cream and herbs. But the focus is the slightly puffy, freshly baked, tender pitas with inventive fillings, including lobster with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, ratatouille and egg, a Reuben pita and a moussaka pita.\u201cPita is the most genius bread in the world,\u201d he said.And he did not claim to have invented it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Family of 5 Among 10 Americans Killed in Costa Rica Plane Crash", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the weeks before their family trip to Costa Rica, Bruce and Irene Steinberg of Scarsdsale, N.Y., told friends and family how excited they were to take their three sons on an adventure through that country\u2019s lush forests and tropical beaches.After visiting the Pacific coast, the Steinbergs were headed on Sunday to Costa Rica\u2019s capital for the last stop of their trip. But the single-engine plane carrying the Steinbergs \u2014 along with four members of another family, the Weisses from Belleair, Fla., as well as a 10th American passenger and two Costa Rican crew members \u2014 crashed that afternoon into a mountain shortly after takeoff, killing everyone on board, the authorities said.Officials in Guanacaste, a popular region on the Pacific coast for tourists, responded to reports shortly after noon of smoke and flames rising from a wooded area near Punta Islita Airport. Emergency responders found the charred wreckage of a Cessna plane operated by the regional airline Nature Air and the burned remains of those who had been on board.The State Department said it was aware of the crash and was working with the aviation authorities in Costa Rica. \u201cWe express our condolences to all those affected by this tragedy,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.The crash left craters of anguish and grief in New York and Florida.\u201cThey were together and they all perished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a terrible tragedy and it is a devastating loss to their families and to our congregation.\u201dA sister of Mr. Steinberg confirmed Sunday night in a Facebook post that her brother and his family had died in the crash. A relative who answered the phone at Mr. Steinberg\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Florida confirmed that the Steinbergs lived in Scarsdale, a suburb north of New York City, with their sons William, Zachary and Matthew.\u201cThey were the kind of people you would like to have many of,\u201d the relative said before saying she had to hang up. \u201cThey always did everything as a family.\u201dLyn Kaller, a close friend of Ms. Steinberg who also lives in Scarsdale, said she learned of the plane crash in a text message from a rabbi in Costa Rica on Sunday afternoon. \u201cSomething happened to the Steinbergs,\u201d the rabbi wrote.Ms. Kaller said she immediately called the man, who told her that the plane the family was on had crashed after takeoff, but she did not believe him until her son found a news story online about the accident.In the hours after the crash, Ms. Kaller said that an official with a United States consulate in Costa Rica also contacted her about the crash. The Steinbergs had many friends in Scarsdale, she said, so why the rabbi and government official contacted her had become another mystery in Sunday\u2019s tragedy.Mr. Steinberg worked in investment banking, and Ms. Steinberg volunteered at many nonprofits, Ms. Kaller said. She said she met Ms. Steinberg about 14 years ago when Matthew Steinberg and her son, Noah, attended nursery school at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale.Matthew was an eighth-grader at a private school, William attended the University of Pennsylvania and Zachary was at Johns Hopkins University, Ms. Kaller said. She said that their parents made an effort to expose them to cultures all over the world. It was a trip to Asia in a previous year, and the latest was the vacation to Costa Rica.\u201cIrene and Bruce felt very strongly about providing that kind of culture and enrichment for their children,\u201d she said in an interview.After the pilots picked up the American passengers, the plane took off for San Jos\u00e9, the capital, which is about 140 miles east, the authorities said. Photos posted by government officials on Facebook show that the Cessna plane crashed several hundred yards from the end of a runway at Punta Islita Airport.Costa Rica, particularly its pristine beaches and mountains on the Pacific coast, is popular with North American and European tourists. More tourists visit Costa Rica from America than any other country. Eco-tourism is a major draw, and Nature Air bills itself as the first carbon-neutral airline in the world.Christine Hauser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrants Fleeing to Canada Learn Even a Liberal Nation Has Limits", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTREAL \u2014 After fleeing to Montreal from Long Island, Marlise Beauville felt, she said, as if she had reached the Promised Land.She entered the country last summer without immigration papers, yet received a work permit, a monthly stipend of 600 Canadian dollars, or $480, free health care and free French lessons. The weather has become bone-cold chilly but her Canadian neighbors are warm.Though it is not clear that she will be able to stay, she is hunkering down, adamant that limbo in Canada is better than returning to Haiti, where she fears that the family of her dead husband will kill her. \u201cI won\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 go back to Haiti,\u201d said Ms. Beauville, a caregiver from Anse-\u00e0-Veau, Haiti, who was visiting a Haitian community center here the other day.Ms. Beauville was one of a surge of thousands of Haitian migrants who crossed over the border from the United States to Quebec last summer, spurred by a May announcement by the Trump administration that Haitians could lose their temporary protected status in the United States, granted after the 2010 earthquake that devastated their country.The migrants were hoping to benefit from a loophole in a United States-Canada treaty that allowed them to make refugee claims in Canada if they did not arrive at legal ports of entry, but crossed the border illegally.But Canadian officials are warning that even liberal Canada has its limits amid concerns, fairly or not, that illegal migration is stretching the immigration system to a breaking point and risks stoking a potential backlash.\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to illegally enter our border, and doing so is not a free ticket to Canada,\u201d Mr. Hussen said in an interview. \u201cWe are saying, \u2018You will be apprehended, screened, detained, fingerprinted, and if you can\u2019t establish a genuine claim, you will be denied refugee protection and removed.\u2019 \u201dOn Thursday at a White House meeting, President Trump demanded to know why he should accept immigrants from Haiti and some countries in Africa, which he described in vulgar and disparaging terms. His remarks possibly further unsettled others in the United States already anxious about their precarious status.On an earlier trip there, he sought to counter false media reports in the Latin American press that he said were suggesting that migrants could travel to Canada, \u201cwalk in and stay forever.\u201dThat loophole has created a political headache for the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, prompting criticism that it is encouraging illegal immigration, even as refugee advocates warn that Haitian migrants could face poverty, violence or worse if they are sent back to Haiti.Mr. Hussen emphasized that Canada was obliged to honor its international commitments under the 1951 United Nations refugee convention, which makes clear that asylum claims should be considered even if those applying use irregular means to enter a country because refugees are, by definition, fleeing persecution.But experts say there are too few judges to adjudicate the backlog of refugee claims, which means that the asylum process for migrants like Ms. Beauville can drag on for as long as two years.Ms. Beauville is undeterred. She said that after her husband died 15 years ago in Haiti, his family threatened her with a machete unless she handed over her inheritance. So she fled to Long Island. There, she eked out a living as a caregiver.Life was not easy in America \u2014 she had left her young son with her sister back in Haiti \u2014 but at least it was better than living with death threats.When reports that Haitians were going to be deported from the United States began to circulate in the summer, Ms. Beauville once again packed her bags. She left her home in Long Island, boarded a Greyhound bus for Plattsburgh, N.Y., and then took a taxi to an unofficial point along the United States-Canadian border.When an amiable Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer warned her that she would be detained, she had her reply ready: \u201cPlease arrest me.\u201dShe was detained but not handcuffed.\u201cThey asked how much money I had,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey took my fingerprints, and a group of us were then taken to a YMCA for processing. I love Canada because it is an open welcoming country. I feel I receive love here.\u201dIn Quebec, which has a small but vocal anti-immigrant far right, the reaction against the newcomers has been relatively muted. After the Haitian migrants began arriving this summer in Montreal, a smattering of protesters picketed near the city\u2019s Olympic Stadium, where some were housed.And while racism exists, she said, much of the animus toward immigrants had been directed at Muslims. The center recently came under criticism, she noted, when it opened its doors to refugees during Ramadan.\u201cThe sad truth is that if Haitians were Muslim the reaction would be far different,\u201d she said.Haitians began arriving in Quebec in the 1960s to flee the tyranny of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc. Today, there is a Haitian member of Parliament, a senator as well as celebrated singers, Uber drivers and doctors.Ms. Beauville hopes to join their ranks, and on a recent day she and her friend Marie Nadege, a fellow migrant, made their way to Haiti House, where a Canadian canoe-making manufacturer had come to recruit workers. As far as they were concerned, Quebec was their new home.\u201cI have nothing in Haiti,\u201d Ms. Beauville said. \u201cNo money. No house.\u201d\u201cI keep praying I can stay,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly regulations on face veils in Quebec. While the government barred people wearing face coverings from using public services or working in government jobs, it did not ban full-face veils in public spaces.Advertisement"}

Officials, including the prime minister, have voiced concerns about an irrational frenzy. Raids by South Korean tax officials on digital currency exchanges this week have added to unease among investors.\u201cI am so nervous,\u201d said Kim Su-jin, a 50-year-old investor in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies who works as a bookkeeper at a women\u2019s clothing store in Seoul. \u201cMy coins could become trash if the government closes the exchanges.\u201dThe country\u2019s justice minister, Park Sang-ki, said this week that his ministry was drawing up a bill that would include the complete shutdown of virtual currency exchanges, adding that trading in the tokens \u201chas started to resemble gambling and speculation.\u201dThe most popular Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea process hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions every day. Trades using the Korean won account for around 5 percent of the volume of Bitcoin trades globally.At the very least, a ban would not be passed quickly: Securing a majority of votes in the National Assembly could take months.\u201cThe power of the individual investor is very huge in South Korea,\u201d said Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Hashed, a fund in Seoul that invests in virtual currency projects.The National Tax Service in South Korea declined to comment on why its representatives visited two major virtual currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, this week. But Shin Won-hee, head of operations at Coinone, said the tax authorities had wanted to check that the company had paid proper corporate tax.Bithumb told local news outlets that it was cooperating with the investigation.Separately, the police in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, have been investigating whether Coinone is operating \u201ca gambling site.\u201d The company had previously allowed investors to buy and sell virtual currencies on margin \u2014 that is, to place bets using borrowed money. But Mr. Shin said that Coinone decided in November to stop allowing margin trading as government officials began expressing concerns about market overheating.Mr. Park, the justice minister, said this week that the depths of South Korean investors\u2019 irrationality was reflected in the high premium \u2014 around 30 percent on Friday \u2014 that they paid on Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea over those elsewhere.Experts said that South Korean prices were also higher because the exchanges there did not allow trading by foreigners. That prevents overseas investors from selling Bitcoin in South Korea to profit from \u2014 and thereby help narrow \u2014 the price gap.South Korea\u2019s isolation from the global market leads investors at home to seek better prices elsewhere. \u201cWe are seeing Koreans taking loads of cash to buy Bitcoin in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia where Bitcoin is cheaper,\u201d said Hong Ki-hoon, professor of economics at Hongik University in Seoul.With so many conflicting signals from the government, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us think that these strong measures will actually be implemented,\u201d said Hyon Hae-in, a 35-year-old Bitcoin investor.\u201cLongtime investors see times like these as opportunities to trade,\u201d she said.Su-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and Raymond Zhong from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tucked Into the Tax Bill, a Plan to Help Distressed America", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A little-noticed section in the $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last month is drawing attention from venture capitalists, state government officials and mayors across America.The law creates \u201cOpportunity Zones,\u201d which will use tax incentives to draw long-term investment to parts of America that continue to struggle with high poverty and sluggish job and business growth. The provision is the first new substantial federal attempt to aid those communities in more than a decade. And it comes as a disproportionate share of economic growth has been concentrated in so-called superstar metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and New York.If the zones succeed, they could help revitalize neighborhoods and towns that are starved for investment.They could also deliver a windfall, in the form of avoided capital gains taxes, for corporations and financiers who invest in the Opportunity Zones.Yet risks remain, including whether investors will steer dollars toward areas that really need investment.\u201cI had to explain it several times to folks,\u201d said Mr. Scott, whose co-sponsors on a previous iteration of an opportunity zone bill included Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and House lawmakers from both parties. \u201cI came out of one of these communities, so I believe that there\u2019s untapped potential in every state in the nation.\u201dMr. Scott said that he had discussed the plan with Mr. Trump and that the president had later spoken approvingly of it. But in the rush to pass the bill over the course of a few frenzied weeks, the idea was never debated on the floor of the House or Senate. It was never promoted by Republican leaders or the White House.\u201cThis is a little billion-and-a-half dollar part\u201d of the law, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cBut if it\u2019s successful, we\u2019ll look back 10 years from now and say this was one of the most important parts of the tax bill, and one we didn\u2019t talk nearly enough about.\u201dMr. Hassett has a longtime interest in providing tax incentives for economic development in distressed areas. He said he first began discussing opportunity zones with Mr. Parker several years ago at a meeting in Mr. Parker\u2019s Greenwich Village home. Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Hassett wrote several white papers to help elevate the idea as part of an extensive, multiyear effort by the Economic Innovation Group to win support.The national economy grew and added jobs during that period, but that growth was disproportionately in large cities. Metropolitan areas with at least one million residents provided just under half of America\u2019s jobs in 2010. But from 2010 through 2016, those metropolitan areas accounted for nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s net job creation, according to new research by the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Rural areas accounted for just 3 percent of the job growth in that time. From 2010 to 2014, according to the innovation group\u2019s research, rural areas saw more businesses close than open.The new tax law provision plays to that sweet spot. It instructs governors in each state and territory, along with the mayor of the District of Columbia, to designate Opportunity Zones from a pool of low-income, high-poverty census tracts, subject to certification by the Treasury secretary. States cannot nominate all their qualifying tracts for that status \u2014 they are limited to only a quarter of eligible tracts. Investors, like banks or hedge funds, then create Opportunity Funds to seed either new businesses in those areas, expansions of existing ones or real estate development.The people who invest in Opportunity Funds are able to minimize their tax burden through preferential treatment of capital gains.More than $2 trillion in unrealized capital gains are sitting on individual and corporate balance sheets across America, according to the Economic Innovation Group, the result of profitable investments in stocks and mutual funds. Normally, the proceeds from the sale of those assets would be taxed as a capital gain, at a maximum federal rate of 20 percent plus a 3.8 percent surtax. The new law offers investors an alternative: to roll those unrealized gains into an Opportunity Fund, and defer federal taxes on the profit, at least temporarily.That deferral grows into capital gains tax relief the longer the investment is held. An investor who retains an investment for seven years will pay only 85 percent of the capital gains taxes that would have been due on the original investment. If the investment is held beyond 10 years, the investor permanently avoids capital gains taxes on any proceeds from the Opportunity Fund investment.\u201cThis becomes its own asset class, and it could be a very large asset class,\u201d Mr. Parker said in an interview, referring to Opportunity Funds.Investors are already starting to take notice. A two-hour session on Opportunity Funds drew a standing-room-only crowd last week at the Winter Innovation Summit in Salt Lake City, said Patrick McKenna, founding partner of the venture capital firm High Ridge Global. Mr. McKenna has invested in distressed communities such as Baltimore and over the last year has tried to steer Silicon Valley dollars to struggling areas such as Youngstown, Ohio, out of a belief those areas contain untapped potential for growth and prosperity.Civic leaders are beginning to pitch state economic development officials on designating tracts of their communities as Opportunity Zones. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif., which the Economic Innovation Group ranks as the eighth-most distressed large city in America. \u201cIt makes communities like Stockton more attractive for investment.\u201dTurning distressed communities into attractive investments, however, is not a guarantee. One critique of the plan is that it might not leverage much investment in areas that really need it \u2014 be they Stockton, or Youngstown, or any other distressed community. Research suggests many previous federal attempts to increase investment in particular regions, such as Clinton-era Enterprise Zones, were largely ineffective. A more successful effort was the New Markets Tax Credit, a program that still exists and similarly gives incentives to invest in distressed areas but that is relatively limited in scope.State economic development officials worry that if they designate the wrong areas as Opportunity Zones, they could end up subsidizing investments that were in the pipeline anyway.\u201cJob one is getting the areas correct and really levering this, in the intent of the program,\u201d said Stephanie Copeland, executive director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. \u201cNot just making venture capitalists more money.\u201dMr. Parker said he planned to educate fund managers on how to best capitalize on the possibilities in distressed areas.\u201cEventually,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important that I put my money where my mouth is by investing in Opportunity Funds myself.\u201d He said that he expected it would take a year or two for the funds to catch on, but that the results would exceed expectations once they did.Advertisement"}

She is a high-functioning alcoholic: She doesn\u2019t drink during the day but becomes a slurry obnoxious mess at parties. I avoid her, and eventually her husband steps in. But recently, my teenage stepdaughter witnessed her \u201cdrunk show\u201d and helped the woman\u2019s daughter through tears of anger and shame. Now I feel complicit. My sister-in-law won\u2019t intervene. So, I would like to tell this woman she needs help. Can you suggest a diplomatic approach?ANONYMOUSRemember that ancient party trick Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon? Its premise: Any two people, but particularly actors, are separated by fewer than six others who link them. It was utterly charming until its ubiquity made it insufferable. But if Six Degrees proved what a small, small world we inhabit, it never argued that folks at the far poles of separation should intervene in our most personal problems.I admire your helping impulse. But you are a near-stranger, not complicit. You see this woman about three times a year and avoid her when you do. You have no idea what goes on during the other 362 evenings (or any of the days). And denial is common among people with substance problems. Many report that when they do seek help, it is thanks to the intervention of loved ones \u2014 not in-laws of uninterested pals.You are not the right messenger, but you still have a big opportunity: You (and your spouse) should speak with your stepdaughter about what may have been an upsetting experience at the party. Praise her for her kindness to the woman\u2019s daughter; sketch out the limits of helpfulness (for example, no getting into cars); and answer her questions. The most valuable dialogue to begin is with someone close to you.My boyfriend\u2019s niece is getting married in Colorado. His brother suggested a pre-wedding trip and invited us along. After the wedding, this brother wants his wife and me to leave, so that the brothers and their sister can have some time alone. (The brother\u2019s wife has no problem with this.) The siblings live in different states, so I get that time together is precious. But being asked to leave early rubs me the wrong way. I would never ask this of anyone. Is the brother being rude, or am I too sensitive?I. W.Unless you have an abstract interest in rudeness, you\u2019re asking the wrong questions. Who cares what the brother wants? Focus your attention on your boyfriend \u2014 whom you love, presumably. If he wants a few days alone with his siblings after the two of you enjoy a high-altitude mini-break, I would go along with him.Staying connected with siblings in middle age, especially when we\u2019re spread out or after the organizing parent dies, is no mean feat. Strictly speaking, this \u201csibling time\u201d can include significant others, but if your beau wants a solo experience, this time, what\u2019s the harm? Don\u2019t make this about you. They may have issues to discuss. So, ask your boyfriend what he wants and see if you can give it to him.I am 57. I\u2019ve been going to the same hairstylist for years. She posts pictures of her clients\u2019 cuts and colors on her Instagram. All types of people are on her feed. But I have never been photographed for it, which is hurtful to me. If you are taking one client\u2019s picture, shouldn\u2019t you take all of them? And my hair looks great! How can I say something?KARENWe increase the odds of getting what we want by asking for it. And when what we want is as paltry as what you want, why spend a lot of time agonizing about it? (You led with your age, as if you suspected that was the issue. But then you eased the concern by saying she puts \u201call types of people\u201d on her feed, including 57-year-olds with great hair, one imagines.)The next time you\u2019re in for a cut or color, tell your stylist: \u201cMy lustrous mane looks magnificent today, doesn\u2019t it? Please take out your camera and put me on that Instagram feed.\u201d She is a service provider, Karen. She will do precisely that.Then came a tidal wave of letters from readers, many worried about possible sexual assault or the onset of mental illness. (The father\u2019s letter suggested neither, but I appreciate the vigilance.)

There have been plenty of opportunities for sliding, slipping and skating \u2014 even in places where it is risky and not allowed \u2014 from Boston to New York to the nation\u2019s capital.In the past week, parks authorities in Washington reminded visitors that where there is ice, there is usually water, after a number of people trying to skate or walk across the surface of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall broke through the ice.\u201cIce skating can lead to a cold and dangerous swim,\u201d the post added.On Monday, with the temperature in the mid-20s, the pool was marked with yardslong cracks all over the ice \u2014 but that didn\u2019t keep bold visitors from walking on its surface.Dozens of tourists slid cautiously along the edges, others wrestled playfully and some ventured toward the center of the pool to pose for photographs.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous,\u201d said Franco Benedetto, a tourist from Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina, who was visiting Washington with his girlfriend, Romina Apestey. \u201cWe just saw four, five people messing around out there. Really risky.\u201dMary Fredlake of the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, who was out for a morning run around the monuments on Monday, said her friends had seen people playing pickup hockey on the Reflecting Pool\u2019s surface on Sunday.Officials from the United States Park Police, National Park Service rangers, and volunteers patrolled the premises. Alao Hogan, a volunteer with the park service\u2019s Volunteers-in-Parks program, shooed tourists off the pool.He joked that it was \u201ca bit like herding cats,\u201d but added that people did move off the ice when asked.Posters \u2014 traditionally used to urge visitors not to wade in warm water \u2014 advised visitors against testing their luck on the ice. But the warnings were written in English, and many tourists traveling to the capital in the winter months come from foreign countries.\u201cSir!

Mr. Woods said he suspected some skaters could be trying to relive their childhood memories.\u201cThe lagoon used to be a place where you could skate,\u201d Mr. Woods said. \u201cBut we do not have a rule against it.

On Jan. 13, Superintendent Anwar released a statement claiming that he and his officers had thwarted a deadly attack on Karachi\u2019s airport, killing four unidentified militants who he said had a history of killing \u201cpolice, Rangers and army personnel.\u201dThree days later, the family of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a 27-year-old shopkeeper with dreams of becoming a model, received his bullet-riddled body from the authorities, along with the news that he had been among the supposed militants shot by the police.Mr. Mehsud\u2019s relatives insist that he has never had militant ties and was targeted just because he was Pashtun. \u201cWe\u2019re still in shock about what happened,\u201d said Manzoor Ahmed, a family friend and social activist. \u201cHis entire family is trying to understand why this happened to Naqeebullah.\u201dAn internal police investigation into the supposed Taliban shootout supports the family\u2019s side of events, finding the superintendent\u2019s account of the clash \u201cdoubtful\u201d and uncovering no apparent links between Mr. Mehsud and any militant group.What he did have, however, was a Facebook page with a large following, fans of the glamorous photos he posted as he tried to develop a modeling career.

In a long statement he released by WhatsApp afterward, Mr. Anwar appeared to put the blame for Mr. Mehsud\u2019s death on Pakistan\u2019s weak judicial system, in effect saying that he did what he had to do.\u201cKarachi, don\u2019t forget the blasts. Karachi, don\u2019t forget the target killings,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you take that into consideration, then you know that some of the work that should have been done by judges was done by officers like Rao Anwar.\u201dThough many law enforcement agencies in Karachi stand accused of similar tactics to Mr. Anwar\u2019s, they appear to be responding to public outrage by closing ranks against him.\u201cThis is an opportunity to deter extrajudicial and unjust killings, and for law enforcement to correct itself,\u201d said the head of Karachi\u2019s counterterrorism department, Sanaullah Abbasi. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to give justice to the people.\u201dEarlier versions of this article incorrectly listed the number of terrorism suspects reported to have been killed by the Karachi police in 2017. The police said that 73 had been killed, not 7,373.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1,000 Danes Accused of Child Pornography for Sharing Video of Teens", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 About 1,000 adults and adolescents may face prosecution for sharing online video of two 15-year-olds having sex, and more people may be charged for spreading the images, the Danish National Police said Monday.Consensual sex between 15-year-olds is legal in Denmark, but anyone who forwarded the video violated the law against distributing child pornography, the police explained. The two video clips \u2014 one 50 seconds long, the other 9 seconds \u2014 were shared through Facebook\u2019s Messenger app.The case prompted outrage when it was first reported last year, because the video appeared to show the girl being abused, penetrated with foreign objects. The girl has said that she consented to sex, but not to the abuse or to the recording.The police notified 1,004 people on Monday that they faced preliminary charges, which the police can issue on their own; prosecutors will decide whether to proceed with charges and take the cases to trial. Investigators are looking into whether the video was distributed on platforms other than Facebook.\u201cIt may sound very dramatic that we\u2019re charging with child pornography,\u201d said Flemming Kjaerside, a police superintendent. \u201cMany had no intention to distribute child pornography, but objectively speaking, that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done.\u201dThose found guilty in the Danish case are unlikely to go to prison, but the convictions will remain on their records for 10 years, barring them from becoming police officers and from taking certain jobs working with children. Some have already confessed, Mr. Kjaerside said, as the police across the country contacted the accused and their parents, and conducted the first rounds of questioning.It is not clear whether all of the people charged knew that the boy and girl in the videos were under 18, the minimum age for legally distributed pornography. If they convince a judge that they had no way of knowing, the child pornography charges could be dropped, but they could still be charged with distributing the material without the consent of the couple in the images.All but eight of the accused are under 25 years old, and four-fifths of them are male. A few 14-year-olds who also shared the video are not being prosecuted, the police said.Mira Bech, 19, who received notice to contact the police for questioning, admitted seeing and storing the video, but she denied sharing it. She said she knew others who also had the video but had not been charged.Mr. Kjaerside, the police superintendent, said that charges were leveled only against those who had shared the video.The case came to light in the fall of 2017, after Facebook alerted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States, and that group contacted American and international authorities. Danish police spent months identifying the social media users, their IP addresses, phone numbers and names.The recordings were made at a party by friends of the couple, who were the first to share them online. Two of them were fined last year for their part in the distribution.\u201cI tried to forget that evening,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that it was filmed, but I didn\u2019t realize they would think of passing the videos on to others.\u201dKuno Sorensen, a psychologist with Save the Children Denmark, said, \u201cYoungsters are afraid of reporting these cases to the police,\u201d and they are embarrassed to discuss them with their parents or other authority figures.\u201cA lot of the charged are under 18 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that they become hostages in this, but at the same time they\u2019ve committed a crime with a heavy impact on the victims.\u201d\u201cFour years ago, I would have felt sorry for them,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then you could have argued that they were not aware of that it was illegal, but today they know.\u201dRather than tell children not to take explicit images, she said, adults should tell them not to bully or humiliate others, just as they do in school or on playgrounds.\u201cTelling them to not take photos is like trying to forbid them to have sex,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been tried for 10,000 years and it didn\u2019t work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Romania Names 3rd Prime Minister in a Year Amid Struggle Over Corruption", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Viorica Dancila was approved by the Romanian Parliament as prime minister on Monday, becoming the first woman to hold the position in the country\u2019s history despite doubts about her relative lack of experience and the continued influence of a party leader who has been convicted of vote fraud.Ms. Dancila was formerly a little-known politician, and her low profile, some of the cabinet choices, and her ties to Liviu Dragnea, the powerful leader of the governing Social Democrat Party, mean that she will enter office with many Romanians skeptical of her independence and her ability to bring stability and usher in a more progressive era, especially as the country wrestles with corruption and growing disillusionment with the political class.Mr. Dragnea was unable to become prime minister because of a conviction for electoral fraud, and is also under investigation for misuse of state money, including European Union funds.That has led to speculation that Ms. Dancila had effectively been installed to serve his interests rather than acting independently, although he said in a speech before the vote that the country would benefit from her lack of recent exposure to the more petty aspects of Romanian politics. She hails from the same county as Mr. Dragnea.\u201cThe goal of my mandate is for Romania in 2020 to be in the top half of the E.U.\u2019s strongest economies so that young people no longer leave from Romania, and those that have left want to return,\u201d she told lawmakers.\u201cMaybe she is a very good person, but we don\u2019t know anything about her,\u201d said Cristian Pirvulescu, the dean of the political science department at the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had any important political experience until now \u2014 she was just a member of a small city council and then after that a member of the European Parliament.\u201dProfessor Pirvulescu said there was a simple explanation for why she had become prime minister: \u201cAfter difficult experiences with the two previous governments, Liviu Dragnea wants a government he can be absolutely sure of.\u201dOthers also questioned Ms. Dancila\u2019s experience.\u201cShe\u2019s not been among the prominent M.E.P.s, and wasn\u2019t very visible in Brussels. I knew she existed, that she was a Social Democrat M.E.P., but that\u2019s where it ended,\u201d said Paul Ivan, a former Romanian diplomat and a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels.Ms. Dancila was nominated after her predecessor, Mihai Tudose, resigned on Jan. 15 after losing the support of his Social Democrat colleagues, in particular Mr. Dragnea. His appointment came after the resignation of Sorin Grindeanu last June, after he lost a no-confidence vote brought about by his own party.Both were felt not to have given their full backing to efforts to overhaul the justice system, a party priority, and to have sought more autonomy from party leaders like Mr. Dragnea.After a year of on-again, off-again protests over attempts to weaken anticorruption efforts, the composition of the new government dampened hopes that it would offer a different approach to leadership.Several cabinet members, including the new business minister, Radu Oprea, have faced allegations of corruption. The new minister for European funds, Rovana Plumb, was forced to resign from the same post late last year over allegations related to land transfers.Professor Pirvulescu said that the main focus of the new government in the short term was likely to be on completing highly disputed changes to the judiciary, an effort that has been met with strong criticism from the country\u2019s allies, including the United States and European Commission.Opposition groups were also disinclined to give Ms. Dancila and her cabinet the benefit of the doubt.\u201cDancila seems like she will be more obedient to Mr. Dragnea, so it won\u2019t be better, and it could be worse,\u201d said Florin Badita, an activist who has helped rally people through a Facebook group he created after a deadly nightclub fire in 2015. \u201cHer appointment won\u2019t have any impact on the protests.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both her children have discouraged this.\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m going to keep cleaning houses.

He was 67.Mr. Clarke, who was born Edward Allan Clarke, joined the band as its guitarist in 1976, alongside the drummer Phil Taylor and the singer and bassist Ian Fraser Kilmister, known as Lemmy.Mot\u00f6rhead, known for its punishing and distorted heaviness, volume and penchant for rhythmic speed, which would inspire genres like thrash and speed metal, released 22 studio albums and went through numerous lineup changes. But the one with Mr. Clarke on guitar was regarded as the classic one, leading to some of the band\u2019s best-selling albums, including \u201cMot\u00f6rhead\u201d (1977), \u201cOverkill\u201d and \u201cBomber\u201d (both 1979), and \u201cAce of Spades\u201d (1980).Mr. Clarke occasionally contributed vocals to the group, in addition to his chunky chords and squealing licks and solos. On \u201cBeer Drinkers and Hellraisers,\u201d a ZZ Top cover from a 1980 Mot\u00f6rhead EP, Mr. Clarke traded lines and harmonized with Mr. Kilmister, a strategy they would also employ on the band\u2019s version of \u201cI\u2019m Your Witchdoctor\u201d (originally performed by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers).Mr. Clarke, who was born on Oct. 5, 1950, in Twickenham, a suburb of London, left the band while it was on tour in the United States after the release of \u201cIron Fist\u201d in 1982. He went on to form the two-piece hard-rock group Fastway with the former U.F.O. bassist Pete Way in 1983.Fastway released seven albums, including its 1983 debut, called simply \u201cFastway,\u201d which Mr. Clarke called a personal favorite. \u201cI loved it because it was all my pent-up stuff,\u201d he said. The album \u201cAll Fired Up\u201d was released the next year, and the band would go on to tour with AC/DC.Mr. Clarke reunited intermittently over the years with Mot\u00f6rhead, including in 2000 at a 25th-anniversary concert at Brixton Academy in London. The show was documented on a live DVD titled \u201c25 & Alive Boneshaker.\u201dPhil Campbell, Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s guitarist from 1984 to 2015, said in a statement that Mr. Clarke would be remembered for his \u201ciconic riffs\u201d and that he had been a \u201ctrue rock \u2019n\u2019 roller.\u201dThere was no immediate word on survivors.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misspelled part of Mr. Clarke\u2019s birth name. He was born Edward Allan Clarke, not Edward Allen Clark.Joe Coscarelli contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Virginia Official Pulls Republican\u2019s Name From Bowl to Pick Winner of Tied Race", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn official of the Virginia State Board of Elections pulled the name of David Yancey from a blue and white stoneware bowl on Thursday, breaking a tied race that is pivotal to control of the state House of Delegates.The outcome in favor of Mr. Yancey, the Republican incumbent, means that the House remains narrowly in his party\u2019s hands, 51 seats to 49, after a Democratic wave in November propelled by anger at President Trump. Going into the election, the Republicans had a 32-seat advantage.The random drawing, a species of political unicorn that attracted attention well beyond Virginia, was conducted in the Patrick Henry Building near the State Capitol in Richmond shortly after 11 a.m. Each candidate\u2019s name was written on strips of paper, inserted into film canisters and mixed together in the handmade bowl, made by the potter-in-residence at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Steven Glass.Despite the high ceremony, the drawing may not bring finality to a race that has already been fiercely fought through a recount and in court skirmishes. By state law, the loser in the drawing may request a second recount.The Democratic challenger, Shelly Simonds, a school board member in Newport News, said after the drawing that \u201call options are still on the table.\u2019\u2019 But she also sounded resigned. \u201cYou know it was a long hard election season, and it does seem like a sad end to the story to have to end on a game of chance,\u2019\u2019 she told reporters.Ms. Simonds had proposed to Mr. Yancey on Wednesday that each should pledge to forgo a second recount if they lost the drawing. Mr. Yancey rejected the offer.Republican leaders in the House called on the Democrat to give up the fight, despite her right to ask for a second recount.For one day last month, when the initial recount gave Ms. Simonds a one-vote lead in the race, Democrats celebrated the end of 17 years of Republican majorities in the House. Republicans even said in a statement that with control evenly divided, they looked forward to a power-sharing arrangement.But a three-judge recount court, reviewing the count the next day, added an additional ballot for Mr. Yancey. That tied the race at 11,607 apiece, and created the need for the random drawing called for under Virginia law. Ms. Simonds asked the court to reconsider its decision on the single ballot, but the court rejected the request earlier this week.If Ms. Simonds requests a second recount, it probably would not be complete by Jan. 10, when the House of Delegates is scheduled to reconvene. Republicans said on Thursday that in the past, members have not been seated when a recount of their race was in progress. But even without Mr. Yancey, they would still have one more vote than the Democrats.\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that we intend to organize the House on the first day of session,\u2019\u2019 said Kirk Cox, a Republican who is expected to be chosen as speaker.Control of the speakership on opening day brings with it a bag of political goodies, including control over committee assignments and House rules, which will determine which bills make it to the floor, amplifying Republican influence over a chamber that is nearly equally divided.Virginia Democrats had hoped that under Ralph Northam, the governor-elect and a Democrat, thwarted liberal priorities would break through a logjam of Republican control of both houses of the General Assembly. Expanding Medicaid in the state was high on that list.Democrats have angrily pointed to the gerrymandered House of Delegates map, saying that it unfairly prevented them from gaining control, even though their candidates received 10 percentage points more votes statewide than their Republican rivals.The drawing was held with the three members of the State Elections Board seated at a long table. Noting that they usually attracted only one or two journalists to their meetings, the members sounded and acted a bit nervous.James B. Alcorn, the chairman and a Democrat, said there was \u201ca fair amount of interest in which bowl we would use.\u2019\u2019 For the drawings the board routinely conducts to decide the order in which candidates are listed on ballots, he said, \u201cwe have been using a glass bowl for many years, and more recently a cardboard box.\u2019\u2019 For this occasion, though, he said he asked the fine arts museum for something special.Strips of paper with the candidates\u2019 names were rolled and inserted into old film canisters and placed in the bowl. The vice-chairwoman, Clara Belle Wheeler, a Republican, then gave the bowl a stir, and Mr. Alcorn plucked the winner. It was the first time since 1971 that Virginia broke a tied legislative race by random drawing.Ms. Wheeler gave a long statement about the importance of ensuring that elections are trustworthy. For this reason, she said, in the 2017 election Virginia exclusively used paper ballots, which can be inspected in the event of a recount.\u201cVoting is a very serious thing,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wheeler said.The drawing happened the day after Mr. Trump dismissed his voter fraud commission, which he had set up after claiming without evidence that millions of illegal votes were cast in the presidential election of 2016. The commission was dissolved before issuing a report.At the end of her statement, Ms. Wheeler indirectly addressed the unknown voter in House District 94 whose disputed ballot had tied the race. The voter had blackened in bubbles for both Mr. Yancey and Ms. Simonds, which would ordinarily cause the ballot not to be counted. But the voter had also drawn a slash through the Simonds bubble, and the recount court ruled that the ballot should be counted as a vote for Mr. Yancey.\u201cSometimes you make a mistake,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wheeler said. \u201cAll you have to do is give your ballot to the election official in the room,\u201d and get a fresh one to try again, she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Brace for Europe\u2019s New Data Privacy Rules", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs.Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information.And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center \u2014 a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served.With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley\u2019s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.\u201cEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,\u201d said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. \u201cG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.\u201dEuropean officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.\u201cThere has not been any pushback from American companies,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cIf anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.\u201dOfficials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google\u2019s director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. \u201cWhen G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation\u2019s mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services \u2014 from Gmail to its Cloud storage services \u2014 to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone\u2019s data.\u201cFor a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,\u201d Mr. Golan said.Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.The new privacy center would give Facebook a \u201cvery good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules.\u201cWe embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,\u201d Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. \u201cWe began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company.\u201dHow the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online.\u201cWhere the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see real changes across the board.\u201dMs. Jourov\u00e1 said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens.\u201cThere will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Exiled Billionaire Whistle-Blower", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "FeatureFrom a penthouse on Central Park, Guo Wengui has exposed a phenomenal web of corruption in China\u2019s ruling elite \u2014 if, that is, he\u2019s telling the truth.Supported byGuo\u2019s New York apartment is a 9,000-square-foot residence along Central Park that he bought for $67.5 million in 2015. He sat in a Victorian-style chair, his back to a pair of west-facing windows, the sunset casting craggy shadows. A black-and-white painting of an angry-looking monkey hung on the wall to Guo\u2019s right, a hat bearing a star-and-wreath Soviet insignia on its head and a cigarette hanging from its lips. Guo had arrived dressed entirely in black, except for two silver stripes on each lapel. \u201cI have the best houses,\u201d he told me. Guo had picked his apartment for its location, its three sprawling balconies and the meticulously tiled floor in the entryway. He has the best apartment in London, he said; the biggest apartment in Hong Kong. His yacht is docked along the Hudson River. He is comfortable and, anyway, Guo likes to say that as a Buddhist, he wants for nothing. If it were down to his own needs alone, he would have kept his profile low. But he has a higher purpose. He is going to save China.Nothing in Guo\u2019s story is as straightforward as he would like it to seem. Guo is 47 years old, or 48, or 49. Although he has captured the attention of publications like The Guardian, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the articles that have run about him have offered only hazy details about his life. This is because his biography varies so widely from one source to the next. Maybe his name isn\u2019t even Guo Wengui. It could be Guo Wugui. There are reports that in Hong Kong, Guo occasionally goes by the name Guo Haoyun.When pressed, Guo claims a record of unblemished integrity in his business dealings, both in real estate and in finance (when it comes to his personal life, he strikes a more careful balance between virility and dedication to his family). \u201cI never took a square of land from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a penny of investment from the banks.\u201d If you accept favors, he said, people will try to exploit your weaknesses. So, Guo claims, he opted to take no money and have no weaknesses.Yet when Guo left China in 2014, he fled in anticipation of corruption charges. A former business partner had been detained just days before, and his political patron would be detained a few days afterward. In 2015, articles about corruption in Guo\u2019s business dealings \u2014 stories that he claims are largely fabrications \u2014 started appearing in the media. He was accused of defrauding business partners and colluding with corrupt officials. To hear Guo tell it, his political and business opponents used a national corruption campaign as a cover for a personal vendetta.Whatever prompted Guo to take action, his campaign came during an important year for China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. In October, the Communist Party of China (C.P.C.) convened its 19th National Congress, a twice-a-decade event that sets the contours of political power for the next five years. The country is in the throes of a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign, and Xi has overseen a crackdown on dissidents and human rights activists while increasing investment in censorship and surveillance. Guo has become a thorn in China\u2019s side at the precise moment the country is working to expand its influence, and its censorship program, overseas.In November 2017, the Tiananmen Square activist Wang Dan warned of the growing influence of the C.P.C. on university campuses in the United States. His own attempts to hold \u201cChina salons\u201d on college campuses had largely been blocked by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association \u2014 a group with ties to China\u2019s government. Around the same time, the academic publisher Springer Nature agreed to block access to hundreds of articles on its Chinese site, cutting off access to articles on Tibet, Taiwan and China\u2019s political elite. Reports emerged last year that China is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars quarterly to purchase ads on Facebook (a service that is blocked within China\u2019s borders). In Australia, concerns about China\u2019s growing influence led to a ban on foreign political donations.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling the United States they should really be careful,\u201d Guo said. China\u2019s influence is spreading, he says, and he believes his own efforts to change China will have global consequences. \u201cLike in an American movie,\u201d he told me with unflinching self-confidence. \u201cIn the last minutes, we will save the world.\u201dThe tight grip that the C.P.C. keeps on information may be nothing new, but China\u2019s leadership has been working hard to update the way it censors and broadcasts. People in China distrusted print and television media long before U.S. politicians started throwing around accusations of \u201cfake news.\u201d In 2016, President Xi Jinping was explicit about the arrangement, informing the country\u2019s media that it should be \u201csurnamed Party.\u201d Likewise, while the West has only recently begun to grapple with government-sponsored commenters on social media, China\u2019s government has been manipulating online conversations for over a decade.\u201cThey create all kinds of confusion,\u201d said Ha Jin, the National Book Award-winning American novelist born in China\u2019s Liaoning Province, and a vocal supporter of Guo. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what information you have and whether it\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know who are the informers, who are the agents.\u201dOnline, the C.P.C. controls information by blocking websites, monitoring content and employing an army of commenters widely known as the 50-cent party. The name was used as early as 2004, when a municipal government in Hunan Province hired a number of online commenters, offering a stipend of 600 yuan, or about $72. Since then, the 50-cent party has spread. In 2016, researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the University of California-San Diego estimated that these paid commenters generated 448 million social-media comments annually. The posts, researchers found, were conflict averse, cheerleading for the party rather than defending it. Their aim seemed not to be engaging in argument but rather distracting the public and redirecting attention from sensitive issues.In early 2017, Guo issued his first salvos against China\u2019s ruling elite through more traditional channels. He contacted a handful of Chinese-language media outlets based in the United States. He gave interviews to the Long Island-based publication Mingjing News and to Voice of America \u2014 a live event that was cut short by producers, leading to speculation that V.O.A. had caved to Chinese government pressure. He called The New York Times and spoke with reporters at The Wall Street Journal. It did not take long, however, before the billionaire turned to direct appeals through social media. The accusations he made were explosive \u2014 he attacked Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping\u2019s corruption czar, and Meng Jianzhu, the secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, another prominent player in Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign. He talked about Wang\u2019s mistresses, his business interests and conflicts within the party.In one YouTube video, released on Aug. 4, Guo addressed the tension between Wang and another anti-corruption official named Zhang Huawei. He recounted having dinner with Zhang when \u201che called Wang Qishan\u2019s secretary and gave him orders,\u201d Guo said. \u201cThink about what Wang had to suffer in silence back then. They slept with the same women, and Zhang knew everything about Wang.\u201d In addition, Guo said, Zhang knew about Wang\u2019s corrupt business dealings. When Zhang Huawei was placed under official investigation in April, Guo claimed, it was a result of a grudge.\u201cEveryone in China is a slave,\u201d Guo said in the video. \u201cWith the exception of the nobility.\u201dTo those who believe Guo\u2019s claims, they expose a depth of corruption that would surprise even the most jaded opponent of the C.P.C. \u201cThe corruption is on such a scale,\u201d Ha Jin said. \u201cWho could imagine that the czar of anti-corruption would himself be corrupt? It is extraordinary.\u201dGuo quickly resumed posting videos and encouraging his followers. His accusations continued to accumulate throughout 2017, and he recently started his own YouTube channel (and has yet to divorce his wife). His YouTube videos are released according to no particular schedule, sometimes several days in a row, some weeks not at all. He has developed a casual, talkative style. In some, Guo is running on a treadmill or still sweating after a workout. He has demonstrated cooking techniques and played with a tiny, fluffy dog, a gift from his daughter. He invites his viewers into a world of luxury and offers them a mix of secrets, gossip and insider knowledge.Wang Qishan, Guo has claimed, is hiding the money he secretly earned in the Hainan-based conglomerate HNA Group, a company with an estimated $35 billion worth of investments in the United States. (HNA Group denies any ties to Wang and is suing Guo.) He accused Wang of carrying on an affair with the actress Fan Bingbing. (Fan is reportedly suing Guo for defamation.) He told stories of petty arguments among officials and claimed that Chinese officials sabotaged Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing, in order to cover up an organ-harvesting scheme. Most of Guo\u2019s accusations have proved nearly impossible to verify.\u201cThis guy is just covered in question marks,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna who specializes in Chinese governance.The questions that cover Guo have posed a problem for both the United States government and the Western journalists who, in trying to write about him, have found themselves buffeted by the currents of propaganda, misinformation and the tight-lipped code of the C.P.C. elite. His claims have also divided a group of exiled dissidents and democracy activists \u2014 people who might seem like Guo\u2019s natural allies. For the most part, the democracy activists who flee China have been chased from their country for protesting the government or promoting human rights, not because of corruption charges. They tell stories of personal persecution, not insider tales of bribery, sex and money. And perhaps as a consequence, few exiled activists command as large an audience as Guo. \u201cI will believe him,\u201d Ha Jin said, \u201cuntil one of his serious accusations is proved to be false.\u201dDespite Guo\u2019s high-powered supporters and his army of online followers, one important mark of believability has continued to elude him. Western news organizations have struggled to find evidence that would corroborate Guo\u2019s claims. When his claims appear in print, they are carefully hedged \u2014 delivered with none of his signature charm and bombast. \u201cWhy do you need more evidence?\u201d Guo complained in his apartment. \u201cI can give them evidence, no problem. But while they\u2019re out spending time investigating, I\u2019m waiting around to get killed!\u201dThe story continues into Guo\u2019s pre-teenage years, when he moved back to his hometown in Shandong Province. He met his wife and married her when he was only 15, she 14. They moved to Heilongjiang, where they started a small manufacturing operation, taking advantage of the early days of China\u2019s economic rise, and then to Henan. Guo got his start in real estate in a city called Zhengzhou, where he founded the Zhengzhou Yuda Property Company and built the tallest building the city had seen so far, the Yuda International Trade Center. According to Guo, he was only 25 when he made this first deal.The string of businesses and properties that Guo developed provide some of the confirmable scaffolding of his life. No one disputes that Guo went on to start both the Beijing Morgan Investment Company and Beijing Zenith Holdings. Morgan Investment was responsible for building a cluster of office towers called the Pangu Plaza, the tallest of which has a wavy top that loosely resembles a dragon, or perhaps a precarious cone of soft-serve ice cream. Guo is in agreement with the Chinese media that in buying the property for Pangu Plaza, he clashed with the deputy mayor of Beijing. The dispute ended when Guo turned in a lengthy sex tape capturing the deputy mayor in bed with his mistress.Following the construction of Pangu Plaza in Beijing, Guo\u2019s life story becomes increasingly hard to parse. He started a securities business with a man named Li You. After a falling-out, Li was detained by the authorities. Guo\u2019s company accused Li and his company of insider trading. According to the 2015 article in Caixin, Li then penned a letter to the authorities accusing Guo of \u201cwrongdoing.\u201dAs this dispute was going on, China\u2019s anti-\u200bcorruption operation was building a case against Ma Jian. In Guo\u2019s telling, Ma had long been rumored to be collecting intelligence on China\u2019s leaders. As the anti-corruption campaign gained speed and officials like Wang Qishan gained power, Ma\u2019s well of intelligence started to look like a threat. It was Guo\u2019s relationship with Ma, the tycoon maintains, that made officials nervous. Ma was detained by the authorities in January 2015, shortly after Guo fled the country. Soon after Ma\u2019s detention, accounts began appearing in China\u2019s state-run media claiming that Ma had six Beijing villas, six mistresses and at least two illegitimate sons. In a 2015 article that ran in the party-run newspaper The China Daily, the writer added another detail: \u201cThe investigation also found that Ma had acted as an umbrella for the business ventures of Guo Wengui, a tycoon from Henan Province.\u201dIn the mix of spies, corrupt business dealings, mistresses and sex scandals, Guo has one more unbelievable story to tell about his past. It is one reason, he says, that he was mentally prepared to confront the leaders of the Communist Party. It happened nearly 29 years ago, in the aftermath of the crackdown on Tiananmen Square. According to Guo, he had donated money to the students protesting in the square, and so a group of local police officers came to find him at his home. An overzealous officer fired off a shot at Guo\u2019s wife \u2014 at which point Guo\u2019s younger brother jumped in front of the bullet, suffering a fatal wound. \u201cThat was when I started my plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your brother had been killed in front of your eyes, would you just forget it?\u201d Never mind the fact that it would take 28 years for him to take any public stand against the party that caused his brother\u2019s death. Never mind that the leadership had changed. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everyone in the Communist Party is bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system is bad. So what I need to oppose is the system.\u201dThe revelers decided to hold the event in the park partly for the available grills but also partly because the square in front of Guo\u2019s penthouse had turned dangerous. A few weeks earlier, some older women had been out supporting Guo when a group of Chinese men holding flags and banners showed up. At one point, the men wrapped the women in a protest banner and hit them. The park was a safer option. And the protesters had learned from Guo \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a live audience they were hoping for. The group would be filming the protest and posting it on social media. Halfway through, Guo would call in on someone\u2019s cellphone, and the crowd would cheer.Despite this show of support, Guo\u2019s claims have divided China\u2019s exiled dissidents to such an extent that on a single day near the end of September, two dueling meetings of pro-democracy activists were held in New York, one supporting Guo, the other casting doubt on his motivations. (\u201cThey are jealous of me,\u201d Guo said of his detractors. \u201cThey think: Why is he so handsome? Why are so many people listening to him?\u201d) Some of Guo\u2019s claims are verifiably untrue \u2014 he claimed in an interview with Vice that he paid $82 million for his apartment \u2014 and others seem comically aggrandized. (Guo says he never wears the same pair of underwear twice.) But the repercussions he is facing are real.In December, Guo\u2019s brother was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for destroying accounting records. The lawsuits filed against Guo for defamation are piling up, and Guo has claimed to be amassing a \u201cwar chest\u201d of $150 million to cover his legal expenses. In September, a new set of claims against Guo were made in a 49-page document circulated by a former business rival. For Ha Jin, Guo\u2019s significance runs deeper than his soap-opera tales of scandal and corruption. \u201cThe grand propaganda scheme is to suppress and control all the voices,\u201d Jin said. \u201cNow everybody knows that you can create your own voice. You can have your own show. That fact alone is historical.\u201d In the future, Jin predicts, there will be more rebels like Guo. \u201cThere is something very primitive about this, realizing that this is a man, a regular citizen who can confront state power.\u201dHo Pin, the founder of Long Island\u2019s Mingjing News, echoed Jin. Mingjing\u2019s reporters felt that covering Guo was imperative, no matter the haziness of the information. \u201cIn China, the political elite that Guo was attacking had platforms of their own,\u201d Ho said. \u201cThey have the opportunity, the power and the ability to use all the government\u2019s apparatus to refute and oppose Guo Wengui. So our most important job is to allow Guo Wengui\u2019s insider knowledge reach the fair, open-minded people in China.\u201d Still, people like Pei urge caution when dealing with Guo\u2019s claims. Even Guo\u2019s escape raises questions. Few others have slipped through the net of China\u2019s anti-corruption drive. \u201cHow could he get so lucky?\u201d Pei asked. \u201cHe must have been tipped off long before.\u201dAt the barbecue, a supporter named Ye Rong tucked one of his children under his arm and acknowledged that Guo\u2019s past life is riddled with holes. There was always the possibility that Guo used to be a thug, but Ye didn\u2019t think it mattered. The rules of the conflict had been set by the Communist Party. \u201cYou need all kinds of people to oppose the Chinese government,\u201d Ye said. \u201cWe need intellectuals; we also need thugs.\u201dGuo, of course, has his own opinions about his legacy. He warned of dark times for Americans and for the world, if he doesn\u2019t succeed in his mission to change China. \u201cI am trying to help,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am not joking with you.\u201d He continued: \u201cI will change China within the next three years. If I don\u2019t change it, I won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the name of the province where the Chinese government hired online commenters in 2004. It is Hunan Province, not Henan.Advertisement"}

And aside from the health consequences, if we\u2019re head down, our communication skills and manners are slumped, too. But, ironically, that might not be how most of us see ourselves.Ms. Way studies technology\u2019s role in shaping adolescent development. These head-down interactions take us away from the present, no matter what group we\u2019re in, she said. And it\u2019s not just a youth problem. It\u2019s ingrained, learned, copied and repeated, much of it from mimicking adults. When kids see their parents head down, they emulate that action. The result is a loss of nonverbal cues, which can stunt development.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening more and more is we\u2019re not talking to our children,\u201d Ms. Way said. \u201cWe put them in front of the tech when they\u2019re young, and when we\u2019re older, we\u2019re absorbed in our own tech.\u201dYou\u2019ve seen it: Think of how some parents deal with screaming toddlers. \u201cHere kid, take this iPhone and go to town,\u201d according to Ms. Way \u2014 not, \u201cLet\u2019s talk this out, what seems to be the problem, son?\u2019\u201dShe added: \u201cWe think, \u2018Somehow my kids will know what\u2019s a good and bad interaction, they\u2019ll have empathy.\u2019 But when I go upstairs into my son\u2019s room and seven teens are all looking at their phones, none of them saying a word, there\u2019s all sorts of disengagement happening. It\u2019s not Facebook that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s how we\u2019re using Facebook.\u201d\u201cIt literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201dDigital detoxes have never been so popular, but they\u2019re no cure-all, and realistically, there simply isn\u2019t a black-and-white fix.\u201cActual human beings, in the flesh, take precedence,\u201d Ms. Martin chided. \u201cTo ignore people you\u2019re with is rude, whether you ignore them for virtual friends or distant friends by snubbing them.\u201dIt sounds so obvious it almost borders on stupid. But like Dr. Turkle\u2019s hope of building dialogue, not denigrating the digerati, it\u2019s an obvious dialogue we\u2019re not having enough of.\u201cTo treat the person standing in front of you as secondary to your phone, is usually, as the kids say, a micro-aggression,\u201d he said.Young or old, we\u2019re all a generation of literal test cases. Etiquette, manners, body language, the way we respond, interact and even look is changing. We\u2019re missing a whole life happening a mere 90 degrees above our smartphones. Start looking up.\u201cNever be the first person in the group to whip out his phone,\u201d Mr. Alford said. \u201cDon\u2019t be Patient Zero.\u201dCorrection 1/30/2018: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of car accidents attributed to the use of smartphones. About one quarter of car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and talking on the phone while driving, not solely by texting.Advertisement"}

Perhaps, the setting was \u2018back in time\u2019 on the Mississippi River. It was obviously a metaphor about leaving painful, stressful things behind for a more tranquil and meaningful life. Far from a story about killing people for money.\u201dNow, instead of a mythical river, it\u2019s just the Mystic, and instead of the song\u2019s riverboat queen, it\u2019s just warehouse space \u2014 and vans, lots of people unloading vans.For the incoherent, visually chaotic climax, Mary winds up flooring her expensive coupe into the men shooting at \u2014 but somehow missing \u2014 her. The camera can barely keep up with the bodies and the debris hurtling toward it. Some of that debris doesn\u2019t even seem real. The bullet holes might give the worst performance in the movie.There\u2019s nothing legally wrong going on here, though. Screen Gems, the Sony imprint that produced and released the movie, paid for use of the song, whose rights don\u2019t belong to Mr. Fogerty. But the incompetence really is something. Or maybe it\u2019s the obviousness. Maybe it\u2019s the inevitability. The whole movie seems to exist just for this sequence. Even if I\u2019d paid just to see Ms. Henson mow down gangs of goons (and I probably did pay only for that), I didn\u2019t get my money\u2019s worth. It\u2019s like I bought a can that said \u201cpeaches,\u201d got peaches in the can, but the can was rusty, so the peaches were, too.Now, I know what somebody involved with this movie was thinking. The screenplay seems as if it\u2019s been kicking around for who knows how long (Pam Grier could have done this in 1973, title and all), and maybe it used to be called something else. But it\u2019s \u201cProud Mary\u201d now, and Mary is a black woman \u2014 and when was the last time a black woman, who isn\u2019t Halle Berry, carried any movie by herself, let alone one in which she keeps an arsenal hidden in her walk-in closet, not far from her wigs, one that lets her do the old shoot-and-slide along a warehouse floor? This really is a kind of momentous occasion, and for that you need a momentous song, and \u201cProud Mary\u201d more than satisfies the occasion. Every time I hear Ms. Turner spit out the word \u201cleft\u201d or sing \u201cburnin\u2019\u201d or \u201call right!,\u201d I want to fight to ensure voting rights.

{"Headline": "Woes Deepen for New York G.O.P. as Best Hope to Challenge Cuomo Bows Out", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican prospects to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in November just grew exponentially more daunting, with Harry Wilson\u2019s decision this week to forgo his bid \u2014 leaving party strategists downcast, frustrated and scrambling.Mr. Wilson, a businessman who unsuccessfully ran for state comptroller in 2010, was widely seen as the Republicans\u2019 top recruit, and he had seriously looked at the governor\u2019s race for months.He registered the site www.wilsonforgovernor.com in May 2017. He told Republican officials that he would invest $10 million of his own fortune into his campaign. He repeatedly pinged New York and national strategists about his pathway, including traveling to gatherings like the Republican Governors Association.But he officially pulled the plug in a New Year\u2019s Day Facebook post, citing his commitment to his family.\u201cEveryone was really hoping for Harry Wilson,\u201d said Andrea Catsimatidis, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party. \u201cWe thought he would be great.\u201dNow New York Republicans are headed into the midterm elections, saddled by a president who is deeply unpopular in this heavily Democratic state and without a clear leader of their own for the top of the ticket. Whoever does run faces the financial might of Mr. Cuomo, who had banked more than $25 million for his run as of mid-2017 and is expected to report having millions of dollars more in the coming weeks.\u201cBecause Harry was able to come to the table with his own personal financial commitment, we all kind of held in place wondering whether he\u2019d get in or out,\u201d said Marcus Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is also considering a Republican bid for governor. Just to match Mr. Cuomo\u2019s treasury from six months ago, any Republican would need to raise more than $550,000 every week between now and November.In a dozen interviews, Republican operatives and officials expressed a fresh urgency at their predicament. The state\u2019s Republican congressional delegation is in the cross hairs of national Democrats hoping to win back the House, especially following the passage of a new tax law that punishes high-tax states like New York. And the party\u2019s current lone foothold on power in Albany, their control of the State Senate bolstered by fragile alliances with renegade Democrats, is also imperiled this fall.Over sodas and sandwiches, more than a dozen of New York\u2019s top Republican political strategists gathered last month, convened by Ms. Catsimatidis, to plot a path back for the party.On a whiteboard, they brainstormed together a list of ideal characteristics for a statewide Republican candidate, among them: resources (i.e. having money or the ability to raise vast sums), being a woman, being a political outsider, speaking Spanish and having a political base in downstate New York.The problem? The current crop of Republicans check off almost none of those boxes.In addition to the messaging challenge of ousting a two-term governor for a political insider, Mr. Cuomo has proved adept at locking up campaign cash from institutional Albany, the same donors those challengers would likely have to rely upon.\u201cYou can\u2019t take the fight to Albany if you\u2019re from Albany,\u201d said one of the Republican operatives who attended, who spoke anonymously to not disparage the eventual nominee because so many of the current candidates are linked to Albany.Some have urged Chele Chiavacci Farley, a finance chairwoman for the New York Republican Party, to challenge Mr. Cuomo. Ms. Farley is currently laying the groundwork to run against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand this year, and has begun assembling a campaign team, including John Brabender, a former adviser to the presidential candidate Rick Santorum, and the pollster John McLaughlin.But Ms. Farley has told people she is set on a Senate bid.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that hard-working taxpayers are fed up with Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s obstruction, political grandstanding, and ineffectiveness,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn the next few weeks, I will be making an official announcement about my intentions.\u201dRepublican county party leaders are set to gather in Albany on Monday to plot their next steps; two days later, in Manhattan, the same strategists that met last month are scheduled to reconvene.For now, the Republican political strategy seems to be mostly hoping that Mr. Cuomo, riding high in polls, self-destructs: that the transit woes of New York City\u2019s subways worsen; that the upcoming corruption trial of one of his former top aides, Joseph Percoco, tarnishes his image; that the state budget falls out of whack; that Democrats challenge and wound him from the left in a primary; and that the third term curse proves an actual curse.Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York Democratic Party, rattled off Mr. Cuomo\u2019s accomplishments, including gun control, infrastructure investment and managing the budget for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strong position.\u201cThat\u2019s a hard record to run against, and these would-be candidates know it,\u201d Mr. Berman said. \u201cNew Yorkers aren\u2019t stupid. They know a good thing when they see one and are not going to be fooled by the empty rhetoric of extreme conservatives, no matter how well-funded or rich they may be.\u201dEd Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said the governor\u2019s race would be an \u201canybody but Cuomo\u201d campaign, just like the one that felled Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994. Except now Republicans are expected to battle Trump headwinds; in 1994, they were riding an anti-Clinton wave.\u201cThe Bills are in the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, so I always remain hopeful that we can win statewide,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a Buffalo-based Republican strategist who previously ran communications for House Republican campaigns nationally.But in New York, she said, Republicans are inured to a weak top of the ticket.\u201cIt\u2019s just a benefit that we haven\u2019t enjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be awesome, but \u2026\u201dHer voice trailed off, and she didn\u2019t finish the sentence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wall of Love Outside a Jail", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaria stood outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, on a recent evening, looking up. The jail loomed above, a concrete bulwark more than a dozen stories high and lined in narrow windows. Behind one of them was her husband.Maria, who wished to be identified only by her first name because of her husband\u2019s notoriety, had been standing there for hours. She had flown in from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, for the weekend, only to learn she would not be allowed inside.The sun was going down and it was time to go; she had a flight to catch. But first, she went to her rental car and pulled out what looked like a rolled-up poster and some packing tape. \u201cA little message for my husband,\u201d said Maria, 33, in Spanish, walking over to a warehouse across the street from the jail.A section of the wall had been covered in signs. \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day Chris B.\u201d \u201cHappy Thanksgiving Luchie.\u201d \u201cI Love You Payroll.\u201d \u201cStay Strong Hubberz. We Got This.\u201d There were signs in Spanish, posters in Hebrew. Some were handwritten and covered in tape to protect them from the elements. Others were printed on durable plastic. They hung amid scraps of tape, deflated balloons and the tattered remnants of even older signs.Maria\u2019s sign said, in pink marker, \u201cTe amo, Gordo.\u201d \u201cI love you, Big Guy.\u201dBut inmates\u2019 families are also bound to the jail, where they pay weekly visits and gather to celebrate birthdays and holidays \u2014 and, lately, to post signs.The signs are clustered at one end of the low-slung warehouse that faces the detention center, on 29th Street. There is no formal system behind the effort, no Facebook group. Like Maria, who said she had noticed the signs during a previous visit, relatives see them and come back with their own. It\u2019s a gesture of last resort.A spokeswoman for Herman Quay, the jail\u2019s warden, said in an email that the jail was concerned about the posters only if they affected \u201cthe security or orderly running\u201d of the detention center, and that the jail \u201cencourages inmates to maintain family ties.\u201d Some jail personnel, who said they were not authorized to give their names, said that inmates were occasionally reprimanded for banging on their windows after spotting a family member posting a sign below.From his cell, Varick Winters, 26, who is in for drug-related offenses and violation of parole, could look out and see families arriving for visiting hours, posting signs and waving, he said through his mother, Leann Winters, who relayed questions by phone. Asked whether the message wall boosted morale, he said, \u201cIt makes you want to cooperate.\u201dIn most cases, inmates are allowed visitors on one day of the week. These visits can be whittled down to less than an hour, relatives say, because of the time-consuming process of entering the building, or they can be forbidden altogether depending on the inmate\u2019s risk factor or whether the jail is on lockdown.Relatives say the signs are a way to communicate when they can\u2019t visit, to show affection on a special day, and to defy a system that strictly limits personal touches: Mail is inspected, gifts must be ordered through a third-party vendor like Amazon, and in the visiting area, the only items that can be handed over are small bills and food from the vending machines.Another reason relatives post signs is that inmates not only can see them from above, but also can respond.\u201cHe\u2019s told me where he is,\u201d said Maria, pointing to the light. \u201cThat\u2019s why I know it\u2019s mine.\u201dThe Metropolitan Detention Center lies on a waterfront strip of Sunset Park known as Industry City. The area, once thoroughly industrial, has recently begun to transform as outlets, showrooms and start-ups open in redeveloped buildings. But around the jail, the view remains treeless and desolate.No one can say exactly when people began posting signs on the warehouse, but an image captured by Google Earth shows it was completely blank in 2013. A spokesman for Con Edison, which owns the warehouse, said that the signs were periodically removed and that the current batch would soon be taken down. In the meantime, the rain and the wind do much of the work.But new ones always appear.On a recent evening, Jeffrey, 17, and his brother Jason, 8, took the subway from the South Bronx to Sunset Park and walked to the jail. Jeffrey held Jason\u2019s hand as they crossed under the Gowanus Expressway toward the water\u2019s edge.The routine was familiar. The boys went into the jail to get the form they filled out before every visit, then joined visitors sitting in a glass-encased room outside to wait for their number to be called.They were there to see their father, who was detained on narcotics charges by the F.B.I. in the early hours of Jeffrey\u2019s birthday last February. Their mother was also arrested. She was released on a bond but could face deportation to Mexico. Because their mother was not allowed to visit their father, Jeffrey said he brought his three younger siblings to see him on his visiting day every week. They took turns.Last summer, Jeffrey made a sign for his father. \u201cHe asked the officer: \u2018May I have a chance to peek outside? Because my son put up a poster.\u2019 I put it right there with a picture of my mother and the four of us,\u201d he said, pointing to the warehouse.The poster said, as Jeffrey recalled, \u201cWe hope our father will be reunited again with our mother, his wife and his four children.\u201d It wasn\u2019t up for long; Jeffrey said he was told by a jail employee that the poster could be considered graffiti, so, after about two weeks, he took it down.By Christmas Day, Maria\u2019s sign had been smeared by the rain and snow and new ones had appeared. There was a poster wishing Misha a Merry Christmas and another that said Feliz Navidad. A Santa Claus decoration and some tinsel had been hung.As visiting hours began, a car pulled up, then another and another. Abraham Lebowitz had come from Monroe, N.Y. He had posted the signs in Hebrew earlier in the year, he said, \u201cfor a few people inside\u201d from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Satmar sect. They announced a religious celebration and the opening of a new building. \u201cJust to make a connection,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should see what is happening in the outside world.\u201dNot everyone\u2019s visiting day fell on Christmas, but some families had come anyway. In one car was the family that had posted the sign that said \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day, Chris B.\u201d months before. They had driven from East New York, Brooklyn. \u201cWe try to come as often as we can,\u201d said Khaiya Tucker, bundling her 2-year-old daughter Aubrey and holding her up so her grandfather could see her from his cell. She pointed to a blinking light on the third floor. \u201cLook, Bree-Bree, it\u2019s your G-Pops,\u201d she said.An icy wind swept in off the water, and down the street another family huddled beside their idling sport utility vehicle, holding up a bedsheet that said, in permanent marker, \u201cMerry Xmas We Love You Bebo.\u201d They had come from Queens to send a message to Victor, 30, who they said was arrested on drug-related charges about five months ago.\u201cI\u2019m here because I miss him,\u201d said his mother, who gave only her first name, Sonia, holding the sheet as it twisted and flapped in the wind. \u201cI want him to know I love him.\u201dUpstairs, a cell lit up.\u201cHis light went on. I saw it!\u201d she said.The family waved and blew kisses as the lights flicked on and off. Victor\u2019s father, Victor Sr., began to weep.Visitors rushed past, hunkered down. The puddles on the street had turned to ice. But Victor\u2019s family stayed outside, stomping against the cold, laughing, looking up. As long as that light was there, it was hard to leave.Finally, they got in the car, and Sonia\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Victor, calling from a shared jail phone. \u201cI just happened to look outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see anybody there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians Brave Icy Temperatures to Protest Putin and Election", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Protesters across Russia braved icy temperatures on Sunday to demonstrate against the lack of choice in the March election that is virtually certain to see President Vladimir V. Putin chosen for a fourth term.\u201cWhat we are being offered right now are not elections, and we must not participate in them,\u201d Yevgeny Roizman, the mayor of the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg and a rare elected official from an opposition party, told a crowd of hundreds that had gathered in protest.Attacking the government as thieves, he said: \u201cHow many more years will you keep getting a lower salary than you are due? For how many more years will your business receive less revenue than it is due?\u201dMr. Navalny was detained before he reached the several thousand demonstrators gathered in Pushkin Square in central Moscow and other main avenues closer to the Kremlin. Video footage showed police officers, who over all were far more restrained than during previous demonstrations, tackling him and dragging him onto a bus.The boisterous crowd in Pushkin Square chanted slogans including, \u201cThese are not elections!\u201d and \u201cDown with the czar!\u201dMr. Navalny organized anticorruption protests across Russia in March and June, mobilizing middle-class youths in particular, and his campaign has vowed to organize repeated protests before the March 18 election to underscore that the vote is a fraud, with the Kremlin manipulating the entire process.The numbers on Sunday were smaller than previous protests, not least because an election boycott is a less-galvanizing issue than corruption.\u201cPeople did not come out for an unsanctioned event,\u201d Marat Guelman, a leading cultural figure, wrote on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s a defeat. Moscow does not want tensions.\u201dBut even those who despaired of change thought that showing up mattered.\u201cThe boycott won\u2019t likely change anything, but there are two different factors that work against Putin,\u201d said Sergei Zhilkin, 32, a mathematician and IT engineer. \u201cFirst, he gets older and is increasingly detached from what modern life is like; second, the new generation becomes more and more active in the society.\u201dMr. Putin, 65, has refused to even say Mr. Navalny\u2019s name, warning that protest movements would only bring chaos to Russia.The demonstrations were generally peaceful, with some 240 protesters detained nationwide, according to OVD-Info, an independent organization that tracks arrests. In the far eastern part of the country and in Siberia, crowds gathered despite frigid temperatures, with Yakutsk approaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 45 degrees Celsius).Numerous provincial cities granted permits, although the protests were often shunted to remote locations.Kazan was typical. The city offered organizers the parking lot of a garbage processing plant in an industrial district 30 miles north of the city, then erected a 10-foot wall of snow with bulldozers so that no passing cars could see the protesters.Not to be deterred, a number of the roughly 600 demonstrators clambered atop the barricade to wave their protest signs despite the biting wind.\u201cI\u2019m 23, and Putin\u2019s been in power 18 years, practically my whole life,\u201d said Grigory Bochkarev, an IT specialist. He was not there so much to support Mr. Navalny, he said, but for freedom of choice.\u201cI pay taxes, and my money goes toward corruption \u2014 not toward new roads or my relatives\u2019 welfare, but for expensive cars for officials,\u201d he added.Another man, who identified himself only as Khaliulla, 79, said he had spent his whole life sacrificing in order to build socialism and now he could barely survive on his pension, forced to choose between rent and medication. \u201cI thought my retirement would be decent,\u201d he said.He also objected to the forced location of the gathering at a garbage plant. \u201cWhat are we: trash or something?\u201d he said.In Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s two largest cities, law enforcement officials had warned that they would crack down on illegal gatherings. About 2,000 people demonstrated in St. Petersburg, according to the local news website Fontanka.ru.Mr. Navalny\u2019s call for a boycott puts him on one side of a dispute among the opposition about whether exercising the right to vote, however futile, might be preferable.\u201cRussia has matured to the stage for elections to take place not as a production with Putin seeking pseudo-opponents and everyone goes out and performs,\u201d Vladimir Milov, an opposition figure supporting the boycott, said during a debate on the Echo of Moscow radio station.Maksim Kats, another opposition politician from one of Moscow\u2019s district councils, countered that voting was crucial, even if the outcome was precooked.\u201cI think that the most appropriate means is to vote for the candidate that suits you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even if not, then at least spoil the ballot. And vote against Putin.\u201dEven among the protesters, there was some support for this position, with one man yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t support the boycott! You will be helping Putin if you do!\u201dHe has ruled Russia since 2000, governing as president for all but a four-year stretch, when term limits forced him to serve one term as prime minister. A fourth presidential term \u2014 lasting for six years until 2024 \u2014 would make him the longest-serving leader since Stalin.Matthew Luxmoore contributed reporting from Kazan, Russia, and Sophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s All Downhill in Chechnya, This Time at a Ski Resort", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVeduchi JournalVEDUCHI, Russia \u2014 Sporting a camouflage ski suit, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, pulled a gigantic ceremonial lever to start this once war-wrecked region\u2019s first ski lift. \u201cGod is great!\u201d some spectators yelled as the machine whirred to life.High in the Caucasus Mountains, a ski resort is rising on slopes that once teemed with Islamist militants. The Veduchi resort, which takes its name from the local village, is a multimillion-dollar development featuring a hotel and spa center, chalets and a helicopter pad. It is the centerpiece of an improbable effort for Russia to ski and snowboard its way out of a long-simmering insurgency.A state-owned company, North Caucasus Resorts, is building a string of ski resorts in the restive, predominantly Muslim areas of the Caucasus. Three have opened so far, the most recent here in the Argun Gorge of Chechnya.The intention is to create jobs, though even the developer conceded that it might be difficult to convince winter sports enthusiasts of the merits of Chechnya, where Russia brutally repressed an Islamist insurgency and where thousands of militants may be returning from Syria after fighting for the Islamic State.\u201cI am confident it will become popular not only with the Russian population but also with foreign countries,\u201d Mr. Kadyrov said at the opening this week.Ruslan Timukayev, a spokesman for the regional government, said the region had seen an uptick in tourism as \u201cChechnya became a brand.\u201d About 100,000 tourists came to Chechnya last year, he said, adding with a shrug, \u201cSome people like extremes.\u201dAbout $35 million has been invested so far in the ski resort, which is expected to cost $500 million when completed. The plans call for 19 ski lifts and 28 miles of trails fanning out over a serene alpine valley though the resort opened with only one modest, half-mile lift, serving just one trail.After pulling the lever to start the lift, Mr. Kadyrov, who does not ski, hopped on for a ride. The lift stalled briefly, leaving him dangling for a few moments before jerking back into motion.Professional skiers flown in from St. Petersburg zigzagged down the slope for the television cameras, and local children were offered free lessons.\u201cHow is a ski resort going to solve all that?\u201d Tanya Lokshina, the Russia director of Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHow is it going to solve the problem of a state within a state, where lawlessness and abuses are the norm?\u201dMore recently, rights groups have expressed alarm at what they see as a cruel and capricious response from Mr. Kadyrov to the cancellation last month of his Facebook and Instagram accounts.While talk like that might scare foreign tour operators and other visitors from traveling to Veduchi, it seems to have had little effect on the main market: Russians.While conceding that many impressions of Chechnya start with a \u201cnegative background,\u201d Khasan Timizhev, the director of North Caucasus Resorts, said market research had shown that Russian skiers were more concerned about the condition and safety of the slopes rather than lawlessness or terrorist attacks.Whatever doubts outsiders might harbor about Chechnya, the few who turned out from nearby villages were more enthusiastic, saying the only other living to be made was in sheep herding.\u201cWe think the Chinese will come,\u201d said Albert Rabuyev, principal of the Itum-Kale village middle school, gazing at the chairs of the new lift gliding up and down the mountain.Mr. Rabuyev said he would even welcome gay men, because as visitors they would \u201crent rooms, rent skis and then leave.\u201dIsa Abkarom, a vendor at a stand selling cups and other collectibles, said the long-promised resort came as good news for Chechnya. \u201cEverybody was just waiting for normal life to return,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are happy to see the last of the war.\u201dThe vision of ski resorts as pacification tools sprang from preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The North Caucasus insurgency had raged over mountain territory, and so winter sports were a logical postwar development goal, officials said. Two additional resorts are planned by 2025, one in Ingushetia and the other in Dagestan.The two other resorts opened last season in neighboring regions reported 383,000 skiers combined. Crisp, sunny mountain weather draws visitors to the resorts, said Ekaterina Zhigalo, a spokeswoman for North Caucasus Resorts. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good climate for health.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Literary South Is in Mourning", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySewanee, on top of Monteagle Mountain not far from Chattanooga, is barely a pinprick on the map \u2014 less a town than a crossroads where the gas station doubles as the local grocery store. It is also the home of the University of the South, a liberal-arts college tucked into 13,000 acres on the southern end of the Cumberland Plateau. Thanks to a bequest from the playwright Tennessee Williams, Sewanee occupies an outsize place in the Southern literary landscape.Three years ago I arrived \u201con the mountain,\u201d as they say around here, for my first weekend at Rivendell. I have a graduate degree in creative writing and spent a dozen years making my living as a writer, but by the time I got to Rivendell I was working as an editor and had written hardly a word of my own in years. I was exhausted by caregiving \u2014 by raising children and simultaneously tending needy elders \u2014 and I longed for an uninterrupted chance to read and write and walk in the woods.I\u2019ve come to think of Rivendell as my spiritual home, and of Carmen Toussaint, Rivendell\u2019s executive director, as a kind of literary midwife. Toussaint\u2019s preternatural calm and kindness make it possible to move past the anxiety and despair endemic to writers, and her gift for unintrusive organization is the invisible scaffolding that has kept the place running and made it possible for writers to settle in and write.As news that the Rivendell campus would soon become a \u201ccenter for spiritual healing and exploration\u201d made its way across the literary South, authors took to email and social media to mourn its loss. \u201cRivendell is already a spiritual healing and exploration center,\u201d wrote Karen Hayes, co-owner (with the novelist Ann Patchett) of Parnassus Books in Nashville, on Facebook. \u201cThat is the power of the written word, whether it is through the creation of a work of literature, or the reading of it.\u201d\u201cAuthors typically thank people and institutions at the rear of a book,\u201d John T. Edge, founder of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said in a phone call. \u201cFor \u2018The Potlikker Papers,\u2019 I thanked Rivendell at the front. It mattered that much.\u201dUnlike storied writers\u2019 colonies like Yaddo and MacDowell, Rivendell has always welcomed writers at the start of their careers, with young poets and short-story writers sharing space with best-selling novelists and established nonfiction authors. \u201cI was 24 hours into a stay at Rivendell when I finally worked out the arc of my book,\u201d the essayist Mary Laura Philpott wrote in an email. \u201cMaybe it seems silly to think it took sitting in a silent house in the middle of nowhere for that to happen, but that\u2019s the gift Rivendell gave me.\u201dIn a painful irony of timing, Ms. Philpott sold her first essay collection three days before Rivendell announced it was closing.In fact, the benefactor who founded and has been underwriting Rivendell\u2019s literary mission has simply changed her mind. She has every right to do that, of course. It\u2019s her property and her money.There\u2019s a reason Tennessee Williams left his estate to a college and not to a human being, even a visionary human being. Here\u2019s hoping Sewanee \u2014 or another institution unwavering in its commitment to literature \u2014 can step up to recreate this necessary incubator for the literary arts on a mountain in Tennessee.Advertisement"}

In 2017, that number skyrocketed to 117.Others are responsible, too, though. In the last five years, premium cable has seen 45 percent growth in the number of original programs and basic cable networks a 40 percent rise, and even the broadcast networks have grown by 29 percent, according to FX. This doesn\u2019t even include the large number of non-scripted reality or documentary series.Even lesser-known shows are plugging along. \u201cFuller House,\u201d a Netflix revival of the old ABC family sitcom, released its third season, to little fanfare, last year.\u201cSomeone will tweet me, and they will be, like, \u2018I watched all four seasons in two days,\u2019\u201d the Australian comedian Josh Thomas said last year about his show, \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d \u201cThat took me five years to fill that two days,\u201d he added, with an expletive for emphasis.Still, the freewheeling spending of the streaming services has prompted more networks to spend more than they usually would. (A respectable drama costs at least $3 million an episode to make.) It is not clear just how many players will be able to sustain that pace.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the streaming services are putting an enormous amount of pressure on the business model,\u201d John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, said at a news media event on Friday.But cancellations have done little to stop the glut of programming.With all of this content, there remain three players that make what are perceived to be the best TV shows, at least in the past year.FX, HBO and Netflix accounted for 55 percent of the shows on critics\u2019 best-of-2017 lists, according to FX. Netflix had 24 percent, HBO 21 percent and FX 10 percent. The rest were distributed by dozens of other TV networks, like NBC, Showtime, Hulu and AMC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Braces for Opening of Film That Has Hindu Extremists Enraged", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Police forces across India have reinforced security for the Thursday opening of a contentious film that has prompted hundreds of women to threaten mass suicide and other people to threaten murder.Extremist Hindu groups have whipped up crowds against the film, claiming that it distorts history and disrespects their legendary queen.They have all kinds of complaints: Padmavati\u2019s clothes are too skimpy; a dream sequence between her and the Muslim invader is inappropriate; the story has been twisted and Padmavati\u2019s heroism has been cheapened.Protests are already erupting in many places and rowdy mobs have vandalized movie theaters, tollbooths, road dividers, buses and cars.Indian intellectuals watching the hysteria have been perplexed by two issues.First, few people have actually seen the film. The most strident protesters admit that they have not watched \u201cPadmaavat\u201d and that their objections rely on hearsay. The source of the rumors is unclear. The filmmakers have been careful about leaks of advance copies.Second, Queen Padmavati might never have existed. Although Alauddin Khilji, the leader of the Muslim invasion depicted in the film, and the Hindu king at the time, Ratnasimha, known as Ratan Sen in the film, were historical figures of the 14th century, several scholars said they could find no mentions of Queen Padmavati in sources from that era.\u201cWe are living in strange times,\u201d said Manish Tewari, an official with India\u2019s leading opposition party, the Indian National Congress, who supported the release of the film.The Indian police services are taking no chances, busing reinforcements into place on Wednesday.\u201cWe have geared up our local intelligence machinery,\u201d said Anand Kumar, a police chief in Lucknow, in northern India. \u201cWe have also told them to deploy policemen at sensitive points. We have asked the cinema owners also to deploy their own private security.\u201dBut many cinema owners are refusing to show it. They are frightened for their own safety, they say.This is especially true in Gujarat and Rajasthan, two states in northern India with large populations from the Rajput caste, historically associated with warriors. The Padmavati legend, rooted in a poem written in the 16th century, is set in a Rajput kingdom. The first \u2014 and loudest \u2014 voices against the film have been Rajputs.The chief ministers of several states controlled by India\u2019s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, tried to block the film\u2019s release, on the grounds it could stir violence. But India\u2019s Supreme Court last week overturned all bans and ordered the film\u2019s release.Earlier this week, a Hindu extremist with hundreds of thousands of Facebook followers threatened to kill himself on Facebook Live if the film was released \u2014 but first he wanted to see how much money it made.The group of 300 women threatening mass suicide said they were still awaiting a response from the government \u2014 and ready to take their own lives.News about the film has dominated television coverage and the front pages of the biggest publications. Some schools said they would be closed on Thursday over fears of violence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Fancy Chefs Excel at Fast, Cheap Food? Two Case Studies", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review8 PhotosSuccessful fast food restaurants have to be clean, efficient and consistent. As far as I can tell, though, it\u2019s never been necessary for the people who run them to care about food. How would you even tell? It would be like watching a porn film to assess the work of the dialect coach.If you tasted the fusilli with pesto, say, or the fettuccine Alfredo, and didn\u2019t know Mr. Ladner\u2019s history, you probably wouldn\u2019t guess that it had been made by one of the city\u2019s greatest pasta cooks. But you\u2019d be able to tell in a second that it was made by somebody who cared about food.The texture is the first thing most cheap pasta places screw up. Pasta Flyer doesn\u2019t screw it up. The noodles are firm and chewy, with a happy little bounce. Partly this is because they\u2019re not overcooked, but Mr. Ladner is also buying excellent dry pasta from Italy. It\u2019s similar to the imported stuff I like to buy when I cook at home, which costs almost as much by the pound as a bowl does at Pasta Flyer. The rigatoni is made with whole grain and the penne is gluten free; they\u2019re both as supple and smooth as the three shapes made from semolina.The sauces \u2014 which can be matched with any pasta \u2014 are pesto, beef rag\u00f9, Alfredo and marinara, with or without meatballs. You might see that and say, \u201cAh, classics.\u201d Or you might say, \u201csounds kind of basic?\u201d, with a rising inflection signifying that \u201cbasic\u201d is not a compliment. Your response will mirror your attitude toward Pasta Flyer as a whole.I\u2019m in the classic group. The basil pesto looks a little too glossy, more pur\u00e9e than paste, but it has the advantage of insinuating itself all over the pasta (fusilli is the default shape) and it still tastes like aged cheese and toasted pine nuts. The marinara is lively on its own and an agreeable partner for the meatballs, which are of the fine-ground, spicy, sausagelike school.The rag\u00f9 is lovely, if a little pale and lean. The Alfredo sauce, sweetly dripping from the fettuccine like rain from a leaf, hit me like a prescription opiate that had been specifically engineered for my opiate receptors. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019d had fettuccine Alfredo.Those who expect ingenuity from Mr. Ladner should be happy with the garlic dots. Everybody should be happy with the garlic dots, little fried puffs of choux pastry brushed with garlic butter. Like the browned slices of lasagna that you can eat with your fingers, they\u2019re street-fair food from a more advanced civilization. A few small vegetable sides, like a sweet-and-sour fried cauliflower with golden raisins, can be had, along with crisp little chopped salads. That\u2019s about it. Dessert, in the form of tiramis\u00f9 cannoli, will shuffle onstage later this week.Once your pasta is sauced and you\u2019ve helped yourself to a fork, a napkin and a tray, you settle the tab \u2014 paying is the slowest part of the whole procedure \u2014 and look for a table. These were plentiful on my three visits, particularly at night. I learned to avoid the seats directly under the satellite dish that hangs from the ceiling and echoes conversations held under it, disconcertingly. It\u2019s an artifact of Mr. Ladner\u2019s fixation on flying saucers, also seen in the door-handle design and in the doctoring of a blown-up photograph of the Roman Forum that covers one wall.In other words, Pasta Flyer is not where you take somebody you need to impress. For some reason, this is how our culture defines success for chefs: by how well their food performs the task of being impressive to a date, an employer or a fan of restaurant dining.Mr. Ladner, though, is using his skill, knowledge and connections not to make special-occasion fireworks but to make ordinary food that many people can afford. Pasta Flyer isn\u2019t spectacular, but it\u2019s still a major achievement. I\u2019ve eaten a lot of supposedly cheap pasta, and it\u2019s never as good as what Mr. Ladner is serving.Do enough people in Greenwich Village want $8 rigatoni to make Pasta Flyer a success? In a way, the location would work better if it didn\u2019t have to bear the weight of being the only one in town. As a solitary prototype, the restaurant has an odd, expectant air, as if it\u2019s ready for a crowd that hasn\u2019t shown up.9 PhotosYou do save some time ordering and paying at Martina\u2019s counter, but speed isn\u2019t the real selling point. Martina\u2019s charm is that it is a neighborhood place where nothing is a big deal, but where attention has been paid to all the little deals.If the idea of fagioli al fiasco with pizza appeals to you, the ones at Martina are excellent, as are the arancini, cylindrical fritters of creamy rice cooked with tomatoes. The wine list is a thumbnail version of Marta\u2019s, but the few wines are good ones; as at Marta, you\u2019re encouraged to drink sparkling wine in full or half bottles, kept here in an open refrigerator case facing the dining room.The pizza is in the style of Roman neighborhood joints. The crusts are flat, extremely thin, pale and crisp, but not crunchy. They\u2019re softer than the ones at Marta, which snap like crackers. The crust is merely a vehicle; what interest these pies hold is entirely in their toppings. Covered with mushrooms, say, or pork sausage with broccoli rabe, or grated cheese and shaved brussels sprouts, they can be very good. But the simple margherita is a bore.For dessert, there\u2019s vanilla soft-serve, either over espresso or under simple toppings like olive oil, sea salt, candied hazelnuts or chocolate sauce. Simple as it is, it helps make Martina into a restaurant instead of a pit stop. (Mr. Ladner might take notes here.)Neither Martina nor Pasta Flyer is trying to be a thrill ride. But finding a quick, cheap meal that betrays signs of actual care can be a thrill of its own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Offers African Migrants a Choice: Ticket Out or Jail", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel is offering a stark choice to tens of thousands of African migrants in the country: Agree to leave voluntarily by the end of March, with a plane ticket and a grant of $3,500, or face possible incarceration.\u201cEvery country must guard its borders,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, announcing the plan. \u201cThe infiltrators have a clear choice \u2014 cooperate with us and leave voluntarily, respectably, humanely and legally, or we will have to use other tools at our disposal, which are also according to the law.\u201dMr. Netanyahu said a few months ago that Israel had reached understandings with African countries willing to absorb the migrants, but without identifying the countries. Based on testimonies of people who have already left, Israeli rights groups say the main destination appears to be Rwanda.\u201cThey are not being granted any status or work permits there, nor a safe haven,\u201d said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an Israeli nonprofit group that collected dozens of testimonies from those who left previously for Rwanda and for other countries including Uganda, some of whom later made it to Europe.About 60,000 migrants have surreptitiously crossed into Israel over the once-porous border with Egypt since 2005, most of them Sudanese or Eritreans who cannot be sent back home because of international conventions that prevent the repatriation of asylum seekers to home countries where they could face persecution.Israeli officials insist that most of the Africans were not fleeing persecution, but came as economic migrants looking for work.The process of seeking asylum in Israel is a slow one. Of nearly 14,000 asylum applications submitted by Eritrean and Sudanese migrants to the Israeli authorities over the last five years, only 10 people have been granted refugee status \u2014 eight from Eritrea and two from Sudan, according to Ms. Sadot and the United Nations refugee agency.The agency said another 200 Sudanese from Darfur had recently been granted humanitarian status in Israel. Thousands of asylum requests are pending. The Immigration Authority did not respond to a request for information.Anwar Suleiman Arbab, 38, left the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan in 2003 and went to Libya. After five years there, he tried to make it to Europe but failed. \u201cA friend told me Israel is a good place,\u201d he said in an interview.So in 2008 Mr. Arbab paid Bedouins to help him cross the border into Israel from Egypt. He was detained for five months and released, and then later detained again for 18 months in Holot. For the last two years he has been living in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, on a temporary visa, working in a small restaurant and studying English.Given a choice in 2014 of leaving for Africa or being detained in Holot, he chose Holot. He had applied for asylum a year earlier, he said, and has still not received an answer.He said that there was fear and concern among African migrants in Israel as new measures continued to be introduced, but that his answer had not changed.\u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cif it\u2019s between going back to Africa or to jail in Israel, I\u2019ll go to jail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Authorities Block Access to Social Media Tools", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As protests in Iran stretched into their sixth day on Tuesday, the Iranian authorities continued to restrict access to social media tools that have become key sources of information to antigovernment demonstrators.Telegram, a messaging app that is widely used in Iran, has been blocked since Dec. 31, while internet access has been sporadically cut off to several cities where protests have taken place, according to cybersecurity researchers monitoring internet activity in the country. Access to other social media platforms like Instagram has also been intermittent.Social media and messaging apps have become crucial to antigovernment demonstrators around the world, as a means of both organizing and delivering messages to other citizens. Not surprisingly, restricting access to such technology has become as important to government crackdowns as the physical presence of the police.Many social media tools \u2014 as well as a number of products that encrypt internet conversations \u2014 have long been unavailable in Iran. Twitter and Facebook have been banned since 2009, although many Iranians still find ways to use them. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, even opened a Facebook account. But messaging apps like Telegram, which claims some level of encryption, report wide usage in the country.\u201cThe Iranian government is active on Telegram, as is the president, and members of Parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cIranians use it to sell clothes or find doctors, she added. \u201cIn the last week it has become a key source of information about the protests.\u201dIn the past, some Iranians have found ways to get around government restrictions by using tools that evaded Iran\u2019s censorship technology. But economic sanctions imposed on the country have made access to some of those tools more difficult, said Collin Anderson, a cybersecurity researcher who planned to publish a report this week about Iran\u2019s capabilities.Take, for example, the Google App Engine, a service intended to be used as a platform for developing and hosting web applications. In countries where they are otherwise banned, messaging apps that encrypt conversations often use the Google App Engine to conceal their activity within Google\u2019s traffic.But Google believes that it is not allowed to offer its Google App Engine in Iran because of the sanctions. That makes it tough to offer Iranians apps like Signal, which is commonly used in other countries to protect internet communications from surveillance.\u201cGoogle has chosen to adhere to the strictest letter of the law regarding sanctions in Iran, and by doing so they are blocking Iranians from this service,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Google could be worried that technology would be used by nuclear scientists in a potential violation of sanctions. But \u201cthe reality is that the ban affects everyday Iranians\u2019 ability to use a tool that could keep them safe,\u201d he said.Mr. Anderson argued that Google could white list, or unblock, certain applications like Signal. In doing so, Google could allow the app to become widely available in Iran in a matter of hours.Google declined to comment on its policies regarding the use of its technology in Iran.Sanctions have also forced many Iranians to use smartphones and applications that have been jailbroken, a term used when a manufacturer\u2019s restrictions are removed to allow a user to install unauthorized software. But jailbroken phones and apps cannot be updated, leaving their users open to hackers and government monitors that take advantage of bugs in outdated software.\u201cIranians are tech-savvy but by using jailbroken phones they leave themselves really vulnerable,\u201d Ms. Dagres said.The communication crackdown prompted an online outcry that included President Trump, who posted on Twitter over the weekend that Iran had \u201cclosed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!\u201dMs. Dagres argued that tweets from officials in other countries do little, but allowing access to more communications tools would help protect protesters. As it is, she said, Iranians have proved to be resourceful in finding ways to communicate.\u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way,\u201d Ms. Dagres said. \u201cIranians have been living under sanctions for years, and they have always found a way to get online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Economic Woes Are Piercing Modi\u2019s Aura of Invulnerability", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat second leg is now looking a little shaky.Still, the economy here is far from failing. The stock market continues to soar, major rail, road and port projects are unfolding across the country, and foreign investors poured $25.4 billion into India from April to September, up 17 percent from the period in 2016.But it does not feel that way to the huge number of Indians negatively affected by Mr. Modi\u2019s policies, and the grumbles are growing. So are social tensions, especially those that divide Hindus from Muslims, and upper caste from lower caste. The fear is that Mr. Modi is already beginning to lean more heavily on that first leg of his, Hindu nationalism, now that his economic strategy is losing some of its sheen.Even in Gujarat, the state considered the strongest of Mr. Modi\u2019s strongholds, where people have been cheering his rise for the past 20 years and line up in dusty fields by the thousands just to catch a glimpse of his saffron scarf and groomed white beard, many feel betrayed.The output from the textile industry, a huge employer here and once a healthy exporter, has been cut nearly in half, prompting layoffs and despair.In many of the industrial areas, the happiest merchants are the merchants of scrap, who make their rounds in lurching trucks, scooping up looms, steel spools and other underused machinery for pennies on the dollar.The message was clear: Mr. Modi\u2019s party was still No. 1, but the man himself was no longer bulletproof.\u201cModi hurt our business, and we want to show him that we can hurt him, too,\u201d said Manish Patel, whose once clackety cloth factory is now completely empty, another Gujarati business that has gone under.Mr. Patel complained that under Mr. Modi, \u201cIt was like we were in first class and now we\u2019ve been put in 10th class.\u201dManish Patel and his older brother, Dilip, who run the family\u2019s cloth business, found themselves scurrying into line at the bank and waiting hours each day, trying to get money.It was never enough, and when the brothers could not pay their loom operators, many walked off. Hundreds of factories had the same problem. The Surat textile traders association said production in this area dropped to 25 million meters a day now from 40 million meters two years ago.It\u2019s hard to overstate how central cash is to Gujarat, and India in general. Most laborers, whether they operate looms, drive trucks, wash clothes or haul bricks, are paid in stacks of soft rupee notes, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s face on each one.Even large real estate deals, say for a home that costs the equivalent of $500,000 or $600,000, will be done partly in blocks of rupees, to keep profits off the books.This was what motivated Mr. Modi, who has made fighting corruption a big plank in his platform. He said that by making people turn in old bank notes, he would capture billions of rupees of so-called black money.It has never been made clear how much black money he actually captured, and perhaps he thought he could get away with the enormous disruption because India\u2019s economy had been doing so well. It expanded at more than 8 percent annually between 2005 and 2009 and more than 7 percent between 2010 and 2014.But his timing seems to have been bad.Unlike many of the other big economies that turn on exports \u2014 such as China\u2019s, Japan\u2019s or Germany\u2019s \u2014 India is not nearly as industrialized.India\u2019s economy remains substantially influenced by domestic rural demand. And back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015 ruined millions of farmers, slowing down overall growth.Then in July 2017, before people had a chance to recover from the currency chaos \u2014 which had also hampered consumption, because many Indians simply didn\u2019t have any spare cash in their pockets \u2014 Mr. Modi moved ahead on another front: the new goods and services tax, or G.S.T.It was the most sweeping tax overhaul India had ever tried, and probably overdue. But many economists and business people questioned Mr. Modi\u2019s timing on this as well.Business owners like the Patels, who had run their factory off a calculator and a paper pad, said they had no idea how to file.\u201cYou need a computer; you need to buy online time; you need to hire someone who knows how to do it,\u201d Manish Patel lamented. \u201cAll this costs money.\u201dMany small businesses began to suffer from something they did not understand.\u201cG.S.T., G.S.T., what is this G.S.T.?\u201d said Bharat Bhai Kavad, who works out of his house in Surat with his wife and daughter sewing lace on garments for a big textile company. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at first what this G.S.T. was, and now it\u2019s come from Delhi to Gujarat to Surat to my house.\u201dBecause the Kavad family\u2019s lace work is unregistered and informal \u2014 they get paid a few rupees for each lace they attach \u2014 they cannot produce the proper receipts bigger companies need to comply with new tax rules. The Kavads\u2019 earnings have been cut in half.This is one point that many people here make: The informal economy feeds the formal; the two are inextricably linked.\u201cThe informal sector is a very important part of the economy, a bridge, a foundation of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Himanshu, the economics professor. \u201cAnd then you attack them?\u201dPolitics are shaped by expectation, and many Indians said they expected more from Mr. Modi. About one million Indians enter the work force every month, and job creation is one of the country\u2019s most urgent political priorities. Mr. Modi has come nowhere near his promise of creating 10 million jobs a year.The unemployment rate was 5 percent, the worst in five years, in 2015-16. Some studies show that at best, a few hundred thousand jobs have been created each year under Mr. Modi in major industries such as textiles, transportation and information technology, though this excludes the informal sector, where millions of Indians traditionally work.India\u2019s economy still has a lot going for it: It is already huge, and still growing relatively fast. It has an educated work force; a young, working-age population; and a public that craves new technology. Facebook has 217 million monthly active users in India, second only to the United States.Economic growth is projected to be higher next year, and Mr. Modi\u2019s supporters say that as India\u2019s economy matures, some sort of slowdown was inevitable. And it is not as if his base has fragmented.For every Gujarati business owner who wants to send Mr. Modi an angry message, many others are still with him. This was the area where Mr. Modi built his commanding brand as the state\u2019s top politician for 13 years before becoming prime minister in 2014, and where he attracted heavy manufacturing and investment.But for many people here, politics and economics are not connected at the hip. Kailash Dhoot, a textile exporter, said that Mr. Modi\u2019s recent policies had wounded his business but that Mr. Modi\u2019s party was still his first choice.When asked why, Mr. Dhoot was quick, and curt, with an answer. \u201cHindutva,\u201d he said. And he closed his mouth firmly, signaling the discussion was over.Hindutva is a philosophy adopted by Mr. Modi\u2019s party that emphasizes Hindu supremacy.Analysts fear that if the economy continues to come up short of expectations, Mr. Modi might turn more to what are termed \u201ccommunal issues,\u201d subjects that divide communities based on religion or caste.\u201cThat\u2019s what Mr. Modi did in Gujarat,\u2019\u2019 Professor Varshney said. \u201cHe twisted every available political possibility into a Hindu-Muslim question.\u201dMany people saw those claims as a low blow to stir up Gujarati Hindus, who make up the state\u2019s vast majority.\u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be like this,\u201d said Hanif Belim, a taxi driver in Gujarat. But nowadays, he added, \u201cpoliticians divide the public and sit on the side and watch them fight.\u201dVindu Goel and Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai, and Suhasini Raj from Morbi, India.Advertisement"}

She admired the panda, which looked out from a crib.\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute?\u201dAnd postcards.The world may have largely abandoned postcard writing, but deltiology \u2014 or postcard collecting \u2014 persists.Like the members themselves, no two postcard collections are alike. A founder of the club, Joe Nardone, collected postcards of Main Street in different towns and cities around the United States. Current members specialize in postcards of Eskimos; Broadway theaters; kilts; old Baku, Azerbaijan. The list goes on.Deltiologists like to say, \u201cIf it exists, it\u2019s on a postcard,\u201d and indeed, it seems that each of the collectors in the club, like subjects in a Werner Herzog film, has been tasked with tending over a small corner of the universe.\u201cA lot of the things don\u2019t exist anymore, so they\u2019re an important historical record,\u201d said Rod Kennedy, the president of the club. \u201cWe are sort of the custodians.\u201d\u201cThere are people who only collect World War I submarines,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI met another guy who collected harps and orchestras playing harps. He traveled hundreds of miles, looking for these harps. Maybe once every two years he got lucky.\u201dAs a group, Mr. Kennedy said, the club\u2019s current members have rescued at least a few million postcards \u2014 from junk stores, flea markets, estate sales and basements \u2014 many thousands of which have been donated to museums.That Sunday, some of them had gathered in a conference room tucked at the back of the Watson Hotel for their monthly meeting. Folding tables had been set up and were covered in shoeboxes, each filled with postcards, all sorted by topic.\u201cClocks,\u201d \u201cCoat of Arms,\u201d read the labels on one box. \u201cDisney,\u201d \u201cErotica,\u201d \u201cEthnic Customs,\u201d \u201cExaggeration/Fantasy,\u201d \u201cFairs and Expos,\u201d \u201cFamilies,\u201d \u201cFire Fighting,\u201d \u201cFlags.\u201dThe postcards, which had been priced in pencil and slipped into plastic sleeves, ranged from less than $1 to more than $100.George Gibbs, a dealer, had brought a selection of the 20,000 to 30,000 cards he takes to the club\u2019s biannual shows. He pulled out some \u201creal photo postcards\u201d \u2014 these were actual photos printed on card stock, not lithographic or offset prints, the kind of postcard that could easily fetch $100, said Mr. Gibbs.At one time, postcards were also printed by governments and political groups, who used them to spread propaganda and push social agendas. He pulled out a postcard, warning that it was graphic. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a soldier with World War I injuries,\u201d he said, turning over the card to reveal a man whose face been severely disfigured; his flesh had been crudely sewn together in folds around the eyes and teeth. \u201cIt was likely printed in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would make series of cards to illustrate the horrors of war, so it would never be repeated.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little world in here,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201c You can go down the rabbit hole.\u201dAcross the room, another dealer, Ira Rubin, showed a collector a stack of Halloween cards. \u201cHalloween is very, very rare,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the most popular of all the holidays, so it is the most sought-after.\u201d While the panda card cost less than $5, a vintage linen Halloween card could go for $20 or more.Hy Mariampolski, a dealer whose wares covered several tables, said the messages written on cards were amusing but often of little interest to collectors. Postcards were the text messages and emails of their day; they were how people invited one another to dinner and to tea, and said, \u201cThank you for a lovely time.\u201d Like emails and texts, they changed how people wrote, but on the whole, they were pretty boring.\u201cHave not much time so will write later, thank you for the postcard, it was a dandy,\u201d read the message on a card featuring a pair of women\u2019s shoes, from 1909.There were exceptions. Mr. Mariampolski pulled out a postcard of a comely French nurse in aquarelle, which, according to the sender\u2019s message, had been plucked \u201cfrom the coat of a dead Austrian.\u201dMr. Mariampolski added: \u201cI started as a collector, but like all kinds of junkies, you eventually have to become a dealer to support your habit.\u201d He said he found postcards in various places. There were flea markets abroad \u2014 \u201cOne of the best is in Buenos Aires,\u201d he said\u2014 an annual antique fair in Brimfield, Massachusetts. And some were found close to home. \u201cI live out here in the Hamptons. It\u2019s one of those places: \u2018God\u2019s waiting room,\u2019 as they say. There are all kinds of articles and collections that come up when people pass away.\u201dThe postcard era began around 1900, when the printing of commercial postcards took off around the United States and Europe, and peaked in the first decades of the century. The golden era is thought to have ended around World War I, when the supply of German postcards, considered by many to be the best in the world, was cut off.Major shifts followed: White border postcards were introduced, to save expensive ink; linen postcards and photochrome color postcards, or \u201cchromes,\u201d came along around the 1940s.In other words, Instagram before the Internet.But postcards weren\u2019t documentary in the strict sense of the term. Before photochrome cards, artists created color postcards from black and white photographs and often embellished them with details like clouds or trees that weren\u2019t there, Mr. Kennedy said. They could take a single photograph and make two postcards from it \u2014 say, \u201cLondon by Day\u201d and \u201cLondon by Night.\u201dThey could also create what are known as \u201cexaggerations.\u201d Exaggeration cards at the hotel that day featured, for example, giant apples rolling through an otherwise realistic scene, and an enormous fish rising from the water and tipping a fisherman\u2019s boat (\u201cA fight with a mad pickrel,\u201d read the handwritten caption, from 1911).While collectors browsed in the conference room, a few women came in carrying thick, brown photo albums, which eventually formed a leaning tower in one corner. Sandra Gottlin was dropping off the last of her father Kurt Gorwitz\u2019s collection, which she had donated to the club. \u201cHe was a Holocaust refugee from Austria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe collected 22,000 cards. He loved Austria. He loved Canada. He loved National Parks.\u201dShe went on, her eyes filling with tears: \u201cHe used to sit on the floor. He would put them in the albums and on some of them he would write where they were from.\u201d She opened an album with a sticky, ripping sound, and revealed a page of postcards of museum dioramas of Native American life.You don\u2019t have to talk to a postcard collector long before the conversation turns existential. Postcard collecting, even if it was given a burst of life by the Internet and the rise of online marketplaces such as eBay, is not exactly a youthful pursuit.\u201cCan we have silence please?\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, standing in the center of the room at the Watson and calling the group to order for the meeting. He shuffled some papers and cleared his throat. \u201cIt was a quiet year, and we continued to do well.\u201d Then he read the names of members who had died.Those present murmured in sympathy. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy. \u201cWe need to get new members. We need to get younger members.\u201dUnless there is a new generation of postcard collectors, club members say, there will be no one to save postcards from the recycling plant.\u201cPostcards are like a time machine into the past,\u201d said Ms. Stern, the collector of superlatives. \u201cWhether it\u2019s fashion, technology or race relations, you can go visit it in the past.\u201dShe added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if a Healthier Facebook Is Just \u2026 Instagram?", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftFor the past several years, Facebook has been conducting what amounts to an A/B test on human society, using two different social media apps.The first app in Facebook\u2019s test has a maximalist design: It allows users to post lengthy status updates, with links to news articles, photos, videos and more. The app is designed as a giant megaphone, with an emphasis on public sharing and an algorithmic feed capable of sending posts rocketing around the world in seconds.The second app in the test is more minimalist, designed for intimate sharing rather than viral broadcasting. Users of this app, many of whom have private accounts with modest followings, can post photos or videos, but external links do not work and there is no re-share button, making it harder for users to amplify one another\u2019s posts.Good for him. But there may be a simpler fix here. Why doesn\u2019t he make his beleaguered blue app more like Instagram, the Facebook-owned app that isn\u2019t destabilizing society?But this kind of minor algorithmic knob-fiddling may not be enough. Instead, Facebook should consider using what it\u2019s learned with Instagram, which it acquired in 2012, to embark on a gut renovation.If I were Mr. Zuckerberg, here are some Instagram lessons I\u2019d be thinking about.Lesson No. 1: Emphasize visuals. De-emphasize text.First, and most obviously, Instagram is a visual medium. Photos and videos are the main event, and text, while present, is mostly confined to captions and comments. As a result, Instagram feels more intimate than Facebook, where photos and videos often sit alongside lengthy diatribes, restaurant check-ins and mundane status updates.A heavily visual platform also makes a relatively poor conduit for breaking news and in-the-moment commentary, which might explain why Instagram often feels less exhausting than other social networks. (It also explains why last month, before I went on vacation, I deleted every social media app from my phone except Instagram \u2014 the only app I trusted not to ruin my beachside calm.)Lesson No. 2: Rethink the share button.A native share button has been tremendously useful for Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth. It has also allowed upstart media organizations like BuzzFeed and Upworthy to build enormous audiences by specializing in highly shareable stories. But ease of sharing has also allowed the loudest and most emotional voices to be rewarded with clicks \u2014 and attention. It\u2019s this incentive structure that has allowed partisans and profiteers to hijack Facebook\u2019s algorithms and spread divisive messages and false news to millions of people.The easy virality of Facebook also seems to have made individual users more hesitant about opening up. That makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s easier to share a selfie if you know it won\u2019t accidentally find its way into the feeds of a million strangers.Lesson No. 3: Ban links.The walled-garden nature of Instagram has frustrated publishers, who want to send followers out to their websites, where the publishers can earn advertising money and \u201ccontrol the reader experience.\u201d (It\u2019s really just about the money.) But Instagram has wisely refused to give in, perhaps realizing that allowing links might turn the platform into a screeching bazaar, with publishers and pages all doing circus acts for clicks.Removing links from Facebook would wreak havoc on the digital media industry, which has built an economic model around referral traffic from Facebook. It would also risk alienating some users, who enjoy promoting and discussing stories from other parts of the internet. But it would also solve some of the platform\u2019s most vexing challenges. And ultimately, it would be better for the world.After all, malicious actors don\u2019t post fabricated news, wildly exaggerated headlines or partisan outrage-bait on Facebook only for fun. They do it, in many cases, because it\u2019s profitable. Take away bad actors\u2019 incentives and they\u2019ll go elsewhere.Lesson No. 4: Bad actors are unavoidable, but their influence can be contained.But even these flaws are preferable to the structural problems that have plagued Facebook.Given the choice between a version of Facebook that made some of its users feel ugly and unpopular, and one that could be used to undermine democracies and promote misinformation around the world, I know which one I\u2019d pick. A few billion Facebook users might agree.Advertisement"}

Many have urged more disclosure by Facebook, Twitter and other companies, which possess internal information about users and payments.Damian Collins, the Conservative member of Parliament leading the inquiry, said in a statement, however, that \u201ccompanies like Facebook should initiate their own research into issues like this, where there is such clear public concern, and not just act on intelligence that has been passed to them.\u201d\u201cThey are best placed to investigate activity on their platform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.The context Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.What Elliott wants\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the companyAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.What could lie aheadBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release.

It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.The secondRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker.

Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.Goldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time.It took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.And it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\u2014 Stephen GrocerVia ValueWalk:Despite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.More in corporate social activism \u201cThese guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures.\u201dIn other media deals:A few years ago I met with a very successful entrepreneur who built his company outside of the tech sector.

{"Headline": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Backing Up Photos", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d says the award-winning National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, about backing up her photos. \u201cI\u2019ve had hard drives fail throughout my career. For example, back when I first started as a photographer, I had a very nice hard drive system in my home, and the whole thing failed.\u201d In retrospect, Ms. Vitale says, she would have definitely set the system up differently.\u201cI lost some historic moments from the first part of my career,\u201d she says, \u201cand they\u2019re gone forever.\u201dMs. Vitale may shoot photos differently from how most of us capture images these days \u2014 she shoots with a digital single-lens-reflex camera (or DSLR). But her cautionary tale should resonate, since many of the same vulnerabilities exist when photographing with smartphones. In other words, if you\u2019re snapping away without a backup plan for your photos, beware: In an instant, you could lose them all, forever.Before I explain how to back up your photos, it\u2019s useful to understand one important aspect of digital photos that relates to storing them properly. Namely, image resolution.Every digital photo has a certain image resolution, which is the total number of pixels that make up a photo. If an image you shot on your smartphone, say, is 4,000 pixels high by 3,000 pixels wide, it contains a total of 12 million pixels (the height multiplied by the width). Since one million pixels is known as a megapixel, the resolution of your smartphone image is 12 megapixels.But right now, most websites, including social media and even photo-printing sites, aren\u2019t designed to truly store photos. That\u2019s because when you back up your photos, you want to be able to retrieve an image file that is as close to, if not identical to, the original photo you captured on your phone or digital camera. That\u2019s also why you want to carefully choose a backup solution, whether it\u2019s online or an external hard drive.The important takeaway here is that you should consider using a combination of services and solutions to safely back up photos. Ideally, store them both online and on two external hard drives (one stored locally and another at a different location). However, at the very least, consider using one online backup, which lets you copy and transfer the photos on your phone, as well as other devices, to an alternate location.By contrast, you get free, unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, allowing you to automatically back up all images from your phone, computer and other devices. Google also recently updated its app for desktop computers, which now can automatically upload photos directly into Google Photos when transferring images from your camera to your computer, which is very convenient.However, Google Photos has limitations as well. If you shoot photos with a resolution larger than 16 megapixels, they\u2019ll be downsized, which some photographers find unacceptable. At this time, smartphones mostly capture 12- or 16-megapixel photos, which won\u2019t be affected, but some models already exceed that limit, as do many digital cameras.Both Amazon Prime Photos and Dropbox have their pros and cons, too. If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account.Dropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB).As the name implies, external hard drives, which range in price from $50 (one to two TB) to $350 and up (eight TB), are like the storage that\u2019s built into your computers, except they\u2019re connected externally. Most hook up via a USB connection, although there are other methods. (For instance, network attached storage, or NAS, drives, connect via an Ethernet line to your home or office network.) As with your internal drive, there are many ways to transfer, copy, or sync your photos. You can also automate your backup using your computer\u2019s operating system, the external hard-drive\u2019s software, or a third-party backup software app or service.Our personal library of images generally doesn\u2019t end with just our digital photos. Many of us also own precious prints, photo albums, slides and negatives, some of which can be decades old.Whatever backup system you eventually select, whether it\u2019s just an online solution or a combination of several services and hard drives, it\u2019s important to monitor the system. Be sure to periodically check it and make sure it\u2019s backing up your photos correctly.Consider these tips from Jill Duffy, Ami Vitale and myself, when backing up your images:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Saint Peter in Sydney, Australia", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare11 PhotosThe restaurant has a dedicated aging room, where blue mackerel is hung for 12 days before being served with bitter radicchio in a sweet-and-sour sauce, and albacore is aged for as long as 41 days. Like dry-aging meat, the process intensifies the flavor of the flesh, while careful butchering techniques and tightly controlled conditions keep the fish from rotting. The aged albacore is served raw and diced, its texture fatty and its flavor pure and lean. Traditionally meat-focused chef obsessions \u2014 offal, dry aging, whole animal cookery \u2014 are here applied to seafood.On any given night, you might find five varieties of Australian oyster, a live scallop from Victoria\u2019s Port Phillip Bay and two kinds of sea urchin roe. Spanner crab from Ballina in northern New South Wales has had its sweet meat picked and served in its own shell, in a pool of coral sauce \u2014 sauce, that is, made from its roe. The pure sweetness of the crab meat and the deep funk of the sauce are like crab to the power of crab: crab squared.This is the one realm that Australian restaurants dominate, with the breadth and quality of our seafood, and the inventiveness with which it is handled by Australian chefs. The United States, in particular, has a dearth of exciting modern seafood restaurants. I have long suspected that this has as much to do with kitchen dynamics as with ingredients or creativity, and is perhaps a side effect of the dude-food revolution.Two decades ago, there was a balance in many American professional kitchens, a symmetry between the delicacy of the saut\u00e9 station, where pans are used, and the brawn of the grill, where direct heat is king. The beautifully browned, melting-in-the-middle piece of pan-cooked fish used to be a staple of New American menus. But then the offal trend took off, and wood-fired meat assumed command.Now, when you find fish on New American menus, the trend is toward crudo or whole-roasted preparations. There are exceptions, of course, but most American restaurants that bill themselves as seafood specialists are trading in nostalgia, either for New England crab shacks or grand oyster houses.For some reason, the kitchens of Australia have not endured quite the same fate. Charcuterie and offal and meaty overload reign here, too. But this country\u2019s seafood prowess is remarkably strong because nuanced fish cookery never went out of style.Mr. Niland quickly learned that being self-employed has its unique challenges, many of them financial in nature. His cooking style is inspired by a chef\u2019s desire to showcase lesser-known seafood varieties and flavors (you are far more likely to find wild kingfish on this menu than salmon or even barramundi), but also by an owner\u2019s concern that every unused part of an ingredient is money lost.The chef takes inspiration from Japanese cuisine and its love of fish bits, and he hopes to prove that they can be pleasurable to a Western palate. This is not a restaurant where the food feels like a dare. It would be easy to focus on the eyeballs \u2014 which, once turned into a chip, have much in common with a prawn cracker \u2014 and miss Mr. Niland\u2019s greatest strength: the clever simplicity of his cooking.Maray \u2014 small, oily fish with shiny silver skin \u2014 are filleted raw, lined up on a plate, drizzled with oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. They are then placed under the heat lamp just long enough that they arrive on the table at around the same temperature as the inside of your mouth. The slight warming and slick of oil make for a slippery velvet texture, and the fish\u2019s being neither cold nor hot \u2014 neither raw nor cooked \u2014 is like a magic trick that amplifies purity of flavor. It is one of those dishes that works like a lightning bolt; suddenly you understand important truths that you previously did not.The space, too, is beautifully simple. Brick walls and bare wooden tables lead to an open kitchen at the back of the room that\u2019s not so open it intrudes on your lunch or dinner. There are thoughtful, agreeable wines to be drunk, and a short beer list peppered with great discoveries from small Australian breweries. Like everything here, even the low-acid, high-flavor vegetable accompaniments are geared toward heightening our understanding and appreciation of the seafood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hawaii Panics After Alert About Incoming Missile Is Sent in Error", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn early-morning emergency alert mistakenly warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack was dispatched to cellphones across Hawaii on Saturday, setting off widespread panic in a state that was already on edge because of escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea.The alert, sent by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, was revoked 38 minutes after it was issued, prompting confusion over why it was released \u2014 and why it took so long to rescind. State officials and residents of a normally tranquil part of the Pacific, as well as tourists swept up in the panic, immediately expressed outrage.\u201cWhat happened today was totally unacceptable,\u201d said Gov. David Y. Ige. \u201cMany in our community were deeply affected by this. I am sorry for that pain and confusion that anyone might have experienced.\u201dOfficials said the alert was the result of human error and not the work of hackers or a foreign government. The mistake occurred during a shift-change drill that takes place three times a day at the emergency command post, according to Richard Rapoza, a spokesman for the agency.\u201cSomeone clicked the wrong thing on the computer,\u201d he said.State officials said that the agency and the governor began posting notices on Facebook and Twitter announcing the mistake, but that a flaw in the alert system delayed sending out a cellphone correction. As a result, they said a \u201ccancellation template\u201d would be created to make it easier to fix mistaken alerts. A new procedure was instituted Saturday requiring two people to sign off before any such alert is sent.At no time, officials said, was there any indication that a nuclear attack had been launched on the United States. The Federal Communications Commission announced that it had begun \u201ca full investigation into the FALSE missile alert in Hawaii.\u201dThe alert went out at about 8:10 a.m., lighting up phones of people still in bed, having coffee by the beach at a Waikiki resort, or up for an early surf. \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL,\u201d it read.Hawaii has been on high emotional alert \u2014 it began staging monthly air-raid drills, complete with sirens, in December \u2014 since President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, began exchanging nuclear threats. Estimates vary, but it would take a little more than half an hour for a missile launched from North Korea to reach Hawaii, traversing an arc of roughly 5,700 miles. State officials said that residents here would have as little as 12 minutes to find shelter once an alert was issued.Within moments of the first announcement, people flocked to shelters, crowding highways in scenes of terror and helplessness. Emergency sirens wailed in parts of the state, adding to the panic.\u201cI was running through all the scenarios in my head, but there was nowhere to go, nowhere to pull over to,\u201d said Mike Staskow, a retired military captain.Allyson Niven, who lives in Kailua-Kona, said her first instinct was to gather her family as she contemplated what she thought would be her final minutes alive.\u201cWe fully felt like we were about to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI drove to try to get to my kids even though I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t make it, and I fully was visualizing what was happening while I was on the road. It was awful.\u201dRay Gerst was vacationing on Oahu with his wife to celebrate their 28th wedding anniversary. He received the alert as they pulled up for their tour of Kualoa Ranch.\u201cAll the buses stopped, and people came running out of the ranch and said, \u2018Just sit still for a minute, nobody get off the bus, nobody get off the bus,\u2019\u201d he said.They were taken into the mountains, Mr. Gerst said, and dropped off at a concrete bunker. They sheltered in place for about 15 minutes, he said, during which time they had no cell signal.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d Mr. Gerst said. \u201cI mean, there was no intel.\u201dAt Konawaena High School on the Island of Hawaii, where a high school wrestling championship was taking place, school officials, more accustomed to alerts of high surf or tsunamis, moved people to the center of the gym as they tried to figure out how to take shelter from a missile.\u201cEveryone cooperated,\u201d said Kellye Krug, the athletic director at the school. \u201cOnce they were gathered, we let them use cellphones to reach loved ones. There were a couple kids who were emotional, the coaches were right there to console kids. After the retraction was issued, we gave kids time to reach out again.\u201dMatt LoPresti, a state representative, told CNN that he and his family headed for a bathroom. \u201cI was sitting in the bathtub with my children, saying our prayers,\u201d he said.Natalie Haena, 38, of Honolulu, said she was getting ready to take her daughter to ice skating lessons when the alert came. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to prep for a missile coming in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no bomb shelters or anything like that. There\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201dIn Washington, Lindsay Walters, a deputy press secretary, said that President Trump had been informed of the events. \u201cThe president has been briefed on the state of Hawaii\u2019s emergency management exercise,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was purely a state exercise.\u201dSenator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said the mistake was \u201ctotally inexcusable.\u201d\u201cThe whole state was terrified,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be tough and quick accountability and a fixed process.\u201dWhile the cellphone alerting system is in state authorities\u2019 hands, the detection of missile launches is the responsibility of the United States Strategic Command and Northern Command. It was the military \u2014 not Hawaiian officials \u2014 that was the first to declare there was no evidence of a missile launch.The false alert was a stark reminder of what happens when the old realities of the nuclear age collide with the speed \u2014 and the potential for error \u2014 inherent in the internet age. The alert came at one of the worst possible moments \u2014 when tension with North Korea has been at one of the highest points in decades, and when Mr. Kim\u2019s government has promised more missile tests and threatened an atmospheric nuclear test.During the Cold War there were many false alarms. William J. Perry, the defense secretary during the Clinton administration, recalled in his memoir, \u201cMy Journey at the Nuclear Brink,\u201d a moment in 1979 when, as an under secretary of defense, he was awakened by a watch officer who reported that his computer system was showing 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles headed to the United States. \u201cFor one heart-stopping second I thought my worst nuclear nightmare had come true,\u201d Mr. Perry wrote.It turned out that a training tape had been mistakenly inserted into an early-warning system computer. No one woke up the president. But Mr. Perry went on to speculate what might have happened if such a warning had come \u201cduring the Cuban Missile Crisis or a Mideast war?\u201dThe United States faces an especially difficult problem today, not just because of tense relations with North Korea but also because of growing fears inside the military about the cyber vulnerability of the nuclear warning system and nuclear control systems.Because of its location, Hawaii \u2014 more than any other part of the United States \u2014 has been threatened by escalating tensions and the risks of war, and preparations have already begun there.On Friday, the day before the erroneous alert, several hundred people attended an event in Honolulu sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in which military commanders, politicians and others discussed the threat to the islands\u2019 population.Vern T. Miyagi, the administrator of the agency, said that during the drill, an employee \u2014 whom he did not identify \u2014 mistakenly pushed a button on a computer screen to send out the alert, rather than one marked to test it.

{"Headline": "Is Oprah the Un-Trump, or the Un-Clinton?", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe metabolism of the media is such that we moved, within 20 hours, from the exhortation that Oprah Winfrey run for president (roughly 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday) to the reading of rune stones about whether she\u2019d be game (8 a.m. Monday) to the analysis of her chances of victory (2 p.m.) to the deconstruction of what it all said about America (7 p.m.).Sometime Wednesday the speculation about what she\u2019ll wear to her inauguration should commence. By Saturday we\u2019ll be reviewing the campaign missteps that sent her poll numbers into free fall, and the pundits on the Sunday morning talk shows can bicker over which of her confidantes and handlers are to blame.But I\u2019d like to go back to the analysis-of-her-chances phase and to something that came up among the analyzers: Is Oprah too much a replay of Trump, in that she\u2019s another unfathomably famous billionaire with no experience in government? Or do their differences far outnumber their similarities, in that she\u2019s a black woman as earnest about personal improvement as he is convinced of his superhuman perfection?The answer matters, because there\u2019s a compelling theory that when voters change presidents, they want a departure, someone poised to correct many of the flaws and fill in many of the holes that his (or her!) predecessor had.But the question misses a big player and big part of the equation. Oprah\u2019s ability to excite Democrats and independents doesn\u2019t hinge entirely, or even mainly, on whether she\u2019s the un-Trump. It has more to do with her being the un-Clinton.Barely a day goes by when Trump\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t fill most Democrats with despair, and they have spent the first year of his presidency torturing and berating themselves: How did such a spectacularly unqualified person with such a proudly offensive nature manage to win the Electoral College?While there\u2019s a brimming grab bag of possible explanations (Vladimir Putin, James Comey, Facebook), nearly all of the Democrats I know maturely admit that one factor can\u2019t be dismissed, and their regret about it intensifies over time. The party put its chips on the wrong candidate.Wrong not because Hillary Clinton is a woman \u2014 though that may have hurt \u2014 and not because she lacked seasoning, skills and a plan. Clinton checked all of those boxes.But she was a terrible fit for the times, which were anti-elitist, anti-erudition, anti-Washington. To many voters, she was a career politician who had been pining and plotting for the presidency her whole life. And she had spent so much time at the center of so much controversy. She was exhausting.On top of which, she had trouble connecting with voters. She acknowledged as much in her speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was smoothly delivered but nothing soaring. Nothing that gave goose bumps.Oprah soars. Oprah gives goose bumps. That\u2019s her m\u00e9tier, and where Clinton wants for charisma, Oprah overflows with it. She\u2019s the Niagara Falls of charisma, and as warm to the touch as Clinton can be cold.And no one can call Oprah a Washington insider.None of this is an argument for her candidacy, which would be a mistake in many ways. How effectively could Democrats disparage Trump as a political novice who got in over his head if they were backing another novice, no matter how much more serious-minded she was?I\u2019m betting that she realizes it and won\u2019t run in the end, for that reason and another: She lacks Trump\u2019s shamelessness, which enabled him to transcend his unpreparedness for the office. He was happy to claim knowledge that he didn\u2019t possess and stake out positions to which he\u2019d given minimal thought because, hey, he was Trump! Details and facts paled beside his majesty and his needs. Why worry about credentials when there\u2019s applause to be savored?I don\u2019t think I\u2019m idealizing Oprah when I say that she\u2019s probably too aware of what she\u2019s unaware of to follow Trump\u2019s lead, and that he rushed in where she\u2019ll rightly fear to tread.But the Oprah hoopla is a lesson to Democrats and a clue to which of them might ultimately get the party\u2019s nomination. That person will be as brightly inspirational as Trump is darkly confrontational. That person will radiate empathy.That person may not be Oprah. But he or she will be Oprah-esque.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Trolls Are Only Part of the Problem", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Rest easy, everyone. A year after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Twitter claims it has solved the problem of Russian disinformation that plagued the 2016 election by playing \u2014 and according to Twitter executives, winning \u2014 this round of the game of Whack-a-Troll.It\u2019s refreshing to see that these companies have finally realized their culpability in the spread of online disinformation. But their solutions to the phenomenon overlook homegrown purveyors of it. The companies have misplaced their focus in the fight, concentrating too heavily on removing Russian content while ignoring the problematic articles and posts created and shared by American outlets and users.In its statement, Twitter asserted that it is committed to identifying and removing more bots in the future. But it also added a few important caveats: \u201cautomated election-related content associated with Russian signals represented a very small fraction of the overall activity on Twitter in the ten-week period preceding the 2016 election,\u201d and of tweets from Internet Research Agency-linked accounts, only 8.4 percent were \u201celection-related.\u201dTwitter does not seem to comprehend that non-automated content, including from American accounts, is a huge part of the disinformation ecosystem. Its amplification of neo-Nazi rhetoric, abusive content and false or misleading stories spread by accounts with huge numbers of followers all affected rhetoric surrounding the 2016 election. Other than supporting a few small media literacy programs, Twitter doesn\u2019t seem to have a plan for eliminating the problematic content that originates within America\u2019s own borders.These polls seem likely to reinforce existing biases, privilege well-known media giants and leave small outfits in the dust. After a year in which the United States witnessed a 37 percent decline in trust in institutions, the country\u2019s dwindling local newsrooms are more important than ever, interpreting and contextualizing events from Congress to the City Council for their readers in a way that larger news organizations struggled to do. Facebook should place local news in a prominent location, prioritize content from high-performing smaller outlets, perhaps through a competitive application system, and make serious investments in local journalism.Facebook will also continue to rely on users to report false stories, which it will work with third-party fact-checkers to confirm and label. It claims this process stops the spread of untruths by 80 percent. Conveniently, Facebook ignores decades of research demonstrating that those who have consumed untruths are unlikely to buy into the corrected version.Like Twitter, Facebook is doing little to address problematic narratives that may not be patently false. After all, most of the infamous Russian election ads purchased on Facebook in 2016 were not \u201cfake.\u201d They were highly inflammatory messages aimed at the specific populations with whom they would most resonate. How might a concerned citizen or outside fact-checker respond to an ad comparing Hillary Clinton to Satan, or to a meme arguing that blue lives matter more than black lives?For both platforms, and for the internet as a whole, this is admittedly a hard question. But it\u2019s not one without an answer. As private entities, these companies have the right \u2014 and the obligation \u2014 to update their terms of service to reflect the realities of the disinformation era, defining in plain English what content is permissible on their platforms and actively enforcing those definitions. Yes, it would be costly, but you can\u2019t put a price tag on democracy.By narrowly focusing on eliminating Russian accounts and posts, relying on users to determine which content is trustworthy and blindly believing that fact-checking will improve the rapidly worsening level of civil discourse in America, social media companies are relinquishing their role as today\u2019s most powerful gatekeepers of information. If these tech giants want to contribute to democracy instead of help to tear it down, they need to recognize that homegrown threats to civil discourse exist among the very users to whom they are bequeathing more responsibility. In a world where every person with a smartphone is a citizen journalist, a threat to democracy is a threat to democracy, no matter the post\u2019s country of origin.An earlier version of this article misstated a detail of how Facebook will now treat local news. Facebook says it will continue to appear in the News Feed; it will not be confined to a dedicated section.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What I\u2019ve Learned from My 4-Year-Old", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A bathroom at 4:45 a.m. is quiet. I try to wake at this time, three hours before my 4-year-old son does, so I can write, even in a hotel bathroom. I have not checked email, Twitter or Instagram, and last year I got off Facebook.I had been gentle with my 82-year-old father during Christmas, but as I prepared to leave his house, I snapped at him when I felt that he had nagged me one too many times. I immediately regretted it. All he wanted was for me to listen to him.That regret was surely on my mind when I took a walk after dinner later that night with my wife and son, and a man pushing a shopping cart loaded with his belongings asked me for the box of leftovers I had in my hand. I hesitated. It had half a pizza that my son would surely demand as soon as it was bedtime, but I gave it to the man, along with $2. My wife observed that I would not normally do such a thing.But I had been doing such things whenever my son was with me, rolling down the window of my car when he was in his Batman car seat behind me, so I could give an old man on the median a dollar. I wanted to teach my son a lesson about generosity, and I wanted to be, in his eyes, a kind person.He is cognizant and curious about morality and ethics, at the level of preschool behaviors, parent-child negotiations, apocalyptic superhero conflicts and science fiction wars. As most parents would, I have tried to teach him about giving, sharing, listening and empathy. And yet in my own life, away from his gaze, I have sometimes failed in all those respects.My own ambitions and the dreadfulness of our political world consume and distract me. I taught my son the face and name of the man who is president, along with a few negative words for him. That was wrong. Not just for the sake of the person who is president, and for all the people who voted for him, but for my own sake. To call someone else stupid is to release anger, bitterness and vitriol into my own bloodstream, poisoning me. I need only to read the Twitter feed of Donald Trump to see this happening.Let that not happen to me, that I become like him. Let me empathize with him, so that I can understand him and feel for him as a human being, even as I oppose him in almost all matters.A meal I shared with a Vietnamese-American Buddhist monk provoked some of this thinking. At the end of our meal, we closed our eyes and meditated, focused on our breathing, on the passage of air over our upper lips, on the stillness within ourselves.I listened to his steady, quiet voice guide me and my breathing. I believe, as he tells me, as my Catholic tradition tells me, that there will be no end to war until each of us calms the conflicts within ourselves. A simple task, to change only ourselves, and yet such a difficult one. I resolve to hold the shell of my self up to my ear every day, to listen to the sound of my own self, before I set out into the unsettled world, as I must.While our religions instruct us to behave ourselves, I find that my son teaches me, too, even as I teach him. What have I learned from our relationship this year? That we must believe in what is good and right, without demonizing those that we oppose; that we must fight for what we believe in, without recourse to hate or insults; that we must give, in ways great and small, to distant organizations and the people we meet face to face; that we must connect to others who believe as we do, and grow our values and our organizations; that we must write and read what is meaningful, and ignore the morass of public opinion and media-induced emotions.If we all do this, perhaps we can change our country, even in the face of entrenched power, the oligarchy of billionaires, the fear and hatred of those who feel powerless. It will take years to stop the tax cuts and the environmental assault, and it may take forever to stop our forever wars and to dismantle racism and patriarchy. But we can stop the moral and political degradation. We can say: Me, too, or I support you. We can say: Enough. We can say: What can I do?I continue to write and to give talks in parts of the country that are beautiful but alien to me. Even if this costs me time to write, I want to reach out to people who are different than me, as we all must. I want to listen to strangers and I continue to listen to my son, knowing that if I do not listen to him, he will not listen to me.That is true for all of us. Not everyone will listen, caught up in the noise, but enough might. Those who do not listen will never know what those who listen do: that it is the listening itself that matters, that listening is what connects us to others, and ourselves.Viet Thanh Nguyen, a contributing opinion writer, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d and the editor of the forthcoming \u201cThe Displaced: Refugee Writers on Refugee Lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were being held in jail with bail set at $9 million each, the authorities said.The Sheriff\u2019s Department did not say how long the siblings may have been held captive.Sheriff\u2019s deputies provided food and water to the siblings, who claimed they were starving. They were later transported to hospitals for treatment. Their conditions were not released.California records show that Mr. Turpin had received state approval to run a private school, the Sandcastle Day School, at the family\u2019s home, a one-story stucco house in a subdivision built in recent years. The school enrolled six students this year, in grades six through 12, and Mr. Turpin was listed as the principal.In a neighborhood where residents often walk outside and children run around a nearby playground, the Turpins stood out for never being seen, neighbors said. Dennis Cooke, who lives two blocks from their home, said he saw Mr. Turpin once but never the siblings.Roberto Gomez, who lives in the house behind the Turpins, said the family kept lights on inside the house at all hours but never seemed to come outside. Another neighbor, Julio Reyes, said that last year he saw teenagers mowing the family\u2019s yard and helping put up Christmas decorations.\u201cThey look pretty normal,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cPretty normal house, they have nice cars. It\u2019s just an appearance.\u201dThe couple filed for bankruptcy in California in 2011, stating in court documents that they owed between $100,000 and $500,000 in debt. At that time, Mr. Turpin worked as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the defense contractor, and earned $140,000 annually, records show. Ms. Turpin\u2019s occupation was listed as a homemaker.Their bankruptcy lawyer, Ivan Trahan, said in a phone interview on Monday night that the parents spoke often about their children. They had 12 at the time of their bankruptcy, Mr. Trahan said, adding that the children never visited his law office.\u201cThey spoke about them highly,\u201d Mr. Trahan said.He said Ms. Turpin told him that the family loved Disneyland in Southern California and visited often.\u201cWe remember them as a very nice couple,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is shocking.\u201dThe Turpins moved to California from Texas around 2010, the parents wrote on Facebook, after Mr. Turpin returned to work for Northrop Grumman. On a family photo of the parents and 12 children (the youngest had not yet been born) posted on their Facebook page in 2011, a friend asked if all the children pictured were theirs.\u201cYes all 12 are our children and we are very proud of them,\u201d the Turpins replied.Sandra E.

She is beginning to read and can\u2019t grasp nuances in written communication. She also doesn\u2019t understand privacy.Facebook\u2019s new app for young children opens greater concerns, the group said.\u201cYounger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts,\u201d the experts said in the letter. \u201cA growing body of research demonstrates that excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to children and teens, making it very likely this new app will undermine children\u2019s healthy development.\u201dMessenger Kids is a texting-type service that a parent sets up for a child. The parent uses his or her own Facebook account for the child, but the app is otherwise not a part of the main Facebook service. The app doesn\u2019t have News Feed or a \u201clike\u201d button, which some mental health experts have linked to anxiety among teenagers on social media.But many elements of the social network are there, including emojis, selfies, video chat and group texting.Facebook says Messenger Kids provides a safer environment for children than many online experiences.

{"Headline": "Putting the Voters in Charge of Fair Voting", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesKatie Fahey is 28 and lives in a small village just outside Grand Rapids, Mich. She works as a program officer for the Michigan Recycling Coalition. In her spare time, she founded and leads a massive volunteer effort that could end partisan gerrymandering in Michigan.If you doubt that a private citizen can make a difference, meet Fahey.Like many others, Fahey anguished over America\u2019s growing polarization. After the 2016 elections, she resolved to do something. \u201cNobody trusted the system \u2014 on the right, on the left, on the middle,\u201d she said. \u201cI was nervous to go to Thanksgiving dinner. I didn\u2019t want another holiday to be ruined by divisiveness.\u201dEvery 10 years, states redraw their electoral districts for Congress and the state legislature. This is what we too often get: the Seventh Congressional District of Pennsylvania, meandering in a crazed H-like pattern through five counties near Philadelphia. (On Monday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the entire state\u2019s congressional map violated the state Constitution and would have to be redrawn by mid-February.)Why such eccentricity? Because the state legislature usually draws the map, and the majority party tries to draw it as favorably as possible. For example, Republicans will concentrate Democratic voters in one district \u2014 so that all the others will be safe seats for Republicans.By assuring incumbents of re-election, gerrymandering relieves them of worrying about what their voters think. They need to worry only about primary opposition, usually from more extreme candidates. Letting politicians choose their voters instead of the other way around robs people of their voice.\u201cIn a certain sense, redistricting is the spoils of war,\u201d said Samuel Wang, a professor of neuroscience and molecular biology at Princeton, who runs the Princeton project. \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate as long as it\u2019s a small advantage. But now we\u2019ve seen such a big distortion of the process.\u201dThat\u2019s why in Virginia\u2019s state government elections two months ago, Democrats didn\u2019t get to control the Legislature even though they won the statewide popular vote by nine points, a landslide. It\u2019s why Michigan Republicans got 16 more seats in their State Legislature than Democrats in 2016, even though the total vote in the state legislative races split down the middle. It\u2019s why North Carolina\u2019s Republican congressional candidates won 10 out of 13 seats with just 53 percent of the total vote. Democrats also gerrymandered in some states where they got the chance, Maryland being the starkest example. They just didn\u2019t have many chances.Then there are nonpartisan citizen campaigns that have nothing to do with Holder\u2019s group. Michigan\u2019s is the furthest along, but citizens are also organizing for ballot initiatives in Ohio, Missouri, Utah, Colorado and South Dakota. In Pennsylvania and Virginia, grass-roots groups sprang up to persuade legislators to establish independent commissions. Other gerrymandered states are still waiting for their Katie Fahey.Fair Districts PA is an arm of the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit that yielded Monday\u2019s ruling. The group will continue to campaign for fairer districts for the state Legislature, which was not covered in the lawsuit, and to insure a fairly drawn Congressional map. The legislative district map continues to pose a tough challenge: The Legislature must pass redistricting reforms in two consecutive sessions, followed by a successful ballot initiative. Nevertheless, reform has been doing pretty well; in the lower house of the Legislature, the bill had accumulated nearly enough co-sponsors to pass, including 30 Republicans.Why Republicans? One reason is we might see a Democratic wave this year; if it lasts until 2020, Democrats may be drawing the maps.\u201cHow do we win our country back? How do we get back to feeling heard?\u201d Kuniholm of Fair Districts PA said. \u201cThe system is allowing the leadership in both parties to ignore you. A person is not going to solve this for you. It\u2019s fixing the system.\u201d\u201cPeople instinctively get this,\u201d said Michael Li, senior counsel for democracy programs at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law. \u201cThe real disconnect is between political elites and what people on the ground know is fair.\u201dRose Reeder\u2019s story is proof. She is 70, a retired teacher. She has long been active in liberal causes, but she lives in rural Clinton County in central Pennsylvania, which voted 65 percent for President Trump.After hearing a speaker on gerrymandering at the library, Reeder called the board of county commissioners and asked to give a presentation at the commissioners\u2019 monthly meeting.She hadn\u2019t known much about the issue, but she read and prepared herself. She bought foam board at the dollar store and made eight posters. \u201cI prepared visuals \u2014 just as if I was back in the classroom,\u201d she said.On March 20, the commissioners \u2014 two Republicans and a Democrat \u2014 listened carefully to Reeder. At the next meeting, they voted unanimously to oppose gerrymandering and endorse an independent commission to draw district lines.That energized her. Clinton County has 29 municipalities. She decided to try to persuade all of them to take a similar position.The meetings were always at night, some of them two hours away, over gravel roads. \u201cThe hardest part was finding some of these places,\u201d she said. She went with her husband, Dan, and often with a friend, Joan Heller, who ended up doing seven presentations herself. \u201cI\u2019d go in, and they were looking tired and thinking \u2018I hope she hurries up,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAs I presented, I could see them sitting a little straighter, more attentive. I could see that they changed their attitude.\u201dShe had to visit three of the municipalities twice to convince them. But on Dec. 7, Reeder and the county commissioners presented 30 resolutions on the courthouse steps. All 30 governing bodies in a very red county were asking Pennsylvania\u2019s Legislature to pass a fair redistricting law.In Michigan, Voters Not Politicians held its first meeting on March 4, 2017, in Marquette, in the Upper Peninsula. They expected a few people and instead got 70 \u2014 standing room only in the public library. It was the first of 33 town hall meetings in 33 days, to ask people how they would design a fair system. V.N.P.\u2019s volunteers also looked at other states and consulted election law experts. They put together a proposal for a ballot initiative and asked for comments.The Board of State Canvassers approved the proposal on Aug. 17. Then V.N.P. had 180 days to collect 315,654 signatures (10 percent of the number of votes cast in the last governor\u2019s race).As in Pennsylvania, volunteers flooded in. V. N. P had no money; most of its donations come from volunteers themselves, and there still is no physical office or anyone to answer the phone. But Fahey estimates that 4,000 people collected or did data entries for signatures, and 10,000 people were involved in some way.Fahey and her colleagues organized signature collection as if it were a political campaign. They divided Michigan into 14 regions, each with a director and field captains. While the weather was warm, canvassers worked Labor Day parades and state fairs. They collected signatures at the Cheeseburger Festival in Caseville and the Labor Day parade in Detroit. They went to the Michigan-Michigan State football game and the Michigan-Ohio State game (Ohioans were canvassing for their own effort) and put up signs: \u201cWolverines and Buckeyes agree, voters should choose their politicians and not the other way around.\u201dAs it turned cold, canvassers had to move indoors, but some hardy ones still worked highway rest stops, their pens freezing. They asked businesses to display petitions for customers to sign.Rebecca Lenk, a financial analyst who lives outside Detroit, had volunteered before \u2014 but only at her church and PTA.\u201cI was terrified to talk to people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband said: \u2018What do you think they\u2019re going to do? Yell at you?\u2019\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be crying on the street.\u201dBut people were kind and receptive, she said. It helped to wear her \u201cHi, I\u2019m a volunteer\u201d button. She started carrying a petition with her all the time, just in case. She signed up her morning aerobics group.On Dec. 18, two months before the deadline, V.N.P. gave the secretary of state 425,000 signatures, from all 83 Michigan counties. The state must certify the petition, and there is likely to be a lawsuit by Republicans \u2014 which will be heard by Michigan\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a 5-2 Republican majority.If the petition survives, the next step is to get it passed in November. The group must intensify its field operation and start buying advertising, which will take money. The opposition will certainly be well organized and funded.There\u2019s still time before the 2020 election for other states to catch up. \u201cWe\u2019re in conversation about putting together a Fair Districts US coalition,\u201d Kuniholm said. \u201cSome things people learned could be helpful to others.\u201dIn an ordinary year, Li of the Brennan Center said, \u201cif you had said what Michigan did was possible with no paid canvassers, everyone would have laughed you out the door.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been an ordinary year, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to re-examine a lot of conventional assumptions about what is and isn\u2019t possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just a few days ago, a young writer, Moira Donegan, found herself anointed in the wake of a well-crafted and thoroughly absorbing essay she wrote for The Cut, in which she announced that she was the woman who had created the fabled list meant to steer women away from potentially dangerous men in the media. And yet this kind of success isn\u2019t scalable. It is nearly impossible to imagine a similar reception for a 25-year old woman who composed a powerful piece about how she came to believe in the moral necessity of, say, congestion pricing.When Joan Rivers died, the internet exploded because we could talk about what kind of feminist her comedy of self-loathing really made her. Mathilde Krim, who fought passionately against stigma and stereotyping and whose work saved tens of thousands of lives, left us with too little ambiguity \u2014 and presumably not enough wisdom on hooking up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Disney Deal Looming, Murdoch\u2019s Empire Is Fractured", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In late summer, Verizon Communications came to Rupert Murdoch with a surprise acquisition offer.Verizon \u2014 locked in battle with AT&T, which was then finalizing its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner \u2014 wanted to buy pieces of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s television and film conglomerate. Representatives of the two companies secretly met at least once to discuss a merger.Mr. Murdoch, 86, shrugged off the talks as uninspiring, according to an associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to maintain his access to the media titan. Verizon declined to comment, but the overture prompted Mr. Murdoch to start to think seriously \u2014 for the first time \u2014 about selling his Hollywood treasures.Not only would a sale solve a business problem, it could solve a family one.Fox News, the company\u2019s financial engine and a hugely influential platform for Republican politics, has been the source of family friction. James, who holds some progressive views, has privately expressed embarrassment about some elements of Fox News, including its sometimes skeptical coverage of climate change, according to the three people who are friendly with him, a stance not shared by his more conservative brother and father.It was becoming increasingly clear to many analysts, investors and Hollywood agents that the three-pronged leadership structure Mr. Murdoch had put in place was not going to work over the long term.The Murdochs declined to be interviewed for this article.Disney\u2019s offer also provided Rupert Murdoch with the opportunity to establish the like-minded Lachlan as his clear heir, putting him in a position to eventually take over Fox News, which Disney was not buying, and the family\u2019s other company, the newspaper-focused News Corporation.At first, Lachlan was unenthusiastic about discarding such a large chunk of the family\u2019s holdings, according to the four people with knowledge of the sales process. Disney would take the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, cable networks like National Geographic and FX, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India.Lachlan understood the threat posed by the technology giants, but he saw less need to rush into Disney\u2019s arms. Most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses were doing quite well.He had also just gotten his family settled in Los Angeles as part of the 2015 management arrangement. The primary property Disney was leaving behind \u2014 Fox News \u2014 was based in New York.Although Lachlan has not yet made a decision, Rupert has made it clear that he wants his elder son to run what they are calling New Fox, which will house Fox News and the other businesses left behind by Disney, including the Fox broadcast network and a chain of TV stations.What James will do is more of a mystery.People close to him say he may try to strike out on his own. Unlike his brother, James has never worked outside the family businesses, other than the hip-hop record label he founded after dropping out of Harvard. His father bought it, bringing James into the corporate fold.A senior job at Disney is also a possibility, but there were \u201cno guarantees of any sort,\u201d Rupert said in the Sky News interview.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said on a call with investors after the deal was announced. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dBeyond the family dynamics, the deal may allow James to finally vanquish memories of his role in the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. He was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff, but a parliamentary committee accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.Moreover, James is likely to emerge with a stake in Disney worth at least $1 billion.\u201cThat\u2019s a good return for putting up with your father for 20 years,\u201d Ms. Enders said.It has been suggested that Rupert could look at buying stations in political swing states, where there is a lot of money to be made in political advertising during election years, to say nothing of potential influence.Some have also mused that Mr. Murdoch may try to combine New Fox with News Corporation, the owner of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. In his interview with Sky News, he brushed aside the immediate possibility. \u201cThere\u2019s logic to it, but we\u2019re not planning it at this stage,\u201d he said.In any case, Mario Gabelli, a longtime media investor whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in 21st Century Fox shares, predicted that Rupert would relish having a voice at Disney, even if the deal did not come with a board seat.\u201cHe now becomes Disney\u2019s largest single shareholder,\u201d Mr. Gabelli said, \u201cwith an ax to grind.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}

The official theme this year is \u201cCreating a shared future in a fractured world.\u201dAll of which makes Mr. Trump the anti-Davos Man.\u201cTrump is as loathed by the elites of Western Europe as he is by the elites of Manhattan,\u201d said Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University and a longtime Davos attendee who is taking this year off.Who from the White House is supposed to be attendingHot topics at DavosThe deal between the two privately held companies ranks as one of the biggest liquor deals in recent years.Why Bacardi is doing the deal according to the WSJ:\u2022 Patr\u00f3n is the premium tequila market leader with U.S. sales of $1.6 billion in 2016, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.We here at DealBook will forgive if you don\u2019t. It has been a long time.So when was the last time the market fell 5 percent from a recent high? The aftermath of Brexit in June 2016.The statement is part of a legal settlement that Mr. Ford reached over the weekend with Morgan Stanley, according to a person who was briefed on the resolution but was not authorized to speak publicly. The broader contours of the settlement were unclear, including whether there was a financial component. Through a spokesman, Mr. Ford declined to comment.Before his firing last month, Mr. Ford had spent seven years at Morgan Stanley recruiting clients. He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006.Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014. At the time, Morgan Stanley said he had been fired \u201cfor conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.\u201d Some media reports of his firing said it had been triggered by the harassment allegation.Since Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point emerged as an investor in the Swiss food giant, Nestl\u00e9 has sold off its U.S. confectionary business, named new directors and bought Blue Bottle coffee.All of those have been great moves, according to the hedge fund. But there\u2019s more to be done, Third Point wrote in its latest letter to investors.From the investor letter:These actions are important steps in the right direction that make it clear that Nestle\u0301 is responding to calls for action. While we recognize that Nestle\u0301 has certain unique cultural and structural constraints, we hope now that Dr. Schneider has completed his first year and there is new blood on the Board, the company is able to move with greater alacrity.What Third Point wants\u2022 Better demonstrate that the company is focused on \u201cnutrition, health and wellness,\u201d with the implication being to divest products like ice cream and frozen pizza.\u2022 Buy back more shares.\u2022 Again consider selling the L\u2019Oreal stake, something Nestl\u00e9 has been loath to do historically.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMore from the article by Michael Kranish of the WaPo:\u201cAll I know is that we are not at all concerned, and we are cooperating,\u201d Kushner said in a half-hour interview at his headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue. \u201cAnd they can knock themselves out for the next 10 years reading those papers as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201dThe elder Mr. Kushner also lamented the amount of criticism that his son, a senior presidential adviser, has taken:\u201cI try not to focus in my life on the haters but it\u2019s just, I have never seen anything like this,\u201d Kushner said. \u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe transaction is expected to bolster the A.I.G.\u2019s general insurance business, by adding a reinsurance platform, an insurance-linked securities asset manager and \u201ca meaningful presence\u201d at the Lloyd\u2019s of London marketplace.Here\u2019s what Brian Duperreault, A.I.G.\u2019s chief executive, said:\u201cValidus is an excellent strategic fit for AIG, bringing new businesses and capabilities to our General Insurance operation, expanding the bench of our management team and deepening our underwriting expertise.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayRemember that earlier this month, Celgene agreed to pay up to $7 billion for Impact Biomedicines, which also makes a treatment for a kind of blood cancer.Celgene, which is based in Summit, N.J., already owns about 9.7 percent of Juno\u2019s shares.Here\u2019s what Mark Alles, Celgene\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayFrom a recent note by analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics:We would be astonished if Congress could not cobble together a majority of the sane in order to prevent a default. But astonishment has been quite common in response to events over the past couple of years, so investors would be well-advised to rule out nothing, however outlandish.Where things standElsewhere in WashingtonThe tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture.Improving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum.Yet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.So what gives? The tax law.Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201dExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.Two points of note:Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it\u2019s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.Mr. Chakrabarti added that while the company was slow to address Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s working to prevent it happening again.More news from FacebookThe tech flyaroundMore from the FT\u2019s Martin Arnold and Miles Johnson:Tiger Global appears to back Mr. Staley\u2019s view that the bank\u2019s 40 percent discount to book value is unjustified after it recently completed its multiyear restructuring and sold off most of its African operation to address longstanding concerns about its capital levels.UBS\u2019s turnaround hits a bumpMore from Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Matt Goldstein of the NYT:Officials from human resources interviewed as many as a dozen people who have worked with Mr. Malik. He left roughly two weeks before annual bonuses were to be handed out.The misconduct flyaroundHere\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, told Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:\u201cI would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus\u2019s worth of electricity consumption to global warming.\u201dSome, however, say an independent, decentralized monetary system is worth the cost.The virtual currency flyaround\u201cI truly believe I was put on this Earth to make money, but also to be generous with it.\u201dto tosaleAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what a few had to say.\u201cI strongly believe that we already have too many bike lanes. I have never seen more than two bikes in a bike lane. Frequently they are empty. I find many bicycles running red lights, on sidewalks and going in the wrong direction. In addition, I feel like the bike lanes are ageist. Bicycles are used exclusively by younger people, not seniors and definitely not the disabled.\u201d\u2014 Helene Polonsky, 65, Murray Hill\u201cPeople tend to complain about cyclist behavior, but it\u2019s important to point out that nearly all of the cyclists who were killed in 2017 were obeying the law when they died. A crosstown bike lane might have saved Dan Hanegby, who was killed by a bus driver who allegedly passed him too closely. I\u2019m thankful that the Department of Transportation is finally solving the problem of safe crosstown travel for New Yorkers on bikes.\u201d\u2014 Doug Gordon, 44, Park Slope, Brooklyn\u201cI live on the street with the proposed protected bike lanes. Although I\u2019m an avid Citi Biker and pro-safety, I know that the extra width on my block is super critical to allow fire trucks to pass traffic when they get called out. I\u2019m not looking forward to the blasting horns I will now hear because there is no \u2018passing lane.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Allison Robin, 35, Murray Hill\u201cIf people are really complaining about the loss of a few parking spaces, one might ask why that is an efficient use of public space. About 25 percent of Manhattan households own cars. Why does the city provide public space, free of charge, for storage of private property that is, for most people, a discretionary expenditure?\u201d\u2014 Jeremy M.

{"Headline": "Steamed Fish, Swimming in Flavor", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are many ways to approach a pescatarian dinner. The next time you buy a piece of fish for dinner, instead of pan-frying, poaching or broiling, why not consider steaming? It\u2019s fast, easy and makes a remarkably satisfying light meal.Chinese cooks have long been experts at steaming fish \u2014 especially whole fish, which may seem daunting. But boneless fillets are also excellent when prepared in the same way. The technique is not at all difficult to master, and the aromatics \u2014 like ginger, scallion and sesame oil \u2014 are readily available.Most vegetables, whether small potatoes or carrots or asparagus, benefit from steaming, which accentuates their innate sweetness. The same holds true for fish.Of course, spanking fresh fish is required. Look for white-fleshed fish such as halibut, sea bass or cod, preferably about two inches thick. In a pinch, you could use salmon, but avoid stronger-tasting fish (like mackerel) for this method.It\u2019s worth investing in a good steamer with a sizable diameter. One made of stainless steel, though expensive, will last a lifetime. The inexpensive bamboo steamers available in Asian markets are quite sturdy, though, and come in every size. However, a large wok with a lid works, too. It just needs a rack of some sort to hold what\u2019s being steamed well above the boiling water below. Chopsticks can do the job, or a cake rack propped up securely. Absent a wok, a wide deep skillet with a domed lid will suffice, or some pasta pots have a steamer basket included.In truth, the preparation for this fish dish takes longer than it does to cook, but not by much: The cooking itself takes only 10 minutes or so.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.First, you cut scallions and ginger into fine julienne, then stir up a little mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil, spiked with Shaoxing wine and a pinch of sugar. This makes a savory steam bath for the fish.Then, you put your fine fish fillet directly on the plate from which it will be served. It goes into the steamer for a brief spell and emerges succulent and aromatic. All you need is jasmine rice as an accompaniment.Though my recipe includes some toasted sesame oil, which is traditional, I used pistachio oil to finish and liked its nutty effect. It\u2019s not required, of course. With its topping of sizzled ginger, chopped pistachios and fluffy cilantro, the fish is both festive and fragrant.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "20 Wines Under $20: Touring the World, Familiar to Obscure", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWine comes in seemingly endless varieties, from a growing number of places and in countless styles. While the choices may sometimes seem overwhelming, they also present a wonderful opportunity for pleasure and experimentation.On a recent expedition through a handful of Manhattan shops, I found these 20 excellent bottles, all under $20. They come from eight different countries, and even more regions. Most of these are red, in deference to the season, when most people gravitate toward heartier dishes. But in winter I still eat foods that call for white wines, and I always like sparkling wines, so both are represented as well.The $20 price is crucial. Budget-minded shoppers may recoil, believing they can find plenty of bottles under $10. That\u2019s true, and most of those wines will be technically sound. They will also be boring, the scourge of mass-market wines today.By contrast, most of these are from small producers who work traditionally and sometimes iconoclastically. Wines like these cost a little more, from $15 to $25, but for that price, the level of interest and pleasure in the wines increases exponentially.Among these selections are merlot and chardonnay, seemingly the most mundane of wines, but delicious when carefully and conscientiously produced. Alongside are rarities, made from grapes like vespolina, xinomavro, vernatsch and persan, which have long local histories but are largely unknown in the United States. Why not give them a try?It\u2019s possible that some merchants will simply try to unload bottles they cannot otherwise sell. The best stores will not want to saddle you with rejects. They will honor your request and give you what they think is best for the price. That\u2019s how you get customers to return.Here are the 20 bottles, in no particular order.This sparkling Vouvray is foaming, voluminous and bone dry. While it tastes more like the grape than the place, with a true honeysuckle, herbal, chamomile flavor of chenin blanc, it is rich and satisfying enough for a cold and snowy day. (Zev Rovine Selections, Brooklyn, N.Y.)Meinklang is one of the more interesting and unusual Austrian estates. It farms biodynamically, as many good wineries do nowadays, but it strives for a true biodiversity, as is not always possible in monocultural areas like Burgundy. The results, in my experience, have been clear, pure wines like this bright blaufr\u00e4nkisch, with aromas of fresh, ripe dark fruits and a welcome touch of bitterness. (Artisanal Cellars, White River Junction, Vt.)This wine, the first I have had from this producer, was a revelation: juicy, fresh and full of energy, with aromas of dark fruits, graphite and minerals. It was made from cinsault grapes grown in granitic soils. The grapes were fermented and aged in terra-cotta amphorae, a traditional method in the Chilean countryside, according to the importer. (Broadbent Selections, Sonoma, Calif.)Another sparkling wine from the Loire, yet so different from the Vouvray. This beautiful pink p\u00e9tillant naturel is made from gamay grapes, bottled before the initial fermentation was completed. The carbon dioxide that was trapped in the bottle gives the wine its gentle sparkle. It smells like fresh strawberries and earth, and tastes slightly steely, in a good way. (T. Edward Wines, New York)In the old days, this might have been called a jug wine, in the best sense of the phrase. Indeed, the Tendu is sold in 1-liter bottles \u2014 there\u2019s added value. It\u2019s so delicious and low in alcohol (just 11.7 percent) that you\u2019ll want to gulp it down. It\u2019s an Italian-style blend of barbera, montepulciano and aglianico, plus some unidentified others. It\u2019s made without sulfur dioxide, a common stabilizer, yet I\u2019ve never seen a flawed bottle. Try it with burgers, pizza and even Cantonese food.The Muscadets of La P\u00e9pi\u00e8re are wonderful values year in and year out. This one is naturally made from melon grapes grown in granitic soil. It\u2019s rich and savory, with a spine of mineral and lemon flavors. While Muscadet is famously great with oysters, do not restrict yourself. It also goes well with other seafood and poultry dishes. Drink young or save for a decade. (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York)Foxglove is the value label from Varner, which makes excellent wines in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This is rich, ample California chardonnay, unadulterated by oak and made without the softening influence of malolactic fermentation, which turns firm malic acid into creamy lactic acid. The chardonnay is juicy, lively and full-bodied, not complex or subtle \u2014 just a big, clean wine that feels good.A nonvintage red? Why not, especially in an inexpensive wine like this one, where the aim is deliciousness and drinkability. It\u2019s spicy, brambly and precise, made mostly of merlot and cabernet franc, as well as trace amounts of cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and malbec. From the terrific Shinn Estate, which changed ownership last summer. With luck, that will be the extent of the changes.A rare bargain from the prestigious St.-\u00c9milion region, this is merlot from a Bordeaux point of view. As with all good Bordeaux, this is a refreshing drink of wine. At first it\u2019s a bit tight, but with time in the glass it becomes quite floral, with firm tannins, focused and linear. It\u2019s not an aperitif wine; drink it with food. (Polaner Selections)In contrast to the more delicate sorts of wines made in Ribeira Sacra from the red menc\u00eda grape, the menc\u00edas from Bierzo, grown in slate and clay like this one from Diego Losada, tend to be more robust. It\u2019s earthy, herbal and fruity, with a firm tannic spine, but also has a refreshing lift to it. Serve with roasted meats. (Jos\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines, Fairfax, Calif.)The Franz Gojer winery is also known as Gl\u00f6gglhof, which makes sense: You simply want to glug this red down. It is made from a grape called vernatsch in Tyrolean Italy, which is also known in Lombardy as schiava and in Germany as trollinger (a word derived from Tyrol). By whichever name, this wine is fresh, bright, floral and fruity, with refreshing, lively acidity. (Polaner Selections)Advertisement"}

(GroupM, where Mr. Norman remains a consultant, claims it\u2019s responsible for one out of every three ads worldwide.)While television and newspapers were the dominant forces in his native England when Mr. Norman started his career, he began working with online advertising in the mid-1990s, taking on challenges like increasing listings on search engines like Excite and AltaVista.Later, he guided brands and colleagues through the heydays of MSN and Yahoo and the rise of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and streaming TV. Along the way, Mr. Norman became known for sharing his insights at industry events and in trade publications, always with a healthy dose of dry British wit.Mr. Norman recently spoke with The New York Times about where the media and advertising worlds are now and where he thinks they are going. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.There is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.The people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.At the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters. Then it was held by this display triumvirate of Yahoo, MSN and AOL and, separately, search by Google. And it took quite a long time to get here.If you asked anyone in 2009, \u2018Guess what the combined market shares of Google and Facebook will be in 2017,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure there would have been anyone that would have come close.How long do you think will they maintain that position? It kind of depends on what Google and Facebook allocate their resources to, and like everybody else, it depends on how they manage to navigate actual and potential regulatory environments going forward. I think if they were both worried about a thing today, it would be what regulators think about them, because they\u2019re not at the peak of their popularity with those folks at the moment, it would seem to me.I think that\u2019s why people are so interested in the Amazon story and were so interested in the Snap story and were so interested in Twitter\u2019s story \u2014 because everyone\u2019s looking for the next one to break through.What\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to look and feel completely different that disrupts how people interface with the world around them? My guess is that five to seven years from now, there will be at least one company that people will think of in the top five most important enterprises in advertising that simply doesn\u2019t exist now.Imagine a massively emboldened Hulu.If Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.You could have things like day-after episodes of new drama of the Hulu model and then the entire movie libraries of Universal, Fox, Disney, Pixar and all of the other stuff with it.Then what happens if that same group of people says to the broadcasters of the world: \u201cWhat we have here is a working business model of what the studio system plus the broadcast system can look like in a new world, with a tiered-option model based on some combination of live, day-after, on-demand, paid, ad-funded and so forth, and basically you could slice it whichever way you\u2019d like for your market. We\u2019ve got the content block and the technology license block so that everyone can build their own castle in all these markets.\u201dIt may not be owned 100 percent by one company, but it could be a new phenomenon that could be a kind of distributed monopoly, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really thought about.And this could potentially run ads?Because you\u2019re using the same underlying systems, you suddenly have a data pool that crosses all of that content, all of those users and potentially all of those markets. People are asking the question about what\u2019s the third force? That would probably be the answer.What\u2019s another way that could go?I think if I learned one thing over my career, it is that Newton was right: The objects that are in motion stay in motion, and that motion tends to accelerate, hit plateaus and reaccelerate.Given the asymmetry of certain enterprises in the world, you kind of wonder as to whether or not new Disney, with all of its IP, has in fact become the juiciest peach in the world to be consumed by Apple.If Apple was going to make a \u201cone bound and you\u2019re serious\u201d move into the video content business globally, and the provision of video service business globally, it could make sense. You then have most of Hulu and all of the IP in Pixar, Marvel and all of the other things that Bob Iger has been assembling over the years, and you have ESPN. That wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place to start, and they could do it for 30 percent of their market cap.You can on one hand take it at face value and say that Facebook is taking a step back to their roots. The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.The one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?What have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that? It seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news. I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big appetite for Facebook saying, \u201cWe would like 20 news organizations to provide news bulletin programming for Facebook Watch.\u201dWe know there are dozens and dozens of news organizations around the world, or at least a dozen or two that include The Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, the BBC and so on, who are, for the most part, the keepers of truth in news and the people who keep the public informed.And it seems odd to me that if you have aspirations to take up a very significant part of the media consumption time of the public that you do not have an overt policy for the dissemination of news and to participate in the funding of news for your audience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "School Soccer Coach in California Charged With Trafficking Teenage Girls", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe call came in shortly before 3 a.m. on Christmas Day: A frightened 17-year-old girl, hiding in the backyard of a suburban California home, told the operator that she had been trafficked into prostitution by a man waiting for her in a nearby car.Police officers arrived and soon found the man sitting in a vehicle with a second girl, also 17, who they determined had also been trafficked, the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.The man, Elan Seagraves, was a soccer coach for the local school district, and he also worked as a driver for the ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft. He was arrested and charged with two felonies related to the trafficking and pimping of minors, said Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cI\u2019m a Soccer Coach, Bartender, and a Dad,\u201d Mr. Seagraves wrote on Facebook, where his profile picture on Wednesday showed a group of teenage girls in soccer uniforms. He identified himself on Facebook as a coach at John F. Kennedy High School in Sacramento as well as a coach and trainer at NorCal Elite Soccer Trainers, where employees did not return a phone call seeking comment.Alex Barrios, a spokesman for the Sacramento City Unified School District, said Mr. Seagraves had been an intermittent employee of the district and was fired on Thursday.He had worked since the fall as the coach of the varsity boys\u2019 soccer team, comprising mainly juniors and seniors, at Kennedy High School and was not a classroom teacher, Mr. Barrios said. Mr. Seagraves had also coached the boys\u2019 team from March to May 2016 and from January to March 2017.\u201cWe have let him go,\u201d Mr. Barrios said. \u201cAfter this announcement, we made the decision that he was not going to be able to fulfill his duties as a soccer coach.\u201dMr. Seagraves had previously worked for the district as a coach for the girls\u2019 junior varsity team, comprising mainly freshmen and sophomores, at the district\u2019s West Campus High School between September and October 2013 and again from February to May 2014, Mr. Barrios said. He did not know if either of the teenage victims in the case was a student in the school district.The school district has high levels of poverty and is in an area where trafficking has become a more high-profile issue in recent years, Mr. Barrios said.\u201cWe have invested so much into preventing instances of human trafficking,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very sensitive issue in Sacramento and for our district. We don\u2019t even know if these are our students, but as a partner in the region we have tried to do a lot.\u201dThe district was the only in the country to receive a $400,000 three-year grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice in 2016 to mentor child victims of sex trafficking and prostitution, Mr. Barrios said.It hired 10 college-age mentors in 2017 to work with young people and has also trained over 500 district staff in issues related to trafficking and child sex exploitation.A case manager hired in 2012 has worked with more than 100 young people since 2016, he said.Mr. Barrios said the district had no information about the victims. \u201cWe just hope they\u2019re O.K.,\u201d he said.Lyft and Uber both said Tuesday that Mr. Seagraves\u2019s accounts had been terminated, a move that effectively bars him from driving for them. Andrew Hasbun, a spokesman for Uber, said Mr. Seagraves had passed a background check in accordance with California law and had been driving for the company for two years.\u201cThese allegations are incredibly disturbing,\u201d said Scott Coriell, a spokesman for Lyft. \u201cOur concern is with the victims, and we stand ready to assist law enforcement in any way that we can.\u201dMr. Seagraves is being held at the Sacramento County Main Jail and his bail has been set at $2 million, the police said. The district attorney\u2019s office said his next hearing is on Thursday. It was not known if Mr. Seagraves had a lawyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orrin Hatch, Utah Senator, to Retire, Opening Path for Mitt Romney", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced Tuesday that he would retire at the end of the year, rebuffing personal pleas from President Trump to seek an eighth term and paving the way for Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s, to run for the seat.Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision marks another political setback for Mr. Trump, who lost a Senate seat in Alabama after his preferred candidates were rejected. He also faces an exodus of Republicans from both chambers of Congress and has been warned of a political typhoon in November.Mr. Romney\u2019s potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber.\u201cWhen there are things he agrees with him on, he\u2019ll be a big supporter,\u201d Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney\u2019s longtime fund-raiser, said of Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd when there are things he disagrees with, he\u2019ll voice that.\u201dMr. Hatch, 83, made his decision public on Tuesday afternoon via a video announcement.\u201cWhen the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter. I\u2019ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I\u2019ve brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.\u201dMr. Hatch was under heavy pressure from Mr. Trump to seek re-election and block Mr. Romney. Last month, Mr. Trump flew with Mr. Hatch, who has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most avid loyalists in the Senate, on Air Force One to Utah for a day of events that was aimed entirely at lobbying the senator to run again. At the request of the senator, the president announced that he was vastly shrinking two of Utah\u2019s sprawling national monuments, reversing decisions made by Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.And Mr. Trump used a speech in Salt Lake City to say that he hoped Mr. Hatch would \u201ccontinue to serve your state and your country in the Senate for a very long time to come.\u201dThen on Dec. 20, at a White House event celebrating passage of the comprehensive tax cut that Mr. Hatch helped write, the president pulled him aside to again ask him to run.The senator lauded Mr. Trump at the event, calling him \u201cone heck of a leader.\u201d\u201cWe are going to make this the greatest presidency we have seen, not only in generations, but maybe ever,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.But the presidential intervention failed. Mr. Hatch decided to retire after discussing the matter with his family over the holidays.That clears the way for the political resurrection of Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is now a Utah resident and is popular in the Mormon-heavy state, where he ran the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mr. Romney has told associates he would likely run if Mr. Hatch retires.\u201cHe\u2019d be a very difficult candidate to beat in Utah,\u201d said Michael O. Leavitt, a former Republican governor of Utah.Mr. Romney repeatedly assailed Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, calling him \u201ca fraud,\u201d and Mr. Trump returned the favor, stating that Mr. Romney \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in the 2012 race. The two had something of a rapprochement after the election when Mr. Romney was briefly considered as secretary of state, but after Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating statements that followed the racist and anti-Semitic violence in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, Mr. Romney regained his critical voice.When it comes to Mr. Trump, Mr. Leavitt said, Mr. Romney has \u201cnot been reluctant to speak his mind, and I can\u2019t imagine he would change in the Senate.\u201d\u201cAs Chairman of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees and as the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history, Senator Hatch has represented the interests of Utah with distinction and honor,\u201d he said.By Tuesday evening, Mr. Romney had updated his Twitter profile to change his location to Holladay, Utah, from Massachusetts.Mr. Romney intends to make his intentions known in a matter of weeks, according to an adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His senior campaign team will include Mr. Zwick; Matt Waldrip, who had been running Mr. Romney\u2019s annual policy retreats; and his former chief of staff, Beth Myers.Mr. Zwick did not confirm Mr. Romney would enter the race, but said that \u201cof all the people who can run, Mitt will represent and honor the legacy of Senator Hatch more than anybody.\u201dMr. Hatch, who briefly ran for president in 2000, amassed a distinguished record over his four decades in Washington and became a fixture in a Senate once noted for its bipartisanship. While considered an institution in his home state, Mr. Hatch was facing harsh poll numbers in Utah, where 75 percent of voters indicated in a survey last fall that they did not want him to run again.Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision comes just weeks after Mr. Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, a measure that the senator helped shepherd as chairman of the Finance Committee. The bill represented something of a capstone to Mr. Hatch\u2019s career, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, even deemed it as such last month in what was seen as a subtle effort to usher his colleague to the exit.Mr. Romney was unaware of Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision and of late had been operating under the assumption that the senator would run again, not even bringing up the possibility of a campaign while skiing Monday with friends in Utah.That is in part because Mr. Hatch had privately told Mr. Romney he was not sure he was ready to leave a seat he has held since 1977, and White House officials did all they could to nudge him into another campaign.The president has had Mr. Romney on his mind. Over golf last year, Mr. Trump asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, what he thought of the former Republican nominee. (Mr. Graham said he praised Mr. Romney and predicted he would be a solid senator.)\u201cIt would be good for Utah if Hatch, having finally caught the Great White Whale of tax reform, were to call it a career. If he doesn\u2019t, the voters should end it for him,\u201d the editorial concluded.In announcing his retirement, Mr. Hatch joined an exodus of Republican heavyweights in what promises to be a difficult election season. Also on Tuesday, Representative Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, disclosed that he planned to retire at the year\u2019s end. Mr. Shuster, 56, was facing a possible primary election challenge from the right and said his decision would allow him to focus exclusively on trying to steer major infrastructure legislation, a long-sought bipartisan priority, into law.Other retiring House chairmen include Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, of the Judiciary Committee; Jeb Hensarling of Texas, of the Financial Services Committee; and Lamar Smith of Texas of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.In all, 29 House Republicans have resigned, announced they will retire or run for another office, compared to 16 Democrats. Mr. Hatch joined Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, in announcing an end to his Senate career.Mr. Hatch defeated a Democrat 42 years ago this November, arguing that the incumbent had stayed in Washington too long, and became one of the country\u2019s most prominent senators for a generation. While he usually voted a conservative line, he also developed close relationships with his Democratic colleagues, most famously with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, the two collaborated on what became a landmark health care plan, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and Mr. Hatch even wrote a love song for Mr. Kennedy and his wife, Victoria, called \u201cSouls Along The Way.\u201d\u201cOrrin\u2019s long list of accomplishments means he will depart as one of the most productive members ever to serve in this body,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Changing. What Does That Mean for Your News Feed?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn short, you\u2019ll see more posts from friends that have spurred lively debates in the comments. And you\u2019ll see fewer cooking videos from brands and publications. Prioritizing what your friends and family share is part of an effort by Facebook to help people spend time on the site in what it thinks is a more meaningful way.Facebook is making the changes by tinkering under the hood, reconfiguring its algorithms that guess what you may be most interested in. Here\u2019s what it means for you.Facebook is not being coy about this: Those third-party organizations that took over large swaths of your News Feed years ago \u2014 sites that post funny pictures and memes, sell you clothing, or deliver articles about the world \u2014 will have the visibility of their posts scaled back under the new arrangement.Those who still want to see posts from their favorite brands and trusted, wonderful publishers, one of whose articles you may be reading at this very moment, will be able to. The options under the News Feed tab on Facebook will allow users to prioritize the pages (and friends) whose posts they are most interested in.And Mr. Mosseri explained that other posts that your Facebook connections find engaging will also rise to the top. Conversations stemming from live videos, celebrities\u2019 posts, private groups and other highly interactive post types will be among those highlighted on the new News Feed.Without that kind of explicit direction, though, Facebook\u2019s top priority will remain posts from your friends and family.Facebook will remain customizable, with the options that allow you to limit your exposure to certain people \u2014 even if those people are your pesky siblings or that one over-the-top uncle. One option is to quietly \u201csnooze\u201d a Facebook friend, which will cause their posts to disappear from your feed for 30 days.Implicit in the changes that Facebook introduced this week is that for many users, the News Feed had become mindless scrolling, moving from one autoplaying video to the next, without offering people much of substance. It was serving up junk food.In an interview with The New York Times, Mark Zuckerberg said that it was the company\u2019s expectation that many users would be gravitating to other sites to get their viral fix. But with more than two billion monthly users, Facebook has gained a foothold that allows it to play a longer game.

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Mr. Amazon, Steps Out", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "Mr. Bezos is the world\u2019s richest person and can afford virtually any luxury. But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age. He is 54, not 53.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "A Cake to Keep Your Sweet Tooth in Shape", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteBanana bread, baked in a loaf pan, is necessarily restrained \u2014 the kind of thing you feel good about eating for breakfast. Though it might have a thin glaze or sugar topping, it never has frosting. You might even spy healthful flecks of wheat germ or flaxseeds folded into the batter.Such nods to wholesomeness have no place in a banana cake.With towering layers covered in billowing frosting, banana cakes qualify as dessert, not breakfast \u2014 unless, of course, a sugar rush is your waking intention.This version is most definitely a cake: a fluffy, festooned pile of shaggy coconut and caramelized, buttery banana. With their rich, round tropical flavors, coconut and banana are beautifully complementary.The cake layers house the bananas, which are roasted until golden and syrupy before being mashed into the batter.Roasting the bananas is a clever trick I picked up from cooks on the internet. It intensifies their fruitiness and gives them toasted, caramelized notes. Roasting also helps along bananas that are not quite ripe enough to be turned into cake \u2014 the ones with peels that are mostly yellow rather than speckled brown. While riper is always better for banana cake (and banana bread for that matter), roasting gives you a slightly wider window of banana usability.The coconut appears in both the cake and the frosting. Fluffy and white, it is similar to a classic cream-cheese frosting, but coconut cream stands in for some of the cream cheese. Be sure to use pure coconut cream and not cream of coconut (which you\u2019d blend into a pi\u00f1a colada). If you\u2019re unsure, read the label; if there\u2019s any mention of added sugar, it\u2019s not the right stuff. You can also use pure, full-fat coconut milk if you can\u2019t find coconut cream; just chill and skim the solid cream off the top.Since this is a cake and not a quick bread, be sure to use sweetened shredded coconut rather than the unsweetened kind. Without sugar steeped into the flakes, they won\u2019t turn golden and crunchy in the oven the way you want.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Americans Were Afraid of Being Brainwashed", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe specter of Russian meddling in a United States presidential election \u2014 the fear that the Kremlin may have shaped the way Americans thought and voted \u2014 has electrified political life in the United States for the past 18 months. Those who hold the inviolability of electoral processes dear are understandably alarmed by evidence of foreign manipulation.But the level of anxiety surrounding Kremlin interference threatens to exceed the immediate object of concern. A little-remembered episode from the early Cold War may shed light on today\u2019s panic: Americans have a long history of fearing foreign subversion via mental manipulation.In the early 1950s, these concerns reached a new high with the captivity of some 7,000 American P.O.W.s during the Korean War. When a number of downed United States airmen recorded statements on behalf of the People\u2019s Republic of China claiming that they had engaged in germ warfare, many Americans became alarmed. Primed by recent show trials in newly Sovietized Eastern Europe that showed defendants like Hungary\u2019s Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty parroting confessions to trumped-up charges in a trance-like state, American audiences took the prisoners\u2019 rehearsed mea culpas as yet more evidence of a new Communist triumph: Scientists behind the Iron Curtain had apparently developed techniques that could wipe the mind clean and repattern behavior. Soon, processes of mental corrosion acquired a new and alarming sobriquet: \u201cbrainwashing.\u201dAmerican commentators struggled to say exactly how a brain might be washed or whether the spin cycle could be reversed. Some believed that hypnosis or psychotropic drugs were used to induce a trance-like state in American prisoners. Others proposed that Chinese and North Korean Communists, tutored by their Soviet peers, applied Pavlovian techniques to condition the reflexes of their captives, rewarding complicit behavior while punishing deviance. Whether brainwashed P.O.W.s were ideological converts or merely obedient bodies, disciplined by physical punishment, remained a matter of dispute among contemporary observers.But the vagueness of the concept served only to heighten hysteria. \u201cMenticide,\u201d announced the Columbia University psychiatrist Joost Meerloo, was a crime against humanity analogous to \u2014 or even worse than \u2014 genocide. The conceit spawned an array of nightmare scenarios. The worst of them appeared to be confirmed when 21 American prisoners refused repatriation after an armistice halted the Korean War in July 1953. Since a preference for \u201cRed China\u201d over America seemed inconceivable to many contemporaries, the conclusion was that the men must have been brainwashed. An unequivocal New York Times editorial in January 1954 evinced no doubt whatsoever. The \u201cnon-repatriates\u201d offered \u201cliving proof that Communist brainwashing does work on some persons,\u201d The Times informed its readers.A vast majority of American P.O.W.s who survived captivity did return home \u2014 as, eventually, did almost all of the 21 men supposedly lost to brainwashing. But many found themselves suspected as traitors or ideological termites, sent back by their Communist captors to hollow out American society from within. Insidious plots subsequently made popular by fiction \u2014 think \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d \u2014 appeared first in the pages of serious newsmagazines. In The Saturday Evening Post, Rear Adm. D. V. Gallery speculated that the Communists had expended so much energy on brainwashing American P.O.W.s to create a network of sleeper saboteurs awaiting activation. The Chinese, according to Admiral Gallery, had sown mental seeds they anticipated would \u201ctake root\u201d and sprout in 10 or 20 years should another depression grip America. \u201cThis may seem far-fetched to those of us who live from year to year,\u201d he acknowledged, before adding an Orientalist twist to his scenario. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t to Asiatics, who look at centuries as we do months.\u201dWhy did people take \u201cbrainwashing\u201d so seriously, despite the best efforts of prominent social scientists to debunk outr\u00e9 Pavlovian notions and the racist stereotypes often used to buttress them? And why does \u201celection hacking\u201d exert a comparable allure? Anxieties about external manipulation are not, of course, divorced from the demonstrable efforts of other powers to sway Americans\u2019 politically consequential behavior: The theft and distribution of Democratic National Committee emails was real enough, as was the Chinese effort to win converts among captive Americans imprisoned in North Korea. But \u201celection hacking\u201d and \u201cbrainwashing\u201d share an aura of dark magic that obscures the precise mechanics believed to be at work in shaping the thoughts and actions of freethinking adults. And obscurity provides fertile soil in which conspiracy theories flourish. When everything is, or may be, a form of \u201celection hacking,\u201d the techniques appear worrisomely diffuse. So, too, do the agents of a phenomenon variously attributed to Russian trolls, Twitter-bots, Facebook ads, a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d in the White House or American idiocy more generally.Anxiety over new technology also helps explain how concerns over foreign mental meddling metastasized in both the 1950s and present-day United States. Then as now, Americans fretted not only over the Kremlin\u2019s machinations but also over the ways in which a pervasive new medium was simultaneously bringing people closer while turning living rooms into isolated bubbles. Where today we devote acres of type to parsing the antisocial pitfalls of social media, anatomists of the \u201950s rued the destructive potential of television \u2014 whether to empower populist maniacs or induce Americans to crave new consumer goods they neither wanted nor needed. Now we ponder mysterious algorithms that mine our every online keystroke for lucrative potential; then, Americans got wise to techniques of \u201csubliminal suggestion\u201d that advertising wizards apparently employed to turn psychic soft spots into sales.Fears of external manipulation tap into deep-seated human anxieties over individual autonomy. It can be terrifying to envision the mind as porous and malleable, just as it\u2019s alarming to contemplate state sovereignty as fragile and violable. But fantasies of invasion also exert a horror-show allure that threatens to cloud sober judgment about what ails democracy and how best to remedy it.Perhaps the most surprising twist to the 1950s brainwashing scare is how quickly Americans lost interest in the brutality of P.O.W. camps and turned instead to self-criticism. An increasingly affluent society was excoriated as soft, degenerate and vulnerable, while Americans were called (by other Americans) flabby and gullible dupes. The enemy without was recast as an enemy within. Curiously, at the height of the Cold War, Americans reserved their most scathing critique for fellow citizens. It would be unfortunate if the current wave of panic over Russian interference ended in fiercer excoriation of American \u201cdeplorability,\u201d without generating more productive ideas for reinvigorating deliberative democracy.Susan L. Carruthers is a professor of American history at the University of Warwick in England and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Good Occupation: American Soldiers and the Hazards of Peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Say When You Meet the Angel of Death at a Party", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "OpinionAfter years of living with stage IV cancer, I have some suggestions.Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 EVERY 90 days I lie in a whirling CT machine, dye coursing through my veins, and the doctors look to see whether the tumors in my liver are growing. If they are not, the doctors smile and schedule another scan. The rhythm has been the same since my doctors told me I had stage IV colon cancer two and a half years ago. I live for three months, take a deep breath and hope to start over again. I will probably do this for the rest of my life. Whatever that means.When my scan is over, I need to make clear to my friends and my family that though I pray to be declared cured, I must be grateful. I have three more months of life. Hallelujah.So I try to put the news in a little Facebook post, that mix of sun and cloud. I am trying to clear the linguistic hurdles that show up on my chart. Noncurative. Stage IV. I want to communicate that I am hoping for a continued \u201cdurable remission\u201d in the face of no perfect cure, but the comments section is a blurry mess of \u201cYou kicked cancer\u2019s butt!\u201d and \u201cGod bless you in your preparations.\u201dI was recently at a party in a head-to-toe Tonya Harding costume, my blond wig in a perfect French braid, and a woman I know spotted me from across the dance floor.\u201cI guess you\u2019re not dying!\u201d she yelled over the music, and everyone stopped to stare at me.\u201cI\u2019m working on it!\u201d I yelled back, after briefly reconsidering my commitment to pacifism.We all harbor the knowledge, however covertly, that we\u2019re going to die, but when it comes to small talk, I am the angel of death. I have seen people try to swallow their own tongue after uttering the simple words \u201cHow are you?\u201d I watch loved ones devolve into stammering good wishes and then devastating looks of pity. I can see how easily a well-meaning but ill-placed suggestion makes them want to throw themselves into oncoming traffic.A friend came back from Australia with a year\u2019s worth of adventures to tell and ended with a breathless \u201cYou have to go there sometime!\u201d He lapsed into silence, seeming to remember at that very moment that I was in the hospital. And I didn\u2019t know how to say that the future was like a language I didn\u2019t speak anymore.Most people I talk with succumb immediately to a swift death by free association. I remind them of something horrible and suddenly they are using words like \u201cpustules\u201d at my child\u2019s fourth-birthday party. They might be reminded of an aunt, a neighbor or a cousin\u2019s friend. No matter how distant the connection, all the excruciating particularities of this person\u2019s misfortune will be excavated.This is not comforting. But I remind myself to pay attention because some people give you their heartbreak like a gift. It was a month or so into my grueling chemotherapy regimen when my favorite nurse sat down next to me at the cancer clinic and said softly: \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you. I lost a baby.\u201dThe way she said \u201cbaby,\u201d with the lightest touch, made me understand. She had nurtured a spark of life in her body and held that child in her arms, and somewhere along the way she had been forced to bury that piece of herself in the ground. I might have known by the way she smoothed all my frayed emotions and never pried for details about my illness. She knew what it was like to keep marching long after the world had ended.What does the suffering person really want? How can you navigate the waters left churning in the wake of tragedy? I find that the people least likely to know the answer to these questions can be lumped into three categories: minimizers, teachers and solvers.The minimizers are those who think I shouldn\u2019t be so upset because the significance of my illness is relative. These people are very easy to spot because most of their sentences begin with \u201cWell, at least \u2026.\u201d Minimizers often want to make sure that suffering people are truly deserving before doling out compassion.My sister was on a plane from Toronto to visit me in the hospital and told her seatmate why she was traveling. Then, as she wondered when she had signed up to be a contestant in the calamity Olympics, the stranger explained that my cancer was vastly preferable to life during the Iranian revolution.Some people minimize spiritually by reminding me that cosmically, death isn\u2019t the ultimate end. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, in the end, whether we are here or \u2018there.\u2019 It\u2019s all the same,\u201d said a woman in the prime of her youth. She emailed this message to me with a lot of praying-hand emoticons. I am a professor at a Christian seminary, so a lot of Christians like to remind me that heaven is my true home, which makes me want to ask them if they would like to go home before me. Maybe now?Atheists can be equally bossy by demanding that I immediately give up any search for meaning. One told me that my faith was holding me hostage to an inscrutable God, that I should let go of this theological guesswork and realize that we are living in a neutral universe. But the message is the same: Stop complaining and accept the world as it is.The second exhausting type of response comes from the teachers, who focus on how this experience is supposed to be an education in mind, body and spirit. \u201cI hope you have a \u2018Job\u2019 experience,\u201d one man said bluntly. I can\u2019t think of anything worse to wish on someone. God allowed Satan to rob Job of everything, including his children\u2019s lives. Do I need to lose something more to learn God\u2019s character? Sometimes I want every know-it-all to send me a note when they face the grisly specter of death, and I\u2019ll send them a poster of a koala that says, \u201cHang in there!\u201dThe hardest lessons come from the solutions people, who are already a little disappointed that I am not saving myself. There is always a nutritional supplement, Bible verse or mental process I have not adequately tried. \u201cKeep smiling! Your attitude determines your destiny!\u201d said a stranger named Jane in an email, having heard my news somewhere, and I was immediately worn out by the tyranny of prescriptive joy.A tragedy is like a fault line. A life is split into a before and an after, and most of the time, the before was better. Few people will let you admit that out loud. Sometimes those who love you best will skip that first horrible step of saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you.\u201d Hope may prevent them from acknowledging how much has already been lost. But acknowledgment is also a mercy. It can be a smile or a simple \u201cOh, hon, what a year you\u2019ve had.\u201d It does not ask anything from me but makes a little space for me to stand there in that moment. Without it, I often feel like I am starring in a reality program about a woman who gets cancer and is very cheerful about it.After acknowledgment must come love. This part is tricky because when friends and acquaintances begin pouring out praise, it can sound a little too much like a eulogy. I\u2019ve had more than one kindly letter written about me in the past tense, when I need to be told who I might yet become.But the impulse to offer encouragement is a perfect one. There is tremendous power in touch, in gifts and in affirmations when everything you knew about yourself might not be true anymore. I am a professor, but will I ever teach again? I\u2019m a mom, but for how long? A friend knits me socks and another drops off cookies, and still another writes a funny email or takes me to a concert. These seemingly small efforts are anchors that hold me to the present, that keep me from floating away on thoughts of an unknown future. They say to me, like my sister Maria did on one very bad day: \u201cYes, the world is changed, dear heart, but do not be afraid. You are loved, you are loved. You will not disappear. I am here.\u201dKate Bowler is an assistant professor at Duke Divinity School, the author of \u201cEverything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I\u2019ve Loved\u201d and the host of the forthcoming podcast \u201cEverything Happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Saba\u2019s in Melbourne, Australia", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare8 PhotosMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Brunswick Street in Fitzroy is known as Melbourne\u2019s epicenter of hipsterdom, a stretch of boutiques and bars and cafes catering to the young and fashionable. In many ways, Saba\u2019s, a restaurant that sits smack in the middle of it all, adheres to the neighborhood\u2019s trendy reputation. The design is sleek and simple, with bright pops of color on the wall in the form of vibrant woven plates. The customers are youthful, as expected, but the crowd is far more diverse than it is elsewhere in the area.Ms. Alemayoh recalls a childhood of trips to Ethiopia to visit family, returning to Australia with suitcases packed with spices and traditional Ethiopian teff flour, brought in part to cook for a sister who has celiac disease. (Teff flour is gluten free.) Saba\u2019s opened in 2015, and Ms. Gebre remains the restaurant\u2019s main cook, with two cousins helping out as needed.The menu declares that the people in the kitchen cook from their own knowledge and have no written recipes. \u201cHope that they don\u2019t get sick!\u201d it jokes, which on first read seems like an alarmingly honest admission about the perils of food-borne illness. But it is meant to say that if Ms. Gebre and her family were unable to come to work, the restaurant would have no food. There is no recreating the recipes held only in their minds and hands.The food at Saba\u2019s is served in the traditional Ethiopian manner. Injera bread forms the base of any meal, both literally and figuratively. The injera here is made from teff flour that the restaurant imports itself and has available for purchase. It is allowed to ferment long enough to produce a flat, spongy bread that, at its best, is deeply tangy and lightly bouncy, adding a pleasant sour note to every bite of food.The sense that you\u2019re eating a lovingly prepared home-cooked meal begins with katania, a dish that the menu describes as \u201cthe snack given to impatient kids when mum is cooking.\u201d It is effectively a chile sandwich, with triangular strips of injera held together by a paste made of salty, spicy butter turned deep red by Ethiopian chile powder.The main meal is served on those large colorful woven baskets as a shared platter, over a large round of injera. The menu offers many hearty and deeply flavored stews, which you can order as vegetarian or meat combos, or individually. Bamya, lamb cooked with okra and beriberi \u2014 the Ethiopian spice mix of onions, garlic, mustard seeds, ginger and more \u2014 is pure, deep comfort, and vegetable dishes like fava beans with egg, or pumpkin cooked in chile, are brightly flavored and distinct. Chopped Chinese broccoli spiked with garlic serves as a vibrant green foil to the meat and bean dishes, and salata dakwa, a Sudanese salad of cucumber and tomato dressed in peanut sauce, provides cooling balance.If you get the ratio just right \u2014 enough warming stewy things, a few contrasting vegetables, a salad for crunch \u2014 it\u2019s possible to assemble a devastatingly delicious meal here. It is one of those places where you can sense the love and personality of the cook in the food, where everything tastes as though it has been fussed over until it is just right.Ms. Alemayoh and her small staff of family and close friends are an effervescent presence in the restaurant. The young women greet most customers, and when the room gets full it has the air of a celebratory gathering, with people calling out to one another as they arrive and Ms. Alemayoh drifting from table to table, offering embraces and conversation.It would be possible to live in Fitzroy and frequent the establishments along Brunswick Street and ignore this growing cultural influence on the neighborhood. It would be possible to walk by Saba\u2019s and not see the thriving community that is represented by this restaurant. But you\u2019d be missing out.An earlier version of this article misstated the address of Saba\u2019s Ethiopian Restaurant. It is 328 Brunswick Street, not 28 Brunswick Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angie Mar\u2019s Menu: Red Meat and Respect", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAngie Mar stood at her kitchen\u2019s narrow steel pass on a recent Saturday, gliding through a dinner rush that wouldn\u2019t let up until close to midnight.\u201cMy loves,\u201d she announced, \u201ccoming my way I\u2019ve got one branzino, two c\u00f4tes de b\u0153uf \u2014 one rare, one medium \u2014 one poutine, and in six minutes, a duck for two with a lamb chop and a tartiflette going with a porterhouse, and in 11 minutes I\u2019d like a full clean down of the kitchen.\u201d\u201cYes, chef,\u201d five cooks replied in unison.Ms. Mar, who had been cooking for less than a decade, did this by following her culinary North Star \u2014 meat, in all its glory \u2014 and her own sumptuous, grand cooking sensibility, defying the movement in fine dining toward delicate vegetable-focused compositions; spills of light, colorful juices; and handmade ceramics.Her aesthetic is full of old-fashioned references; of whole animals or big, fatty cuts on the bone; and of sauces \u2014 rich, sticky, reinforced sauces that Escoffier might recognize. Her dishes are served with grace and gusto, often in immense portions, on vintage silver and crystal that she picks out at flea markets in London.\u201cWhat we do at the Beatrice is not for everyone, and I\u2019m 100 percent O.K. with that,\u201d she said. She occasionally posts photographs on Instagram in which she\u2019s gnawing the meat off bones (which she encourages her diners to do, too) or relaxing with a leftover venison pie from the restaurant, on the unmade bed of her Upper West Side apartment. The images are an extension of Ms. Mar\u2019s brand \u2014 joyful celebrations of style and appetite.(On Tuesday, after this article was published, a former bartender at the restaurant filed suit in New York alleging wage theft by Ms. Mar and her company, Butcher\u2019s Block Hospitality. Reached on Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Mar said her restaurant did everything by the book.)To achieve an effect of effortlessness, Ms. Mar puts in constant, meticulous work behind the scenes. She has set a standard for acceptable parsley leaves (dainty, feathery soft). And once a month, she puts on a heavy coat to treasure-hunt in the freezing meat lockers at Pat LaFrieda\u2019s New Jersey warehouse, picking out her favorite cuts of beef (hulking, marbled with fat).During the dinner rush, as the printers spat more tickets full of orders, Ms. Mar directed the frenetic kitchen with a composed intensity. She pressed a long needle into a lobe of foie gras, then to her lip, to check its temperature. She inspected every open oyster on its way to the dining room.Was the adductor muscle completely unattached? Was the mantle neatly in place? Was there a rogue piece of shell hiding somewhere, anywhere, inside? On one occasion, yes \u2014 a fragment, no longer than an eyelash, which she immediately fished out.\u201cMr. de la Rosa,\u201d she said to a server, holding up the shard on her fingertip, \u201cWould you like to take this downstairs and show it to them?\u201dHer aim, she says, is to provide her team with the training, support and guidance she couldn\u2019t always find for herself as a young cook. For restaurant culture to shift in a meaningful way, Ms. Mar believes it is just as vital for her to mentor men as women.Ms. Mar sometimes uses honorifics \u2014 Mr. and Ms., ladies and gentlemen \u2014 to address her team, with the archaic formality of a professor. She and her managers also carve out time each day to discuss an informal curriculum of books, films and restaurant reviews, as well as techniques and inspirational quotations, with the entire staff.Afterward, Ms. Mar met with her wine consultant, Nathan Wooden, to test dishes under development. The staff seated her, as if she were a guest, and Ms. Mar took notes on the back of her menu, writing down questions and ways to improve not only on flavors and presentations, but also on the introductory monologue a server gives to each table (which she determined to be a smidgen too long).Just a few weeks earlier, she had tapped a 19-year-old server, Emma Arango, to train as a chef de salon, adding tableside service to her responsibilities. Tonight Ms. Arango was in a black suit, shaving truffles over hamburgers, flamb\u00e9ing whole ducks, carving lamb.\u201cLook at her go,\u201d Ms. Mar said with pride. \u201cShe\u2019s going to run one of my restaurants one day.\u201dMs. Mar had asked the kitchen to plate two versions of a langoustine cocktail she was fine-tuning \u2014 one with the sharp shell still on, the other ready to eat.\u201cThe problem is, do most people want to go through all this?\u201d Ms. Mar asked, cracking open a shell-on one with her hands, with ease, dipping the meat in butter, and then tipping it back for a taste of the brains. No, she decided, and went with the version that would require more work in the kitchen, but less in the dining room.The langoustine had been developed, like all new dishes, through a series of weekly workshops that Ms. Mar runs with her sous-chef, Nicole Averkiou, and head chef, Ed Szymanski.In the earliest stages of a new dish, Ms. Mar draws out a word web in Sharpie, on printer paper, throwing words out, circling them, squashing them together in different sequences, discussing all the possible variations out loud.\u201cWhat else do we want? Truffles. Smoke. Chocolate.\u201d\u201cRed things,\u201d Mr. Szymanski said. \u201cAll things red.\u201d\u201cCherries?\u201d she asked.Ms. Mar was born in Seattle, where her family bought cherries grown in Eastern Washington from the stands on Beacon Avenue. As a girl, she would sit in the back seat of the car, spitting pits out of the window.\u201cI still look for that meaty texture,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the ones from Yakima, when you bite into them, they\u2019re almost steaklike. The skins are snappy, like sausage casing.\u201dHer paternal grandparents had come from China, and their experience was shaped by the racist immigration laws of the early 20th century, including the Chinese Exclusion Act. When they died, Ms. Mar\u2019s father was one of 10 children left orphaned. Raised by his siblings, he grew up in poverty.\u201cMy aunt used to send my dad to the back doors of restaurants in Chinatown to ask for scraps to eat,\u201d Ms. Mar recalled.By the time Ms. Mar was a child, growing up in south Seattle, her father, a dentist, was cooking at home with generosity and devotion: T-bone steaks during the week, smoked ducks at Christmastime, and on the weekends, braised pork shoulders in milk \u2014 a recipe she has adapted for the restaurant.In a quiet moment downstairs, Ms. Mar set a 28-pound rack of beef on the counter with a thud, and cut it loose from a net of twine. For five months now, she had been soaking the meat in whiskey, drawing out the aging as thrill-seeking butchers did in the 19th century.The beef was beautiful, but unconventionally so, speckled all over with a splendid, powdery mold. Another variety bloomed in the curves of its bones, flossy and sheer and caramel-colored.Ms. Mar cut it open and shaved a few pieces of the meat inside. Raw, unseasoned, the slivers were mouthwatering and faintly alcoholic, like a ripe, washed-rind cheese.\u201cThis one\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, signaling to Ms. Averkiou.After dinner service, at 1:30 in the morning, Ms. Mar and her cooks were done for the night, but they didn\u2019t leave. Instead, they gathered in the back dining room and took turns discussing what they wanted to improve on, and what they got right \u2014 with immediate feedback from Ms. Mar.\u201cI need to not shut down when I make a mistake,\u201d said Duncan Burgin, who had to return a lobe of foie gras to the heat when Ms. Mar noted that it was slightly underdone.\u201cI\u2019m working on getting faster,\u201d said Kevin Huffman, the newest cook in the kitchen, fresh out of culinary school.\u201cYou\u2019re definitely picking up speed,\u201d Ms. Mar agreed. \u201cAt the beginning on a new station, you always work on getting it perfect, and then you work on getting faster. Awesome. Who\u2019s next?\u201dMs. Mar asked her cooks to share notes on their favorite chefs of the moment, and the conversation was easy and earnest. Ms. Mar went last.\u201cSo she wasn\u2019t exactly a chef, but I chose Julia Child,\u201d she said.\u201cI knew it!\u201d Diana Lee, another cook, shouted. \u201cI knew it!\u201d\u201cHer boeuf bourgignon was the first braise I ever mastered,\u201d said Ms. Mar, who had watched Child on television and cooked from her books as a teenager, with her father, long before she was on the lookout for Michelin inspectors in her own dining room.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder this year, as we chase stars and awards, and we keep on pushing, we don\u2019t lose sight of who we are.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the weight of the steaks aged in whiskey at the Beatrice Inn. They are 35 ounces, not 350 ounces, and up.cookingslide showAdvertisement"}

Schwartz, the dean of List College, said in a statement. \u201cAbove all, she was deeply passionate about the environment.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Dr. Schwartz said that Hannah was in her second year at the college and had not yet declared a major, although she was involved in environmental sustainability studies and Jewish thought and ethics.In telephone interviews, David and Alexis Lerner, resident directors of a dormitory at the college who knew Hannah, said she had successfully petitioned the school to install bins and freezers for residents to collect materials for composting.\u201cShe is brave, and bold,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cShe had a lot of a clear perspective on the role of a university for young people. She sort of saw it in a big picture. She was certainly a leader.\u201dThe Weisses had a piano in their home, and Hannah and Ari took music lessons from Steve Rosicky, a local musician. They both played the ukulele and the guitar, and Ari had recently taken up songwriting. Ari hoped to create a full album; they had three songs mostly finished before Ari left for Costa Rica, Mr. Rosicky said.\u201cHe was so special to me,\u201d Mr. Rosicky said. \u201cHis songs were so honest and so true.\u201dRebecca Gorman, who attended Seeds of Peace camps in Maine with William Steinberg, said his world travels and loving family had given him confidence and wisdom beyond his years, whether navigating conversations among children from countries in conflict or just listening to friends.\u201cWhenever he would speak, it left you with an impression for the rest of the day,\u201d said Ms. Gorman, who is 19. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to accept that more people didn\u2019t get to see what a wonderful young man he was.\u201dLeslie Adelson Lewin, the executive director of Seeds of Peace, said that William had \u201cambitions for a political career that were formed at Seeds of Peace\u201d and that his mother was especially passionate about the organization because she had a background in social work.The family loved music, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was the theme of a surprise birthday party the family gave for Bruce, who turned 50 on Nov. 30. Their youngest son, who was in the eighth grade, was an accomplished musician known for his singing.\u201cThey were an incredibly tight-knit family who just loved to explore, loved to live life,\u201d said Paul Rubin, a family friend. \u201cThey traveled extensively, but also gave their time extensively.\u201dThe 10th passenger on the plane was Amanda R. Geissler, 33, who was in her first year as a guide for Backroads, which has provided \u201cactive travel\u201d experiences in Costa Rica for more than 25 years. Her LinkedIn profile said she was based in Salt Lake City and had received undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Wisconsin.\u201cAmanda\u2019s passion and ability to genuinely connect with people, in addition to her leadership, made her a rising star at Backroads,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday.The names of the crew members have not been formally released, but Laura Chinchilla, a former president of Costa Rica, said her cousin Juan Manuel Retana was the pilot.The earlier crash, on Sept. 5, killed a Costa Rican woman and an American man. Four other people survived that crash, which remains under investigation.Enio Cubillo Araya, the director general of Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation agency, said in a phone interview that the two crashes appeared to have been isolated episodes and not symptomatic of a deeper problem. Nature Air, founded in 1990, did not respond to phone and email messages requesting comment.\u201cThe country and the aviation industry are in mourning,\u201d Mr. Cubillo said. \u201cThe government of Costa Rica stands in solidarity with the relatives of those who lost their loved ones during this holiday.\u201dHe said that investigators did not yet know the cause of the crash but that early theories include mechanical malfunction, human error and the possibility that a raft of wind, common in the area this time of year, may have destabilized the small plane. Weather and visibility were ideal, he added.Idier Porras Guzm\u00e1n, 51, who lives in a tiny hamlet by the beach near Nandayure, on the country\u2019s northwest coast, said he and his relatives had been celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve when they were startled by a plane flying unusually low overhead.\u201cWe all noticed it was too low,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cWe said, \u2018How weird,\u2019 and then three or four seconds later, we heard a loud thud.\u201dMr. Porras said he and others staying with him had run toward the sound of the explosion, about 1,000 feet from their modest rental houses. The plane crashed in a hilly area planted with teak, he said.\u201cWhen we got to the site, the plane was consumed by flames,\u201d said Mr. Porras, who first shared his account with the Costa Rican newspaper La Naci\u00f3n. \u201cIt was totally disintegrated. Only part of the tail was visible.\u201dRuss Buettner contributed reporting from New York, and Arielle Stevenson from Belleair, Fla. Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Lawmaker Who Called Muslims \u2018Rapist Hordes\u2019 Faces Sanctions", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A right-wing German lawmaker was temporarily blocked by Twitter after she referred to \u201cbarbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men,\u201d and prosecutors are now looking into whether her remark violated the country\u2019s hate-speech laws.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of police in NRW tweeting in Arabic,\u201d Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. \u201cAre they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men?\u201dFacebook later removed that post, Ms. von Storch told her followers. She vowed not to be silenced by the new law, but to continue to \u201ccall out problems by name.\u201d She went on to insist that the young men who had sexually harassed German women were \u201cnot Protestant Swedes, not Catholic Poles, not Orthodox Russians, not Jewish Israelis and not Buddhist Thais. The overwhelming majority of them are young Muslim men for whom women and followers of other faiths are second-class citizens.\u201dThe party ran on a platform arguing that Islam was incompatible with the German Constitution.Ulf Willuhn, a spokesman for state prosecutors, said on Tuesday that his office had been alerted to Ms. von Storch\u2019s statement by the Cologne police and was also looking into a statement of support for her, made by a leader of the party, Alice Weidel. As news of the investigation spread, private citizens filed dozens more complaints.Unlike the United States, Germany has very strict laws governing hate speech and comments that denigrate ethnic and religious groups, a legacy of its dark, totalitarian past. The new law regarding social media companies solidified the country\u2019s position as one of the most aggressive in moving against online hate speech.Prosecutors must now decide whether there is sufficient evidence of criminal action to open a formal investigation that could lead to charges, Mr. Willuhn said. But before that step can be taken, Germany\u2019s Parliament would have to lift immunity.Many of the Alternative for Germany\u2019s followers are active on social media, and the party claims nearly three times as many followers on Facebook than either of the country\u2019s two largest parties, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats or the center-left Social Democrats.Digital and human rights groups and others had warned that the new law \u2014 which was passed last year, but fully took effect on Monday \u2014 placed too much of the burden of patrolling the internet on companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Snapchat. Under the law, the companies are required to to remove any content that is illegal in Germany \u2014 such as Nazi symbols or Holocaust denial, but also any remarks that could be considered calling for incitement \u2014 within 24 hours of it being brought to their attention.Within 24 hours of its posting, Facebook had removed the video and closed the man\u2019s account, citing its content. The company later restored the post and apologized for the error, but only after dozens of users had complained about the decision.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Child a Phone \u2018Addict\u2019?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI have spent the past 15 years helping teens with organization and time management. Many parents of kids I work with are conflicted about their teens\u2019 smartphone use. They appreciate the convenience of having access to their children and the potential safety benefits. And, in an age of social media socialization, teenagers use messaging apps to stay in touch with friends and make social plans, some of which can be positive.When a high school student I work with broke his neck playing football this past fall, his smartphone became a crucial link not just to friends, but also to others dealing with similar injuries. After watching videos of others documenting their recovery on YouTube, he connected with some via Facebook Messenger and began conversations he found \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201dFor some teens, the constant potential feedback loop from notifications and messaging might create a fear of missing out, or FOMO. And although there is currently no official medical recognition of \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d as a disease or disorder, the term refers to obsessive behaviors that disturb the course of daily activities in a way that mirrors patterns similar to substance abuse.In my work with students, I\u2019ve found that even teenagers who want to curb their phone use may find it difficult to self-regulate without parental guidance. Creating daily and weekly offline time as part of the family routine is helpful, and finding a way to have a once- or twice-yearly extended period of time off \u2014 at a summer camp or outdoor expedition without Wi-Fi, or on a family trip \u2014 may provide the reset teens need to break negative habits.For parents thinking of getting their kids smartphones, providing incremental and compartmentalized access can help establish good habits and prevent problematic dependency. Parents sometimes hand down their old iPhones as a first phone for a child in elementary school. I encourage parents to get their kids flip phones first, and wait until they have developed good overall habits before giving them a smartphone.Just as kids learn to ride bikes with training wheels or get junior licenses when they learn to drive, kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to manage their first smartphones all by themselves. Fortunately, there are ways to manage use and help kids develop better tendencies, and much of it requires a delicate balance of parental modeling and involvement.For parents of teens who have smartphones, making the effort to understand how, where and why kids are spending time on their phone is critical.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Journey Into Iraqi Kurdistan", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "ExplorerAncient fortresses, crisp mountain streams, curious people and healing cities: Travelers are discovering the Kurdish region of Iraq, a place of great beauty, haunted by war.Supported byThe Mar Mattai monastery clings to the side of a steep mountain, and on a clear day a visitor can stand against its fortresslike walls and discern far below the winsome farmlands of Upper Mesopotamia. Here, in the cradle of civilization, the building is one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world. From this peaceful perch, it is difficult to imagine the horror.One hazy morning last spring, Harry Schute, a retired Army colonel in his 50s with a Cheshire grin, walked through the monastery\u2019s heavy doors and along its shaded arcades. A boy played with a soccer ball in the courtyard, the boom of each kick cracking off the stone walls. At its peak in the 9th century, the monastery housed as many as 7,000 monks. Today it has five, a bishop, this boy and his family \u2014 all survivors of the Islamic State.We were on the western fringes of Kurdistan, a Netherlands-size, semiautonomous region in the north of Iraq that is home to 5.2 million of the world\u2019s estimated 30 million Kurds, a stateless people who populate the border regions between Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria. The fact that the monastery still stood; that this Christian boy and his family were still alive; that a small group of North Americans now felt safe enough to travel here \u2014 all of it seemed like a miracle.It was now May 2017 and most of the artifacts had been returned to the monastery. This was one of the first times that Mr. Schute had brought travelers here since ISIS had come so close. Today Mr. Schute believes that Kurdistan could be one of the world\u2019s great travel destinations if people would only stop confusing it with the Iraq they see in the news.To be sure, Kurdistan is nothing like the Iraq of Mosul but a Middle Eastern Montana with ruins: a cooler, welcoming tableau of crisp mountain streams and scrappy peaks. A traveler can ski at a new resort serviced by gondolas or wander through the sun-roasted walls of the deepest canyon in the Middle East. You can drink city water from the taps and stroll around Erbil, the regional capital, concerned with only how to decline, politely, invitations to drink tea.\u201cHello, my friend, have some bread.\u201d\u201cCome, sit.\u201d\u201cPlease, mister, enjoy my country.\u201dAs a West Point history major with a soft spot for heavy metal, Mr. Schute had been a state trooper in New Jersey before being called to Iraq in April 2003 to command a United States Army Reserve civil affairs battalion. \u201cThose are the guys who help get people and things out of the way so the Army can come in and break stuff,\u201d he said. Soon he became something of a celebrity as the senior American officer in Kurdistan; to this day, the Kurds \u2014 who view Americans as their liberators for ousting Saddam Hussein \u2014 recognize him on the street and ask for photographs with him. As his tour drew to a close, Mr. Schute began to feel anxious.\u201cIt was like there was a hole in me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was in the middle of contributing worthwhile things and I wanted to continue to contribute. I wanted to stay.\u201dIn 2003 at a Kurdish investment seminar in Erbil, Mr. Schute met Douglas Layton, an American who came to Kurdistan in 1992. Mr. Layton, whose round spectacles and woolen cap lend him the air of a paperback spy, had survived a $1 million bounty on his head, courtesy of Saddam Hussein. After the dictator\u2019s capture and execution, Mr. Layton journeyed to Hussein\u2019s palace in Baghdad, where he found his outlandish throne and sat in it. \u201cYou\u2019re gone,\u201d Mr. Layton whispered to Saddam\u2019s ghost, \u201cand I\u2019m still here.\u201d\u201cEveryone said no one will come to Iraq, and I said but they\u2019ll come to \u2018the other Iraq!\u2019\u201d Mr. Layton recalled. \u201cI believed, and I still believe, that tourism is the future.\u201dFor their main local guide, they hired and trained Balin Zrar, a charismatic, chain-smoking Kurd. Mr. Zrar had spent seven years running an Italian restaurant in London after he smuggled himself to Europe \u2014 an epic tale that involved time in an Iranian prison camp and riding for days curled atop a spare tire under a tractor-trailer. After the London bombings, Mr. Zrar returned to Kurdistan to dabble in real estate. For the guide-position interview, Mr. Layton asked him if he liked history. \u201cI hate history,\u201d replied Mr. Zrar, now in his early 40s, and the candor landed him the job. No one believed he\u2019d be busy.Then, ISIS showed up.The militants steamrolled down the Tigris and pushed into Kurdistan. They got so close to Erbil\u2019s city gates that even Mr. Schute was worried. Tourism companies shut down. Seventy hotels closed. Many flights ceased. \u201cWe were the last guys standing,\u201d Mr. Layton said.Our contingent of five North Americans had pretty much spent a lifetime traveling. Even so, only one of us, the head of an adventure travel trade association, had visited Kurdistan before. This time he\u2019d brought along his son, who\u2019d turn 17 on the trip. A Canadian expat living in Hong Kong and a photographer from Los Angeles who had been to North Korea 10 times rounded out our group.We piled into a mini bus and rolled into the city. Rows of half-finished skyscrapers rose from the earth like the picked-over rib cage of a great steely beast. Barbershops, bookstores, mosques and carts laden with wild cucumbers and cigarettes scrolled by the window. Unlike Iraqi Arabs, few Kurdish women wore head scarves. If you ignored the road signs pointing to Baghdad, you could mistake this for Turkey.The plan was to spend a week traveling in a clockwise loop that started and ended in Erbil, taking in cities like Duhok and Sulaymaniyah along the way. We\u2019d hike in the Zagros Mountains, paddle kayaks on Lake Dukan, and eat kebabs and flatbread. Often we\u2019d pause over sugary tea outside noisy bazaars and linger in museums highlighting Kurdish traditions and history. Mr. Layton, who now lives in Connecticut, could not join us, but Mr. Schute, still in Erbil, would spend time with us.Immediately it became clear that this would be unlike any other trip. Mr. Schute also serves as a senior security adviser to the Kurdish interior ministry and works closely with the Peshmerga, which means \u201cthose who face death.\u201d More than 100,000 of these Kurdish soldiers \u2014 our allies against Saddam Hussein and ISIS \u2014 manned a nearly impenetrable front riddled with tank ditches and checkpoints that has kept Kurdistan an enclave of comparative security while much of the rest of Iraq remains too dangerous for tourists. The Peshmerga, coalition forces and the Iraqis had cornered the last of ISIS\u2019s fighters in Mosul\u2019s old city along the Tigris. The effort to root them out for good was being coordinated through the Zerevani Peshmerga headquarters outside Erbil. Mr. Schute arranged to take us there.C-17s roared overhead as we arrived. In the distance you could see a dome that the South Koreans had built for a gym and several squat metal buildings. Guards led us into a room with a long table set with bananas and apricots and cold cans of Pepsi. United States Army Lt. Col. Darin E. Huss, the center\u2019s director, and Iraqi and Kurdish generals, came in to answer our questions about the fight. \u201cIn 10 days it will be finished, inshallah,\u201d Staff Major Gen. Saad Khalid Yasin told me. (It would be more like six weeks.)Most eye-opening of all, though, was the base\u2019s Mad Max junkyard of captured ISIS vehicles. The militants had welded thick armored plates around old Soviet personnel carriers and attached grids of rebar along their sides to disperse incoming rocket blasts. Some rigs had heavy metal prows to better ram a checkpoint. Others had been reduced to mangled heaps of metal. I climbed inside one that had been scorched beyond all recognition. On the floor lay a chalky white bone. Lamb. Someone\u2019s lunch had ended poorly.The next morning our driver headed north toward the Mar Mattai monastery. We slipped past wheat fields, gas stations with knockoff names like \u201cShall\u201d and \u201cNobil,\u201d and a refinery \u2014 a reminder of Kurdistan\u2019s agricultural economy and the fact that Iraq controls some of the richest oil fields in the world, a quarter of which lie in Kurdistan. Kids played on the banks of the Greater Zab River where earthen bunkers once shielded Iraqi tanks during the 2003 invasion. This was the Green Line, the point behind which Saddam withdrew his forces after the creation of a no-fly zone over Kurdistan following his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.The air turned hair-dryer hot as we wrapped up our time at the monastery. From there we drove to a field just outside a village called Amian. A lone cow stood in the grass. A kid in a yellow shirt rode by, waving, on a bike. In the distance rose a gumdrop-shape dollop of earth. It was a tell, or a man-made hill formed when ancient villages are built and rebuilt atop one another over thousands of years until they\u2019re abandoned and the grass reclaims them.Kurdistan has no real budget for tourism projects, which means few attractions have basic things like interpretive signs. This field, which also has never been excavated, would be just a field without Mr. Schute to explain it. In 331 B.C. the Persian king Darius III picked this now peaceful place to face Alexander the Great of Macedonia once and for all. The ensuing fight, the Battle of Gaugamela, saw Darius\u2019s far greater force suffer such horrific losses that soon the Macedon kingdom would stretch from Greece to Pakistan. The battle counts as one of the most important military victories of all time, Mr. Schute said.\u201cCan you feel it?\u201d he asked, as he imagined the war elephants, the scythed chariots and the tens of thousands of soldiers lining up to hack each other to bits. \u201cI get here and I can feel it.\u201dWe pressed on toward Duhok, a city tucked between the Shandukha and Spi mountains, just as rain began to fall. We stopped to take a short hike to see carvings of Assyrian kings left in a hillside and grabbed a lunch of nesik, a lentil soup, and sawer, a bulgur dish served with pickled squash. Murals on walls said \u201crespect the Peshmerga.\u201dThe faith holds that every Yazidi should take a pilgrimage to the center of their world, or Lalish, a lovely mountain village about 30 miles southeast of Duhok. The Yazidi believe that Noah\u2019s Ark came to rest here after a snake used its body to plug a hole in the boat, thus saving all of creation.Yazidi kids gathered around us as we walked toward temples tucked against scruffy hillsides. The village had stone buildings and narrow streets, and families sat together on carpets inside courtyards and on patios. Everyone, like us, was barefoot. Shoes aren\u2019t allowed in Lalish.\u201cWhere you from?\u201d asked a boy in sunglasses.Another, a teen with immaculate hair, wanted to take a selfie with us. Soon everyone wanted a selfie with us. They followed us toward a shrine with a conical roof. Sheik Adi, a man as holy to the Yazidi as Jesus is to Christians, was buried inside. \u201cStep through the door!\u201d a boy told me, meaning I shouldn\u2019t step on the threshold. Angels rest in doorways.Inside the air was cool and moist. A woman pressed her forehead against a threshold, kissed it and mumbled. Others walked around Adi\u2019s tomb, chanting; holy water burbled up from deep within the mountain. In one room I found two holes in the floor. One went to heaven, the other to hell, but no one would tell me which was which.That seemed to be a fitting image for the rest of the trip, which oscillated between breathtaking beauty and heartbreaking anguish. We visited the spectacular town of Amadiya, perched on a butte, perhaps home to the three wise men, and toured refugee centers where children had posted notes for dead parents. We danced in shin-deep water at the Ali Begg waterfall with giggling Arab Iraqi men, then visited Halabja where Saddam murdered thousands of Kurds in chemical gas attacks. I gazed over endless peaks that stretched toward Turkey, while standing in the blown-up husk of one of Saddam\u2019s once-lavish palaces. Never once did I feel unsafe.Even so: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future is,\u201d Mr. Zrar told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to be hopeful.\u201dStanding along the Lesser Zab River, he told me how he dreams of opening an outdoor shop in Erbil, of hiking across Kurdistan through the mountains, of getting more women involved in the outdoors. Like Mr. Schute and Mr. Layton, he sees something in Kurdistan that would be obvious were it not for the news.\u201cWhen there is no war in my country, Kurdistan is the best place,\u201d he said. He stuffed inflatable kayaks, coolers and tents into his S.U.V. for a long weekend of adventure with his girlfriend. We said goodbye. Then he drove down a road that arced out of sight.The first is to go overland through Turkey. To do that you would fly to Sirnak or Diyarbakir, both in southeastern Turkey, then cross into Iraqi Kurdistan via the Habur-Ibrahim Khalil border crossing. You\u2019ll need a Turkish visa. The second way is to connect on a domestic flight through Baghdad. To do that, you\u2019ll need an Iraqi visa.Tim Neville is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.Advertisement"}

He didn\u2019t have gloves on and he didn\u2019t tell me what he was doing.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe did this \u2018treatment\u2019 on me, on numerous occasions.\u201dDr. Nassar would also pay her compliments on Facebook, and tell her how beautiful she was, Ms. Nichols said. At the time, she thought \u201che was trying to be nice to me.\u201dNow, she said, \u201cI believe this was part of the grooming process I recently learned about.\u201dShe reported the abuse to U.S.A. Gymnastics in the summer of 2015, she said, setting off an investigation into Dr. Nassar, who was fired that year.But according to Ms. Nichols\u2019s lawyer, U.S.A. Gymnastics waited five weeks to notify law enforcement, and did not report the reason for Dr. Nassar\u2019s dismissal to Michigan State University, where he continued to practice medicine until he was arrested. Likewise, Michigan State did not alert U.S.A. Gymnastics when the university investigated Dr. Nassar in 2014, Mr. Manly said.U.S.A. Gymnastics wasn\u2019t informed in 2014 because the result of the investigation was that there was not a policy violation, \u201cand the local prosecutor\u2019s office reviewed the case and declined to press charges against Nassar,\u201d Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State University, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cAlso, the complainant was not a gymnast or a minor, nor did the complaint involve allegations of penetration.\u201dU.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement on Tuesday that it was \u201centirely baseless\u201d to suggest that it had attempted to silence athletes or keep the investigation secret, and that it never tried to hide Dr. Nassar\u2019s misconduct.\u201cU.S.A. Gymnastics kept the matter confidential because of the F.B.I.\u2019s directive not to interfere with the investigation,\u201d the organization said. \u201cU.S.A. Gymnastics reported Nassar to the F.B.I. in July 2015 and to a different F.B.I. office again in April 2016.\u201dWhen Ms. Nichols reported the abuse, U.S.A. Gymnastics hired \u201can experienced, independent investigator to speak with her and others,\u201d it said in the statement, and that investigator recommended that U.S.A. Gymnastics report the abuse to law enforcement, at which point the F.B.I. \u201ctook over the matter.\u201dU.S.A. Gymnastics said it cooperated fully with the F.B.I. and refrained from discussing the matter in accordance with a \u201crequest to not do anything that might interfere with their investigation.\u201dWhen she announced that she would be leaving elite gymnastics, Ms. Nichols was a four-time United States medal winner and a member of the 2015 world championship gold-medal winning team, where she also won individual bronze on floor. She was not selected for the Olympic team, and said a knee injury was part of what prevented her from continuing.Gina Nichols said U.S.A. Gymnastics has never inquired about her daughter\u2019s well-being, or offered to send her to therapy. \u201cNever, nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cNot once.\u201d\u201cFor me as a parent, I feel like what happened to my daughter was inexcusable, gross negligence,\u201d she added.He is expected to be sentenced to 25 years or more on the molestation charges.\u201cU.S.A. Gymnastics and the U.S.O.C. did not provide a safe environment for me and my teammates to train,\u201d Ms. Nichols said in her statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe were subjected to Dr. Nassar at every National Team Camp which occurred monthly at the Karolyi Ranch. His job was to care for our health and treat our injuries. Instead, he violated our innocence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expect 2018 to Be More Sane? Sorry, It\u2019s Not Going to Happen", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHappy new year to you and yours, of course, but I\u2019m going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You\u2019re fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded.Sure, as in any year, a lot of good things could happen in 2018, and perhaps lots of bad things will happen, too. (How\u2019s that for a prediction?) But there is a deeper and more unsettling certainty about the ride upon which we\u2019ve all just embarked: A lot of probably very crazy things will happen in 2018.Get ready for even more events that don\u2019t follow the rational course, and narratives that appear unmoored from the laws of politics, business and science. The background sensation of uncertainty that has pervaded much of the last two years isn\u2019t going to abate. Just the opposite \u2014 my columnist\u2019s Spidey sense tells me it\u2019s only going to get worse. Strap in.Yet what has happened is rather quite different. Instead of revealing unseen order and predictability in the world, technology has unleashed a cascade of forces that have made the world more volatile \u2014 and thus made the future hazier and more open to out-of-the-blue results.Some of this isn\u2019t news. In 2016 and 2017, the world began to appreciate how smartphones and social networks can upend what we once considered the natural order. Tech has helped undercut the power of incumbent institutions \u2014 governments, political parties, the media, the patriarchy \u2014 and it has created a new class of geopolitical actors whose presence and ricocheting power we\u2019re all still getting used to: trolls, terrorists, conspiracy theorists, social-media activists, hackers and cyptocurrency bugs, among others.These dynamics aided many of the biggest and most surprising stories in the last couple of years \u2014 Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the emergent resistance movement against him, the #MeToo avalanche, the decline of Uber, the rise of Bitcoin.Yet even as a barrage of surprising stories plays out, many of us have yet to come to grips with the permanence of this chaos. People seem to have a latent, hopeful sense that things are going to calm down, that we\u2019re on the cusp of a more normal news cycle. I suspect that\u2019s wrong. Chaos is the new normal; the apprehension you feel every time you get a notification on your phone \u2014 the fear that you don\u2019t know what fresh horror it could bring \u2014 isn\u2019t an overreaction but an adaptation. Thanks to phones and Facebook, anything really could happen tomorrow.\u201cThere are just a lot more variables in play,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cThink about how a single tweet from Donald Trump can have all these strange reverberations across the world. You can almost apply chaos theory to Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\u201dOne of the touchstone ideas of chaos theory, which is the study of dynamic systems, is the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d \u2014 the idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to huge differences in outcomes, like how a butterfly flapping its wings in Peru can cause a hurricane in Houston.But it\u2019s not just that one-off stories cause huge cascades; it\u2019s that in a connected world, there are now so many one-off stories capable of setting off cascades, and no one knows which ones will hit.Note how Mr. Trump was not brought down by the series of sexual harassment claims against him during the presidential campaign \u2014 and yet just a few months later, claims against a host of other powerful men spiraled into a culture-shaping movement that has upended many parts of the economy.As if all that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s another complication to fold into the chaos: Technology isn\u2019t stopping. The pace of technological change is in many cases too fast for anyone of us to comprehend or get used to; as a result, just as the world seems to get its head around one new force unleashed by tech, another comes along to discombobulate our efforts to respond to it.For example, in the last year and a half, social networks have tried several ways to tamp down the misinformation flowing online. Their efforts have been fitful at best, but already they risk being outdated. Soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality software will make it trivially easy to create not just text-based misinformation but entirely fake audio and video, too.In the run-up to the 2018 election, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have vowed to take on the kinds of misinformation and trolling that ran amok in 2016. But what if social media is hit with a wave of explosive, realistic-looking viral videos whose authenticity can\u2019t be confirmed? It\u2019s highly unlikely that the social networks, the news media or the political class will know how to respond to such a situation.Mr. Rose pointed out that in the long span of human history, periods of turbulence aren\u2019t unusual; technological change often prompts social and political instability and unpredictability. What is unusual now is that many of us aren\u2019t used to this sort of chaos.\u201cSo I do think people are now realizing the world is less predictable than we thought it was,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cBut in some ways that\u2019s a return to normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Islam Teaches Us That Life Is a Test. So Is This President.", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAs I prepared myself to head to the mosque that morning, I recalled the sermon I gave three days after the election. In November, the community was panicking. People regularly asked, \u201cSheikh Mustafa, is it time we leave this country?\u201d One friend from the mosque told me sadly, \u201cI can\u2019t live anywhere else.\u201d I told him that a Muslim prepares for the worst but hopes and prays for the best.Islam teaches us that life is a test of obedience to God and I counseled my community to view Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a test of our patience: God wanted to see if we would endure this challenge, or fall into complaining and despair. Islam and the Quran teach us that when we encounter a challenge, we should try to benefit from it. The election, I hoped, could lead us to strive to be better as individuals and to improve society.Just a few hours after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, I stood before a crowd of about 2,000 Muslims from all walks of life, young and old, native-born Americans and immigrants from some two dozen countries. I reminded them that being a Muslim is about good character. We Muslims shouldn\u2019t allow harsh words to get under our skin. We must not insult people who insult us because of our religion \u2014 and we must always be on our best behavior.The truth is, Muslims in America are held to a different standard. If, for example, a husband is seen yelling at his wife in a restaurant, people might think that he\u2019s having a bad day, or he\u2019s just a jerk. But if that same man appears to be a Muslim and his wife is wearing a head scarf, fellow diners might assume that the Quran told him to behave that way.After the inauguration, our mosque received notes, flowers and gifts. People in Anaheim wanted us to know that despite the messages coming from many voters and from Washington, we were welcome. One card read: \u201cHaving a mosque in my neighborhood helps make my neighborhood truly American. I am so proud and so grateful you are here. Please be of good cheer. You are not alone. You have friends. I am one of them.\u201d I read the card aloud at the end of a sermon and posted it on Instagram and Facebook. This simple gesture gave us hope.Still, as a leader of a Muslim community, I could see that sometimes the climate of Islamophobia that Mr. Trump was creating was challenging believers. More than once over the past year, women in the congregation approached me to ask if they should stop wearing the hijab for fear of being harassed. I didn\u2019t judge them for this, but it made me sad.We Muslims pray five times a day. Sometimes that means finding a spot in the mall or at a park to perform prayers. But I heard repeatedly from people who no longer felt safe doing so \u2014 or had internalized a feeling of shame after being repeatedly associated with extremists. I tried to remind them that there are 1.8 billion Muslims, and 99.99 percent of them are good, peaceful people.At the end of January, the president issued his first version of the \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d I went to Los Angeles International Airport to protest with a group organized by a Muslim civil rights organization. We expected to find maybe a few hundred people there; instead, there were thousands \u2014 most of them not Muslims \u2014 holding signs that said things like \u201cMuslims are here to stay.\u201d Seeing this kind of support gave me a sense of security and assured me that we would be just fine here in Southern California.Mustafa Umar is the director of education and outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange County.Advertisement"}

She will be \u201crequired to take further training\u201d while the district investigates.This was the first time Ms. Thole has been disciplined in more than 22 years with the district, Dr. Kist-Kline said in the statement.She added: \u201cIt is not lost on me that this comes as we prepare to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day and his legacy of fighting for justice. Dr. King reminded us that \u2018the time is always right to do what is right.\u2019 In this case involving our teacher, the right thing to do is apologize, make amends, and take steps to be better.\u201d\u201cI never wanted her fired,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want her trained properly.\u201dShe added: \u201cBut just as important, I want the district to institute practices that give student and families confidence in being heard, valued and respected when they have been wronged.\u201dThe superintendent applauded Nathan because he \u201cbravely stood up and called his teacher to account.\u201d\u201cThe student could have reacted poorly and could have rightfully berated the teacher for her thoughtlessness,\u201d the statement said. \u201cYet, he extended grace to the teacher. The student is the hero in this story.\u201d\u201cAs a district, we want to be very clear, racial slurs or any behavior that discriminates against others are NOT acceptable,\u201d the statement said.A spokeswoman for the district could not immediately be reached for comment.Nathan\u2019s experience was indicative of the \u201chostile racial environment\u201d in Mason\u2019s schools, and is only one example among many, said Ms. Agee-Bell, 43, who has served on the district\u2019s diversity council for 12 years and is the former president of the middle school\u2019s parent-teacher organization.Black students have reported feeling unsafe or disrespected across the country.\u201cI got a bet,\u201d he added. \u201cI bet by the time you\u2019re 21, someone\u2019s going to put a bullet right through your head, O.K.? And it might be me, the one that does it.\u201dMs. Agee-Bell said that Mason had more work ahead to address the issues experienced by black youth, but that it was also important to focus on healing.\u201cThe community has stepped out and stepped up and said, \u2018We will not tolerate this,\u2019 and that makes me hopeful,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are willing now to speak out.\u201dElisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}

Al menos 55.000 cuentas de Devumi usan los nombres, fotos de perfil, lugares de origen y otros detalles personales de usuarios reales de Twitter, incluidos menores de edad, seg\u00fan un an\u00e1lisis de datos realizado por el Times.\u201cNo quiero que mi foto est\u00e9 relacionada a esa cuenta, ni mi nombre\u201d, dijo Rychly, quien ahora tiene 19 a\u00f1os. \u201cNo puedo creer que alguien pague por eso. Es simplemente horrible\u201d.En noviembre, Facebook revel\u00f3 a sus inversores que ten\u00eda al menos el doble de usuarios falsos que los estimados anteriormente, lo que indica que existen unas 60 millones de cuentas automatizadas en la plataforma de medios sociales m\u00e1s grande del mundo. Estas cuentas falsas, conocidas como bots, pueden ayudar a influenciar a las audiencias publicitarias y replantear los debates pol\u00edticos. Pueden afectar negocios y arruinar reputaciones. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista legal, su creaci\u00f3n y venta est\u00e1n en una zona gris.\u201cLa continua viabilidad de cuentas fraudulentas e interacciones en las plataformas de redes sociales, y la profesionalizaci\u00f3n de estos servicios fraudulentos, es muestra de que todav\u00eda hay mucho trabajo por hacer\u201d, dijo el senador dem\u00f3crata de Virginia Mark Warner, quien tambi\u00e9n es miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Inteligencia del Senado de Estados Unidos, que ha estado investigando la propagaci\u00f3n de cuentas falsas en Facebook, Twitter y otras plataformas.El fundador de Devumi, German Calas, neg\u00f3 que su compa\u00f1\u00eda vendiera seguidores falsos y dijo que no sab\u00eda nada sobre las identidades sociales robadas a los usuarios reales. \u201cLas acusaciones son falsas y no tenemos conocimiento de ninguna de esas actividades\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Calas en un intercambio de correos electr\u00f3nicos en noviembre.En momentos en que Facebook, Twitter y Google se enfrentan a una epidemia de manipulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y noticias falsas, los seguidores falsos de Devumi fungen como la infanter\u00eda de las batallas pol\u00edticas en l\u00ednea. Los clientes de esa empresa incluyen tanto a partidarios ac\u00e9rrimos de Donald Trump como a comentaristas liberales y conservadores de la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense.A diferencia de algunas empresas de redes sociales, Twitter no exige que sus cuentas est\u00e9n vinculadas a una persona real. Tambi\u00e9n permite un mayor acceso automatizado a su plataforma que otras compa\u00f1\u00edas, lo que facilita la creaci\u00f3n y el control de grandes cantidades de cuentas.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cLas redes sociales son un mundo virtual en el que la mitad son bots y el resto es gente real\u201d, dijo Rami Essaid, fundador de Distil Networks, una empresa de ciberseguridad que se especializa en erradicar redes de bots. \u201cNo puedes aceptar sin m\u00e1s lo que dice un tuit.

Para algunos artistas o empresarios, ese estatus virtual es un factor de influencia en el mundo real. Los conteos de seguidores en redes sociales pueden determinar qui\u00e9nes los contratan, cu\u00e1nto les pagan por patrocinios o compromisos e, incluso, c\u00f3mo los clientes potenciales eval\u00faan sus productos o negocios.Una cantidad alta de seguidores tambi\u00e9n es clave para los influenciadores que aspiran a marcar tendencia o para las estrellas de YouTube a quienes las empresas les dan miles de millones de d\u00f3lares al a\u00f1o para patrocinar sus productos. Mientras m\u00e1s alcance tengan esas personalidades, m\u00e1s dinero ganan. De acuerdo con datos de Captiv8, una empresa que vincula a los influenciadores con las marcas, alguien con 100.000 seguidores puede ganar hasta 2000 d\u00f3lares por un solo tuit promocionado, mientras que alguien con un mill\u00f3n de seguidores podr\u00eda cobrar hasta 20.000 d\u00f3lares.La fama genuina a veces conlleva una influencia real en redes sociales, con los fan\u00e1ticos que siguen a sus estrellas de cine favoritas, a cocineros c\u00e9lebres y modelos. Pero tambi\u00e9n hay atajos disponibles: en sitios como Social Envy y DIYLikes.com tan solo se requiere dar un n\u00famero de tarjeta para comprar un ej\u00e9rcito de seguidores en cualquier plataforma social en l\u00ednea.\u201cVes a un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s alto o una mayor cantidad de retuits y supones que esa persona es importante o que a ese tuit le fue bien\u201d, dijo Rand Fishkin, fundador de Moz, compa\u00f1\u00eda que desarrolla software de optimizaci\u00f3n y posicionamiento en motores de b\u00fasquedas. \u201cComo resultado, es m\u00e1s probable que t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n lo amplifiques, lo compartas o que sigas a esa persona\u201d.Twitter y Facebook pueden ser influenciadas de manera similar. \u201cLas plataformas sociales quieren recomendarte cosas y dicen: \u2018\u00bfLo que estamos recomendando es popular?\u2019\u201d, dijo Julian Tempelsman, cofundador de Smyte, firma de ciberseguridad que ayuda a empresas a combatir el fraude y abuso en l\u00ednea y a los bots. \u201cLa cantidad de seguidores es uno de los factores que toman en cuenta\u201d.Para entender mejor el negocio de Devumi, contratamos sus servicios. En abril, el Times cre\u00f3 una cuenta de prueba en Twitter y le pag\u00f3 a Devumi 225 d\u00f3lares por 25.000 seguidores; alrededor de un centavo de d\u00f3lar por cada uno. Como se promete, los primeros 10.000 parec\u00edan ser personas reales. Ten\u00edan fotograf\u00edas y nombres completos, la ciudad en la que se encontraban y biograf\u00edas que parec\u00edan ser aut\u00e9nticas. Una cuenta se asemejaba a la de Rychly, la joven de Minnesota.Pero vistas m\u00e1s de cerca hab\u00eda detalles extra\u00f1os. Los nombres de las cuentas ten\u00edan letras de m\u00e1s o usaban guion bajo o sustitu\u00edan letras tan similares que el cambio era casi imperceptible, como una ele min\u00fascula en vez de una i may\u00fascula.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusLos siguientes 15.000 seguidores de Devumi eran m\u00e1s claramente sospechosos: no ten\u00edan im\u00e1genes de perfil y en vez de nombres ten\u00edan una mezcla de letras, n\u00fameros y fragmentos de palabras.Pero los registros de la empresa revisados por el Times revelan mucho de lo que Devumi y sus clientes prefieren ocultar.La mayor\u00eda de los compradores mejor conocidos de Devumi venden productos, servicios o a s\u00ed mismos en las redes. En entrevistas dieron explicaciones variadas: compraron a los seguidores porque ten\u00edan curiosidad sobre c\u00f3mo funcionaba o se sintieron presionados para tener un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s altos para ellos mismos o para sus clientes. \u201cTodos lo hacen\u201d, dijo la actriz Deirdre Lovejoy, clienta de Devumi.Aunque algunos dijeron que cre\u00edan que Devumi les daba fan\u00e1ticos potenciales o clientes reales, otros admitieron que sab\u00edan o sospechaban que las cuentas eran falsas. Varios dijeron arrepentirse de haber hecho la compra.\u201cEs un fraude\u201d, dijo James Cracknell, remador brit\u00e1nico y medallista de oro ol\u00edmpico que le compr\u00f3 50.000 seguidores a Devumi. \u201cLa gente que juzga seg\u00fan cu\u00e1ntos me gusta o cu\u00e1ntos seguidores\u2026 no es algo saludable\u201d.Kathy Ireland tiene m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de seguidores en Twitter, que usa frecuentemente para promocionar empresas con las que tiene acuerdos de patrocinio. Pero en enero del a\u00f1o pasado Ireland solo ten\u00eda unos 160.000 seguidores. El mes siguiente, un empleado de su agencia de licencias de marca, Sterling/Winters, gast\u00f3 unos 2000 d\u00f3lares para conseguir 300.000 seguidores m\u00e1s, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi. El empleado despu\u00e9s hizo m\u00e1s adquisiciones, seg\u00fan reconoci\u00f3 en una entrevista. Un an\u00e1lisis del Times hall\u00f3 que la mayor\u00eda de los seguidores de Ireland parecen ser bots.Una portavoz dijo que ese empleado actu\u00f3 sin la autorizaci\u00f3n de Ireland y que hab\u00eda sido suspendido despu\u00e9s de que el Times pregunt\u00f3 al respecto. \u201cEstoy segura de que pens\u00f3 que estaba cumpliendo con sus responsabilidades, pero no es algo que deber\u00eda haber hecho\u201d, dijo la vocera, Rona Menashe.Varios clientes de Devumi o sus representantes contactados por el Times se negaron a hacer comentarios. Muchos otros no respondieron a intentos reiterados para contactarlos.Muchas de las celebridades, l\u00edderes empresariales, astros deportivos y otros usuarios de Twitter compraron a sus seguidores directamente, de acuerdo con registros. En otros casos, la compra fue hecha por agentes, familiares, empleados y otros asociados.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusHillary Rosen, consultora en relaciones p\u00fablicas y colaboradora de CNN, compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s de medio mill\u00f3n de seguidores falsos a Devumi en dos a\u00f1os. En una entrevista, dijo que esas compras fueron hechas \u201ccomo experimento\u201d para ver \u201cc\u00f3mo funcionaba\u201d. Hizo m\u00e1s de una decena de adquisiciones entre 2015 y 2017, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi.Otros clientes dijeron que se hab\u00edan sentido presionados por sus empleadores para tener m\u00e1s seguidores. Marcus Holmlund era el encargado de redes sociales de la agencia de modelaje Wilhemina. Poco despu\u00e9s de haber llegado al puesto, un supervisor le dijo que no estaba consiguiendo suficientes seguidores y que deb\u00eda o comprarlos o encontrar otro empleo. Holmlund termin\u00f3 pagando \u00e9l mismo por las cuentas a Devumi antes de dejar la empresa en 2015 (una portavoz de Wilhemina se neg\u00f3 a hacer comentarios).\u201cMe sent\u00ed pasmado por la amenaza de ser despedido o, lo que es peor, nunca poder volver a trabajar en la industria de la moda\u201d, dijo Holmlund. \u201cDesde entonces le digo a quienes me preguntan que es un enga\u00f1o\u201d.Varios clientes de Devumi reconocieron que hab\u00edan comprado bots porque sus carreras depend\u00edan, en parte, de aparentar tener influencia en redes sociales. \u201cNadie te toma en serio si no tienes una presencia notoria\u201d, dijo Jason Schenker, economista que se especializa en pron\u00f3sticos econ\u00f3micos y que ha comprado unos 260.000 seguidores.M\u00e1s de cien personas que se describen a s\u00ed mismas como influenciadores \u2013cuya val\u00eda en t\u00e9rminos monetarios est\u00e1 aun m\u00e1s vinculada a la cantidad de seguidores\u2013 han comprado las cuentas falsas de Devumi. Justin Blau, un popular DJ cuyo nombre art\u00edstico es 3LAU, adquiri\u00f3 50.000 seguidores y miles de retuits. En un correo electr\u00f3nico, Blau dijo que un exmiembro de su equipo de administraci\u00f3n los compr\u00f3 sin su aprobaci\u00f3n.Las cuentas de los hermanos, seg\u00fan los registros de Devumi, son potenciadas por miles de retuits que compr\u00f3 su madre y m\u00e1nager, Shadia Daho. (Quien no respondi\u00f3 a varios intentos de contactarla por correo y v\u00eda una empresa de relaciones p\u00fablicas).Al principio, Pallen neg\u00f3 haber adquirido esos seguidores. Despu\u00e9s de que el Times contact\u00f3 a Greiner, Pallen afirm\u00f3 que hab\u00eda \u201cexperimentado\u201d con la empresa pero que \u201cdej\u00f3 de hacerlo hace mucho tiempo\u201d. Un abogado de Greiner dijo que ella le pidi\u00f3 que dejara de hacerlo cuando se enter\u00f3 de las primeras compras. Sin embargo, los registros muestran que Pallen le compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s seguidores a Greiner en 2016.Los consultores de mercadotecnia tambi\u00e9n compran a seguidores para s\u00ed mismos, como si compraran la evidencia para respaldar su supuesta pericia. En el 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, exprofesor de la Universidad de California del Sur que se autodenomina \u201cla autoridad l\u00edder del mundo en marcas de celebridades\u201d, comenz\u00f3 a comprar cientos de miles de seguidores falsos a Devumi.La Rychly falsa tambi\u00e9n retuite\u00f3 por lo menos cinco cuentas vinculadas al porn\u00f3grafo estadounidense Dan Leal, quien vive en Hungr\u00eda y usa la cuenta @PornoDan. Leal ha comprado unos 150.000 seguidores a Devumi en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y es uno de al menos doce clientes de esa empresa que son parte de la industria del entretenimiento adulto.En un correo, Leal dijo que la compra de seguidores para su negocio le ha generado m\u00e1s que suficientes ganancias para compensar el gasto. A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que no le preocupa ser penalizado por Twitter. \u201cUn sinf\u00edn de figuras p\u00fablicas, empresas, bandas musicales, etc., compran seguidores\u201d, escribi\u00f3. \u201cSi Twitter tuviera que sacar a todos los que lo hacen no quedar\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente ninguno de ellos\u201d.Devumi ha vendido decenas de miles de bots de alta calidad que son similares, de acuerdo con un an\u00e1lisis del Times. En algunos casos un solo usuario real de Twitter fue transformado en cientos de diferentes bots; cada uno una variante con cambios m\u00ednimos respecto al original.Por Richard Harris y Mark HansenLas cuentas falsas utilizaron identidades sociales de usuarios de Twitter registrados en los cincuenta estados que componen Estados Unidos y en decenas de pa\u00edses que eran tanto adultos como menores de edad; replicaron la informaci\u00f3n de usuarios muy activos y de quienes no hab\u00edan iniciado sesi\u00f3n en meses o hasta en a\u00f1os.Esta no tuvo actividad sino hasta el a\u00f1o pasado, cuando comenz\u00f3 a retuitear de manera continua a clientes de Devumi.\u201cNo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 replicaron mi identidad; soy un estudiante universitario de 20 a\u00f1os\u201d, dijo Dodd. \u201cNo soy alguien conocido\u201d. Pero incluso as\u00ed la identidad social de Dodd tiene valor en la econom\u00eda de la influencia. De acuerdo con los precios publicados en diciembre, Duvemi vend\u00eda a seguidores de alta calidad por menos de dos centavos. Si la identidad social de Dodd es vendida a unos dos mil clientes \u2013el n\u00famero promedio que siguen las cuentas bots de Devumi\u2013 esta empresa se har\u00eda con unos 30 d\u00f3lares.Esas identidades sociales robadas son claves para la marca Devumi. Los bots de alta calidad son los que usualmente llegan primero a los clientes, seguidos por unos de baja calidad; como si entregaran queso parmesano rallado junto con aserr\u00edn.Algunos de los bots de alta calidad de Devumi de hecho remplazan a una cuenta inactiva \u2013alguien que dej\u00f3 de usar el servicio\u2013 con una falsa. Whitney Wolfe, asistente ejecutiva que vive en Florida, abri\u00f3 una cuenta de Twitter en 2008, cuando ayudaba en la planeaci\u00f3n de bodas. Para cuando dej\u00f3 de usarla en 2014 ya hab\u00eda sido creada una cuenta falsa con su informaci\u00f3n personal, que ha retuiteado las publicaciones de actrices de la industria pornogr\u00e1fica y a varios influenciadores.\u201cEse contenido \u2013de mujeres en tanga y fotograf\u00edas de los pechos de mujeres\u2013 no es para nada lo que quiero que se asocie a mi fe, a mi nombre o a donde vivo\u201d, dijo Wolfe, quien es parte de una congregaci\u00f3n baptista.Otras v\u00edctimas segu\u00edan siendo activas en Twitter cuando los bots de Devumi empezaron a suplantar su identidad. Salle Ingle, ingeniera de 40 a\u00f1os que vive en Colorado, dijo que le preocupaba que un posible empleador se topara con la versi\u00f3n falsa si revisaba su actividad en redes sociales como parte del proceso de contrataci\u00f3n. Cuando el Times le avis\u00f3 sobre la cuenta, ella contact\u00f3 a Twitter y logr\u00f3 que fuera desactivada.Despu\u00e9s de enviarle el correo a Calas el a\u00f1o pasado, un reportero del Times visit\u00f3 la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan que lista el sitio web de Devumi. En el edificio rentan decenas de oficinas, pero Devumi y su empresa matriz, Bytion, no parecen estar entre los arrendatarios. Un portavoz del due\u00f1o del edificio dijo que ni Devumi ni Bytion han rentado espacios ah\u00ed.Como los seguidores que vende, la oficina de Devumi es una ilusi\u00f3n.En la vida real, Devumi tiene su sede en un edificio de oficinas arriba de un restaurante de comida mexicana en West Palm Beach, Florida, y frente a un callej\u00f3n repleto de basureros. Calas vive cerca en un penthouse.Calas, quien tiene 27 a\u00f1os, creci\u00f3 en el sur de Florida. Cuando era adolescente aprendi\u00f3 dise\u00f1o web y construy\u00f3 los sitios de varias compa\u00f1\u00edas locales, de acuerdo con versiones anteriores de su p\u00e1gina web personal que est\u00e1n guardadas en el Internet Archive.Con el tiempo se autoense\u00f1\u00f3 t\u00e9cnicas de optimizaci\u00f3n de b\u00fasquedas: el arte de lograr que una p\u00e1gina web termine m\u00e1s arriba al usar Google u otro motor de b\u00fasqueda. En el colegio comenz\u00f3 a tomar clases en la universidad Palm Beach State, donde consigui\u00f3 un t\u00edtulo t\u00e9cnico en 2012, seg\u00fan una portavoz de la escuela. Pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Calas afirmaba haber construido decenas de empresas web con m\u00e1s de diez millones de clientes como parte de Bytion.\u201cInici\u00e9 esta compa\u00f1\u00eda con mil d\u00f3lares en el banco, sin inversores, y solo con una ardiente pasi\u00f3n por el \u00e9xito\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Calas en el sitio de listados laborales Glassdoor.Buena parte del personal de atenci\u00f3n al cliente de Devumi est\u00e1 basado en Filipinas, lo que quiz\u00e1 le haya ayudado a Calas a reducir costos, pero tambi\u00e9n lo expuso a \u00e9l mismo ser v\u00edctima del robo de su identidad social.Calas acus\u00f3 que Boado us\u00f3 un nombre muy similar, DevumiBoost, y el mismo dise\u00f1o del sitio web, con todo y la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan. Durante julio pasado, Boado \u2013haci\u00e9ndose pasar por un empleado de Devumi\u2013 le escribi\u00f3 a cientos de clientes de esta empresa para decirles que sus \u00f3rdenes iban a ser procesadas por DevumiBoost. Luego tambi\u00e9n se hizo pasar por los clientes enviando correos a Devumi con diversos alias para pedir cancelar \u00f3rdenes. (Boado no respondi\u00f3 a correos solicit\u00e1ndole respuesta a las acusaciones de Calas).La demanda de Calas tambi\u00e9n revel\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s: parece que Devumi no hace sus propios bots. En cambio, los compra al mayoreo como parte de un mercado global de cuentas falsas en redes sociales.Esparcidos por todo el internet hay diversos sitios web con los que fabricantes an\u00f3nimos de bots se conectan con minoristas como Devumi. Mientras que los clientes individuales llegan a comprar directo de estos sitios \u2013Peakerr, CheapPanel o YTbot, entre otros\u2013 son menos amigables para un usuario directo. Algunas, por ejemplo, no aceptan pagos con tarjeta, solo Bitcoin.Cada sitio vende seguidores, me gusta y compartir al por mayor para diversas redes sociales en diferentes idiomas. Las cuentas que venden llegan a cambiar de manos en varias ocasiones y a ser comercializadas por m\u00e1s de un vendedor.Devumi, seg\u00fan un exempleado, utilizaba bots de diferentes fabricantes seg\u00fan el precio, la calidad y la confiabilidad. En Peakerr, por ejemplo, mil bots en ingl\u00e9s de alta calidad con fotograf\u00edas de perfil cuestan poco m\u00e1s de un d\u00f3lar. Devumi cobra 17 d\u00f3lares por la misma cantidad.Ese margen de ganancia le ha permitido a Calas construir una peque\u00f1a fortuna, de acuerdo con los registros de la empresa. En tan solo unos a\u00f1os, Devumi vendi\u00f3 alrededor de 200 millones de seguidores de Twitter a por lo menos 39.000 clientes, lo que representa un tercio o m\u00e1s de los 6 millones de d\u00f3lares en ventas durante ese periodo.En diciembre, Calas pidi\u00f3 que el Times le diera ejemplos de bots que hab\u00edan copiado informaci\u00f3n de usuarios reales. Despu\u00e9s de recibir los nombres de diez cuentas, Calas, quien hab\u00eda aceptado dar una entrevista, pidi\u00f3 m\u00e1s tiempo para analizarlas y despu\u00e9s dej\u00f3 de responder a los correos.Binns, la portavoz de Twitter, dijo que la empresa no revisa de manera proactiva las cuentas para ver si son suplantaci\u00f3n de otros usuarios. En vez, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, los esfuerzos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda se enfocan en identificar y suspender cuentas que violan las pol\u00edticas de correo basura de Twitter. Binns dijo que en diciembre, por ejemplo, la compa\u00f1\u00eda identific\u00f3 en promedio unas 6,4 millones de cuentas sospechosas por semana.Leslie Miley, ingeniera que trabaj\u00f3 en la unidad de seguridad de la empresa y de sus usuarios hasta finales de 2015, dijo: \u201cTwitter, como red social, fue desarrollada pr\u00e1cticamente sin prever rendici\u00f3n de cuentas\u201d.Algunos cr\u00edticos creen que hay un incentivo de negocios para Twitter en contra de reprimir m\u00e1s agresivamente a los bots. Durante los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, la empresa ha batallado para generar el crecimiento de usuarios que han tenido rivales como Facebook o Snapchat e investigadores externos han puesto en tela de duda los estimados de la compa\u00f1\u00eda sobre cu\u00e1ntos de sus usuarios activos son en realidad bots.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cTrabajamos con ecosistemas no regulados y cerrados por completo que no reportan estas cosas. Tienen un incentivo perverso para dejar que pase esto\u201d, dijo Essaid, el experto en ciberseguridad. \u201cQuieren controlar esto hasta el punto en el que no sea tan obvio que existe pero que [Twitter] siga sacando dinero de ello\u201d.En enero, despu\u00e9s de unos dos a\u00f1os de promover cientos de cuentas de clientes de Devumi, la Jessica Rychly falsa por fin fue identificada por los algoritmos de seguridad de Twitter y la cuenta fue suspendida.Sin embargo, la verdadera Rychly ya planea salirse para siempre de esa red social.\u201cProbablemente voy a borrar mi cuenta de Twitter\u201d, dijo.Contribuyeron al reportaje Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa y Felipe Villamor.

{"Headline": "Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisruptionsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 I\u2019ve gone gray, and it\u2019s great.In an effort to break my smartphone addiction, I\u2019ve joined a small group of people turning their phone screens to grayscale \u2014 cutting out the colors and going with a range of shades from white to black. First popularized by the tech ethicist Tristan Harris, the goal of sticking to shades of gray is to make the glittering screen a little less stimulating.I\u2019ve been gray for a couple days, and it\u2019s remarkable how well it has eased my twitchy phone checking, suggesting that one way to break phone attachment may be to, essentially, make my phone a little worse. We\u2019re simple animals, excited by bright colors, it turns out.Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google know this, and they have increasingly been turning to the field of applied neuroscience to see how exactly brains respond to color in the apps, what brings pleasure and what keeps the eye. New research shows how important color is to our understanding of priorities and emotion.Mack McKelvey, the chief executive of the marketing firm SalientMG in Washington, D.C., said she\u2019s aware of the tricks phones use to keep you on them longer \u2014 and coming back sooner.\u201cYou don\u2019t buy black-and-white cereal boxes, you buy the really stimulating colored one, and these apps have developed really cool tiles, cool shapes, cool colors, all designed to stimulate you,\u201d Ms. McKelvey said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a vibrant world out there, and my phone shouldn\u2019t be it.\u201dShe decided to make the switch to gray as well. But it was trickier than she expected.One person Facebook and others turn to is Thomas Z. Ramsoy, the chief executive of Neurons, a four-year-old company based in Copenhagen. His business uses brain scans and eye tracking technology to study apps, updates and future technology. The company often measures the electrical activity of the brain while a consumer is interacting with a phone, such as texting and scrolling Facebook.\u201cColor and shape, these are the icebreakers when it comes to grabbing people\u2019s attention, and attention is the new currency,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an interface that grabs people\u2019s attention without disturbing them in the wrong way, without consciously intruding in their space, that\u2019s the fine line.\u201dWhat going grayscale does, Mr. Ramsoy said, is reintroduce choice.Companies use colors to encourage subconscious decisions, Mr. Ramsoy said. (So that, for example, I may want to open email, but I\u2019ll end up on Instagram, having seen its colorful button.) Making the phone gray eliminates that manipulation. Mr. Ramsoy said it reintroduces \u201ccontrolled attention.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to take away the sound as well.\u201dOne way Silicon Valley could help ease phone addiction is by using a more thoughtful color palette, said Bevil Conway, an investigator at the National Eye Institute, who researches color and emotion.\u201cColor\u2019s not a signal for detecting objects, it\u2019s actually something much more fundamental: It\u2019s for telling us what\u2019s likely to be important,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cIf you have lots of color and contrast then you\u2019re under a constant state of attentional recruitment. Your attentional system is constantly going, \u2018Look look look over here.\u2019 \u201dThe same way people think about a color scheme when they\u2019re planning the living room d\u00e9cor, Mr. Conway said, they should think about color when it comes to their phone\u2019s home screen too.\u201cIf you had a color palette, you would end up with a phone that looked pleasant and was not addictively rewarding, that had some intentionality, but of course nobody wants you to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause what they want is for you to look.\u201dSilicon Valley is in a battle for our attention, and often I feel like the last person in charge of my own eyes. After going to grayscale, I\u2019m not a different person all of a sudden, but I feel more in control of my phone, which now looks like a tool rather than a toy. If I unlock it to write an email, I\u2019m a little less likely to forget the goal and tap on Instagram. If I\u2019m waiting in line for coffee, this gray slab is not as delightful a distraction as it once was.The switch made me realize, in a tangible way, that I still have a little choice here.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Teenager\u2019s Basketball Dream Is Size XXXXXL", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA, Ohio \u2014 When strangers approach Robert Bobroczkyi, as they often do, the first question is almost always, \u201cHow tall are you?\u201d Lately, he has been responding with typical teenage snark.\u201cFive-eleven,\u201d he might say, making up a figure nearly two feet off the real answer.Forgive him. Though his voice rumbles forth like boulders down a mountain, and each of his hands is the size of an iPad, and he could gaze down upon the crown of the head of any N.B.A. player today, Bobroczkyi, 17, still has the deprecating wit and trademark eye roll of a sophomore in high school. Because that is what he is.He likes horror movies, science-fiction novels, \u201cold-school\u201d music and NBA 2K. He sleeps wherever and whenever possible. He taught himself to play the piano from YouTube clips. In English class, he was asked to give a presentation about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It helped, he joked, that he had seen the Indiana Jones movies.And then he steps on a basketball court, where he can reject 3-point attempts from just outside the lane. He doesn\u2019t need to be anywhere near the ball to be an intimidating factor. All he needs is to grab the rim, with both hands, while standing flat-footed.This is life at 7 feet 7 inches, with the world at your size 17 feet. If Bobroczkyi entered the N.B.A. tomorrow, he would join his Romanian countryman Gheorghe Muresan and Muresan\u2019s contemporary Manute Bol, who also played at 7-7, as the tallest men to play in the league. But unlike the hulking Muresan and the shot-blocking Bol, Bobroczkyi is modeling his far-from-developed game off that of Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis, who at 7-3 has redefined how a player of that length can handle the nimbleness and fluidity of the modern game.Bobroczkyi is also learning that the one thing no coach can teach \u2014 height \u2014 will not guarantee him a future in pro basketball. He developed scoliosis at a young age, which gives him lower-back trouble, and though he has stopped growing, his hips have been left misaligned by several inches. And then there is his weight.Eating enough to fuel his eight-foot wingspan and gain the muscle needed to sustain a career is a daily ordeal. That is one reason he left Europe to come here to the Spire Institute, a 750,000-square-foot facility on 170 acres in the solitude of Ohio wine country. Aside from the basketball court, with floorboards ripped from Quicken Loans Arena (where the N.B.A.\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers play), and the health-conscious cafeteria, Spire is also close to the Cleveland Clinic, which assigned a dietitian to assist with Bobroczkyi\u2019s nutrition.The goal is to get his weight, 195 pounds, to rise by a pound per month. Doing so requires consuming a diet of 4,500 calories per day. Bobroczkyi eats slowly, and sometimes uncomfortably. At his school, nearby Grand River Academy, the plastic chairs in the cafeteria are of normal height, which means his legs fold underneath his seat, his ankles lying flat against the floor. Eating a bowl of miso soup this week meant lifting the bowl to his lips; for the liquid to travel all the way up there by spoon would be a long and shaky journey.Bobroczkyi said the day he met Porzingis, while visiting a basketball academy in Seville, Spain, was the first time in a long while that he stood eye-to-eye with somebody other than his father. Porzingis was 7-foot-1 at the time. Bobroczkyi was 14.Bobroczkyi was always tall, even when he was little. He passed six feet before his ninth birthday. He dunked at age 12. His father, Zsigmond, is 7-1, and his mother, Brunhilde, a former volleyball player, is 6-1. Still, their boy\u2019s size raised concerns. At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors ruled out Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition of the connective tissue that can lead to life-threatening heart trouble. Other tests over the years eliminated other, potentially worrisome, conditions.\u201cWe made all kinds of tests through the years to ensure everything was all right,\u201d the father wrote in an email. \u201cWe made them everywhere, every year, once including Rome, Seville, Washington, Vitoria, Budapest. Everything was fine.\u201dIn Bobroczkyi\u2019s hometown, Arad, in western Romania, he was known mostly because of his father, who had played professionally with the Romanian clubs Elba Timisoara and West Petrom Arad, and even with Muresan on Romania\u2019s national team, forming what might have been the world\u2019s tallest frontcourt at the time. But he began to garner attention when, in middle school, he surpassed his father\u2019s height.He went to Italy to play for an amateur club, A.S. Stella Azzurra, but took a year off from basketball to work on his frame, which was struggling to support his long limbs. Around that time, Bob Bossman, director of the basketball program at Spire, discovered a YouTube video of Bobroczkyi coolly knocking down 3-pointers and making passes.\u201cI saw he has potential,\u201d Bossman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to work with a kid like that often.\u201dBossman reached out to Bobroczkyi on Facebook. The conversation began: Bossman told him about the facilities, the chance to play on a team with some of the nation\u2019s top recruits, to attend a small boarding school down the road, to practice at an Olympic training site. When Bobroczkyi and his family visited the campus in 2016, he packed a bag and did not return to Italy.He first lived in a dorm at Grand River, a 187-year-old preparatory academy with 80 students. School officials brought in an eight-foot bed for his room and custom desks in his classrooms. He has since moved into a house with his basketball teammates at Spire; the bed could not fit in the door there, he said, so Bobroczkyi props two suitcases at the end of his twin with a pillow on top to support his feet.\u201cYou have to get used to it,\u201d he said of his height, a sizable understatement given the challenges that come with it. Doorways are perpetually too low. Pants need to be custom-ordered. Shirts are XXXXXL.His team once flew him to Hartford for a game, but forgot to reserve a seat for him in an exit row.\u201cNever flying again, Coach,\u201d Bobroczkyi told Bossman when he landed. On the bus ride back to Ohio, he sat in the back row, his legs splayed out down the aisle.\u201cYes, Rob! Thirties! You\u2019re on them!\u201dThe voice of Brandon Strausser, the strength and conditioning coach at Spire, echoed around the cavernous performance center. Bobroczkyi lay on a bench with 30-pound dumbbells on either side of him, ready for his first rep of 10 presses.Strausser and John Wallace, Spire\u2019s performance director, had tailored a workout plan for Bobroczkyi that was like nothing they had ever attempted. It was arguable that nobody had created anything like it. After all, whose body could compare?Porzingis was 6-9 at age 17. Muresan did not reach his playing height until age 20. Bobroczkyi even has a couple inches on the former N.B.A. center Shawn Bradley, who was 7-5 in high school.His experience then, navigating the harsh and bewildering climb to maturity, is truly singular. He cannot fade into the background of his high school hallways, much as he might want to try. In his algebra class, the teacher Matthew Pavlovic asked students to pair up for an assignment \u2014 a difficulty for Bobroczkyi, whose elevated desk is set off slightly from the others. He shuffled it across the room with loud screeches.His father used to tell him that his height could be a blessing or a curse. It was up to him to decide. But asked if he would like to grow any taller, Bobroczkyi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I grew enough.\u201dWhen Bobroczkyi arrived in Ohio, his flexibility was, Strausser said, \u201crough.\u201d His lower back was hurting. Walking could look laborious. He moved adequately on the court, but only in short bursts. \u201cHe\u2019s not slow,\u201d Bossman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about how many times he can get up and down in a matter of a game or a few minutes.\u201dSo while teammates were doing squats and charting their records in the bench press on a blackboard above the entrance, Bobroczkyi lay on the turf, spread his arms, bent his knees and twisted his torso, meticulously cycling through a 40-minute routine of stretches. His weight lifting program is mostly body resistance, using bands and straps, but when he finally got onto the bench, under those 30-pound weights, Strausser was delighted.He held a spreadsheet in front of him with almost 50 different exercises designed for Bobroczkyi.\u201cAs much as we can of each movement, in every single movement category that we can think of, is literally on here,\u201d Strausser said. \u201cBecause he needs it.\u201dIt was a big deal at Spire when, in a practice not too long ago, Bobroczkyi dunked. This might sound like celebrating a sunrise. But it was a sign that his confidence was growing.\u201cI mean, I like when I do it, but I also find that I still don\u2019t have enough to push guys around the rim to dunk on them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of it. But once I start to gain some pounds, that should start to happen more often.\u201dAt a recent practice, Bobroczkyi ambled around the sideline, spinning a basketball on his finger and dribbling it through his flagpole legs. He was relegated to being mostly an observer as his teammates raced up and down the court in fast-break drills and three-man weaves.He had played 12 minutes of game action over the weekend, the coach, Dave Briski, explained, and he needed time to recover. \u201cHopefully by next year he can play some major minutes,\u201d Briski said. \u201cIf we can get 10, 15 minutes a game out of him next year, I think that\u2019s a lot.\u201dBefore Bobroczkyi can entertain the thought of becoming the next Porzingis, or even of earning a scholarship to a Division I college, he needs time to adjust to the speed of the American game. Bossman and others contend that his time on the court is productive, but limited.\u201cHe\u2019s so skilled for his height,\u201d his teammate Julian Dancy said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a guy that can shoot 3s like him, especially the college 3 already.\u201dAfter dinner one night this week \u2014 breaded chicken, turkey tetrazzini, green beans and two helpings of rice pudding \u2014 Bobroczkyi rode the shuttle with his teammates to the house they share near campus, then sat on his bed. Below posters of Porzingis and Dirk Nowitzki, his face lit up when he heard the news that Porzingis had been named to the N.B.A. All-Star team.He had been too shy, he admitted, to say anything the first time they met. But now, he said, he would relish another chance.What would he ask? He paused to think.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask him what advice he would give me,\u201d Bobroczkyi said, finally. \u201cAbout anything. Life, basketball, everything.\u201dHis voice trailed off. He nodded, said \u201cyeah,\u201d and went back to folding his laundry for the next day.An earlier version of this article contained a picture caption that misidentified the place where Robert Bobroczkyi trains. It is the Spire Institute, not the Spire Academy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Democracy Pushed Into the Abyss", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are fragile achievements in many countries \u2014 and susceptible to sharp reversals.Brazil, the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery, is a fairly young democracy, having emerged from dictatorship just three decades ago. In the past two years, what could have been a historic advancement \u2014 the Workers\u2019 Party government granted autonomy to the judiciary to investigate and prosecute official corruption \u2014 has turned into its opposite. As a result, Brazil\u2019s democracy is now weaker than it has been since military rule ended.This week, that democracy may be further eroded as a three-judge appellate court decides whether the most popular political figure in the country, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of the Workers\u2019 Party, will be barred from competing in the 2018 presidential election, or even jailed.The evidence against Mr. da Silva is far below the standards that would be taken seriously in, for example, the United States\u2019 judicial system.He is accused of having accepted a bribe from a big construction company, called OAS, which was prosecuted in Brazil\u2019s \u201cCarwash\u201d corruption scheme. That multibillion-dollar scandal involved companies paying large bribes to officials of the state-owned oil company, Petrobras, to obtain contracts at grossly inflated prices.The bribe alleged to have been received by Mr. da Silva is an apartment owned by OAS. But there is no documentary evidence that either Mr. da Silva or his wife ever received title to, rented or even stayed in the apartment, nor that they tried to accept this gift.But this scanty evidence was enough for Judge Moro. In something that Americans might consider to be a kangaroo court proceeding, he sentenced Mr. da Silva to nine and a half years in prison.While there were officials involved in corruption from parties across the political spectrum, including the Workers\u2019 Party, there were no charges of corruption against Ms. Rousseff in the impeachment proceedings.But in 2014, a deep recession began, and the Brazilian right was able to take advantage of the downturn to stage what many Brazilians consider a parliamentary coup.If Mr. da Silva is barred from the presidential election, the result could have very little legitimacy, as in the Honduran election in November that was widely seen as stolen. A poll last year found that 42.7 percent of Brazilians believed that Mr. da Silva was being persecuted by the news media and the judiciary. A noncredible election could be politically destabilizing.Perhaps most important, Brazil will have reconstituted itself as a much more limited form of electoral democracy, in which a politicized judiciary can exclude a popular political leader from running for office. That would be a calamity for Brazilians, the region and the world.Advertisement"}

The butterflies, on the other hand, seemed quite relaxed.We wondered: How are these butterflies \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 transported across oceans?Faraway farms raise the caterpillars until they pupate, or become a chrysalis. This is the ideal time to ship the soon-to-be butterflies because they don\u2019t eat or drink during this stage. The farmers collect the chrysalides, wrap them in soft cotton, foam or toilet tissue, place them in boxes, and send them (DHL Express or FedEx) from their skies to ours.When Ms. Davies receives the parcels \u2014 each packed delicately with about 100 chrysalides \u2014 she and her team open them inside the museum\u2019s quarantine lab. They check the specimens carefully, like doctors examining their patients, and nurture the healthy ones until the butterflies emerge and can be released in the conservatory to mingle with New Yorkers.\u201cThey particularly like to land on people when you get quite sweaty, because they like to take in salts from sweat,\u201d Ms. Davies said. \u201cThey love bald men\u2019s heads.

{"Headline": "The Latest Data Privacy Debacle", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid you make a New Year\u2019s resolution to exercise more? Perhaps you downloaded a fitness app to help track your workouts, maybe one that allows you to share that data online with your exercise buddies?If so, you probably checked a box to accept the app\u2019s privacy policy. For most apps, the default setting is to share data with at least the company; for many apps the default is to share data with the public. But you probably didn\u2019t even notice or care. After all, what do you have to hide?Perhaps more alarming for the military, similar patterns of movement appear to possibly identify stations or airstrips in locations where the United States is not known to have such operations, as well as their supply and logistics routes. Analysts noted that with Strava\u2019s interface, it is relatively easy to identify the movements of individual soldiers not just abroad but also when they are back at home, especially if combined with other public or social media data.Apart from chastening the cybersecurity experts in the Pentagon, the Strava debacle underscores a crucial misconception at the heart of the system of privacy protection in the United States. The privacy of data cannot be managed person-by-person through a system of individualized informed consent.Data privacy is not like a consumer good, where you click \u201cI accept\u201d and all is well. Data privacy is more like air quality or safe drinking water, a public good that cannot be effectively regulated by trusting in the wisdom of millions of individual choices. A more collective response is needed.Part of the problem with the ideal of individualized informed consent is that it assumes companies have the ability to inform us about the risks we are consenting to. They don\u2019t. Strava surely did not intend to reveal the GPS coordinates of a possible Central Intelligence Agency annex in Mogadishu, Somalia \u2014 but it may have done just that. Even if all technology companies meant well and acted in good faith, they would not be in a position to let you know what exactly you were signing up for.Another part of the problem is the increasingly powerful computational methods called machine learning, which can take seemingly inconsequential data about you and, combining them with other data, can discover facts about you that you never intended to reveal. For example, research shows that data as minor as your Facebook \u201clikes\u201d can be used to infer your sexual orientation, whether you use addictive substances, your race and your views on many political issues. This kind of computational statistical inference is not 100 percent accurate, but it can be fairly close \u2014 certainly close enough to be used to profile you for a variety of purposes.A challenging feature of machine learning is that exactly how a given system works is opaque. Nobody \u2014 not even those who have access to the code and data \u2014 can tell what piece of data came together with what other piece of data to result in the finding the program made. This further undermines the notion of informed consent, as we do not know which data results in what privacy consequences. What we do know is that these algorithms work better the more data they have. This creates an incentive for companies to collect and store as much data as possible, and to bury the privacy ramifications, either in legalese or by playing dumb and being vague.What can be done? There must be strict controls and regulations concerning how all the data about us \u2014 not just the obviously sensitive bits \u2014 is collected, stored and sold. With the implications of our current data practices unknown, and with future uses of our data unknowable, data storage must move from being the default procedure to a step that is taken only when it is of demonstrable benefit to the user, with explicit consent and with clear warnings about what the company does and does not know. And there should also be significant penalties for data breaches, especially ones that result from underinvestment in secure data practices, as many now do.Companies often argue that privacy is what we sacrifice for the supercomputers in our pockets and their highly personalized services. This is not true. While a perfect system with no trade-offs may not exist, there are technological avenues that remain underexplored, or even actively resisted by big companies, that could allow many of the advantages of the digital world without this kind of senseless assault on our privacy.With luck, stricter regulations and a true consumer backlash will force our technological overlords to take this issue seriously and let us take back what should be ours: true and meaningful informed consent, and the right to be let alone.Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep), an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Backlash Grows as Investors Press Apple to Act on Children\u2019s Use", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA creator of the iPhone called the device \u201caddictive.\u201dA Twitter founder said the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201dAn early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network\u2019s impact on children\u2019s brains.Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children\u2019s use of iPhones and iPads.Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction.But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives.Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California\u2019s public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business.\u201cWe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,\u201d the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image.Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children\u2019s preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports.\u201cOver the past 10 years, there\u2019s been a bottom-up backlash,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d \u201cYou see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down.\u201d\u201cThese things can be incredibly addictive,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.\u201dA growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune.\u201cThe short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,\u201d he said. \u201cNo civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.\u201dBy going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company\u2019s stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users\u2019 time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products.\u201cApple\u2019s business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,\u201d Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company.For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, \u201cit turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act.\u201dIn a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices \u201clead the industry\u201d and that \u201cwe think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them.\u201d\u201cWe take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\u201dBut some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive.Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about \u201chow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, \u201cin the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.\u201dMr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, \u201cwe had no idea this was going to happen.\u201d But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones.\u201cNow it needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years in the making.\u201dEven Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company\u2019s influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days.Advertisement"}

I couldn\u2019t breathe until I broke a window with my chair.\u201dThe airline connects parts of the country where travel by road is increasingly impossible. It flies decrepit planes that sometimes bear the marks of their many previous lives: exit signs in Swahili; emergency instructions in Russian.Kam Air canceled several flights on Sunday, according to Farid Peykar, the company\u2019s vice president, who added that operations would be affected for days to come as the carrier tries to attend to the shock and concern of its staff members.Among the dead were Afghans including Ahmad Farzan, a 34-year-old religious scholar turned peace activist. Mr. Farzan had left his three young daughters in Kandahar to come to Kabul to teach university classes and work at the country\u2019s High Peace Council, a body exploring negotiations with the Taliban.He often appeared as an analyst on local television, and he was critical of the difficult regional dynamics that choke any hopes of Afghan peace. But he had begun the new year with a message of hope, posting on his Facebook page:\u201cLife is beautifulOne day, one hour, one minutewill never return.Then, please, stay away from violenceavoid frustrationsspeak of love.\u201dThe Taliban, usually quick to claim attacks, did not issue a statement declaring its responsibility for the assault on the Intercontinental Hotel until 14 hours after the siege began. At least two senior Afghan officials said the country\u2019s intelligence agency had received reports that the Haqqani Network, a particularly brutal arm of the Taliban, had planned the attack.Mr. Danish, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said six assailants armed with grenades and AK-47s had entered the hotel through the kitchen around 9 p.m. on Saturday. Most of the rooms were occupied, with at least 100 guests of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology staying there for a conference.Helicopters and drones circled above the hotel for hours while guests hid inside, many cowering under beds or in toilet stalls. Television footage showed guests trying to climb out of windows with the help of makeshift ropes. The elite forces that arrived at the scene rescued 160 guests, including 41 foreigners.\u201cOur investigation teams are searching and working room by room to find out exact casualties and information,\u201d Mr. Danish said.There was much confusion about when the operation ended. At first, the authorities declared the siege over around 9 a.m., saying all four assailants had been killed. But a New York Times reporter at the scene continued to hear explosions and gunfire, which security officials said was part of a \u201cclearance operation.\u201d When the Interior Ministry later said there had actually been six assailants, it became clear that two had been missed in their initial sweep.\u201cWe tried to proceed with caution to avoid harming guests who hid in the rooms and locked the doors against the attackers,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Afzal Aman, commander of the Kabul Garrison, which is responsible for security in the capital.In a room on the second floor of the hotel, Haji Saheb Nazar, 45, an employee of Afghan Telecom, spent the night huddled in a bathroom, afraid to leave. After sunrise, he spoke on his cellphone in a whisper, nearly in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s still going on, upstairs and downstairs,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\u201cMy family is so worried about me, and they keep calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on outside and how many of them are in the hotel.

He got no answer until shortly after sunrise on Sunday.\u201cHe said he was safe. I was really happy and cried,\u201d Mukhtar said. \u201cFrom midnight until now I\u2019ve been waiting here, and now I just want to hug him and kiss him when he comes out.\u201dThis is not the first time a popular hotel has been the target of an attack in a city that is increasingly barricaded, with blast walls that grow ever taller.The hotel was once part of the chain of Intercontinental Hotels, but is now government owned.Nazar Gul Sholgarai, a commander of the local militia, said the men had been lured to a dinner reception where a Taliban infiltrator had paved the way for the attack. He said a delegation had returned with samples of the meat served at the dinner to see if the men had been poisoned before they were shot.\u201cThe bodies are still lying there, we haven\u2019t buried them \u2014 we are chasing after the Taliban footsteps,\u201d Mr. Sholgarai said. \u201cThe Taliban had come on six horses and four donkeys.\u201dSeparately, in the western province of Herat, a Toyota Corolla carrying laborers struck a roadside bomb, leaving at least eight dead, said Abdul Ahad Walizada, a spokesman for the province\u2019s police.The security forces have suffered heavy casualties in the province over the past month, according to members of the provincial council. Late Saturday, a Taliban roadside bomb killed Col. Gulbahar Mujahid, the province\u2019s deputy police chief, and wounded two of his officers as they were traveling in Humvees during an operation.\u201cThe fighting was inside Farah City and it continued the whole night, which make us stay awake and terrified,\u201d said Abdul Rahman, a resident of Farah City. \u201cWe thought the Taliban would be all around in the city in the morning, but we found security forces around. The bazaar is not functioning due to last night\u2019s fighting and heavy security presence in the city.\u201dReporting was contributed by Fahim Abed and Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul; Najim Rahim from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan; Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan; Rod Nordland from London; and Andrew Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taiwan Dentist Must Pay His Mother Nearly $1 Million for \u2018Upbringing\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 It is an age-old arrangement, and one that is usually implicit: Parents pay for their children\u2019s educations, and hope that in their old age the children will support them.But in a case that made its way to Taiwan\u2019s highest court, a mother who had financed her son\u2019s dental training sued him, asserting that he had broken a written agreement to support her from the proceeds of his dental practice.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court sided with his mother.The case attracted considerable attention because the mother and son had put down in a written contract \u2014 signed when he was 20 \u2014 what is often left unsaid, particularly in a heavily Confucian-influenced society that emphasizes filial piety. The principle is backed up by law in Taiwan, where adults are legally prohibited from abandoning their parents.Each side advanced arguments: The mother urged the court to enforce the contract. The son maintained that he had already paid his mother $1 million and should not have to pay her more.According to news outlets in Taiwan, the woman, identified only by her surname, Luo, raised her two sons after she and their father divorced, putting both through dental school. (Her ex-husband remarried.)When she filed her lawsuit eight years ago, the woman said she had come from a well-to-do doctor\u2019s family.\u201cWhen I was young I came from a na\u00efve and wealthy family and married into a military family that didn\u2019t even have a license\u201d to practice medicine, Ms. Luo said, according to Apple Daily in Taiwan. \u201cI sacrificed all of my leisure time.\u201dMs. Luo\u2019s family provided funds that enabled her to run a dental clinic where her husband, surnamed Chu, practiced until their divorce.Ms. Luo told the Supreme Court that when she worked as a single mother to put her sons through dental school, she was concerned that they might not help support her in old age, so she had each sign an agreement when they turned 20. Her sons both became practicing dentists in 2003, Apple Daily reported.The agreement stipulated that after becoming dentists, her sons would pay her 60 percent of their net profits until the total amount paid reached 50 million new Taiwan dollars, or just under $1.7 million.According to a report in The Liberty Times, the younger son told the court that he worked in his mother\u2019s dental clinic and repaid her more than $1 million. Given that he signed the contract when he was only 20 \u2014 and that he had already paid back so much of his contractual debt to his mother \u2014 he argued that his debt should be cleared.The court disagreed, however, ruling on Tuesday that because he signed the agreement as a legal adult, he was responsible for satisfying its terms.The court ordered Dr. Chu to pay an \u201cupbringing fee\u201d of more than $754,000, with additional interest bringing the total award for his mother to more than $967,000.In Taiwan, filial piety and education are widely recognized as important virtues, but young people face a tougher economic environment than their parents. The verdict drew mixed reactions.\u201cI believe everyone should want to repay their parents for raising them once they\u2019ve grown old,\u201d one Taipei-based dentist, Wu Chih-hang, 30, said in a phone interview, \u201cso I support the judges\u2019 decision.\u201d\u201cI also sympathize with the dentist\u2019s rough lot,\u201d he said. \u201cHis mother went as far as to put a value on raising her son, which is probably a difficult environment for the average person to imagine growing up in.\u201dBut a Facebook user, Huang Ya-ling, was critical of Dr. Chu. \u201cUnfilial people are beneath pigs and dogs,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Canada, a \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 for a #MeToo Reckoning", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Michelle Rempel was debating a sexual harassment bill in Canada\u2019s House of Commons on Monday when she suddenly fell silent. Ms. Rempel, a Conservative lawmaker from Alberta, dropped her prepared remarks onto her desk, stretched out her arms and turned her palms up.\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit in this place and have this conversation again,\u201d she told the chamber. \u201cI don\u2019t want another woman coming into my office. This needs to stop and it needs to stop now.\u201dMonday\u2019s frank debate in Canada\u2019s seat of power about sexual harassment and politics was the latest, and most potent, response to the #MeToo movement that is sweeping the nation in ways that have surprised even hardened Canadian feminists.In a country that often defines itself in the ways it is different from its larger and more bellicose American neighbor, Canadian women have been both inspired and dispirited by what is happening across the border and moved to speak out themselves.One notable difference, however, is that Canadian politicians from all parties are strongly calling for changes and supporting victims who are increasingly coming forward.One lawmaker after another rose to support her bill, and in some cases, argue that it should be strengthened.The debate came, coincidentally, as Canada is reeling from a maelstrom of accusations of sexually inappropriate behavior against men in positions of power, and their swift removal.All of the Canadian cases came after revelations last fall about the American film producer Harvey Weinstein set off a wave of accusations of sexual harassment and impropriety, with women speaking out loudly through the #MeToo movement and dozens of men resigning from their posts in entertainment, politics, publishing and journalism.Canada had already been grappling with the issue of sexual assault in various cases through the years, but the volume of women\u2019s voices across the border gave many reason to believe that the climate in their country might have changed, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm for reform,\u201d said Michelle Coffin, a political science professor at Saint Mary\u2019s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who worked in provincial politics for more than five years.It is not only that Canadian women feel emboldened by their American counterparts, she added. They also feel propelled by American politics, she said.Women are speaking up to make sure \u201cthat we do not get to that place where we have a prime minister accused of sexual assault, where there\u2019s a tape of him talking about women in a misogynistic way,\u201d Professor Coffin said, referring to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Donald J. Trump bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.Paulette Senior, president of the Canadian Women\u2019s Foundation, which finances gender equality projects across the country, said the election of Mr. Trump galvanized Canadian feminists, too.\u201cIt woke up women out of their slumber, those of us, even me, who took it for granted that could never happen,\u201d Ms. Senior said. \u201cWe realized that all we have worked for can be lost.\u201dOver the past week, as the accusations piled up, Canadian politicians from all parties have been swift to demand change and, even more unusually, publicly applaud female victims for disclosing their stories of abuse or assault, even anonymously.Patrick Brown, the former leader of Ontario\u2019s Progressive Conservatives, resigned last week amid accusations of sexual misconduct.Unlike the government in Washington, the federal government in Canada under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a self-described feminist, has been leading the push to address sexual harassment. The legislation his government introduced Monday defines it broadly, as any comment, gesture or touching \u201cof a sexual nature\u201d that could offend or humiliate an employee.The bill also includes as sexual harassment any \u201ccondition of a sexual nature\u201d that might affect a worker\u2019s job security or opportunities for promotion. If passed, the changes will set up a formal complaint system and give the labor department sweeping investigatory powers.The proposed measure also extends the rules to political staff members for the first time. Over the past week, many former political staff members have told personal stories of unwanted groping, kissing and lewd comments they suffered so regularly they thought it was part of the job.\u201cThings need to change and it starts with saying emphatically that it is never O.K.,\u201d said Ms. Hajdu, the labor minister, on Monday. She said Parliament was \u201ca place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced. We are all familiar with this phrase: \u2018She brought it on herself.\u2019 \u201dThe new definitions and complaint systems will, in practice, benefit a minority of Canadian workers \u2014 those who work in the federal government and in federally regulated businesses like banks, airlines and railways.Now that the movement is back on its feet, Canadian feminists say, they hope the grass-roots movement catches up with the political leadership, and changes spread from politics and the media into other domains.\u201cIt is a very interesting political time,\u201d said Lise Gotell, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Alberta. \u201cThere is a lot of space for feminism. I certainly would not have predicted this.\u201dIan Austen reported from Ottawa, and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stampede of Tech Giants Gives Rebalancing New Appeal", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou own a balanced portfolio that should perform well in all sorts of market conditions.But do you really?If you think you\u2019re protected from market swings by holding index-based investments, think again.Over all, large growth stocks soared 25.4 percent in 2017. Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201dSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.The market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roe v. Wade Was About More Than Abortion", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBecause we so often identify Roe with a woman\u2019s right to choose, we forget that the original decision attracted the ire of feminists who believed that the court had focused too little on women\u2019s interests in fertility control. The court held that the right to privacy was broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision, with her doctor, to terminate her pregnancy. The justices also reasoned that the government\u2019s interest in protecting fetal life did not become compelling until the point of viability.But why wield the court\u2019s decision as a weapon for social change? Most scholars agreed that Roe was a poorly reasoned opinion. What was the appeal for grass-roots activists?The answer is that Roe\u2019s definition of privacy seemed different. More than other Supreme Court decisions, it connected privacy to ideas about individual identity and choice. Whatever the flaws of the original decision, many hoped to use it to redefine who was thought to have autonomy and why.Conservatives as well as liberals invoked this newly articulated right to privacy. With the spread of computers, politicians like Barry Goldwater and his son, the former Republican representative Barry Goldwater Jr., pointed to Roe in demanding privacy protections for personal information.Champions of consumers\u2019 rights read the abortion decision as suggesting that patients could choose any course of treatment, including unproven alternative remedies. Those seeking a right to die used it in the fight for autonomy at the end of life.For more than a decade, Roe appealed to different groups exploring the untapped potential of the right to privacy. People on both the right and the left saw possible connections between privacy and individual interests in conscientious objection, self-determination and equal treatment.So how did one decision 45 years ago become synonymous with abortion and nothing else? In part, other privacy fights fizzled when the coalitions backing new rights collapsed. Feminists and libertarians clashed about the line between sexual coercion and sexual privacy. Those who hoped to expand data privacy disagreed about when the government had a good enough reason to collect personal data.Abortion foes and Republican politicians consciously tried to redefine Roe, equating the decision with abortion and judicial activism. Ronald Reagan had to assure social conservatives that he would pick federal judges who opposed abortion, but he also consistently promised to select nominees based on their accomplishments and judicial philosophy. Labeling Roe an activist decision helped Reagan and other Republicans strike this balance.Abortion opponents initially did not take much interest in arguments about judicial activism, seeing them as a distraction from the fight for an amendment that would ban all abortions. But by the 1980s, it was obvious that a fetal rights amendment would not pass soon. Delegitimizing Roe suddenly seemed an important step toward the movement\u2019s new goal of overruling the 1973 decision.On Roe\u2019s 45th anniversary, we should stop to think about where the right to privacy stands today. The picture does not seem very rosy. Since the new year, there have been fresh concerns about data breaches and the misuse of digital information by giants like Facebook and Google. Privacy and conscience have taken center stage as the Supreme Court considers whether a Christian baker can refuse to serve a same-sex couple. It is easy to believe that the right to privacy is ineffective, more likely to shore up a dissatisfying status quo.But part of Roe\u2019s legacy is the many ways conservatives and liberals once reimagined the right to privacy. Social movements hardly felt constrained by what the Supreme Court had written.Some pointed to privacy not just in asking for freedom from the government but also in demanding financial support from the state. Others asked not just to be left alone behind closed doors but also to get respect for relationships in public. People tried to use the right to privacy to transform attitudes about sexuality, death and the collection of digital data.Americans have rethought the right to privacy before. There is no reason we couldn\u2019t do it again.Advertisement"}

The two advisers, after researching the complaint, recommended that he be fired.\u201cIn the end,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI decided to demote him, docking his pay; separate him from the woman; assign her to work directly for my then deputy campaign manager; put in place technical barriers to his emailing her; and require that he seek counseling. He would also be warned that any subsequent harassment of any kind toward anyone would result in immediate termination.\u201d\u201cI did this because I didn\u2019t think firing him was the best solution to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needed to be punished, change his behavior and understand why his actions were wrong. The young woman needed to be able to thrive and feel safe. I thought both could happen without him losing his job. I believed the punishment was severe and the message to him unambiguous.\u201dAbout five years later, Mr. Strider was hired to lead a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton and run by a key ally, David Brock. He was fired from that group after he was accused by another young woman of sexual harassment.Sometimes, she added, second chances are squandered: \u201cIn this case, while there were no further complaints against him for the duration of the campaign, several years after working for me, he was terminated from another job for inappropriate behavior. That reoccurrence troubles me greatly, and it alone makes clear that the lesson I hoped he had learned while working for me went unheeded.\u201dMrs. Clinton said that at the time \u201cI believed the punishment I imposed was severe and fit the offense.\u201d She added that employers today \u201cwould be well served to take actions at least as severe when confronted with problems now\u201d and said that included \u201cthe very media outlet that broke this story\u201d \u2014 a reference to The New York Times.\u201cThey recently opted to suspend and reinstate one of their journalists who exhibited similarly inappropriate behavior, rather than terminate him,\u201d she said. \u201cA decade from now, that decision may not look as tough as it feels today.\u201dMrs. Clinton said that the woman told her in a call on Friday that she felt pleased with how the situation was adjudicated at the time and that she felt as if she had been heard.\u201cI was inspired by my conversation with this young woman to express my own thinking on the matter,\u201d she said.

Born in Malawi to Indian parents and brought to the United States as a 5-year-old, Ms. Mamun\u2019s protected status expires in 2019. She said she had not made any plans about the future because things were so uncertain.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re on edge constantly,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day you have hope that it might go through, and then something else comes up.\u201dAn agreement did seem to be staggering closer on Tuesday, though how much closer seemed impossible for even the negotiators to predict amid the welter of bewildering signals from Mr. Trump. After a year of holding a hard line on immigration, the president suggested in a meeting with congressional leaders that he supported not only a deal to protect the Dreamers but also a comprehensive immigration reform package, raising the possibility that the DACA recipients\u2019 security could hinge on a much messier set of compromises.Republicans, meanwhile, were still pushing to tie any benefits for the young immigrants to curbs on family-based legal immigration, border security and other conservative priorities that Democrats and immigration advocates have frowned upon.\u201cWe\u2019re being held hostage as a bargaining chip,\u201d said Rafael Robles, 26, a DACA recipient in Chicago who owns an architecture, design and real estate development firm. \u201cI\u2019m not advocating for the Dream Act at the expense of everyone else.\u201dOn Tuesday night, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration had ended the program improperly and ordered it restarted. Though immigration advocates welcomed the ruling, they cautioned that they expected it to be challenged, if not overturned, and warned that a court order was no substitute for an act of Congress.It was around 5 a.m. in Fall River, Mass., when Hellosa Silva, 18, a high school senior who came to the United States from Brazil when she was an infant, was jolted awake by a news alert on her cellphone informing her of the judge\u2019s decision.\u201cI read it and got super excited,\u201d she said.Immigration lawyers were deluged on Wednesday morning with clients eager to take advantage of the court-ordered reinstatement. Jeremy McKinney, an immigration lawyer in North Carolina whose firm has more than 1,000 clients with DACA, said he posted the court ruling on the firm\u2019s Facebook page late Tuesday, only for his phones to blow up in the morning.Mr. McKinney said that he had advised his clients against filing renewal paperwork because there was no guarantee that the administration would approve any new applications, even if it did not win on appeal, and he did not feel comfortable accepting legal fees for what would likely be a futile effort.It was difficult news to break to clients who are emotionally exhausted.\u201cWe certainly have been wearing our counselor hats here at the law firm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do our best to talk them through it, to kind of decrease their anxiety levels, but frankly, it\u2019s not working.\u201dRamiro Luna was working late on Tuesday in Dallas when he saw the news about the judge\u2019s ruling on Facebook. It did little to relieve the tension he felt every time he thought about his DACA status \u2014 which was to say, every time he looked at the countdown clock on his iPhone that tells him how many days he has left before it expires.On Wednesday, the clock stood at 280 days.\u201cEvery single day,\u201d he said, \u201cI feel like I have one day left to consider myself safe here.\u201dMr. Luna, 33, came to the United States from Mexico with his father at the age of 7. Now studying psychology at the University of North Texas at Dallas, he works as the campaign manager for State Representative Victoria Neave, a Dallas Democrat.He said he had grown accustomed to living with chaos and uncertainty. For one thing, he might lose his work permit before ballots are cast in the election he is working on.DACA has allowed its recipients to get jobs, go to college, obtain driver\u2019s licenses and open 401(k)s. All of those opportunities are now at risk.\u201cWe\u2019re at the mercy of the administration. We\u2019re at the mercy of court rulings,\u201d Mr. Luna said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m already thinking: What kind of remedial job am I going to be able to do without documentation?\u201dFor Missael Garcia, 27, the question was no longer theoretical. The work permit he obtained through DACA has already expired, forcing him to give up his job as a mentor with the Baltimore city schools system. Now he works as a restaurant cook, paid off the books in cash, he said.On Wednesday, unwilling to leave matters to a judge, he was in Washington, knocking on lawmakers\u2019 doors with a Baltimore-based advocacy group, Casa in Action.\u201cI feel like this government says things that get people excited and then gets their hopes up,\u201d he said, \u201cand at the end of the day it\u2019s like a stab in the back.\u201dKnocking on doors, calling members of Congress, spreading the word on social media: Activism was the only hope most DACA recipients had of influencing a process that had played out in front of millions, on television and in news outlets across the country, yet would ultimately come down to the inclinations of a few.Most immigration activists believe their best chance at a deal for the Dreamers is now, when Democrats can threaten to withhold support for a spending bill Congress would need to pass to prevent the government from shutting down on Jan. 19.More than 100 DACA recipients have been traipsing throughout the Capitol in Washington for the past two days, telling their stories to lawmakers in an urgent effort to persuade them to enshrine the program into law.One of them was Hector Rivera Suarez, 20, the student body president at Guilford College, in Greensboro, N.C., whose DACA status expires Jan. 21.\u201cNow I feel like I don\u2019t have control over my own future anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI had all these plans, but now it\u2019s up to someone else to make those decisions for me.\u201dLiz Robbins contributed reporting from New York, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Retail Trade Show, Technology Is the Star", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retail industry is doubling down on digital to keep its unexpectedly strong holiday performance from becoming a fluke.The floor of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual trade show in New York this week was crowded with alert systems primed to recognize heavy-spending customers, so-called smart shelves fitted with real-time inventory trackers and robots for every step of the supply chain.It was a conference about shopping that looked more like an expo for tech, as if the electronics trade show CES had decamped from Las Vegas and moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.At the three-day event \u2014 which drew more than 600 exhibitors and featured sessions with top executives from Walmart, Best Buy, Neiman Marcus and other major companies \u2014 discussions of artificial intelligence, big data and automation filled stages and meeting booths modeled after fitting rooms.E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.Embracing technologies, and quickly, is crucial to survival as consumers grow more demanding, according to a panel of venture capital professionals.\u201cThe consumer expectation of a frictionless shopping experience is here,\u201d said Scott Friend, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures.Digitally native companies are emerging and growing faster. Catching up can be difficult for large legacy chains, which have struggled to project enough cool factor to recruit in-demand employees.\u201cTalent is a major challenge for a lot of these retailers,\u201d said Janie Yu, a partner at Fung Capital. \u201cIf you are a top-notch, A+ data scientist, you probably want to work at Bonobos or Facebook or Google or Jet.\u201dMr. Friend said that companies like Walmart had tried to make cultural shifts to attract innovative employees, or folded them in through acquisitions.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s some magic that start-ups have that big companies don\u2019t,\u201d he said.All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?\u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201dShoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.Consumers are in control, as retailers scramble to tailor products to their liking, design more elaborate shopping experiences to hold their interest and deliver purchases on increasingly short deadlines.Customer behavior is getting harder to pin down. The boundaries between generations are disappearing, as so-called millennial and generation Z shoppers influence the buying habits of baby boomers, panelists said.As companies compile more detailed dossiers on their clientele, stuffed with data collected online and in stores, retailers could someday fine-tune their marketing and scheduling to each consumer, the panelists said.\u201cWe can microsegment as thin as we want in the future,\u201d Ms. Haziot said. \u201cEach individual is a segment in itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Age of Trump, Political Reporters Are in Demand and Under Attack", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Asked to reflect on the relationship between President Trump and the news media \u2014 an abusive yet symbiotic union, if there ever was one \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, paused a moment to consider.\u201cIt\u2019s the first McLuhanesque presidency,\u201d he said, finally, leaning back in a chair on the parlor floor of his residence here on Thursday. \u201cOne hundred percent.\u201dStill, he has a point: \u201cFox & Friends\u201d routinely prompts presidential edicts, tsetse-like tweets from @realDonaldTrump swarm lawmakers and shape policy, and the pronouncements of Time magazine or MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough can carry outsize importance in the Oval Office.\u201cThe digital world is more real than the physical, analog world,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, adding, of Mr. Trump, \u201cHe understands that in a very visceral way.\u201dSome reporters, in unguarded moments, say that they fear for journalists\u2019 safety. Margaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, was moved to tears in an interview as she recounted the death threats that now routinely land in her colleagues\u2019 emails.Other journalists \u2014 ironic, cynical or simply enterprising, depending on your point of view \u2014 have embraced the moment as the wildest ride of their lives, and a lucrative one, too: The number of Washington reporters with cable television contracts, some with salaries verging on six figures, has surged.It is a boom time for investigative reporting \u2014 witness the revelations unearthed by The New York Times, Politico, The Washington Post and others \u2014 and also for rank incrementalism. A story\u2019s \u201cbuzz,\u201d variously defined by the number of retweets, Facebook likes or panicked text messages from White House aides that it generates, is at a premium, fueling news outlets that condense political reporting from 1,000-word stories into stand-alone nuggets designed to set Twitter aflame.Trust in the press has eroded thanks, in part, to Mr. Trump and his allies, the ubiquitous phrase \u201cfake news\u201d osmosing its way into the American psyche. Yet newspaper subscriptions and television news ratings, once in free fall, have perked back up.\u201cWhen he says you\u2019ll miss me when I\u2019m gone, and your ratings will go through the floor, he\u2019s absolutely correct,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, mischievously, of Mr. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s McLuhan talking through Trump.\u201dWearing four visible layers of shirts (including a zip-up fleece from West Point, which one of his daughters attended), Mr. Bannon declined to speak on the record about his own role in making the fraught new media environment. But there were signs that, like Mr. Trump, he is aware he has benefited from the same news media that he likes to denigrate.Mr. Trump has forsaken formal news conferences, and his usual forum for sit-down interviews has been Fox News. (Last week, in Davos, the president acquiesced to interviews with CNBC and the British presenter Piers Morgan, who has usually been friendly toward Mr. Trump.) But he has embraced the so-called \u201cpool sprays\u201d \u2014 journalist jargon for a White House photo-op \u2014 to spar with reporters off-the-cuff, sometimes for nearly an hour at a time.Mr. VandeHei proselytized for his site\u2019s \u201csmart brevity\u201d philosophy during an interview at Axios\u2019s Virginia offices, inside a co-working space where pale ale is on tap and the coffee urns specify the altitude at which the beans are grown.Axios covers the Trump administration with a bullet-pointed morning newsletter, by the well-connected Washington journalist Mike Allen, and quick-hit scoops from its sole White House reporter, Jonathan Swan. To hear Mr. VandeHei tell it, the era of the in-depth newspaper story is over.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t reading that long and, to be honest, they shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said.An Axios buzzword is \u201cilluminate\u201d \u2014 tell readers exactly what they need to know, and nothing more. Mr. Swan, a newcomer to Washington who regularly breaks news, does not attend White House briefings, where fresh information can be scarce.But Ms. Talev, a Bloomberg News correspondent and the president of the Correspondents\u2019 Association, said that the briefing remains an opportunity to force the administration to speak on the record \u2014 a crucial forum in an era when truth is blurred. \u201cWe think briefings serve people; we think open dialogue serves people,\u201d she said in an interview at Peet\u2019s Coffee, a block from her West Wing desk.Ms. Talev said that her father escaped Communist Bulgaria in the 1960s, where dissent was squashed and criticizing government officials was forbidden. Her work, she said, feels personal these days. Under her watch, the Correspondents\u2019 Association has created a new committee on reporters\u2019 security, to assist members who receive threats, an increasingly common occurrence.Work in the capital, however, goes on. Beneath the White House briefing room, where about two dozen journalists occupy a warren of cramped offices and cubicles, the mood is like that of any other workplace, as it was under past administrations.But subtle subversions do exist. For months, a New Yorker cartoon has been tacked to the wall in a prominent place by the stairs. It shows two bearded prisoners hanging inside a dungeon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beef and Onions, Made Better With Beer", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteGently cooked onions, simmered in butter or oil until they collapse in a golden-brown heap, need very little help to become a meal.Add broth and some toasted bread, and they become a soothing soup. Scoop them onto pizzas or stir them into risotto or pasta, and they shine sweetly against the plainer carbs.And in this hearty, warming stew, they melt into a soft-textured sauce for brawny cubes of beef.Pound for pound, there\u2019s nearly as much onion in the pot as there is meat, with the two flavors melding into each other. Bite into a strand of onion without any meat attached, and you\u2019ll emphatically taste the beef, while the meat absorbs all the oniony broth that surrounds it, becoming redolent as it falls apart on your fork.The ale here is essential. It adds a restraining note of bitterness to counter the onions, which can become overwhelming depending on their natural sugar content and how long you cook them. The longer and slower they go, the sweeter they become. A shot of ale keeps them in check.Another ingredient to seek out is good, strong fresh paprika. Contrary to the beliefs of many cooks, paprika should actually taste like something, and should not just be a bland and ruddy garnish for deviled eggs. If you can\u2019t remember when you last bought a jar of paprika, buy a new one. Then open it and inhale. It should smell sweet, fruity and a little funky.Like all good stews, this one needs a soft bed on which to land. Noodles, potatoes, polenta, rice or quinoa will all work to absorb every drop of that gloriously oniony, meaty sauce.And to Drink \u2026With this variation on Flemish carbonnade, beer would be a natural selection: a Belgian ale, a brown ale, or a dry stout or porter. Good sturdy red wines would be delicious as well. Gigondas or Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, from the southern Rh\u00f4ne Valley, would be great so long as they are not too fruity. Cornas from the northern Rh\u00f4ne would go well, as would structured cabernet francs from the Loire Valley. You could also try syrahs from California or Washington. I would be happy with a Rioja reserva. From Italy, you could try an aglianico from Campania or Basilicata, or a Sicilian nerello mascalese from Mount Etna. The key for the red is to have enough body and structure to stand up to the assertive stew but not overwhelm it with sweet fruit flavors. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trust and Transparency: A.G. Sulzberger, Our New Publisher, Answers Readers\u2019 Questions", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk The TimesWhen we solicited questions last month for our new publisher, A. G. Sulzberger, our readers responded in droves \u2014 to the tune of some 2,500 submissions. You\u2019ll find his responses to a curated selection below. (Some questions have been condensed and edited for clarity.)_____Before I answer your questions, I want to share a bit about my background.Since then, I\u2019ve been working with colleagues across the company to answer an essential question: How can The Times hold on to the best of our journalistic traditions while also evolving to meet the changing needs of our readers and taking advantage of powerful new ways to find and tell stories? Though we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of years, that question remains a focus in my new role as publisher.And now for the questions \u2026_____Seems like a good question to kick this off.At the highest level, a publisher oversees a news organization\u2019s journalism and business operations. This means I am responsible for ensuring that our journalism is worth your time and money, and that we have a strong strategy for our long-term commercial success in a moment of pressure and change in our industry.But to me, Adolph Ochs, my great-great-grandfather and our first publisher, captured the spirit of the role best: \u201cTo maintain the editorial independence and the integrity of The New York Times and to continue it as an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, free of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare.\u201d_____This is a really important \u2014 and tricky \u2014 question, and one that I think about a lot.Powerful forces are stoking distrust in the news media with attacks on the press and sowing confusion by promoting clickbait, rumor, fraudulent stories and propaganda. This has been driven in no small part by various politicians and technology platforms pursuing their short-term interests over the greater good. These tactics contribute to growing polarization and undermine trust in news organizations.It will be hard for a single institution to counteract these forces, but we\u2019re determined to try. (I\u2019m encouraged that some leaders in Washington and Silicon Valley seem to be recognizing that they need to do their part.)The best thing we at The Times can do is stay true to our mission of finding and telling the stories that matter, without fear or favor. I believe that our rapidly growing number of readers and subscribers is a testament to how people increasingly crave news they can trust. I also believe we still have more to do to help people understand why they should trust our journalism and to provide greater transparency into our reporting.In the past, our approach was to let our work speak for itself. Our assumption was that people intuitively understood all the hard work that goes into a New York Times article. But we\u2019ve learned we need to do more to explain how our reporting works. For example, many readers don\u2019t know that a dateline from a foreign city means our reporters are physically in that place, on the ground seeing and hearing firsthand everything they\u2019re reporting. They don\u2019t know that Adam Liptak\u2019s Supreme Court reporting is made stronger by his experience as a lawyer, or that Sheri Fink\u2019s background as a physician informs her investigations into medical misconduct. And they don\u2019t know that for every person we quote in a story, sometimes dozens more have been interviewed.The more we can show readers the thoughtfulness, thoroughness, expertise and rigor that go into everything we cover, the better. (I address the concern about bias in more detail below.)_____But I\u2019d also encourage everyone who is able to support your local news organizations as well. They do essential work and are feeling real pressure right now._____So why eliminate the role of public editor?The public editor was created in a different era to act as an intermediary between our readers and our journalists. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t. But today there are faster, more effective and more transparent ways to receive and respond to feedback.My view is that if readers have significant concerns about a particular story or how we\u2019ve covered a broader topic, we should engage with them directly and openly._____This is a great question.Though there are no easy answers, The Times is deeply committed to finding ways to support robust coverage throughout the United States._____There is nothing we take more seriously than the fairness, accuracy and independence of our journalism.That\u2019s not to say our journalists never have opinions. But just as a judge is expected to set aside personal views to ensure the integrity of a trial, our journalists are expected to do the same to ensure the integrity of their journalism. My colleagues in the newsroom work hard at this, and it\u2019s one of the reasons The Times has such strict standards and rigorous editing.Our job is to follow the truth, wherever it leads, and to bring information to light \u2014 not to tell people how to think.Now more than ever, it is vital for our pages to feature stories and columns that reflect a diversity of views and that challenge readers to consider perspectives very different from their own. Making sure our report explores multiple angles on the biggest stories is a critical part of our mission to remain nonpartisan in these polarized times.Do we sometimes fall short? Of course. This is a human enterprise. But I think some complaints about bias \u2014 both from the right and the left \u2014 are rooted in a misunderstanding of our core journalistic role. And some complaints, more cynically, simply seek to discredit reporting that may prove unflattering or damaging to certain interests.Our commitment to independent, unbiased journalism is one of the things that makes The Times special. As publisher, I\u2019m determined to maintain this approach, and I know our journalists embrace that responsibility with a fierce sense of purpose._____After the 2016 election, I canceled my 15-year-old New York Times subscription. I would like to come back, but I need some sort of accounting for your editorial decisions during the 2016 election.In particular, your coverage of the Clinton email scandal and Trump-Russia seems inexplicable in hindsight. I get that you assumed Clinton would win, but the race was always pretty close. Meanwhile, obvious stories, like Trump\u2019s business connections abroad, were totally ignored.I hear you, and I\u2019ve heard from others who were upset, too. And I don\u2019t want to in any way diminish that concern, but I do want to put it into a broader context.Now, to be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that we embrace a kind of false equivalency \u2014 I\u2019m skeptical of the old line that \u201cif everyone\u2019s mad, then we\u2019re doing our jobs.\u201d But I am saying that our most important function is to report aggressively and to arm readers with the information they need to make their own decisions, rather than to promote any single outcome.Our approach may strike some as old-fashioned. But we believe it\u2019s the most important role the news media can play in supporting a healthy democratic society.I\u2019m always sorry when readers feel let down by our coverage. We work hard every day to earn your trust. We have devoted tremendous reporting resources since the election to examining every part of this political moment \u2014 the anger, the divisions, the rise of both anti- and pro-Trump activism.These are crucial stories for us and, we think, for the country. And I think if you began reading The Times again, you would find that coverage deep and insightful and informative. I very much hope you\u2019ll return as a subscriber in the future._____As a longtime subscriber, my faith in The Times was deeply shaken when the Hillary numbers we saw every day leading up to the election turned out to be so incredibly off the mark. It was 82/18, 84/16; Hillary was going to dominate. After Trump won I kept asking myself how my dear New York Times could have gotten it so wrong.Sixteen percent is like rolling a die and looking for a three to come up. If it happened, you might feel surprised \u2014 chances were against you \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t feel like the entire system was broken.But I also understand that lots of our readers do feel let down, and that saying it was probability, not prophecy, doesn\u2019t help them \u2026I still believe that \u201cWhat do all these polls mean?\u201d is basically a noble question, and that models are a rigorous and disciplined way to think about it.I personally think polls can provide useful information and insight. But regardless of where you come down on that issue, I can assure you that our editors are actively examining the lessons from the last election and are committed to using those insights to update our approach._____Climate change is one of the most important stories of our time, and The Times is invested in covering it deeply and fully.Our approach is to tell those stories in as many ways as we can. We\u2019ve often turned to visuals because showing can be more powerful than telling, particularly when the science can be dense and complicated, and the scale of these challenges can make them feel abstract._____The same way we face all pressure: through independent, deeply reported and scrupulously fair journalism, without fear or favor._____First, allow me to correct the record a bit. While we no longer have a separate copy-desk operation, the majority of our copy editors are still on staff, and still editing copy. But we did significantly change our editing system for the first time in many decades, for two reasons.First, we felt our editing systems and processes needed to be updated to meet the evolving needs of an increasingly digitally focused newsroom. Second, in recent years, largely because of uneven staff turnover, the number of editors had grown significantly larger in relation to the number of reporters, and it was necessary to rebalance a bit so we could put more reporters in the field.Many people, both inside and outside the Times building, were upset with the changes. I understand that. It\u2019s been hard to shift how we work, and it was painful to say goodbye to some longtime colleagues. But as the world changes, The Times must change, too.As for any mistakes you\u2019re seeing: Every week we publish about the number of words you\u2019ll find in the complete works of William Shakespeare. Despite considerable efforts, it\u2019s inevitable that some typos, misspellings and grammatical errors will make their way into our report. We\u2019re tracking the effects of our new editing system closely, and the changes have indeed resulted in a modest uptick of such errors. As we continue to refine our systems, we remain confident that the errors will decrease over the coming months.Finally, it\u2019s worth saying that even with the editing changes, The Times has the largest and best trained staff of editors of any newspaper. Every piece of journalism we publish is read carefully by at least two experienced editors. I believe that if you compare our pages with those of other news organizations, you\u2019ll find that ours display the highest standards of quality.That said, we know our readers rightfully have incredibly high expectations, and we will continue to strive to do better._____I get asked this question all the time, which is a reminder of how much people still love the experience of reading the printed newspaper. And it\u2019s easy to understand why \u2014 curling up on the couch with the Sunday paper is one of the highlights of my week.My advice would be to ignore the predictions of the end of print \u2014 we\u2019ve been hearing them for more than two decades now and the paper is still going strong._____I am a senior citizen who has been reading The Times for more years than I can count! I look forward to this on a daily basis. However, I cannot afford the price increases! I have had to cut back to Sunday only, and read on my iPad.Thank you for your being such a loyal reader, and I\u2019m truly sorry to hear that the print edition is becoming too expensive for you. Maybe it will help to explain why newspaper prices have been rising and where your subscription dollars go.Basically, it\u2019s as simple as this: Great journalism is really expensive, and right now we rely on subscriptions to pay for this important work.We employ more than 1,450 journalists who scour the world for the most important stories and then bring them to life in the most creative and compelling ways. We put reporters on the ground in more than 150 countries every year.We maintain a full-time presence in dangerous places like Iraq and Afghanistan and support journalists doing hard and important work covering war, natural disasters and genocide.We employ experts in countless fields \u2014 our staff includes people with backgrounds in law, medicine, business, science, economics, statistics, the military and more \u2014 whose skills, training and experiences allow them to bring you information and insights others can\u2019t.As print advertising has declined, we\u2019ve had to find new ways to support all of this hard and expensive work. Fortunately, our readers have largely been willing to fill that gap. Ultimately, for less than the cost of a subway ride each day, a print subscription brings you stories and insights from every corner of the globe \u2014 so I hope that when you do pay for The Times, you\u2019ll never question the value you\u2019re getting.Thank you again for reading and supporting what we do._____The Times has covered more issues and given more space and images to people of color and women in its coverage this past year. But many times the coverage is from white people. (For example, in a feature about recipes for Kwanzaa during the holiday, the only African-American cook represented wasn\u2019t even alive anymore!)Will the journalists, editors, illustrators and photographers employed to do work for The Times be representative of the growing population of black, brown and female Americans and be more representative in your leadership beyond a few examples?Diversity is front of mind for me as I step into this new role. And that\u2019s not just for moral reasons; it\u2019s because our mission is to help people understand the world, which means our report must be informed by a wide range of backgrounds, lived experiences and perspectives.In general, I\u2019m proud of our record on diversity. About half of the desks in our newsroom are run by women. And as we\u2019ve increased our hiring over the last year, more than 60 percent of new hires have been women and more than 35 percent are people of color. At the same time we\u2019ve expanded our coverage of gender and race.But I also believe we can do better. To point to one obvious example, our lineup of columnists still needs to be more diverse. I\u2019m committed to working with leadership throughout The Times to continue pushing for real, visible progress over the next few years. I think it will make our journalism better and our business stronger._____The power of the press lies not just in how stories are written but in which stories are published. With the financial challenges that print faces, it\u2019s harder to make choices that don\u2019t necessarily cater to what readers think they want. I worry some important sections may alter or disappear if modern audiences feel they\u2019re not interesting.My grandfather Punch Sulzberger used to say that people don\u2019t come to The Times for news, they come for judgment. I believe that deeply.There are countless other news organizations and social media platforms obsessed with giving the public exactly what it wants to read. At The Times, our reporters and editors spend their days asking: What does the public need to know?That our business is supported by the loyalty of our readers makes this easier for us. We don\u2019t need to chase clicks. Our subscribers have made clear that they want original, expert journalism that they can\u2019t read anywhere else.These stories don\u2019t always get the most buzz or the highest readership, but at an institution dedicated to helping you understand the world, we view them as central to our mission._____My father accomplished much during his 25 years as publisher, so there is a lot I could talk about here. But to me, his most important legacy is that he never wavered from investing in great journalism. Even as other newsrooms were drastically cut in recent years, he made additional investments that ensured The Times\u2019s newsroom was stronger than ever.That was not the easy or obvious choice; it took bravery and vision. I feel lucky to have gotten to see that commitment up close, and it will continue to be my North Star._____In general, I feel very good about our coverage of Trump\u2019s campaign and his administration. It\u2019s been aggressive, smart, revealing and fair.This is not a one-time adjustment \u2014 we are committed to this coverage going forward \u2014 and I think having experienced reporters talking to voters in every part of the country will make our report stronger as we head into the next election cycle._____This is a question I\u2019m getting a lot these days. I think people are trying to find a polite way to ask whether I\u2019m in over my head.But there are also some ways that being young for a role like this has advantages. The most important is that I\u2019m keenly aware that I need to continue to learn and grow, which I believe is essential in a world that is changing this fast. (In fact, I think it\u2019s essential for anyone, of any age or experience, who works in the media business.)Another is that it wasn\u2019t too long ago when I was out in the field as a reporter. Being deeply connected to the reality on the ground and having relationships with people at all levels of the company give me an extra layer of insight and empathy that can be really useful._____Hello Mr. Sulzberger! My name is Crystal Choi and I was recently chosen to serve as the editor in chief of my school\u2019s Journalism Club.I wanted to say that I was very inspired by your statement on continuing on the mission of The New York Times in this day and age of manipulated mass media. Through the years, our club lost direction and isn\u2019t in the best place right now, but after reading your letter, I am encouraged to help spark up a new flame as I strongly value the culture and skill sets that healthy journalism cultivates.Thanks, Crystal. I\u2019m so pleased to hear that you read my note.Student journalism is both important and a great way to start learning about reporting and editing. I got my start in journalism under the tutelage of a great teacher named Bob Montera \u2014 thanks, Mr. Montera! \u2014 and many of my colleagues around The Times got their first journalism experience as students, too.We\u2019re wishing you and your classmates lots of luck in the years ahead. The world needs more young people who are committed to the values that make great journalism possible.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, People Really Are Eating Tide Pods. No, It\u2019s Not Safe.", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt seems every few weeks another challenge takes social media by storm.The latest, the \u201cTide pod challenge,\u201d belongs in that category. It involves biting down on a brightly colored laundry detergent packet of any brand and spitting out or ingesting its contents, an act that poses serious health risks.YouTube and Facebook said they will remove material showing people who have recorded themselves performing the challenge. Tide released a video in which Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots discouraged the practice.Here\u2019s a look at how an improbable idea promoted on the internet has become a cause for genuine concern.Fads like the Tide challenge lend themselves to exaggeration, so it\u2019s wise to be wary of alarmist warnings not backed up by evidence.In this case, however, data suggests a shift in recent weeks, particularly among teenagers.Highly concentrated detergent and a variety of chemicals are inside, depending on the brand, she said. Tide pods contain 90 percent active ingredients and 10 percent water, according to the company. A dissolvable covering holds it all in.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is when children or adults bite into these things that moisture-sensitive membranes basically just disintegrates and the contents explode inside your mouth,\u201d she said in a phone interview.That\u2019s when the pain sets in. The chemicals cause severe burns to the mouth, esophagus or respiratory tract, she said, adding that some very young and very old patients with cognitive issues have been rushed to emergency rooms or even died as a result of eating the packets.\u201cThis is not something I would put anywhere near someone\u2019s mouth,\u201d she said.The origins and inspiration of the challenge are murky, but jokes have circulated online about the temptation of a product that is known to be dangerous but that bears a resemblance to brightly colored candy.In late 2015, the satirical publication The Onion published commentary from a child\u2019s perspective in which he vowed to consume one.In recent weeks, similar jokes have surfaced online featuring real or doctored images of the pods made to look like food, such as pizza toppings.If you or someone is exposed to detergent, it\u2019s important to reach a medical expert right away, either by contacting a poison control center or a doctor.The American Association of Poison Control Centers also maintains a hotline, 1-800-222-1222, where experts are always available to field questions. You can also text \u201cpoison\u201d to 797979.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret to Better Thai Dishes May Already Be in Your Fridge", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThere are, however, times when I crave something a little more ambitious, a dish that\u2019s deeper, more complex and closer to the curries I can get in a good Thai restaurant. But I want it without having to track down the galangal, lime leaves and dried shrimp necessary to make an authentic Thai red curry paste from scratch.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.Doctoring up the stuff in the jar is a good middle ground. The prepared paste has the base flavor that I can build on by adding a few fresh aromatics \u2014 ones that I can easily pick up en route from the subway to my front door \u2014 garlic, chiles, cilantro, ginger and shallot. These can revive even an old half-used jar (the one that lives behind the miso and the tahini), giving it brightness and verve.Once you\u2019ve done your shopping and chopping, the paste comes together quickly in the blender, and you\u2019ll have enough left over to make this dish again. Store the extra paste in the refrigerator for up to three weeks or the freezer for up to three months.As for the noodles themselves, use any kind of thin noodles you like. Even gluten-free varieties work well as long as you don\u2019t overcook them. I generally lean toward skinny Chinese egg noodles because I like the added richness of the yolk. But springy rice noodles are a close second.This dish requires a bit more work than your average weeknight dinner, and a lot more work than ordering in. But with its gorgeous combination of crunchy vegetables, slippery noodles and heady sauce, no one will ever guess it all started in a jar.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Weeknight Dish for Lovers of Non-Fishy Fish", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThere are \u201cfishy\u201d fish, and then there are non-fishy fish. And with its mild, milky flesh, cod is one of the least fishy of them all.Usually, I\u2019m drawn to the more robust varieties \u2014 the mackerels, sardines, anchovies and swordfish in the market, which have enough personality to take whatever seasoning I feel like throwing at them. This gives me the kind of fridge-clearing, spice-sprinkling latitude I need to get really creative.But milder fish can also be appealing, especially cod, which has a fresh, saline taste that can also be sweet. To fully appreciate its subtle flavor, it\u2019s best to keep things simple when preparing it.The good thing about this kind of simplicity is that it can also mean speed. The fewer things you have to chop, peel, squeeze, seed, grind or otherwise deal with when cooking, the faster your dinner will come together. Minimalism is your friend on any given weeknight.In this recipe, the only ingredients to prepare are shallots, garlic and some fresh herbs: It\u2019s labor you can do while your skillet heats up. Once it\u2019s hot, you\u2019ll quickly braise the cod fillets and shallots in butter, white wine and a handful of herb sprigs.Then, while the fish firms up in the pan, you\u2019ll have ample time to mix the sauce: a swirl of garlic, yogurt and whatever those herbs were that you just chopped. Or you can make the sauce ahead. It will keep for a week in the fridge, and it is so good on roasted or raw vegetables that you might even consider a double batch.That\u2019s it, and the payoff is big: A dinner of meltingly tender, butter-infused cod enhanced but not overwhelmed by the tart, herb-speckled yogurt sauce. Add a spinach salad and crusty bread, or maybe some mashed potatoes if you\u2019re in full-on comfort food mode, and you\u2019ve got a cozy dinner that\u2019s after-work friendly.Like most very simple dishes, this one depends heavily on the quality of the ingredients. So when it comes to the fish, it\u2019s better to go for what looks gorgeous in the market rather than sticking to the recipe. If the cod that\u2019s available seems mushy, choose something perkier and more pristine. Another mild fish \u2014 hake, flounder or sea bass \u2014 will keep the gentle spirit of the recipe intact.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For One Baltimore School, 7 Killings in Just 15 Months", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 What happened to 19-year-old Markel Scott last March is increasingly common here: Someone walked up to him on the street and shot him six times. Two months from his high school graduation, he died on the sidewalk, still wearing his book bag.\u201cI grew up here and I\u2019ve never seen crime like this,\u201d his mother, Sharonda Rhodes, said recently. \u201cThese are not normal times. The guns are everywhere.\u201dMr. Scott attended a small school for older students who had dropped out and were trying to get their lives on track. But his resolve was not enough to shield him from the dangers of the streets. Seven students at Excel Academy have been murdered in 15 months, so much violence that an empty desk might mean a skipped class \u2014 or another permanent absence.Dealing with murder has become routine at Excel, with grief counselors called in with each fallen classmate. It has become difficult to focus on things like biology or math. With its shrinking student body, the school is a grim reflection of the difficulties facing Baltimore.The city is adding to a network of more than 750 high-definition cameras that zoom in and follow people as they walk down streets. Probationers and parolees are getting checked on more often. Recreation centers and libraries have expanded their hours.Mayor Catherine E. Pugh, who took office a year ago, convenes monthly meetings with community leaders from the city\u2019s most troubled neighborhoods to discuss anti-violence strategies.City Hall has ordered every agency to undertake initiatives to reduce crime, like installing street lighting and clearing vacant lots. The mayor requires department heads to attend daily meetings where they discuss not only the previous day\u2019s murders but the best way to board up abandoned buildings.It is unclear whether the strategies are working: There were nine killings during the first 12 days of 2018.The Police Department finds signs of hope where it can. The first weekend in January was a bright spot; there was only a single homicide. \u201cThree days, one murder \u2014 that\u2019s no accident,\u201d Kevin Davis, the police commissioner, said at the next daily crime intervention meeting. \u201cBut what gets us is the Mondays and Tuesdays. Let\u2019s do the best we can.\u201dThe police say the vast majority of homicides are retaliatory and committed by repeat offenders. Last year\u2019s victims had an average of 11 arrests each. Almost half had been arrested in connection with violent crimes and nearly three-quarters on drug charges. The suspected killers had similar rap sheets, though they had been arrested fewer times on average than the victims.Some woes common to cities are worse in Baltimore. A port city, it has been a center of heroin use and distribution since at least the 1970s. \u201cIf I live in a neighborhood that has been festering with drugs for 20 years, I\u2019m going to be a drug dealer or be on drugs or be a victim of one or the other,\u201d said Tammatha Woodhouse, the principal of Excel Academy, the small alternative school that Mr. Scott attended.\u201cWhen we don\u2019t address the real cause of poverty, we put young people in places and situations they wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said.The deaths of her students bear the hallmarks of a city awash in guns, with too few residents willing to tell the police what they know.Bryant Beverly, 18, was fatally shot after he was chased into a house after a dispute.Steven Jackson, 18, was killed in a double homicide that the police say was related to drug sales.Lavar Douglas, 18, was killed by a police officer at Coppin State University after Mr. Douglas shot at someone in a car.And of Mr. Scott, the police would say only that he may have been murdered in a disagreement about money.Mr. Scott had no criminal record, and it may never be known whether this was a current dispute, something from his past catching up with him, or even a simple misunderstanding. Six of the seven killings remain unsolved.The police say that even when they have a suspect, they can be hampered by a code of silence that is not unique to Baltimore but has sometimes been traced back to a \u201cStop Snitching\u201d DVD that circulated here in 2004.The lack of answers in her son\u2019s death gnaws at Ms. Rhodes. \u201cWhat did he know? What did he see? Why did someone shoot him so many times?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy son only weighed 125 pounds, but someone shot him six times, twice in the face. Why?\u201dAt one point, a detective called and acknowledged that he had not had time to work on the case, she said, because \u201cthere were so many other bodies.\u201dThe 423 students at Excel have complicated, often traumatic pasts. Many of them live in group homes or foster care, and struggled in regular school. The school has four social workers, a psychologist and mental health counselors who talk frequently to students about how to avoid violence \u2014 and when it happens, how to cope.Excel recently opened what students call the \u201cchill-out room,\u201d where they can vent to a staff aide, listen to music in headphones, or just sit in silence.D\u00e9ja Williams, 19, a student who knew the seven young men who were killed, had been particularly close to Markel Scott. Her path has included six foster homes, sporadic school attendance and frequent quarrels with Ms. Woodhouse, who has repeatedly convinced her not to drop out. She is scheduled to graduate this year.Of the killings, Ms. Williams said, \u201cAfter the third time, it was like, \u2018What\u2019s going on? Why are so many people from our school getting murdered? Is someone going after Excel?\u2019 But I think most of them were at the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201dMs. Rhodes said her son did not carry a gun and was not involved in illegal activity. She made sure, she said, by periodically scanning his mobile phone and Facebook and Instagram accounts.He had dropped out of school when he was 17, around the time three of his friends were killed, she said. But once he started at Excel, he became a dedicated student.Less than a week before his death, Mr. Scott declared his new sense of purpose to his friends. \u201cI might have my days when I\u2019m slacking, but I will never quit again,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. A few weeks before that, he announced: \u201cGraduate in three months. Joining The Army & That\u2019s My Way Out.\u201d\u201cHis whole goal was, \u2018I am going to graduate,\u2019\u201d Ms. Woodhouse recalled. \u201cI remember him saying he didn\u2019t want to be a statistic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "History Is About to Change at New York City Ballet. How?", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSo Peter Martins, after accusations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse of dancers over decades, has retired from New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet. An independent investigation of those allegations continues. But this may be the moment to reform the entire job description, and thus to reform ballet.Mr. Martins inherited a remarkable and wide-ranging job model from George Balanchine, who, with Lincoln Kirstein, founded the school in 1934 and City Ballet in 1948. Balanchine began as the company\u2019s artistic director but changed his title in the 1950s to \u201cballet master\u201d: Ostensibly he was one of several, but ruled with a generally accepted authority that rendered his word as law.Today there are no Balanchines. Is it time to revise the posts that Balanchine filled? Or might this diminish the art form by reducing the scope for creative vision?It is now almost 35 years since Balanchine died. Nevertheless, City Ballet has remained of singular importance to ballet worldwide. Balanchine has become increasingly recognized as the foremost (and the most influential) choreographer of 20th-century ballet. And while the Balanchine enterprise has spawned companies across America and influenced others around the world, City Ballet and the School of American Ballet have remained central to the Balanchine practice.It\u2019s not for me to advocate any heir to Balanchine or Mr. Martins; I strongly dislike the notion of critic as kingmaker or power broker. But when change comes, I must ask: How will the company \u2014 and the art form itself \u2014 be changed, too?If the company is to move forward, several important issues must be considered. Most obviously, a system of checks and balances should be introduced to prevent the abuse of dancers. Harassment within ballet has been reported elsewhere. Let City Ballet now set a global example.Crucially, should the job at City Ballet now be divided into two or more parts? If so, how?Mr. Martins didn\u2019t stop teaching, but his choreography \u2014 never much admired by critics \u2014 ceased to be the prime source of new stage energy for the company once he appointed a resident choreographer (Mr. Wheeldon from 2001 to 2008, Mr. Peck since 2014).Elsewhere there have been artistic directors of note who neither teach nor choreograph. City Ballet, however, has been a different organism. Would it be changed beyond recognition by such a director? And, of prime concern to dance-goers and dancers alike: Can the company continue in its dual capacity as the world leader in new choreography and the foremost exponent of the Balanchine-Robbins repertory?Balanchine didn\u2019t invent the notion of a directing ballet master \u2014 the teacher who made ballets and controlled policy. It went back to at least the 18th century. (Its 19th-century exemplars included August Bournonville and Marius Petipa.) For Balanchine, like masters before him, a company\u2019s dancers had to be custom-trained by its school. And the choreographer who made the ballets had to keep developing his style by teaching, often daily, in the classroom, which became a kind of laboratory.If City Ballet is run by a person who neither teaches nor choreographs, it will move far in spirit from the Balanchine-Kirstein principle. Certainly this may well be the moment for greater artistic separation between the company and the school \u2014 and yet that\u2019s easier said than done, since no company depends more on works, by Balanchine and others, in which students of several ages dance.When alive, Balanchine was controversial, not least in the demands he placed on his female dancers. Seemingly unstoppable, he transformed his art. And today, many of the teachers and choreographers influenced by him \u2014 including the team now at City Ballet\u2019s helm \u2014 either never met him or were born after his time.It was Kirstein who labored to ensure the school and the company would outlive Balanchine. Conversely, Balanchine expressed no confidence that they would, at least on any scale of consequence. Some of his devotees, lastingly despondent about his legacy, still insist either that the flame died with him or that it passed elsewhere. Of the company after his death, Balanchine remarked, \u201cApr\u00e8s moi, le board.\u201dLet nobody \u2014 the boards, critics, other interested parties \u2014 rush into promoting their special favorites or pursuing their own agendas. The responsibility of redirecting City Ballet is both considerable and complex. Let the thoughts percolate. History is about to change \u2014 but how?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baby Hope\u2019s Birth Mom Has a Name", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen someone tells you who they are, believe them.In his State of the Union address, Donald Trump told us exactly who the modern-day abortion opponents are \u2014 and exactly what they think of women.This revelation came more than halfway through the speech Tuesday, and probably by accident, when President Trump told a story that was, at least nominally, about human kindness as a cure for the opioid epidemic. As Mr. Trump described it, a 27-year-old Albuquerque police officer, Ryan Holets, happened upon a pregnant woman who was homeless and was \u201cpreparing to inject heroin.\u201d The president continued: \u201cWhen Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\u201dThe president said that Officer Holets \u201cfelt God speak to him,\u201d that he took out a picture of his wife and their four children, and \u201cwent home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\u201dYou might have been wondering \u2014 I know I was \u2014 what happened to that homeless woman? Was she offered treatment? Was she given a chance to reunite with her newborn baby, which could have been a powerful incentive to get clean? Can she be part of the baby\u2019s life? Where is she now? Is she O.K.?\u201cI did give up. I just decided this was going to be my life,\u201d Ms. Champ told CNN. Her previous attempts to get clean all ended in failure. \u201cIt just keeps coming back and ruining my life.\u201dHappy endings all around. Still, it\u2019s revealing that, in President Trump\u2019s telling, we never learned Ms. Champ\u2019s name, and that, once the Holets family made their offer, she simply vanishes from Trump\u2019s story.This wasn\u2019t accidental.In order to make abortion illegal, abortion opponents have to change our minds. They have to get Americans to believe that a fetus or an embryo is the same as a baby, only smaller, and that a mother doesn\u2019t matter as much as that \u201cpre-born\u201d baby does. If, in fact, she emerges from their rhetorical sausage grinder as barely a person at all, that\u2019s all to the good.Think of the posters often brandished at anti-abortion marches and rallies, with the image of a fetus in utero, floating free, like an astronaut, with the umbilical cord, untethered, trailing off into the darkness. The spaceship \u2014 a woman \u2014 was, of course, nowhere to be seen, an important framing. With the woman literally out of the picture, abortion foes can advance the claim that a fertilized egg is just as much a unique human life, deserving of protection as a living, breathing, toddler.They can argue that the only difference between an embryo, a newborn baby, and a kidney patient on dialysis is age, size, location and circumstance.In this formulation, a pregnant woman, a living, breathing, thinking person, becomes no more than an environment, or a tool, whose story ends once she\u2019s given birth.Once we put the woman back in the picture, once we insist on seeing her as a person, not a place or a thing, we\u2019ve got to acknowledge what is, for abortion opponents, an inconvenient truth. A tiny baby can survive and thrive under the care of a biological parent, or an adoptive one, or even in a neonatal intensive care units, with no parents around. Her survival is not tied to a specific person any more than a patient in kidney failure depends upon a specific machine, or a diabetic\u2019s life is tied to a specific batch of insulin.It\u2019s different for a \u201cpre-born\u201d baby, which does not just need care, or medicine, or machinery. That embryo requires the support, the partnership and the body, of one specific individual: the woman carrying it.The way around that is for abortion opponents to simply take the woman out of the story, to erase her from the picture, or to characterize her as nothing more than the place that \u201cpre-born baby\u201d happens to reside.President Trump\u2019s decision to refer to Crystal Champ only as \u201ca homeless, addicted pregnant woman,\u201d to identify her with a series of unpleasant descriptors, to not include her as a main character in Baby Hope\u2019s story, is the extension of that language.If she\u2019s an invisible, nameless nonperson, she\u2019s nothing more than Tupperware for the next generation, a thing that exists and matters only in service to her baby, a woman undeserving of sympathy or rescue or even a name.Those of us who support the right to abortion cannot let women be pushed to the margins, erased and unnamed. We must insist, in the face of an administration that sees us as less-than and not-there, as empty vessels or wily seductresses that we are fully present, entirely human, that we, too, have lives, and that we, too, have rights.Baby Hope\u2019s biological mother is named Crystal Champ. Insist that she, and all pregnant woman, stay in the picture.Jennifer Weiner is the author, most recently, of the memoir \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baltimore City Schools Are Without Heat, Prompting Protests From Teachers and Parents", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTeachers in Baltimore are calling for city schools to be closed until heating problems are resolved, saying many students have been forced to attend classes bundled up in coats, hats and gloves during the recent frigid weather.The Baltimore Teachers Union sent a letter on Wednesday to Sonja Brookins Santelises, the chief executive officer of Baltimore City Public Schools, saying that this week students and teachers have endured dangerously low temperatures in buildings that are struggling to operate with bursting boilers and drafty windows.\u201cI implore that you close schools in the District until your facilities crew has had time to properly assess and fix the heating issues within the affected schools in Baltimore City,\u201d Ms. English wrote.\u201cI don\u2019t knee-jerk close anything down just because I have one perspective,\u201d she said.She said that other factors went into the decision, such as considering the impact on students\u2019 access to hot school meals and adult supervision while parents work, she added.She said the authorities \u201cdon\u2019t take the closing of schools lightly.\u201dBut, she added: \u201cNobody in this city, including me, wants folks sitting around in coats and mittens all day for the entire week.\u201dAbout 60 schools have been affected over the winter break and this week by heating problems, representing about one-third of the schools in the system, Dr. Santelises said.Alison Perkins-Cohen, the chief of staff of Baltimore City Public Schools, said in a letter to families, students and staff members on Tuesday that workers had visited the buildings over the winter break to try to ensure they were ready.Principals are combining classes if one room is colder than another, and Ms. Perkins-Cohen said school uniform rules had been lifted so students can choose warm outfits.Maintenance workers have been sent to schools as the district gets complaints about them. Dr. Santelises said as some fixes are made at some schools, problems arise at others as workers try to keep ahead of the problems.\u201cIt is a juggle, and I don\u2019t think we get it perfect every time,\u201d she added.Describing herself as \u201cdeeply distressed by the substandard conditions,\u201d she said the city has allocated $17 million for maintenance in the current school year and that amount will increase to $19 million next year.On Twitter, parents shared stories of their children\u2019s struggles and others started fund-raisers for heaters and coats.As Dr. Santelises spoke on Facebook Live, parents and educators weighed in through the comments section, asking where the funding has gone for facilities that primarily affect children of color, and why their children should shiver in cold classrooms while adults figure it all out.Ayanna Barmore, 31, one of the parents, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that her sons, who are in fourth grade and kindergarten, have been wearing full winter gear indoors and were marched back and forth between cold classrooms and a common area that had heat to warm up periodically.\u201cThey said half of the school was without heat,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they do not have a plan to fix it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Submarine Builder Charged With Murder in Death of Kim Wall", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 The Danish inventor Peter Madsen was formally indicted on Tuesday on charges of homicide in connection with the death in August of Kim Wall, a Swedish journalist who had boarded his submarine to interview him.Danish prosecutors and the Copenhagen police indicted Mr. Madsen on charges of killing Ms. Wall \u201cwith prior planning and preparation\u201d \u2014 the equivalent of murder \u2014 according to a statement released by the police, as well as with dismemberment, indecent handling of a corpse and improper sexual relations. While a news release was posted online on Tuesday, the actual wording of the charges is expected to be made public only next week.Mr. Madsen, 47, has given various explanations for the disappearance of Ms. Wall, 30. But he eventually said that she had died onboard his vessel after a hatch unexpectedly collapsed, and that she had hit her head while she was climbing stairs in the submarine\u2019s tower. An autopsy revealed that she had no head injuries to support that claim, however.The prosecution said on Tuesday that it would not reveal details on the evidence supporting the charges.The exact circumstances of Ms. Wall\u2019s introduction to Mr. Madsen remain unclear. In a pretrial hearing in September, he said that she had first contacted him to talk about rockets, but that she had then become intrigued by his submarines and wanted to go on one for a ride. It was not clear when the two first communicated, but they met for the first time on Aug. 10.Witnesses have described seeing Ms. Wall and Mr. Madsen onboard the submarine in Copenhagen port on Aug. 10. When she failed to return home that evening, her boyfriend contacted the authorities and the submarine was reported missing.It was found the next morning floating in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, but began sinking when a private rescue party approached. Mr. Madsen was pulled from the waters.At first, he told the police that he had dropped off Ms. Wall on shore, and denied any wrongdoing. He later said that he had buried her intact body at sea after an accident. When police investigators presented evidence tying him to metal pieces and straps used to weight her body down, he changed his explanation again and admitted to dismembering her.Betina Hald Engmark, a lawyer for Mr. Madsen, said in a text message Tuesday afternoon that she would review the indictment with her client later on Tuesday, adding that she had no further comment about the charges.A trial by jury is expected to begin on March 8 and to last eight days. Jakob Buch-Jepsen, a prosecutor, said in a short news briefing on Tuesday that he would seek a life sentence, which he added translates in Denmark to an average of 14 years in prison.As a routine measure, the Danish Medico-Legal Council performed a psychiatric evaluation of Mr. Madsen, concluding \u201cthat safe custody may be required\u201d if he is sentenced.\u201cIn spite of everything, Kim lives on and continues to make a difference,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}

The wearable-camera maker styled itself a media company when it went public in 2014, but even its hardware business is suffering job cuts as sales fall short. Success is even harder than usual when \u2014 as at Snap, which fancied itself a camera company \u2014 the boss wastes time and resources chasing whims.The company\u2019s portable cameras are popular among snowboarders, sky divers and mountain bikers, but its media partnerships and attempts to launch action shows never amounted to much. GoPro shut down those efforts in 2016. A bid to crack the drone market hasn\u2019t fared any better. The firm now says it will exit that business, blaming competition and a hostile regulatory environment.While GoPro chased those dreams, competition in its core business of making portable cameras grew ever tougher. Asian rivals caught up on quality while cutting prices. And the emergence of waterproof smartphones with quality lenses and better editing software has caused some customers to wonder why they need a separate camera at all.It\u2019s one thing to turn a good idea into a thriving business, as GoPro\u2019s founder, Nick Woodman, did with small, rugged cameras for action sports. But one success hardly guarantees another, no matter how clever the vision. Snap, for example, has seen features like its disappearing messages, face filters and story format copied by Facebook. And the company\u2019s camera glasses have proved to be a dud, prompting it to take a $40 million charge against inventory last quarter.Investors now attach a hefty discount to the idea that Mr. Woodman can produce a string of hit products. GoPro stock is down more than 90 percent from its peak. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that knowing your limits can be more valuable than trying to defy them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Monument the Old South Would Like to Ignore", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFort Negley Park is not a Civil War monument in the South that celebrates the heroism of the Confederacy, in other words. Fort Negley Park is a Civil War monument in the South that celebrates the preservation of the United States of America. The question of what will happen to it has roiled Nashville for more than a year.In part, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a crucial site for African-American history as well. During the war, the grounds surrounding Fort Negley served as a de facto refugee camp for escaped slaves. In an irony lost on no one today, the Union Army immediately forced those refugees into service; under brutal conditions, some 2,700 of them built Fort Negley itself. Many lost their lives and are believed to be buried at Fort Negley Park. When the South surrendered, the survivors \u2014 joined by other freed slaves \u2014 settled there. Today the area is gentrifying, home to new art galleries and coffee shops, but it is still populated largely by low-income African-Americans.In their midst now lies one badly overgrown and dilapidated minor-league ball field. Greer Stadium has sat empty since the Nashville Sounds departed at the end of the 2014 season. As part of a preserved Civil War site, the stadium\u2019s location has long been designated as public parkland, going back to 1928, when the city bought it from the descendants of John Overton, a longtime crony of President Andrew Jackson. That parcel was always meant to revert to parkland once the Sounds decamped.Three years after the Sounds left, Mayor Megan Barry released a request for proposals related to the site of the old stadium. The request was not for Metro Parks to create a plan for desperately needed green space in an already overpaved urban core. The request was not for the Metro Historical Commission to create a plan to preserve the legacy of African-Americans who gave their lives to preserve the Union. It was not a request for the Friends of Fort Negley, an advocacy group, to create a plan to expand the educational reach of the site.The plans the mayor requested were for private development under a land-lease arrangement much like the one that allowed Greer Stadium to be built there in the first place.Let\u2019s call what happened next the second Battle of Nashville.But an army of green-space advocates and historic preservationists quickly mobilized to point out what would seem to be obvious: Nashville owns a lot of land, and there is no good reason to allow for-profit development in a park with huge historic significance.It\u2019s important to note that Southern attitudes to Civil War monuments are not uniform, though the pro-con divide typically follows the rural-urban divide.It\u2019s fair to assume that the supporters of other Civil War monuments around the state of Tennessee will not be coalescing around this vision to preserve a site that celebrates a different kind of history, but the Friends of Fort Negley is moving ahead with plans of its own. Last Thursday it announced that Kix Brooks will serve on a new committee. Its goal: to unite Nashville around a plan \u2014 and funding \u2014 for a reunified Fort Negley Park.Advertisement"}

Twitter and Facebook users shared video footage of the heroes of winter who dived into icy waters to save men, women and animals.In Spain, snow blanketed half the country this weekend, including in southern cities like Granada, trapping hundreds of drivers overnight Saturday in their cars. The army\u2019s emergency units were called in on Sunday to help clear the snow off a highway near Madrid.The Spanish weather office issued alerts for 37 provinces on Sunday, warning of further snowfall, as well as strong rain and high winds in regions like Catalonia, on one of the busiest travel days of the year in Spain as people returned home after the Epiphany holiday on Saturday.Here are some other notable episodes.In December, Chinese social media users praised a good Samaritan\u2019s efforts to free a woman from a frozen river in Hebei Province.It was not clear how the woman fell in. But the footage showed the man, identified as Shi Lei, 54, trying mightily to pull her to safety \u2014 keeping his glasses on during the entire ordeal.She appears dazed as he tugs on her red top, struggles to pull her out of the freezing water and pounds on the ice to clear a path. Her arms remain limp.Finally, as part of the ice collapses, he plunges in waist-deep and hoists her to safety as another man drags a plank close to help get her onto solid ground.When a dog named Nisel fell through the ice in a pond in New Jersey in December, the animal could not climb out no matter how she tried.Officers Robert Voorhees and George Peterson, along with Hopewell Valley Emergency Services and Pennington Fire Company personnel, headed to the pond to assist the dog\u2019s owner, according to news media reports.Footage shows one officer, a cord tied around his torso, crawling on the ice toward the dog as she splashes fruitlessly on the edge of the pond.A woman, presumed to be the animal\u2019s owner, can be heard calling out encouragement to the dog: \u201cCome on, Nisel!\u201d \u201cGood girl!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s coming!

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Artificial Intelligence:How We Help Machines LearnArtificial Intelligence:How We HelpMachines LearnBy age 1, most babies do something that astonishes their parents: They say their first word. It means the child is developing language based on experience. She\u2019s learning.And while that first word is usually \u201cMama\u201d or \u201cDada,\u201d that\u2019s not because the baby wants to say thanks for changing all those diapers (sorry, Mom and Dad). The most frequent first words, which also include \u201chi,\u201d \u201cbaba\u201d (bottle) and \u201cdog,\u201d are those things babies hear most often in their first months of life. Parents label these items and then repeat those labels over and over until the child develops the muscle strength and knowledge to say the words themselves.In many ways, repetition is how machines learn, too. Engineers train computers to recognize common patterns in mountains of data by exposing them to numerous variations of the same thing. After being \u201cshown\u201d thousands of photos of bank checks, for example, computers learn to recognize both printed and handwritten numbers, which allows us to deposit a check by taking a picture of it using a smartphone. In the same way that babies learn to say \u201cMama\u201d and reach for their mothers when they want to be held, a computer learns to recognize images of printed numbers so it can identify bank accounts and handwritten numbers to determine a check\u2019s amount.This process is called machine learning, and it is fundamental to artificial intelligence, or A.I. While A.I. is often seen as mysterious and complicated, in fact the way we teach computers to learn has a lot in common with the way human beings learn. Many A.I. principles are modeled on science\u2019s understanding of how the human brain processes and categorizes information.Today, A.I. is quietly embedded in our daily lives \u2014 many of us don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. In addition to simplifying banking, A.I. enables our email to detect spam, our cars to brake automatically and our phones to respond to voice commands. When we interact with digital assistants like Alexa, we\u2019re tapping A.I. Skin cancer can even be diagnosed earlier thanks to A.I.\u2019s learned \u201cmemory\u201d of thousands of images of melanoma variations.Still, we\u2019ve only just begun to scratch the surface of A.I.\u2019s potential. Let\u2019s take a look at how A.I. is being used across industries today and where it may take us in the future.Trevor Darrell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, explains that while there are core principles that human and machine learning share, there are also key differences.\u201cThe way biology learns is to have situations where thousands or millions of trials are just there for free in the environment,\u201d he says. If shown only a few examples of, say, scissors, \u201cyou\u2019ll have no problem telling me what other objects in your environment are that thing. Machines need thousands of labeled examples, both positive and negative.\u201dOne well-developed area of A.I. where this principle has been applied is computer vision, where machines recognize images in a photo (such as the aforementioned check) or a video. Image recognition is what enables Facebook to deliver content its users are interested in: If you\u2019ve liked photos of your friend\u2019s new puppy, Facebook will make sure you don\u2019t miss pics of that puppy in the future.For visually impaired people, image recognition \u2014 plus computer-generated speech \u2014 can deliver much more. \u201cWe launched a feature based on a computer vision algorithm that allows people who are visually impaired to go through their news feed and understand what photos consist of,\u201d says Joaquin Qui\u00f1onero Candela, the head of Facebook\u2019s Applied Machine Learning team, noting that the descriptions are read aloud automatically. \u201cThey not only hear that somebody posted a photo, they\u2019re told the photo shows three people in the park riding a bike. That greatly improves the Facebook experience for those users.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to write a program that would interpret if an image had a cat, a dog, an airplane or a sailboat in it,\u201d LeCun says. To understand how to solve the problem, you have to think of an image the way a computer does, with each pixel defined by three numbers that correspond to its color and intensity.\u201cTo a computer, an image is just a table of numbers,\u201d LeCun explains. To teach the machine how to interpret that data, LeCun looked to humans. The brain learns based on how strong the links are between neurons \u2014 clusters of nerve cells that, when connected, become increasingly associated with a specific idea or physical entity. These are called neural networks.LeCun replicated this model by running the data of thousands of images of a given thing \u2014 a dog, for example \u2014 through a series of connected digital layers. Using an algorithm (the computer science term for a set of instructions), each layer looks for patterns in the data that indicate a feature that is inherently dog-like. The next layer will look at another dog-like feature. Each layer is calculated and an average is reached that theoretically determines whether or not this object is, in fact, a dog. But sometimes the algorithm doesn\u2019t get it right. That\u2019s where humans come in.\u201cIf it produces the wrong answer,\u201d LeCun says, \u201cyou tell it the correct answer, and it adjusts the average.\u201d Once the machine is trained, it can begin to use this refined average to recognize what is contained in new images.Another problem is a fundamental difference between humans and machines: Be it our first word, our first step or our first time behind the wheel, human experience is cumulative and contextual, helping us to better understand how the world works. A.I. machines, in contrast, are designed to perform an isolated task: to play chess or recognize faces.Another problem is a fundamental difference between humans and machines: Be it our first word, our first step or our first time behind the wheel, human experience is cumulative and contextual, helping us to better understand how the world works. A.I. machines, in contrast, are designed to perform an isolated task: to play chess or recognize faces.Humans possess a breadth of skills far beyond that of any machine yet invented. We rely, at a minimum, on four interconnected capabilities to successfully navigate the world: (1) to perceive and categorize things around us; (2) to contextualize those things for understanding and learning; (3) to be able to make predictions based on past experience and present circumstances and (4) to make plans based on all of the above.\u201cAdd these together, and you get common sense \u2014 those functions you need to survive and thrive,\u201d LeCun says. At this point, most A.I. has developed only the most basic abilities, namely perception and categorization. Or, as LeCun puts it: \u201cA dog has more common sense than the smartest computer.\u201d Take the example of a dog that\u2019s shaped like a bagel. Presented with such an image, a computer might assert that it\u2019s 60 percent sure the dog is a baked good, while humans would know from experience, without being explicitly taught, that it is, in fact, a dog.Joelle Pineau, Ph.D., who leads Facebook A.I. Research in Montreal, cites another language-based example: \u201cIf I say to you, \u2018The trophy will not fit in the suitcase \u2014 it\u2019s too small,\u2019 what does the \u2018it\u2019 refer to?\u201d Humans know that while a trophy can be larger than a suitcase, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where you\u2019d try to fit your luggage inside one. \u201cA computer has no way of knowing that,\u201d Pineau notes. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of contextual knowledge that computers lack.\u201dFacebook is using the same model of neural networks used in computer vision to offer better translations. Indeed, an advancement in Facebook\u2019s A.I. technology has allowed the company to power 4.5 billion translations a day. \u201cFifty percent of people on Facebook don\u2019t speak English, and most don\u2019t have a language in common,\u201d says engineering manager Necip Fazil Ayan, who worked on Facebook\u2019s new translation system. \u201cOur goal is to be able to give Facebook to everyone in their preferred language.\u201dFacebook is using the same model of neural networks used in computer vision to offer better translations.

Similar to the way humans learn to read, by going from our ABCs to sounding out words to understanding complete sentences, Facebook and other tech companies have applied a form of neural networks to translations that takes into account the context of an entire sentence or paragraph, increasing accuracy and fluency. It\u2019s the same kind of exposure to repetition and labeling that makes computer vision possible.\u201cThe translations are becoming more idiomatic now,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Candela says. \u201cI can understand the subtleties between languages. This already removes barriers and in the future will help cultures understand each other. I think that\u2019s incredible.\u201dAs we continue to leverage A.I. to help humans perform daily tasks and make decisions, it\u2019s essential that we prevent bias and discrimination from becoming embedded, too.LeCun was instrumental in forming a coalition of leading tech companies to ensure that A.I. continues to evolve ethically. The Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People & Society has separate working groups focused on safety, accountability, transparency and collaboration. For example, biases can be hidden in data, and if systems are built on that data, that can lead to actions and recommendations that replicate those biases.\u201cHow do we design robots so their values are aligned with human values?\u201d LeCun asks. \u201cThis goes beyond each of our companies \u2014 we need to discuss this in the open. As A.I. tools become more common, we need to work together to be aware of and protect against their limitations, especially in areas like bias and abuse.\u201dAmong these issues is ensuring that, rather than alienating man from machine, we work to achieve a higher quality of life for the people who operate them. \u201cA lot of people take the concept of A.I. for granted without truly understanding how vital it is in our daily lives and all the impactful ways we can use it in the future,\u201d Candela says.Humans working closely with A.I. can lead to advancements never before imagined. When Candela recently sat in on focus groups to test Facebook\u2019s new technology for visually impaired people, he gained a glimpse into the future of what\u2019s possible.\u201cHow the world suddenly opened up for them is truly remarkable,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is groundbreaking technology.

{"Headline": "Facebook to Let Users Rank Credibility of News", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it planned to prioritize high-quality news on the social network by allowing its users to rank news sources that they see as the most credible and trustworthy.For publishers, Facebook\u2019s new ranking system raised immediate concerns, including whether crowdsourcing users\u2019 opinions on trustworthiness might be open to manipulation.\u201cIt is absolutely a positive move to start to try to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of reputation and use brands as proxies for trust,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cBut the devil\u2019s in the details on how they\u2019re going to actually execute on that.\u201dHe continued, \u201cHow does that get hacked or gamed? How do we trust the ranking system? There\u2019s a slew of questions at this point.\u201dThe new system could also potentially favor publishers who are partisan. Facebook users, asked to rank which news they most trust, could choose sites that speak most clearly to their personal beliefs, in effect reducing the prominence of publishers who try to maintain an objective tone.David Kaye, the United Nations\u2019 Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, said that Facebook would probably face more difficult questions as it rolled out the new ranking program globally.\u201cWhat will happen in situations where a community determines that a news source is trustworthy, but that news source is censored, or illegal, in that country?\u201d asked Mr. Kaye, noting that in many parts of the world, governments controlled all official news channels while independent news sources were outlawed or forced to publish pseudo-anonymously.In the past, he added, Facebook has abided by local rules where it operates abroad.\u201cWhat will Mark Zuckerberg do when the needs of the community, in what it determines is trusted news, are different from what the government determines. Who will Facebook side with?\u201d said Mr. Kaye.Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said there was a \u201cgreat irony\u201d that Facebook, which has traditionally left decision up to an algorithm that incorporates the behaviors of its members, would open the decision-making to its users on such a matter. He added that the user-generated ranking system \u201cis a massive abdication of its social responsibility, as a vital platform, to be a good custodian of the Fourth Estate globally.\u201dIn his post on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said the newest change \u201cwill only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community.\u201dFacebook said news would be prioritized according to the new ranking system starting Monday, before expanding globally. Some Facebook users have already been asked to rank the trustworthiness of news sites which appear on the social network. In one survey, people were asked if they recognized a number of websites and then asked, \u201c\u201cHow much do you trust each of these domains?\u201d They were able to choose from a range of answers, including entirely, a lot, somewhat, barely and not at all.The Silicon Valley company said it would continue polling users to refine and select which news outlets garnered the most trust. It declined to say how many people were polled or which news outlets they were asked about.\u201cAs part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of Facebook users across the U.S. to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg has been moving Facebook toward taking more responsibility for what shows up on the social network, especially after the criticism over the 2016 election and the interference by Russian agents. Earlier this month, he described his 2018 goals as including \u201cmaking sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201dIn Friday\u2019s post, he hinted that ranking the credibility of news sources was just one step, with more potential changes to come.\u201dI\u2019ve asked our product teams to make sure we prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd we\u2019re starting next week with trusted sources.\u201dSheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco and Sapna Maheshwari from New York.Advertisement"}

So load up on cash when you can \u2014 fortunately, I\u2019ve never had trouble finding A.T.M.s in Chinese cities, and withdrawing from Chinese currency with my American debit card has been trouble-free. If you want to play it safe, you can exchange for some at your local bank before you go.While you should always remain alert, China is remarkably safe for foreigners. In total, I\u2019ve spent over a year in China, and have never felt in danger or threatened while walking around, no matter the hour. Chinese traffic, however, can be horrendous, and navigating streets as a pedestrian is always an adventure. Buckle up when in a vehicle, and be extremely careful when crossing the street: Cars do not necessarily yield to pedestrians, and motorcycles and scooters do not seem to yield to anything \u2014 not even red lights.While you won\u2019t be able to buy a SIM card for your phone that includes a Chinese phone number, data plans with 4G speed are available for foreigners. Check at the airport (I bought one in a convenience store), or at the hostel or hotel where you\u2019re staying, and be ready to show your passport.Wi-Fi is everywhere in China, from the pricey malls of Shanghai to modest mom-and-pop restaurants in the smaller cities. The bad news is that you won\u2019t be able to access it some of the time, as it frequently requires you to enter a local phone number to receive a Wi-Fi access code. There are ways to circumvent this. Having a WeChat account will grant access to certain Wi-Fi networks. I also use a Google Voice number to receive internet access codes, which works part of the time. But wait \u2014 isn\u2019t Google blocked in China? That brings us to \u2026The Chinese government does a fairly thorough job censoring websites and traffic from sources it deems potentially unsavory or damaging to the ruling Communist Party. Say goodbye to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, any Google-related services (including Gmail), and even (gasp!) The New York Times.One obvious, but essential, tip: Download and set up your VPN before you leave for China. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll be blocked from downloading any VPNs. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve come to depend on Google Maps considerably during your travels. In China, you would be wise to rid yourself of that notion. Even with a VPN, Google Maps in China is filled with incomplete or sometimes just flat-out incorrect information. For example: There are no fewer than six subway lines currently operating in Chengdu. According to Google Maps, there are just two.You\u2019ll notice plenty of well-maintained public restrooms in China, but they\u2019re not always stocked with toilet paper. You would be wise to carry a small stash with you. This applies to napkins in restaurants as well \u2014 at smaller, more casual places, diners are expected to have their own supply on hand.

{"Headline": "At Happy Stony Noodle, a Childhood Favorite Anchors the Menu", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosMr. Hsu, 65, was born in Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan under martial law. As a child, he often lingered over soup at Happy Beef Noodle, a no-frills storefront opened by veterans of the Kuomintang\u2019s Nationalist Army who had fled to Taiwan after the Communists\u2019 victory in mainland China. When he grew up, he took over the noodle shop and ran it for two decades with his wife, Yu Lan Hsu, while they watched the transformation of their country from rural society to megalopolis.They moved to the U.S. in 1997 and brought Happy Beef Noodle with them, trying out iterations of the restaurant in Flushing, Queens, then Edison, N.J. (Both have shuttered.) Two and a half years ago, they settled on this quiet side street off Broadway in Elmhurst, Queens. The \u201cStony\u201d now on the awning is Mr. Hsu\u2019s English nickname, bestowed on him by a professor in his college days.The heart of the restaurant is the same as it was in Hsinchu City: beef noodle soup, which Mr. Hsu starts making every morning at 5 a.m. He sets beef neck bones to boil with star anise, goji berries, doubanjiang (fermented bean paste) and prickly ash, along with a half-dozen herbs that double as Chinese medicine, and keeps stirring the broth over a low flame until nightfall.The soup is deceptively mild at first, gaining carnality with each spoonful but never growing too forceful, held in check by a faint, ameliorating sweetness. It comes with rough cuts of beef, only half-pliant, putting up gentle but firm resistance, and whole spinach leaves added at the end so they\u2019re still vivid. Pickled mustard greens are essential, the tang offsetting the velvet cling of liquid fat.Four types of noodles are on offer, all delivered daily from the same factory in Chinatown that has been making them to Mr. Hsu\u2019s specifications for 20 years. For the beef noodle soup, I liked the flat white bands made of rice flour, slippery with a bit of stretch.The menu is best when it focuses on forthright comfort food, like lu rou fan, pork leg broken down into caramelly hunks, long simmered with rock sugar and Shaoxing wine, and heaped over rice so the flavors trickle down. For texture, there\u2019s a spongy rectangle of fried tofu on the side, along with a hard-boiled egg, shucked of its shell and stained with soy sauce, and more of those beautifully bracing pickled mustard greens.Hunks of salt-and-pepper chicken are colloquially known as popcorn chicken in Taiwan, the name justified by airy, bubbled coats of fried potato starch. Here, the meat inside is juicy from a wallow in sa-cha sauce, with its briny payload of dried shrimp and ground brill. Another snack, chicken roll, is identified on the menu in English as pork roll, which is technically more accurate \u2014 the filling is ground pork and fish paste, wrapped tight in tofu skin and crisped until the outside evokes the rugged golden armor of fried chicken.Elsewhere, little notes were off: too many chives in a dish called flies\u2019 heads (for its scattered dots of fermented black beans, which I wanted more of); in three-cup chicken, overly fatty meat with jellyish corners, and not quite enough of the dark, creased leaves of Thai basil that traditionally give it fragrance.For a recent arrival from Taiwan at my table, missing home, there was only one dish that mattered: four spirits soup, a cloudy broth steeped with four curative herbs, with the supposed power to bolster immunity, ease digestion, bring a glow to the skin and defy time. It\u2019s finished with pale curves of pig intestine and a splash of wine. After all the lush fat and crackle, it tastes like hardly anything at all, and exactly what you need.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maine Town Fires Manager Over White Identity Comments", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA small Maine town fired its manager Tuesday, days after his views promoting white identity and criticizing Islam attracted unwanted national attention.The four selectmen of Jackman, Me., near the Canadian border, met on Tuesday morning and unanimously voted to end their relationship with the official, Thomas Kawczynski. He had been in the position since June.\u201cHe pulled the wool right over our eyes and we had no clue what he was about,\u201d said Raymond Levesque, who attended the meeting and owns a laundromat, ice cream parlor and general store in town.Under the agreement, Mr. Kawczynski, whose contract promised a payout if he was terminated without cause, received a $30,000 settlement on the condition that he not take legal action against the town, said Warren Shay, a lawyer for Jackman.Archived versions of the website show that Mr. Kawczynski had argued that voluntary segregation would improve happiness for all; in one now-removed post, he wrote of what he perceived as \u201cresentment against whites\u201d and the need for a movement around white identity.\u201cYou\u2019re the ambassador for the race,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery person you meet can walk away from seeing you thinking white nationalism is a good thing or a bad thing.\u201dIn an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Kawczynski pushed back against the news reports, arguing that he had been taken out of context and is not a supremacist, a separatist or a nationalist.\u201cThis is not a movement based on racism,\u201d he said.Instead, he said he was simply trying to bring a conversation into the open.\u201cThere are a great many people who have thoughts that are not considered permissible,\u201d he said, \u201cand if the media and the lynch mob determine to force them into darkness, then don\u2019t be surprised when the darkness comes back in the form in which it was required to develop.\u201dThe reports about Mr. Kawczynski\u2019s beliefs drew swift condemnation.In a since-removed Facebook post, the Jackman-Moose River Region Chamber of Commerce noted that interviewees are not asked their views on politics, race or nationality and described his beliefs as \u201cshocking and offensive.\u201dIn Maine, a town manager has several responsibilities, from handling budgets to promoting local tourism. Jackman, often described as a gateway to Canada, relies heavily on visitors for revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s a major route from Quebec down to and through Maine, and they pride themselves on being a welcoming community to everybody who wants to come,\u201d Mr. Shay said.Mr. Kawczynski\u2019s termination was effective immediately, Mr. Shay said. \u201cWhen we left, he turned in his keys and card and was on his way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Best Hookup Results, Use Your Words, O.K.?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveI had invited him over only for sex, so when I woke the next morning to the sight of him putting on his pants, I said, \u201cDo you need me to walk you out?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to use the bathroom,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay, if that\u2019s O.K.\u201dAnd it was. So he stayed for the rest of the day, never more than a few inches from me. We left the room only to use the bathroom or to shuffle to the kitchen for snacks. Meanwhile, my roommates laughed, gossiping about my \u201csexcapade with the cute guy from Tinder.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re the girl of my dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we met on Tinder.\u201dI had never been the girl of anyone\u2019s dreams \u2014 not even my own. I always imagined the quintessential girl of men\u2019s dreams to be taller than me, thinner, more poised and blond. But my lover insisted, and we lounged on top of each other until late in the afternoon.Later, I said, \u201cDo you usually have sex with girls the night you meet them?\u201dHe cocked an eyebrow. \u201cWhy, do I come off as a slut?\u201dI laughed nervously. \u201cOf course not.\u201dFinally, he answered: \u201cNot really, no. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t turn sex down, but I wouldn\u2019t go looking for it, either.\u201dAfter a minute, I asked, \u201cDo I come off as a slut?\u201dHis voice softened. He wrapped his arms tighter around me. \u201cNo, not at all. You actually come off as a lady.\u201dMaybe he wanted it to sound like a compliment, but my doubts about his sincerity made it feel more like a blow. I wondered if he was lying to make me feel better or to ensure more sex later.As a child, I was always told, \u201cUse your words\u201d \u2014 shorthand for saying precisely what I mean and what I expect from people. As an adult, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people aren\u2019t very good at using their words, especially before and after hookups. Few ever seem to say precisely what they mean or what they expect.Regardless, I smiled and said, \u201cReally? Thank you.\u201d I kissed him on the cheek, the temple, the forehead. \u201cAnd you come off as a gentleman.\u201dAnd he did. But I secretly hoped that he was the same as me, that his chest also simmered with hidden indiscretions, and that the speed with which we slept together was as typical for him as it was for me. Because if it wasn\u2019t, I would have to wonder if, upon discovering the truth, he would recoil. I would have to wonder if he would think of me as dirty or morally deficient, even though he already said he found me gentle.\u201cWow, you\u2019ve got a beautiful smile,\u201d he said, idly stroking my waist, my stomach, my hips, my thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re really the full package.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d\u201cI know I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I mean it.\u201dHe told me I was smart, funny, creative. \u201cYou\u2019ve got good karma, Gab,\u201d he said.I said, \u201cYou see things in me I didn\u2019t know were visible.\u201dI don\u2019t know why I fell for it, especially when I hadn\u2019t even gone looking for it. For some reason I\u2019ve always been susceptible to thinking my life would be vastly improved by the solution to a single problem. In high school, I thought, \u201cIt will all get better when the braces come off,\u201d or \u201cwhen my skin clears up\u201d or \u201cwhen I go to college.\u201dAnd now, older and supposedly wiser, I find myself thinking it will all get better when I find romance. When I have a man who wants me despite how fallible, loud or political I can be. Someone who, with a kiss, can snap me out of my self-pitying reverie. I think about how long I\u2019ve been ready to find the beauty in another human being, to caress the scars of someone as flawed as me and to feel that person reciprocate.That night I hadn\u2019t been looking for romance, but my two-time lover embedded himself in my consciousness when he told me I was the girl of his dreams, and I can\u2019t help but think how cruel that was, considering how it all turned out. Our goodbye was a kiss on the mouth and a wink as he stepped off the subway.He had grinned and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d but he never saw me again. I have since learned that \u201clater\u201d means the same thing it did when I was a child and wanted to do something extravagant: It means \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d or \u201cIf I feel like it.\u201dNow I\u2019m told, \u201cYou only like him because he flattered you,\u201d and \u201cGood sex can trick you into thinking you like anyone.\u201d\u201cWhat did you expect, Gab?\u201d my friend said. \u201cYou can\u2019t form a connection with somebody that fast.\u201dI shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. This felt different.\u201dShe sighed. \u201cYour problem is that you jump into things too quickly.\u201d\u201cO.K. \u2026\u201dI thought there must be something terribly, medically wrong with me if I could so badly misinterpret a situation. I wanted to see a doctor. I wanted a diagnosis. I wanted to ask my lover if he had found himself disappointed, if I wasn\u2019t who he wanted me to be.My friends tell me I need to love myself. I\u2019m told this will make my life better, much in the way braces and clear skin were supposed to make me beautiful. When I ask how to do this, my friends become philosophers and say, \u201cYou need to find it within yourself.\u201d Their advice is so abstract that I wonder if they, too, have searched and cannot find it.How do I search within myself? I imagine reaching down my throat and rummaging until I find some bright little mass labeled \u201cself-love.\u201d It has been hiding, perhaps behind some bothersome organ or within the folds of a stubborn muscle. And when I find this magical panacea, I will say, \u201cOh, there you are. Where have you been all this time?\u201d And I will set it back inside of me, this time in the correct place.My question is: How will I know when I have found this thing that I never realized I lost, and what will happen when I do?But I don\u2019t really think my problem is a lack of self-love. I enjoy sex for its own sake every bit as much as a man does, and I\u2019m honest about that. What confuses matters is all this sweet talk, followed by the vanishing act.\u201cGhosting is the most cowardly way to end a relationship,\u201d I once said to a male friend in a room with a guy who had ghosted me years before.\u201cWould you really rather someone tell you to your face that they don\u2019t have feelings for you?\u201d my friend said.\u201cI\u2019d rather have that than be made to feel like an idiot,\u201d I said.Not too long after, a man I slept with told me I was beautiful while we were walking to my apartment in the middle of the night. He caressed the back of my hand with his thumb and smiled, but it meant nothing \u2014 under the orange glow of streetlights, I knew, even broken glass looks stunning.\u201cI feel so lucky right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe a girl like you would give me the time of day.\u201dI texted him the next week, but he never responded. Annoyed, I noted that I wouldn\u2019t even have thought to text him if he hadn\u2019t blanketed me with such gratuitous flattery.And then my two-time lover called me a lady. He added me on Facebook and told me to keep in touch. He said my skin was soft and my smile was beautiful and he couldn\u2019t believe he had found someone like me.He said, \u201cI\u2019m never mean to girls.\u201dI smiled. \u201cSo you\u2019re a self-proclaimed nice guy?\u201d\u201cYes. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, draping my leg over both of his. He slid his arm beneath my head like a pillow. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want a guy to be nice to me just because he feels obligated to, you know? I want him to be nice because he means it.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d he said, tangling a hand in my hair and kissing me on the forehead.I don\u2019t wander into casual sex expecting it to yield a relationship. I have never understood why some guys seem to think flattery is the key to a bedroom they\u2019ve already been welcomed into. They say they would love to date me and then wonder why, the next day, I think they want to date me.I neither require the flattery nor deserve the ghosting. With hookups there\u2019s no need to be mean \u2014 just say what you mean. Use your words.Gabrielle Ulubay recently graduated from Northeastern University in Boston.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Hogs get slaughtered,\u201d said Jay Levy, the Trophy Club\u2019s owner, explaining the relative bargain for guests. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take care of my people. I\u2019ll take advantage of the situation, but not my people.\u201dHis people, on this evening, were a peculiar lot: regulars, newcomers and, at present, the world\u2019s most important porn star \u2014 with her presidential ties and a reported six-figure reason not to confirm them \u2014 traveling for now without a proper assistant.\u201cNobody wants to be seen with me right now,\u201d the performer, known as Stormy Daniels, said in a brief interview, laughing softly behind an assemblage of nude pictures of herself. The line at her table belied the point.And so it was \u2014 on the anniversary of the inauguration; with a government shutdown consuming the capital; with cities across the country, including this one, hosting women\u2019s rallies condemning President Trump as an emblem of misogyny \u2014 that this national moment delivered a glut of customers, journalists and a notable adult film actress to a perhaps inevitable fate.The music came on. The clothes came off. And an airport strip club claimed its piece of the American presidency.\u201cWaaa-ooooooh!\u201d came the cry from a crowd of a couple hundred or so as the show began.Waaa-ooooooh.Every White House leads a trail to venues strange and varied: global summits, hardscrabble swing-state spots, a golf course in South Florida.On Saturday, the Trophy Club was almost certainly making its executive debut. One night only.Better known as Stephanie Clifford to some offstage, the 38-year-old headliner was setting off on what is being called the \u201cMaking America Horny Again Tour,\u201d capitalizing on her spin through a Trump news cycle.Pressed on Saturday, Ms. Clifford responded to any question about Mr. Trump with a wordless grin and a shaking head.Most attendees did not much care, subsisting in the club\u2019s smoky kaleidoscope of flesh. Women swaggered by in tights, leatherette and heels that could dent metal, brushing past a vending machine that spits cigarettes. Bartenders shooed too-stingy visitors from the good seats, returning $15 in singles for a $5 drink order paid with a 20, and mouthing the lyrics to \u201cSuper Freak.\u201dDancers pawed playfully at their prey, flipping their hair at patrons like a fishing line.\u201cAll right \u2014 one,\u201d a member of the news media relented eventually, disappearing for a few minutes as a dancer led him to a back room. She returned a short while later to flip her hair at the other scribes.Other requests were less typical of the place. Suzanne Coe, 52, a local pub owner, hoped Ms. Clifford might sign her copy of \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff, the lacerating, if error-specked, insider account of the Trump administration.A man in a United States Navy cap said he had flown in from Houston, where he had seen Ms. Clifford perform previously. (Many customers were disinclined to give their names because, well, they were spending their Saturday night at a strip club by the airport.)Above the bar, festooned with balloons of red, white and blue, one TV was tuned to a Trump-themed panel on CNN, as a government shutdown clock ticked in the bottom right corner. Beside the stage, the president\u2019s face looked out from an old picture, mugging beside Ms. Clifford.\u201cHE SAW HER LIVE,\u201d an ad for the event read, using the same image. \u201cYOU CAN TOO!\u201dThe region is Trump Country, in a state he carried by 14 points, in a county he won by 25. But even among those who might be expected to tut-tut an extramarital encounter and covert payment by the future president, the story of Ms. Clifford has struggled to break through entirely in recent days.Shutdown. Russia. North Korea. A porn star hardly rates.\u201cThis is just a news story. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s accurate,\u201d the Rev. Franklin Graham, a Trump supporter, told MSNBC.But broadly, he allowed, \u201cour country has got a sin problem.\u201dAt the women\u2019s rally in downtown Greenville hours before the show, Ms. Clifford\u2019s appearance registered only slightly. \u201cTrump Unfaithful to Wives and Country,\u201d a sign read, beside the picture of the two.Some had higher-order concerns. \u201cWe\u2019d rather not have a nuclear war,\u201d said June Baswell, 69, wearing a pink hat with a pin that read, \u201cY\u2019all means all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather die some other way.\u201dMr. Levy, the club owner, with slicked hair and a thick goatee, said his aim was entirely apolitical. \u201cI\u2019m strictly \u2018How can I get lightning in a bottle?\u2019\u201d he said.He read the Journal article about Ms. Clifford, whom he said he had known before, and was compelled to reach out, inviting her once more to the bar he calls \u201cCheers with breasts.\u201dMr. Levy declined to say what he was paying her, though financial considerations dotted the club\u2019s Facebook page during the week.\u201cHow much to get in?\u201d one man asked.\u201c$130,000,\u201d a woman replied.Ms. Clifford said she was receiving her \u201cnormal amount, I guess.\u201d She performed two shows, elaborate burlesque acts around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., lit in part by a disco ball large enough to crush three men if it shook loose from its bearings. Attendance flagged a bit by late in the night.In between, Ms. Clifford, who said she had not danced since the summer, mingled with well-wishers, photo-seekers and, if they approached, reporters.\u201cImagine coming back when you\u2019re the most insecure,\u201d she said of her return. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever gone onstage and was actually scared.\u201dShe was asked what it had been like to be Stormy Daniels over the past week. \u201cStressful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd amusing.\u201dNext in line, a man in a cap was waiting, sliding behind her for a picture. Ms. Clifford dutifully removed her top. The man grabbed at her front, tentatively at first. The brim of his star-spangled hat, reading \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d nearly grazed her blonde hair.Ms. Clifford smiled again, beside a well-stocked jug of tips.Our country has got a sin problem.

Others were still coloring in their signs.\u201cI\u2019m done with men feeling like they have some sort of power over women, and I\u2019m definitely done with having a president who believes that he has the power to take things from them, to take things that are provided \u2014 like Planned Parenthood \u2014 from women, when they deserve the same sort of health care as anybody else,\u201d said Amanda Kowalski, 28, who works in financial services.Claudia Grubbs, a 42-year-old high school teacher, returned after marching last year, which she said spurred her into donating to organizations that support women in politics.\u201cOver the last year, every day when I read the news or watch the news, I\u2019m horrified at the things that Trump and his administration are doing, and I feel like going to the march will help re-center me, refocus me and not make me feel like I don\u2019t know what is happening to our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019ll help me gain a sense of balance and a sense of purpose, and help me pursue things that I want to pursue.\u201dAshley Bennett, a Democrat from Egg Harbor Township, N.J., unseated a longtime local Republican politician in her first campaign for office last November. She ran for Atlantic County freeholder against John L. Carman after he posted a meme on Facebook during last year\u2019s march asking, \u201cWill the women\u2019s protest be over in time for them to cook dinner?\u201dMs. Bennett told the crowd at Saturday\u2019s march in New York that she was scared to run at first, and that she asked herself, \u201cAm I the right person? Can I really do this? But then I realized that if you wait until you feel ready, you may never take action.\u201dIn Washington, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, took the stage with other legislators who arrived from the Capitol. She praised the women who have already launched campaigns, many for the first time.\u201cThey marched, and now they have run for office, and some of them have already won their office,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want women to know their power in so many respects \u2014 by showing up not only on the day of the march, but in airports, in town halls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s women who are holding our democracy together in these dangerous times,\u201d added Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. \u201cTo change the system, we need to change the players and have women at the table.\u201dOn Twitter Saturday afternoon, the president seemed to celebrate the women\u2019s demonstrations, even though the protests across the country had a distinct anti-Trump message.According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the unemployment rate for women aged 20 and older has been falling steadily since 2012, years before Mr. Trump took office.On Friday, Mr. Trump addressed the thousands of anti-abortion protesters gathered in Washington for the March for Life.The federal government shutdown that took effect early Saturday did not dissuade marchers from taking to the streets.One of the sticking points that led to the shutdown \u2014 disagreement over extending legal status to immigrants brought into the country illegally as children \u2014 has become a rallying cry for organizers.On the Metro headed to the Smithsonian, participants on their way to the Lincoln Memorial wore the symbolic pink hats that became popular during last year\u2019s march.Michelle Bloom, 52, a Washington teacher, held a sign as her daughter, Jenna, 14, repaired hers with duct tape. She had made it in her mother\u2019s classroom Friday, tracing the handprints of her classmates who couldn\u2019t make it to the march.\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see young and old coming together like this,\u201d Michelle Bloom said. But, she added, \u201cI thought there would be more.\u201dWomen lined the frozen reflecting pool and slowly filled the grassy areas, but there was still space for kickball games around the Washington Monument. And people jogged and biked around the Mall, which would have been impossible a year ago, when the crowd of marchers was bigger.The organizers of last year\u2019s march in Washington focused their energy this year on putting together an event Sunday in Las Vegas. The event, Power to the Polls, will serve as an opening rally for a national voter registration campaign.While the crowds in Washington were not quite as large as they were in 2017, the Mall was still teeming with people.Garrett Regunberg, 32, pointed to the rallies against President Trump\u2019s travel ban as an example of ongoing activism that has made a difference.\u201cThere was a lot done in the first year to limit the damage that could have been done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resistance is alive.\u201dMarchers packed into downtown Chicago to listen to speakers like billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer, who has urged Democrats to make the ouster of Mr. Trump a central campaign issue this year.With midterm elections approaching, Mr. Steyer said, \u201cWe are going to have to be organized, we are going to have to be engaged and we are going to have to go to the polls and flip those seats.\u201dMarchers shouted anti-Trump chants and carried signs saying, \u201cVote\u201d and \u201cImmigrants Make America Great.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an activist and an artist and I\u2019m here to fight for women\u2019s equality and equality for all minorities,\u201d said Michelle Hartney, 39, of Chicago, who said she attended the Women\u2019s March in Washington last year.Some women avoided the marches on Saturday because they felt they were too focused on electing Democrats, at the expense of other issues. They wanted the movement to be more inclusive of people of color and other marginalized groups.Nadya Agrawal, 26, joined the big rally in Washington last year. \u201cBut it just wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt more like a commiseration rather than the start of a lot of work.\u201dGatherings like these, she added, were no substitute for more focused activism. \u201cI hope that the women who are at this rally are also going to the next Black Lives Matter protest, or marching on behalf of DACA,\u201d she said.Deandra Jefferson, 24, who helped write the letter, said in a phone interview on Saturday that the march \u201ccaters mostly toward middle class, straight white women,\u201d and was not an effective way to dismantle oppression.\u201cThey should stop organizing these marches until they decide what they\u2019re going to do the other 364 days of the year,\u201d she added.The shutdown kept the president from traveling as planned to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida this weekend.Despite his absence, several hundred protesters gathered north of the mansion, on the beach in front of Worth Avenue. Many people waved \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d signs.Organizers of the second Women\u2019s March in Ottawa shifted the focus to issues directly affecting Canadian women. Many marchers wore red scarves as a gesture of support for the large number of indigenous women whose murders or disappearances have received relatively little attention from the police.The march, which began at the Parliament buildings, was one of about three dozen across Canada.Among those who addressed the crowd in Ottawa was Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, who has been one of the leading international voices against President Trump\u2019s climate policies.Late last year, Ms. McKenna confronted a reporter from a right-wing Canadian news outlet, Rebel Media, over its repeated references to her as Climate Barbie. Earlier, a Conservative member of Parliament apologized for describing her that way on Twitter.\u201cI realized that when I spoke out in my small case of being called Climate Barbie \u2014 when I did it I felt better, but I also saw that so many other people stood up for me and they also felt empowered,\u201d Ms. McKenna said in an interview outside of a concert venue at the end of the march.Although Ms. McKenna credited Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who regularly describes himself as a feminist, for encouraging women to enter politics, she said their numbers still must increase, and not just in Canada.\u201cI really believe that we wouldn\u2019t have had an ambitious Paris climate agreement if we didn\u2019t have strong women negotiators,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the untold stories.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to see how many of you today acknowledge that you have put up with abuse, by raising your hands. And not just sexual. Abuse of power. Because we are women, because we don\u2019t have power,\u201d said Ms. Argento, as numerous hands timidly rose from the crowd.The women chanted slogans in Italian and English in solidarity with a global sisterhood whose vision \u201cis in sharp contrast with the Donalds of the world and other self-proclaimed geniuses,\u201d said one of the keynote speakers, Loretta Bondi, of Rome\u2019s Casa Internazionale delle Donne, or International Women\u2019s Center.Women also gathered in other corners of the world, including Frankfurt, Germany; Kampala, Uganda; and Osaka, Japan, where a small group chanted \u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d in English and Japanese.Reporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei, Jacey Fortin and Sean Piccoli in New York; Emily Cochrane in Washington; Ginger Reilly in Chicago; Angela Chen in Los Angeles; Ian Austen in Ottawa; and Elisabetta Povoledo in Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia and Venezuela\u2019s Plan to Sidestep Sanctions: Virtual Currencies", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions.Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States.The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure.In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government\u2019s oil and natural resources.In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble.Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela\u2019s Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That\u2019s because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies.That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency.All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority.That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules.But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking.\u201cThe prototype works,\u201d he added.These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome.None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control.Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country\u2019s gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves.\u201cTo overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,\u201d he said.Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation.The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government\u2019s natural resources.The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar, has experienced in recent years because of the government\u2019s unbridled expansion of the money supply.\u201cThe country is in a social crisis,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. \u201cHow do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.\u201dMr. \u00c1lvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018.But the link between the currency and the government\u2019s oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros\u2019s government.There is a measure of irony in the government\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bol\u00edvar, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm.The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity.Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities \u2014 more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now.In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country.Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system.\u201cThe irony is in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,\u201d he said in October.The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions.Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well.But, he said at the time, \u201cthese are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.\u201dNathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow, and Ana Vanessa Herrero from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Companies Have Newfound Freedom \u2026 to Fire", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The announcements came in a steady drumbeat. Around 1,300 job cuts at France\u2019s biggest automaker. At least 2,500 at France\u2019s largest supermarket chain. Over 200 sought at a major clothing retailer. And thousands more are on the way.Just weeks after France\u2019s labor overhaul went into effect, companies are readily taking advantage of new rules that make it easier to hire and fire. But the other changes, those designed to help cushion the blow like retraining programs, haven\u2019t been put into place yet, leaving workers vulnerable to a coming wave of downsizing.Unemployment, persistently stuck at more than 9 percent for nearly a decade, could rise in the coming months. Unions, already dubious of the overhaul, may grow impatient if the government doesn\u2019t follow through on its promises to workers.\u201cRight now it\u2019s flexibility, and no security,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economics professor at the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cCompanies will do everything they can under the new law to maximize flexibility and facilitate the firing of people.\u201dPerceptions of France, long derided as a difficult place to do business for its onerous labor rules, are changing.Growth has recently picked up after being stagnant for nearly five years. And there are signs that the changes, a major piece of the president\u2019s economic program, are drawing the interest of investors.Amazon will open a new distribution center south of Paris this year, creating over 1,000 jobs. Facebook and Google announced Monday they would invest in artificial intelligence development in France. Also Monday, Toyota announced it would invest 300 million euros, or $367 million, to increase capacity at a plant in northern France, creating up to 700 jobs through 2020.\u201cThe complex labor laws have historically been the No. 1 obstacle to the competitiveness and attractiveness of France,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France, a business consulting firm. The changes, together with other business-friendly measures such as a gradual reduction in the corporate tax, have \u201cdrastically changed investor perceptions,\u201d he said.The transition, though, is off to a halting start.Mr. Macron wants to invest more than \u20ac15 million in programs to improve public and private retraining that have had only mixed success in recent years at ushering the jobless back into employment. Lawmakers won\u2019t vote on the measures until the spring, and any improvements are expected to take months, if not years, to bear fruit.That layoffs are being announced before this crucial part is done has fueled suspicion among organized labor. And while new jobs will eventually be created, many unions worry the changes are a ploy to strip away worker protections \u2014 and their own power. In the last several weeks, the country\u2019s most ardent trade organizations have vigorously opposed such plans, with differing results.The new rules tip the balance of power from workers to employers. Businesses have been reluctant to hire because it was difficult to shed workers. Employers have turned en masse to precarious short-term contracts to fill the gaps.Now, companies will be able to negotiate job cuts and restructurings through voluntary departures directly with labor representatives inside the business, rather than under strict industrywide collective bargaining agreements. Multinationals can downsize loss-making French operations more easily, even if the overall business is profitable. Companies will face less risk of legal action over dismissals, and can hire new staff immediately, rather than waiting.Pierre-Olivier Salmon, the head of corporate information at PSA Group, said the carmaker is looking to bring in a new generation of workers with the digital and programming skills needed to develop projects like electric cars and future technology for the automotive industry.Yet most of the positions affected in this round are white-collar posts, such as administrative assistants, communications personnel and those in research and development.That is seen as hardly a positive by some of France\u2019s unions. They are concerned that the outcome at PSA will be replicated by other companies seeking to shed protected workers, and at most bring in a new generation of cheap labor.The new measures may also have the effect of pitting labor groups against one another \u2014 a development that could work in Mr. Macron\u2019s favor.His union hailed last week\u2019s agreement at PSA, saying it was \u201cnot a danger for employees,\u201d but \u201can opportunity for those who want it.\u201dYet there is also little doubt that the restructuring will benefit PSA Group\u2019s bottom line: Incoming young workers won\u2019t be paid nearly as much as those heading out the door.\u201cThe main point is not to reduce costs,\u201d Mr. Salmon of PSA insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s to meet new challenges.\u201dWhatever the case, last week\u2019s announcements of job cuts will likely be followed by others, providing a test for Mr. Macron. He campaigned for the presidency with pledges to make France more dynamic, but not at the cost of unraveling its social welfare model.The challenge is not lost on his rivals.\u201cThis labor law allows big companies to fire more quickly and easily,\u201d Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, wrote on Twitter. Ms. Le Pen, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Macron last year in the presidential runoff, added: \u201cThe human dramas will multiply.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted a statement from Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the General Confederation of Labor. He said, in part, \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of employees with seniority,\u201d not \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of low-cost employees with seniority.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "False Missile Alert Looms as a Black Eye for Hawaii and Its Governor", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe false alarm about an incoming ballistic missile that sent Hawaii into a panic this weekend threatened to turn into a major embarrassment for the state and its politically endangered governor, David Y. Ige, as Hawaii officials moved to head off damage to Hawaii\u2019s biggest industry, tourism.The Federal Communications Commission said on Sunday that its initial investigation of the mistaken alert had concluded that Hawaii did not have \u201creasonable safeguards or process controls in place\u201d in its emergency notification process. The alert was sent to cellphones across Hawaii on Saturday morning when a state employee pushed the wrong button in the midst of a shift-change safety drill. It then took 38 minutes for the agency to withdraw the alert.The prospect of a battery of investigations by state and federal lawmakers, with public testimony about the timeline of events, suggested that the alert would probably be a dominant subject in Hawaii life for months to come.And it quickly emerged as an issue for Mr. Ige, 60, a soft-spoken engineer and a Democrat who is up for re-election this year, and whose leadership style had already been criticized as tepid. He held a news conference five hours after the mistake to apologize, and frequently yielded the microphone to other officials.\u201cThis is one of the worst things that could happen to an incumbent governor who has already been criticized for his lack of leadership,\u201d said Colin Moore, director of the Public Policy Center at the University of Hawaii. \u201cThere is no more obvious test of leadership than responding to what happened yesterday.\u201d\u201cThis story isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to haunt his re-election campaign all the way to the August primary. Everyone is going to want to talk about their story \u2014 that morning when they were terrified, and why it took the governor so long to respond.\u201dMr. Ige issued a statement on Sunday apologizing again for the bungled alert. \u201cI can personally assure each and every resident and visitor that steps have already been taken by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency to ensure that a situation of this type never happens again,\u201d he said.Across Hawaii on Sunday, people spoke about gathering their families for what they thought would be their last moments, until the \u201cfalse alarm\u201d announcement went out.\u201cWhy did it take so long to correct the mistake?\u201d said Jamie Higa, 34, a real estate agent. \u201cWhoever is responsible clearly failed to do his job. The governor isn\u2019t directly responsible for what happened, but he is our top elected official.\u201dRepresentative Colleen Hanabusa, who is challenging Mr. Ige in the Democratic primary in August, repeatedly questioned in an interview why it took so long for the alert to be rescinded.\u201cThirty-eight minutes \u2014 and the fear and the anxiety and everything that it caused for the people and for our visitors,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to have a major consequence for our visitor industry as well. Either people think we are incompetent, or we are not safe.\u201d\u201cThe governor and his administration did not handle this correctly,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou cannot have people driving 100 miles an hour on the freeway and having visitors shelter in place. Immediately, what he should have done is checked and verified whether it is real or not real, and if it was not real, tell people immediately, not 38 minutes later.\u201dMr. Ige\u2019s campaign issued a statement defending his handling of the event and saying that the governor had focused over the last year on ensuring that Hawaii was prepared for an attack, particularly as tensions rose between North Korea and the United States. A missile launched from North Korea would land in Honolulu in about 30 minutes, giving people very little time to prepare.\u201cThis is an inappropriate time to involve politics with the matter at hand,\u201d said Glenna Wong, the communications director for the campaign. \u201cGov. David Ige has the utmost compassion for our citizens who endured yesterday\u2019s fear and heartache, and has assured each and every resident, community and business stakeholders, and visitors that a false alert will never happen again.\u201d\u201cIt is unfortunate that she is using yesterday\u2019s event to draw attention to herself while offering no solution,\u201d she said of Ms. Hanabusa.The governor\u2019s aides said the state moved quickly to inform people that it was a false alarm in posts on Twitter and on Facebook. They blamed the delay in sending out a second alert on a flaw in the state emergency system: It had no process for recalling an erroneous message. That is now being changed, they said, and two people must now approve an alert before it is sent out.As the crisis rose and receded in less than an hour Saturday, other officials in the state were quicker \u2014 and more visible \u2014 than the governor in trying to reassure a panicked public, including Ms. Hanabusa and Hawaii\u2019s other representative, Tulsi Gabbard, who is also a Democrat.\u201cHis challenger was on air with a local television station before he was,\u201d said Rebecca S. Ward, who conducts polls in the state for The Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u201cThe governor has come under fire in the past for lack of leadership. And I\u2019m afraid that yesterday reinforced that. I think there\u2019s no question but that this is going to be a major hurdle for him in this re-election.\u201dTim Hart, 58, a construction worker spending Sunday on a beach in Kona, said he faulted Mr. Ige for keeping a low profile.\u201cThe governor really didn\u2019t do much until hours and hours after the fact,\u201d he said. \u201cTulsi Gabbard got the bull by the horns and in less than 10 minutes, she was tweeting.\u201dNeil Abercrombie, the previous governor, whom Mr. Ige defeated in a Democratic primary in 2014, called the episode \u201ca monumental example of failure of leadership \u2014 incredible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beyond incompetent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is stunning. It should have been rescinded instantly.\u201dAs officials tried to reconstruct exactly what happened on Saturday, a spokesman for the Pacific Command in Hawaii said the military had moved quickly to push back against the Hawaii state alert as soon as it was known to be incorrect.\u201cUpon confirming yesterday\u2019s message was a false alarm, Uspacom Public Affairs worked quickly to inform the public through traditional and social media channels,\u201d Cmdr. David Benham, a military spokesman, said in an email Sunday, using an acronym for the Pacific Command. \u201cWe will use this as an opportunity to improve our internal processes as well as coordination with State authorities. \u201cThe Pacific Command first told Hawaii media that there was no approaching ballistic missile at 8:23 a.m. \u2014 about 13 minutes after Hawaii sent out the alert.Hawaii\u2019s economy depends heavily on tourism. Ms. Hanabusa\u2019s concern that the false alarm might discourage people from visiting the islands was shared by state tourism officials.George D. Szigeti, the president of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the mistake \u2014 which sent terrified tourists searching for shelter \u2014 \u201cregrettable and completely avoidable.\u201d\u201cThere is no cause for travelers with trips already booked to Hawaii or considering a vacation in the islands to change their plans,\u201d he said. \u201cHawaii continues to be the safest, cleanest and most welcoming travel destination in the world, and the alarm created today by the false alert does not change that at all.\u201dBarbara Tanabe contributed reporting from Honolulu; Meghan Miner Murray contributed from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

But the company that gave the world the modern smartphone has a perfect opportunity this year to create a brave and groundbreaking new take on that device: a phone that encourages you to use it more thoughtfully, more deliberately \u2014 and a lot less.Also, what do we do about it?Government regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who\u2019s left?The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.\u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201dFor one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201dAnother idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).\u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.\u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s working on something grand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Delicate Politics of Chasing Owls", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Owls tend to be secretive. While there are a few American species that enjoy the daylight hours, most are nocturnal and spend their days behind thick greenery or uncannily blending into the bark of the trees they nestle against. Once they\u2019ve found a secure place to snooze, they are likely to return to that spot daily, but even if you find evidence of their presence \u2014 scat and regurgitated pellets \u2014 good luck seeing the clandestine culprits.I\u2019m a seasoned birder with a particular interest in owls, and on my ventures to find them, even when I have specific information on where they\u2019ve been seen just minutes before, I\u2019ve failed to find them more often than not. Such elusiveness makes \u201cowling\u201d one of the great birding challenges. Being the first to find a particular owl is regarded by some as a badge of distinction, and those who find them regularly are viewed with awe-struck reverence.While birders prize owls, the ethical ones also abet the species\u2019 secretive natures with their own code of silence, an owl \u201comert\u00e0.\u201d Many people will not share the specifics of an owl\u2019s location or will do so only in whispers. A typical owl dislikes disruption and will find a new roost if too many people kick up a racket near its daybed. This forces the bird to expend valuable energy \u2014 and of course throws off its sleep pattern.But I worry that in our effort to protect these elusive and private birds, we birders are falling short of another responsibility: to promote the cause of wildlife conservation by letting others in on our secrets so they, too, can see these magnificent predators and celebrate them.On listservs and bird reporting sites, users often note an owl location only well after the fact or provide a general location (Springfield Park) rather than a detailed one (halfway up the sycamore east of the bike trail near the footbridge). Even birders you know might get testy if you ask for details. When you request such information, you do so sheepishly, acknowledging your impropriety while promising discretion. Being protective of owl sightings has caused more than one heated argument; ask too many times and you may be shunned.That many birders are tight-lipped is a good thing, of course, because the cost of incaution can be disappointment or tragedy. When I lived in Ohio there was a hot spot nearby that was reliable for wintering long-eared owls, a species that many birders might travel across state lines to see. Over time the location, details and all, became widely known; sure enough, the owls stopped coming.There are stories about other owls being loved to death \u2014 fleeing spotting scopes and telephoto lenses only to be hit by cars \u2014 or of landowners, once tolerant of owlers on their properties, who revoked access for all because of an unprincipled few.Fortunately, every region seems to have an ambassador owl or two \u2014 an individual that seems indifferent to human attentions. I remember one that chose a nesting site right next to a busy playground and would snooze the day away in the open with no regard for the screaming toddlers, slamming car doors or barking dogs below. These birds are often their viewers\u2019 first owls and are for many the sightings that get them hooked on birding.And that\u2019s arguably a downside to birders\u2019 protective secrecy: Owls might be rivaled only by bald eagles as ornithological recruiting agents, inspiring young and old to take an interest, to care about wildlife and to want to share with others. It\u2019s no accident that many nature centers have live birds of prey, including owls, on display for visitors and that many birding organizations sponsor evening \u201cowl prowls.\u201d But as awesome as it is to see an owl up close in captivity or hear one hooting in the distant dark, there\u2019s nothing like seeing one in the wild on its own terms.It\u2019s snowy owl season in the upper reaches of the United States. Though not entirely dependable, this species is a not-uncommon winter visitor from the Arctic, and during years of sudden upsurges in migration, these owls can show up in significant numbers, on piers and coastal dunes, in stubble fields \u2014 even at urban parks and airports.Because they often rest on the ground and hunt by day (after all, it never gets dark for much of their time up north), they can be conspicuous, much to the delight of birders and amateur photographers. For the same reason, they seem to enjoy a less protected status from birders than their nocturnal kin. With a snowy owl, full location details are even likely to end up in a feel-good segment on the local newscast. (We may have Harry Potter to thank for that.)All of this points to a basic wildlife watcher\u2019s conundrum: When you know the location of a charismatic but sensitive species, do you keep that information to yourself (or to a small network of trusted peers), or do you broadcast it far and wide? The first option reeks of a kind of proprietary elitism, but it is of immediate benefit to the animal. The second option seems recklessly harmful to the animal, but if it promotes the hobby and raises awareness, then it might lead to far greater long-term benefits to conservation.Though there are usually those easy-to-see ambassador owls around, many birders insist on keeping mum about those locations, too; perhaps, for the greater good, they shouldn\u2019t. And here\u2019s a more controversial thing to say: Perhaps when we find an owl that is not especially wary, outside of nesting season and in a publicly accessible place, we ought to freely share that information, especially with those uninitiated to birding. If you have the time, set up a scope and invite passers-by to take a look, and if you have school-age children, see whether a field trip is possible.Some of my birding friends will balk at this suggestion, and there was a time when I would have been skeptical, too. But in an era of deregulation, of species being removed from the Endangered Species Act and of stripped-away land protections, conservationists may need to try harder than ever to get fellow citizens to care about wildlife. It\u2019s awfully hard to care about what you can\u2019t see.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t realize that I was also sitting at Ferris\u2019s bar until the bartender standing in front of me had measured my drink, strained it into a stem glass and set it on a napkin, all without moving more than one step to the right or left.She had whipped up a citrus-sheathed gin number with a rustle of Chartreuse called a 388 C, and it was about as cheerful a kickoff to the dinner hour as anything I\u2019ve come across lately. In fact, almost all the drinks that Ferris\u2019s bartenders stir up in about four square feet of space are smarter and more bracing than what typically comes out of a full-size bar, and often they are poured into vintage etched glasses that any neo-speakeasy would envy.The cocktails encapsulate Ferris\u2019s most likable traits. It\u2019s a modest restaurant that overdelivers, cares about little details and has a personal, handmade sensibility. It doesn\u2019t quite give you the feeling of showing up at a friend\u2019s place for dinner, but it comes closer than a lot of places where that\u2019s the explicit aim.The illusion is aided by the carpentered interior. The single dining room, clad in raw two-by-eights, could be a suburban basement finished over the weekend by a couple with a table saw. A long cushioned bench built into one end of the room provides about half the seating, along with the stools at high tables and the counter.There\u2019s no lobby or reception area to speak of. If you arrive by elevator you\u2019re facing the kitchen, and if you take the stairs from the sidewalk you walk straight into the action in the dining room.At Ferris, his only bad idea so far is trying to make roasted sunchokes into a main course, and by the time I gave up on the plate, filled out with smoked cabbage and sauced with scallion miso, I\u2019d decided that sunchokes themselves were more to blame than Mr. Proechel.He is on firmer ground with other vegetables: Okinawa sweet potatoes, their purple flesh mashed so it opens up to a splash of buttermilk and pumpkin mustard; or roasted beets with soft curls of fresh coconut, dressed in a dark tahini made from black sesame seeds; or charred stalks of broccolini with grapes and cashews (welcome back, cashews, we\u2019ve missed you) scattered over a cushion of yogurt spiced with Timur pepper \u2014 a relative of the Sichuan peppercorn.Agnolotti with a buttery and nearly liquid carrot filling are one of Ferris\u2019s more appealing main dishes; they\u2019re tossed with braised lamb neck. Maybe they would be slightly better without chips of crunchy raw carrot on top; contrary to popular belief, not every dish needs what chefs like to call texture.Mr. Proechel has a keen sense for contrasting flavors, though. He uses red pepper and sticky grilled dates to make what has to be the most exciting blood sausage in town. A chunk of grilled mackerel that any izakaya could be proud of sits in ponzu with \u2014 surprise \u2014 plums and an egg yolk cooked so that it looks and spreads like lemon curd.Nothing at Ferris makes heads swivel and nostrils twitch in quite the same way, but if it\u2019s a table-annexing feast you want, then the c\u00f4te de boeuf with \u201call the fixings\u201d is the dish for you.Mr. Proechel has his own notions about \u201cfixings.\u201d I have never looked at a grilled beef rib and thought that what it really needed was a bowl of whipped buttermilk, but apparently he has, and I have to give him credit. Beating the buttermilk turns it into something between yogurt and whipped cream; mixing that with charred cipollini makes it into a particularly luxurious onion dip. There\u2019s also a paste of black garlic to serve as a super-concentrated steak sauce, and a shaved brussels sprout salad for relief from the richness. The only false move here was the sodden dumplings in broth, and they were easy enough to ignore in all the excitement.The danger of putting a firecracker like that on the menu is that the half of the dining room that didn\u2019t order it ends up staring glumly at the half that did. That was me, one night, looking at the women at the corner table who doted on their steak for an hour while I poked at my (perfectly all right) cod with clams and hazelnuts.When you are ready for something to drink with the c\u00f4te de boeuf, you run into another surprise of this Swiss Army knife of a restaurant: the versatile wine list, overseen by Jenny Lakin. It\u2019s not long, and it draws mainly from France and Italy, but it\u2019s been carefully drafted to include relative values from expensive regions and out-and-out values from less traveled areas.Ferris doesn\u2019t knock itself out for the dessert course. The few sweets are simple and pleasant, though, from the yuzu-lemon frozen yogurt to a dark chocolate mousse stuck with chips of jasmine meringue.Ms. Lakin\u2019s list carries over into dessert territory with amari, absinthes, liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and other end-of-the-night shots. Where all these bottles are stored I never figured out.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

She missed payments on her credit card, was threatened with collections, and was spending a lot on rent, college loans and eating out.\u201cWhere would I have learned personal finance?\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you get it from your family, there\u2019s no time where a teacher sits down and explains very basic financial principles,\u201d she said.As a recent college graduate in New York City, Ms. Bell learned that she wasn\u2019t the only one among her peers who struggled to manage her finances. She often spoke with a college friend, John Moore, whose investment banking roommates also had trouble sticking to a budget or paying off debt on time. They figured that if bankers were having problems with home finances, regular New Yorkers might be as well.In 2002, the two hashed out a basic curriculum and started teaching it to teenagers at community centers and workshops. Friends and acquaintances, many of them from the financial services sector, volunteered to help.\u201cWe connected Wall Street with Main Street,\u201d said Mr. Moore.In the classroom, Ms. Bell wasn\u2019t shocked that most students didn\u2019t know anything about personal finance \u2014 \u201cthey were still using piggy banks,\u201d she said \u2014 but she was surprised by the enthusiasm of the students, many of whom were just starting their first jobs.\u201cOnce you start earning money, it\u2019s one of the most exciting things that kids want to talk about,\u201d she said.Today, Cents Ability\u2019s weeklong course offers the basics on budgeting, credit scores, saving and investing, among other topics. Last year, around 300 volunteers offered classes to nearly 3,000 students across New York.\u201cIt\u2019s like feeding or clothing people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessity.

{"Headline": "The Market Isn\u2019t Bullish for Everyone", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHardly a day goes by without President Trump tweet-bragging about the relentless rise of the stock market to fresh record highs \u2014 Exhibit A in his mind about how he is, indeed, making America great again.But, while strong equity markets are certainly a Good Thing, let\u2019s not forget that, like so many effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, those higher share prices are propelled upward in considerable measure by the new president\u2019s pro-business policies and benefit the wealthy far more than the average American.The unsurprising reality is that the rich are far more likely to hold stocks, and when they do, they own them in much larger chunks than their less-well-off brethren.The percentage of Americans who hold any stocks at all has declined to just over half of all Americans, while only 28 percent of families with below-median incomes hold any shares (including in retirement accounts). Moreover, while middle-class Americans typically own just $15,000 in equities, the top 10 percent have amassed median holdings of $365,000.To be sure, rising stock markets help many Americans in other ways. Perhaps most importantly, they secure pension benefits for those fortunate enough to participate in corporate or municipal plans.However, the percentage of workers covered by these programs has been declining, from 62 percent in 1983 to 17 percent in 2016. Only about 22 percent of Americans below the median even have an individual retirement account.While we can speculate about the future, for the moment, anyway, job growth has been slower under the new president than it was under President Obama. In 2017, the economy added a total of 2,055,000 jobs, the lowest number since 2010.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump omitted to mention any effect that the rising stock market has had on incomes \u2014 perhaps because there hasn\u2019t been a discernible one.From when he took office through the end of November, average hourly wages rose by just 0.6 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Even before taking account of higher prices, earnings were up by only 2.3 percent last year post-inauguration, a fraction of the 17.3 percent gain in share prices during the same time period.Similarly, last year\u2019s 4 percent increase in house prices \u2014 while satisfying \u2014 is only a fraction of the jump in stocks.While Mr. Trump would be hard-pressed to show much benefit for his base from soaring equities, I\u2019m prepared to give him at least partial credit for higher stock prices.That\u2019s because his administration is engaged in a giveaway to corporate America. Yes, we needed to reform our business tax code to compete with countries like Britain, which lowered its corporate tax rate to 19 percent in 2017 from 30 percent in 2007. But the estimated benefit of $600 billion will go straight to the bottom line of corporate America, and anticipation of this has clearly fueled share prices.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has declared open season on regulations that the business community says are impediments to growth (meaning profitability).So, for example, the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 fresh with two new Trump appointees \u2014 has begun reversing major Obama-era rules that favored workers and organized labor, while the Interior Department just rescinded an Obama rule limiting hydraulic fracking in oil and gas fields.I\u2019m appalled that so much of the good work of the Obama administration is being unwound. Investors see it differently: Every regulation that is emasculated or eliminated produces more profit potential for the companies that were subject to the regulation.Nonetheless, even with that tail wind, the jump in our market only roughly parallels global market indexes and pales in comparison with last year\u2019s results in Japan and emerging markets like China.Remarkably, in 2017, the world achieved its highest growth rate \u2014 3 percent \u2014 since 2011, and economists believe the world is on track for another strong year in 2018.It\u2019s hard to imagine that even Mr. Trump would claim credit for Europe\u2019s tantalizing break out of its decade of malaise or for the renewed optimism that China, India and other major developing countries will continue their rapid growth.Yet, Mr. Trump\u2019s braggadocio is so unabashed that one shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a tweet contending that China should thank him for its roaring economy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Pentagon Papers Team Tells How The Times Defied Censorship", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring Tuesday\u2019s Facebook Live, the Times alumni described the secrecy surrounding their work on the Papers and their frustration with the public\u2019s initial reaction to our publication. Here are some excerpts from their conversation, condensed and edited for clarity.I\u2019ve brought them together so that we can talk about what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with the new Steven Spielberg movie \u201cThe Post,\u201d but more importantly to tell the very dramatic story of how the Pentagon Papers were obtained, developed, produced, edited, curated, published against the threat of tremendous legal liability from the Nixon administration \u2014 a dramatic enough story in itself that would have made, we believe, for a very good movie called \u201cThe Times.\u201dI\u2019m going to ask them to introduce themselves in the order in which they first came into contact with the Pentagon Papers in the late spring of 1971. Allan Siegal?Part of the mission of The Times was to present the history of the Vietnam War as it had been recorded under the orders of then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who wanted to find out, how did we get into this mess?The people who compiled the report had access to all kinds of cables, memos and notes, which betrayed \u2014 when you read them closely \u2014 that one administration after the next had engaged in exactly the kind of double-dealing that critics of the war had always maintained was going on. But here was the Pentagon saying it, in its own voice.Because of that, it was critical, as far as The Times saw it, to reproduce the documents themselves. Not simply interpret them or rely on them for narrative articles, but to actually expose the public to the words of the decision makers. And that meant that we were trading in classified information on a scale that perhaps had never been undertaken before.What kind of pause did that give any of you as you worked with this material?When I was taken to the Hilton Hotel where the team was working on the papers \u2014 not in the headquarters of The Times but in the hotel \u2014 I was told that we had these papers and it was of course against the law to have these papers and it could even be treasonous to have these papers, and if I did not want to work on them, I was free not to work on them.And of course I wanted to work on them, but right off the bat it was clear that imprisonment was a possibility and I\u2019m sure everybody else felt that way too.The Pentagon Papers were split into documents, and into regular text. The regular text, in fact, was based on New York Times articles, no problem. I warned everybody at the beginning that it\u2019s going to be a lot more dangerous to publish the regular text, if you leave the documents out. And that ignited a huge argument within The Times in which the news people finally said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t run the documents, you\u2019re not going to run anything.\u201dFrom a personal point of view, when I read the material to be published and I had a chance to read the documents that had been picked out, I remember reading one particularly from national security adviser and strong proponent of the war McGeorge Bundy that shocked me. And I said this has got to be published, the public has never seen anything like this. Go with the documents.I think perhaps you could draw the distinction between the very careful in essence curation of a classified document against the dumps that we now see with WikiLeaks and other sources that just put the material out there, consequences be damned.The New York Times got Wikileaks\u2019s materials. It curated them. It didn\u2019t publish all of them. There were other papers, The Guardian included, that did the same thing. And then after they had done what they had done, WikiLeaks changed what it was going to deliver to the public and curated itself.I would admit, however, as we look at what\u2019s taken place thereafter, WikiLeaks has been more of a \u201cdump\u201d than it was before. But you have to be careful how you describe that.The only problem that government officials seem to have with classified information is when it doesn\u2019t paint them in the light they\u2019d like to be painted in. Otherwise they trade in it with impunity, it seems.You might be interested in the history of that affidavit. Max had a lawyer assigned to him \u2014 we had five lawyers in the case; I was running the case, and we signed different parts of it \u2014 and he didn\u2019t like the lawyer, who was a perfectly capable, competent lawyer.And Max would say what you just implied in your statement, to this lawyer. And the lawyer would say, \u201cIt can\u2019t be! It can\u2019t be that people really don\u2019t pay attention to the classification stamp!\u201d Argument, back and forth, back and forth. It was very important to turn that lawyer. Because if a lawyer didn\u2019t turn around and reflect our point of view, it was going to come through in what he said.And Max finally threw up his hands. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll write an affidavit.\u201d So he wrote this affidavit, in which he describes how this works in the real world. All the stuff that\u2019s traded back and forth is classified because everything\u2019s classified. \u201cWhen everything\u2019s classified\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m quoting the Supreme Court \u2014 \u201dnothing is classified.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief for The Times, based in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What are some of the most important tech tools you have relied on as our reporter covering parts of South America? Lately we\u2019ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with drones here, and not just for filming.It was no surprise to us, either, that drone technology was something that had never made it to the village we were working in. So the \u201cflying camera\u201d was quite an attraction when we arrived at our destination.What about the tools that you use could be better?Google Maps, for one. I mainly work in the Andes, and most anyone who lives in mountains can tell you that the shortest distance between two points isn\u2019t necessarily the route that you want to take. However, Google doesn\u2019t use local knowledge to calculate directions.Recently at a dinner party in La Paz, Bolivia, a friend told me about heading out of the canyon where the capital dwellers live and up to a concert on the plateau that sits above the city. The route his phone had calculated was on a dirt road that went straight up on a 45-degree angle that people generally walked or went up by mule.It reminded me of the stories that every correspondent had about using Google or Waze when I used to cover Israel and the Palestinian territories. Your phone would regularly take you in and out of each as if there weren\u2019t a conflict going on, through military checkpoints and down roads that often ended in a wall put up 10 years before. Even if impassable, it was always the shortest route, Google assured.A correspondent there warned me before I arrived to bring a Kindle \u2014 books were sometimes easier to download than to buy in Caracas, especially best-sellers or anything in English. You also lived in fear of losing things as basic and easy to get as a power cord. Venezuela is a country where people are having trouble finding tires when they get holes in them on the road, let alone Apple products. It is very unfortunate.It\u2019s not uncommon for Venezuelans to come back with a duffel bag filled with just the basics that aren\u2019t for sale in stores anymore: toilet paper, dish detergent, shampoo, sponges. It would get to the point where you were also adding phone chargers, batteries, USB cables, internet routers and anything else you could imagine that plugged into the wall.How has internet connectivity been in the Andes countries, and how do locals use apps or websites like Facebook or Twitter? How do governments use tech for surveillance in those places?That\u2019s a question everyone would like to know. Venezuelan spying can be surprisingly low-tech at times \u2014 opposition politicians regularly turn on the television to hear embarrassing conversations of their telephone calls being aired to the public. It seems a bit of a throwback to the Soviet Union in some ways, rather than Pegasus and the other recent spyware that governments usually reach for.It\u2019s effective, though. Many conversations just don\u2019t happen over the phone, and we find another place to communicate where there\u2019s encryption, like Telegram.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Netflix. There seem to be 10 times more offerings in Latin America than the United States, including many movies that are blocked back home and that I can only rent on iTunes. I would urge anyone who wants to spend days watching good films not available in America to set his or her VPN to Colombia and have a look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Ontario, Cool-Climate Wines of Beauty and Vision", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourHe prefers the term vigneron, a French word without English equivalent, referring to a person who guides the grapes along their journey from vine to bottle. Indeed, shepherding is how Mr. Morissette sees his job, not so much manufacturing wine as helping the grapes realize their destiny.Sometimes a wine never gets there. A 2009 chardonnay, one of Pearl Morissette\u2019s early vintages, is still resting in the winery, unsold. Mr. Morissette judged the wine to be too tight and unyielding, and did not want to release it.\u201cIt was telling us to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly recently has it become inviting.\u201dMore often, though, the wines are captivating. The lineup includes savory, textured chardonnays; cabernet francs of uncommon depth and purity; fresh, joyous gamays and pinot noirs that can vary from a pretty, floral 2011 that is delicious right now to a spicy, smoky 2012 that manages to be both brawny and elegant. Like the \u201909 chardonnay, it has not yet been released.Many Americans may be surprised by the idea of any vignerons like Mr. Morissette working in Canada. Many think Ontario is simply too cold for making fine wine, though they might associate the region with ice wine, a rare delicacy made from grapes that have frozen on the vine, resulting in minute quantities of lusciously sweet, concentrated nectar.In fact, grapes ripen here beautifully. The Niagara Peninsula is more than hospitable to cool-climate varieties like riesling, chardonnay and pinot noir. Surprisingly, grapes that require a longer growing season, like cabernet franc, also make exceptional wines.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.On the Niagara Peninsula to the south, vineyards can survive the occasional blast of cold Arctic air because Lake Ontario, which is exceptionally deep, retains heat and warms the winds. If the vines are too far south of the lake, however, the effect is lost and vines cannot survive. In the summer, the cool waters temper the heat, creating a long, moderate growing season.The summer heat in Prince Edward County is likewise moderated by the lake. But in the winter the cold winds hit the region directly. Growers are forced to take the costly, labor-intensive step of burying their vines in the warm earth so they can survive.\u201cI knew it would be extra work, but it is worth it because the calcareous limestone soils are so incredible,\u201d said Mr. Hardie, who planted his first vines there in 2003. The payoff, for him, is wines that are both subtle and expressive.Beyond the small group of top producers, a lot of wine is made on the Niagara Peninsula. Much of it, alas, is workmanlike stuff to sell to the many tourists who come in the summer to visit the lake and Niagara Falls.\u201cProducing plonk for Niagara bus tours, that\u2019s the biggest problem, not the cold,\u201d Mr. Bachelder said.Mr. Morissette, whose wines are both idiosyncratic and remarkable, never imagined he would be making wine on the Niagara Peninsula. He grew up south of Montreal, \u201cin one of the worst places in the world, a suburb,\u201d he said. His family did not drink wine, but he was inspired by novels and old French movies in which joyful, witty scenes set around meals always seemed to include wine.\u201cI call these wines my liquid mentors,\u201d he said.Mr. Morissette married, had children and learned about farming, working in the cellar and producing wines that were expressive, uncompromising and long-lived. Soon, without hope of establishing his own estate in Burgundy, he was ready for another challenge.Inspired, Mr. Morissette moved to the Niagara Peninsula in 2007 with marching orders from Mr. Pearl to do as he thought best. First, they bought a vineyard where a layer of loam sits over bedrock of dolomitic limestone. In 2008, they bought another that, unusually for Niagara, sits over a heavy gravel bed, as in Bordeaux.\u201cMy goal was never to do Burgundy,\u201d he said as we tasted in the winery. \u201cIt was to see what Jordan could do.\u201dWhile Mr. Morissette rejects the label of natural winemaker, he embraces the classic, traditional methods of frugal farmers, who for centuries honed an innate, practical wisdom based on keen observation and a horror of waste.\u201cI wanted to learn the old methods before they disappeared,\u201d he said of his time in Europe.Many who embrace current ideas that emphasize vineyard bedrock, and its influence on the aromas and flavors in the wine, may be surprised that Mr. Morissette rejects that framework.\u201cI care a lot more about soil and fungi and bacteria than I do about rocks,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, we have extraordinary soils in terms of the intact life.\u201dEven more important, he said, is the effect of the climate, which can be as cool as Chablis one year and as hot and damp as North Carolina the next.The wines \u2014 which age in various vessels, including small barrels, large casks, cement eggs and ceramic amphorae \u2014 have a vibrant life force that is felt rather than tasted. His chardonnays tend to be rich rather than lean, while the cabernet francs are pure, structured and lovely. His rieslings are bone dry and age-worthy. Pinot noir, he said, remains a code that he has not yet cracked to his satisfaction.Mr. Morissette is deeply aware of the advantages he has with his partner, Mr. Pearl, whom he says has never wavered in his commitment to Mr. Morissette\u2019s vision.\u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to think you could do this without money,\u201d Mr. Morissette said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done in 10 years what would have taken a generation or two because we\u2019re throwing money at it.\u201dThe rewards are an uncommon sort of wines, whether from Ontario or anywhere else.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing natural about what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are committed to classicism. If you don\u2019t tamper with a wine and live with its moods, it will bring you to a place you couldn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rachael Denhollander: The Price I Paid for Taking On Larry Nassar", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBut we shared one core, unifying experience: sexual assault at the hands of Larry Nassar. And we had one core, unifying goal: facing our abuser and confronting the culture that allowed him to prey on us without fear or punishment.It felt surreal at first \u2014 finally putting names and faces to the numbered \u201cJane Doe\u201d designations I had wanted for so long to protect. But the pain we shared knit us together instantly. We knew what to do when someone began to weep or shake in court, because each of us had cried those tears before. We knew what to say when a grieving survivor expressed guilt or doubt, because we had experienced that same shame.Over the course of the trial, we became an army determined to expose the greatest sexual assault scandal in sports history. And we succeeded. After 156 of us gave statements, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced him on Wednesday to 40 to 175 years.I lost my church. I lost my closest friends as a result of advocating for survivors who had been victimized by similar institutional failures in my own community.I lost every shred of privacy.When a new friend searched my name online or added me as a friend on Facebook, the most intimate details of my life became available long before we had even exchanged phone numbers. I avoided the grocery stores on some days, to make sure my children didn\u2019t see my face on the newspaper or a magazine. I was asked questions about things no one should know when I least wanted to talk.Yet all of it served as a reminder: These were the very cultural dynamics that had allowed Larry Nassar to remain in power.I knew that the farthest I could run from my abuser, and the people that let him prey on children for decades, was to choose the opposite of what that man, and his enablers, had become. To choose to find and speak the truth, no matter what it cost.As the calls began coming in to the Michigan State University Police Department and the number of reports grew, my horror did as well. Victim after victim came forward. Some were abused when they were as young as 6 years old. Some were victimized nearly three decades ago, others only days before my report was filed. Far worse, victims began to come forward who had tried to sound the alarm years before I walked into that M.S.U. clinic to meet the celebrated doctor. Not only were they suffering the devastation of sexual assault; they were suffering deep wounds from having been silenced, blamed and often even sent back for continued abuse.So how did this happen? How, for 30 years, did this monster manage to prey on little girls and young women without being caught?Partly it is because Larry was an expert predator. He was calculating, deliberate and a master manipulator. Much of the abuse, mine included, took place with our own mothers in the room, their view casually blocked by Larry, his hand hidden under a towel, a sheet or loose clothing.But Larry\u2019s cunning is only a small piece of this story. Because most pedophiles present a wholesome persona, they are able to ingratiate themselves into communities. Research shows that pedophiles are also reported at least seven times on average before adults take the reports of abuse seriously and act on them. In many ways, the sexual assault scandal that was 30 years in the making was only a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem \u2014 the unwillingness to speak the truth against one\u2019s own community.The result of putting reputation and popularity ahead of girls and young women? The vile stories you heard in that courtroom this week, all of which could have been prevented.Now that the world has been transfixed by our case, we must make sure not even one more young woman is preyed upon as I was.The first step toward changing the culture that led to this atrocity is to hold enablers of abuse accountable. There is much that needs to be done legislatively, including extending or removing the statute of limitations on criminal and civil charges related to sexual assault, and strengthening mandatory reporting laws and ensuring truth in sentencing, so that dangerous offenders are not released early to damage more children.Most important, we need to encourage and support those brave enough to speak out. Predators rely on community protection to silence victims and keep them in power. Far too often, our commitment to our political party, our religious group, our sport, our college or a prominent member of our community causes us to choose to disbelieve or to turn away from the victim. Far too often, it feels easier and safer to see only what we want to see. Fear of jeopardizing some overarching political, religious, financial or other ideology \u2014 or even just losing friends or status \u2014 leads to willful ignorance of what is right in front of our own eyes, in the shape and form of innocent and vulnerable children.Ask yourself: How much is a child worth?Every decent human being knows the answer to that question. Now it is time to act like it.Rachael Denhollander is a lawyer in Louisville, Ky.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thiel Makes a Bid for Gawker.com, a Site He Helped Bankrupt", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Thiel, the technology billionaire, submitted a bid this week to purchase Gawker.com, the remaining unsold property from the Gawker Media gossip empire that was nearly destroyed in 2016 by a lawsuit largely bankrolled by Mr. Thiel.If approved, the acquisition could be the last step in a yearslong effort by Mr. Thiel to finish an independent journalism outfit that angered him in 2007 when it reported, without his permission, that he is gay, a fact widely known at the time in Silicon Valley.Gawker.com has received other offers, and it is not clear if Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, will prevail. A winning bid is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, if representatives of Gawker.com do not take the site off the market.\u201cThere are going to be multiple factors to consider, which will not be solely economic,\u201d said Will Holden, the administrator of Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy plan.Mr. Thiel, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, according to Forbes, has the means to beat almost any rival bidder. But Mr. Holden said the \u201cethos\u201d of Gawker \u2014 which prided itself on a wry, pirate-ship approach to reporting \u2014 would also be considered in determining new ownership of the Gawker name.Mr. Thiel\u2019s interest in buying Gawker.com has led to speculation that he might delete the site\u2019s archives, effectively erasing its journalism from the web. A spokesman for the billionaire did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Female Kurdish Fighter Kills Turkish Troops in Likely Suicide Bombing in Syria", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQAMISHLI, Syria \u2014 A female Kurdish fighter carried out what appeared to be a suicide bombing attack on the Turkish military in Syria, destroying a tank and killing several Turkish soldiers with a grenade, Kurdish forces in the area said on Sunday.The Kurdish bomber, identified as Zuluh Hemo, 20, had fought under the nom de guerre Avesta Habur, according to a statement from her military organization, the Women\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.J., which is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces.The independent Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the attack, which took place on Saturday, killed two Turkish soldiers after Ms. Hemo threw a grenade down the turret of the tank. The organization\u2019s director, Rami Abdulrahman, said he did not believe it was a deliberate suicide attack.Ms. Hemo\u2019s own unit refrained from calling her a suicide attacker in its statement but said that \u201cthe heroine Avesta attacked the tank and blew herself up with the tank.\u201d It also called her \u201ca model of free Kurdish women,\u201d likening her to other Kurdish suicide bombers.A spokesman for the United States-led military coalition in Syria and Iraq, Col. Ryan Dillon, said that American forces were not operating in the Afrin area and that he could not confirm nor comment on reports of a Kurdish suicide attack.The Turkish military offensive against Kurdish militias in the Afrin area of northern Syria has put Turkey and the United States in the tense position of fighting with and against the same ally: the Kurdish Popular Protection Units, known by their acronym Y.P.G., along with their female component, the Y.P.J.Both are the dominant units in the Syrian Democratic Forces, which, with United States support, has largely defeated the Islamic State militants in eastern Syria, forcing them from their major strongholds of Raqqa and Deir al-Zour last year.According to the Syrian Observatory, 66 people died in the fighting on Saturday, including seven Turkish soldiers. Among the dead, the Observatory said, were 13 children and seven women.Afrin is well west of the area where United States forces are operating in cooperation with the Kurds, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has threatened to advance into areas to the east, where the Americans also operate.Women are a major component of the Kurdish militias in northern Syria, fighting under their own flag and with independent, female commanders. The Y.P.J.\u2019s statement about Ms. Hemo\u2019s attack compared her to Arin Mirkan, a suicide bomber who had attacked the Islamic State in the northern Syrian city of Kobani.The statement, issued by the Y.P.J.\u2019s general command, praised its suicide attackers and said: \u201cWe will resist the Turkish occupation, which represents the historic enemy of our people until the last drop of our blood. Afrin will be a cemetery for fascism.\u201dThe Y.P.J. said that Ms. Hemo joined the militia in 2014, when she would have been about 17, and that she was from a village near Afrin.The Turks refer to Syrian Kurdish militias by the initials of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, P.K.K. \u2014 separatists who are closely allied with the Syrian Kurds \u2014 and falsely accuse the Kurds of having an alliance with the Islamic State, also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh.An earlier version of this article misstated where Turkey fears that an autonomous semi-state is being carved out by the Syrian Democratic Forces. It is in northeastern Syria, not northeastern Turkey.Advertisement"}
