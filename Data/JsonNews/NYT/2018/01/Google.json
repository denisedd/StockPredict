{"Headline": "Is the Populist Revolt Over? Not if Robots Have Their Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneDoes President Trump represent the new normal in American politics?If it was globalization \u2014 or, more precisely, the shock of imports from China \u2014 that moved voters to put Mr. Trump in the White House, could politicians get back to supporting the market-oriented order once the China shock played out?But for all the wishful elucidations, the cosmopolitan elite can\u2019t rid themselves of a stubborn fear: The populist wave that produced President Trump \u2014 not to mention Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, as well as Britain\u2019s exodus from the European Union and the rise of the National Front in France \u2014 may be here to stay.But few manufacturing jobs are left to lose. And rising wages in China are discouraging some companies from relocating production across the Pacific. What\u2019s more, the spread of automation across industries suggests that the era of furious outsourcing in search of cheap foreign labor may be ending.Economists studying the changes in the nature of work that produced such an angry political response suggest, however, that another wave of disruption is about to wash across the world economy, knocking out entire new classes of jobs: artificial intelligence. This could provide decades\u2019 worth of fuel to the revolt against the global elites and their notions of market democracy.Consider the occupation of truck drivers. Mr. Levy expects multiple demonstrations of fully autonomous trucks to take place within five years. If they work, the technology will spread, starting in restricted areas on a limited number of dedicated highway lanes. By 2024, artificial intelligence might eliminate 76,000 jobs driving heavy and tractor-trailer trucks, he says.Similarly, he expects artificial intelligence to wipe out 210,000 assembler and fabricator jobs and 260,000 customer service representatives. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about the future of work in the next 25 years,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to worry about in the next five or six years.\u201dThese may not be big numbers, but they are hitting communities that expressed their contempt for the status quo in 2016. White men and women without a four-year college degree accounted for just under half of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters \u2014 compared with fewer than a fifth of Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Seventy percent of truck drivers, 63 percent of assemblers and fabricators, and 56 percent of customer service representatives share these characteristics.To be sure, economic dislocations don\u2019t have to produce populist politics. Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. notes that geography makes a difference: If the dislocation from A.I. is concentrated in big cities, where workers have more options to find new jobs, the backlash will be more muted than it was when trade took out the jobs of single-industry company towns.What\u2019s more, Mr. Acemoglu added, the political system can respond in different ways to workers\u2019 pain: The Great Depression not only led to Nazi Germany, it also produced Sweden\u2019s social democracy.It\u2019s easier to demonize people \u2014 especially foreigners \u2014 than machines, the children of invention. What\u2019s more, imports from countries with cheaper labor, weaker worker protections and threadbare environmental standards will be seen as unfair. Thea Lee, a former deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who now heads the Economic Policy Institute, notes that workers\u2019 anger is directed against \u201cthe particular set of rules about globalization that we chose,\u201d which spreads benefits among financiers and corporations while disregarding workers.This time could be different, though. \u201cThat sense of unfairness can be attached to technological changes, too,\u201d Mr. Rodrik told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Bill Gates, who came out of nowhere, but big corporations that are getting bigger and becoming monopolists.\u201dIndeed, artificial intelligence could move populism in a different direction. Mr. Rodrik proposes two varieties, of right and left. The two share an anti-establishment flavor and claim to speak for the people against the elites. Both oppose classic liberal economics and globalization. Both are often authoritarian.But right-wing populism \u2014 like that harnessed in Europe \u2014 is provoked by immigration. Its clan consciousness exploits cleavages of race, religion and nationality. On the left, by contrast, the \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative focuses on the economic divide between the capitalists and the working class. Populists of the left mostly take aim at trade.The United States was ripe for both reflexes. Over the last 50 years, as the nation opened its markets to foreign trade, it never set up a social safety net to help workers dislodged by change, as Europe did. It also experienced large-scale immigration across the southern border. And it was walloped by a financial crisis that proved to typical workers that Wall Street would always get a better deal.Mr. Trump\u2019s discourse straddles the divide between the ideological domains, vilifying both trade and immigration. But his policies \u2014 tax cuts and immigration restrictions \u2014 hew decidedly to the right.It is not a great fit for a big-tech future. A world in which immigration is on the decline yet some Google technology is taking the jobs of truckers and cashiers sounds compatible with a leftist policy platform that takes on Wall Street and corporate behemoths.That is a world in which, say, Bernie Sanders would thrive. And that alone could give the cocktail class that gathered in Davos something to worry about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Systematic Crushing of a #MeToo Pioneer", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEight decades ago, Patricia Douglas made nationwide headlines, upstaging even the wedding of the former king of England and the American double-divorc\u00e9e Wallis Simpson. Then, just as suddenly, she vanished, hounded into exile by Hollywood\u2019s most omnipotent men.Why? Because Douglas did something unique: For the first time, a rape survivor not only refused to be silenced, but took her case all the way into federal court, where she reframed the crime as a civil rights issue. And she battled the system alone, without the support of today\u2019s collective outrage and hashtag campaigns.Douglas has been all but forgotten since. But when Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars wear black on the Golden Globes red carpet this weekend in solidarity with sexual assault victims, they will do so in part because, many decades ago, Douglas blazed a trail for the uprising we\u2019re seeing today.In 1930s Hollywood \u2014 its so-called Golden Age \u2014 Douglas was a dancer, shuttling among studios for musical numbers. \u201cI was good,\u201d she recalled in an interview for my 2007 documentary film \u201cGirl 27.\u201d \u201cI moved just like J.Lo.\u201d So when a casting director sent her to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the world\u2019s most prestigious film factory, the 20-year-old Douglas didn\u2019t think twice.What happened next defines Golden Age tarnish: She was bused along with 119 female dancers, to a remote ranch, which the women were told was a film set. Actually, it was an M.G.M.-sponsored \u201cstag affair\u201d for 282 visiting studio salesmen, a reward for record annual profits.Without telephones or transportation, the young dancers were trapped. Two salesmen pinned down Douglas, a teetotaling virgin, and poured Scotch down her throat. She managed to flee; one of the men, David Ross, followed and raped her. \u201cCooperate!\u201d he demanded as Douglas began to black out. \u201cI want you awake.\u201dSexual assault in 1937 implied two things: First, the victim had somehow provoked such abuse, and second, she must stay silent or become \u201cdamaged goods.\u201d Douglas understood each but ignored both, taking her case to Buron Fitts, district attorney of Los Angeles County. Fitts\u2019s top campaign contributor was the M.G.M. chieftain Louis B. Mayer, the highest-paid man in America. Needless to say, Fitts did not support Douglas\u2019s case.It would be no surprise if her story ended here. But once again, Patricia Douglas defied the rules, first by going public about M.G.M.\u2019s wild party, then filing a lawsuit against Ross; the studio general manager, Eddie Mannix; the casting director, Vincent Conniff; and others.Coverage of Douglas\u2019s case was predictably slanted: The word \u201crape\u201d was deemed unfit to print, so front-page newspaper articles resorted to euphemisms like \u201cravished.\u201d And while her home address was widely published, M.G.M. \u2014 the world\u2019s best-known purveyor of Hollywood product and largest employer in Los Angeles County \u2014 was identified only as \u201ca local film studio.\u201dM.G.M. may have seemed its invincible self, but behind the scenes there was panic. \u201cGee whiz, Louis,\u201d fretted the media baron (and movie producer) William Randolph Hearst to Mayer in a letter about the party recently discovered in Hearst\u2019s private archive and quoted here for the first time, \u201cdo you realize how damaging that is to the whole moving picture industry and fraternity?\u201d\u201cI am going to do everything I can now to help this situation, of course,\u201d promised Hearst. \u201cBut the public will be sympathetic with a poor little extra girl.\u201dDouglas gave no interviews, letting her lawsuit speak for itself. Meanwhile M.G.M. unleashed a smear campaign: Pinkerton detectives subjected her to surveillance; pressured her doctor to falsely say she had gonorrhea; and strong-armed fellow dancers to sign statements tagging her a promiscuous drunk. (In our own era, Harvey Weinstein would follow his forebears, hiring outside help to besmirch accusers.)A Los Angeles County judge dismissed Douglas\u2019s suit. Yet again she could have given up; instead the next day she refiled in United States District Court. For the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a woman made rape a federal case by invoking its violation of her civil rights.Douglas used every legal resource available to her, but a young dancer was no match for M.G.M., which best evidence shows now bought off her mother, the court-appointed guardian in her lawsuit. Blackballed by the studios, shunned as \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d Douglas disappeared without a trace, spending the rest of her life in seclusion. \u201cWe had her killed,\u201d I was told Mannix wisecracked. So thoroughly did M.G.M. expunge Patricia Douglas from the historical record that when I first stumbled upon her story, no reference source whatsoever cited her case, while a Google search of her name yielded nothing.It\u2019s a brave new world now, though Douglas did not live to see it. Sixty-five years after her landmark lawsuit and just before her death in 2003, Douglas shrugged off her pioneering importance. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for glory,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was just to make them stop having those parties.\u201d In this sense, she achieved her aim: M.G.M. would never lure women under false pretenses to such events again.She did so in another sense, too. \u201cThe truth will out,\u201d Douglas declares in \u201cGirl 27,\u201d and with each new account of sexual assault and harassment, her example serves as a call to arms. Injustice can thrive only in silence, and finally, thankfully, explosively, the story of Patricia Douglas and others like her now resonates in Hollywood and beyond. Sometimes winning is just being heard. And sometimes being heard is just the start of much more.David Stenn is a screenwriter and author.Advertisement"}

I promise this is an honest question: Are people routinely being destroyed by the flu or something? (I mean, first I\u2019d ask, \u2018Is everyone but me simply vaccinated, and thus gifting me with herd immunity?\u2019 And so I did. My first Google search brought me to yearly C.D.C. flu-vaccine coverage statistics, and for the last four years, the percentage of flu-vaccinated adults has been in the low 40s. So... nope.) I\u2019m not a particularly healthy person \u2014 I get colds, sinus infections, etc. \u2014 but I just can\u2019t recall ever having had the flu, or at least *knowing* I had it. This seems to indicate that the flu is either 1) rare enough that it\u2019s possible for me to have been lucky forever (in which case it\u2019s fairly rare, apparently), or 2) not severe enough of an illness for me to have noticed experiencing it.Both lead me to conclude that skipping the vaccine is fine.I\u2019m just a regular idiot, presumably representing other regular idiots, amenable to changing their habits, but who haven\u2019t done so \u2014 not due to obstinance or contrarianism, but due to signals so mixed as to inspire ambivalence \u2014 and if this article can be said to have provided the \u2018why\u2019 its headline promises, unfortunately it hasn\u2019t provided the \u2018why\u2019 idiots like me need to hear:Why is the flu a big deal literally at all? \u2014 Chrystie, Los AngelesMany of those people end up in the hospital. In a good year, we might see as few as 114,000 people hospitalized with flu-associated illnesses. In a bad year, that number rises to more than 700,000. Because the flu is so common, we tend to minimize its importance. Consider the contrast with how the United States responded to Ebola a few years ago. We had a handful of infections, almost none of them contracted here. One person died. Yet some states considered travel bans, and others started quarantining people. If just 5 percent more people had been immunized, we could have probably avoided 500,000 illnesses, 230,000 medical visits and 6,000 hospitalizations.They died from the flu.Chickenpox \u2014 and the varicella virus that causes it \u2014 had long been considered a \u201cnuisance\u201d by many. When a vaccine was introduced in 1995, some questioned whether it was necessary for children, since most who got the disease were fine. Pediatricians disagreed; they had cared for the many young children who were hospitalized by the illness, and the surprising number who died \u2014 mostly infants. But only a third of adults 18 to 49 are. They can do better. If not for themselves, then for those they love.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Need to Do Because of Flaws in Computer Chips", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the world\u2019s largest tech companies have been working on fixes for these problems. But the researchers who discovered the flaws said one of them, Spectre, is not completely fixable. \u201cIt is a fundamental flaw in the way processors have been built over the last decades,\u201d said Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered these flaws.Here is a guide to what you need to know and what you should do.Both are issues with the way computer chips are designed.Meltdown affects most processors made by Intel, the company that supplies the chips for a majority of PCs and more than 90 percent of computer servers.Spectre is far more difficult for hackers to exploit. But it is even more pervasive, affecting Intel chips, microprocessors from the longtime Intel rival AMD and the many chips that use designs from the British company ARM. Your smartphone most likely contains an ARM chip.Both flaws provide hackers with a way of stealing data, including passwords and other sensitive information. If hackers manage to get software running on one of these chips, they can grab data from other software running on the same machine.This is a particular issue on cloud computing services.Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, these are services where any business or individual can rent access to computing power over the internet. On a cloud service, each server is typically shared by many different customers. By exploiting the Meltdown flaw, a hacker can just load some software onto a cloud service and then grab data from anyone else who has loaded software onto the same server.Phones and PCs are more difficult targets. Before they can exploit the chip flaws, hackers must find a way of getting their software onto your device. They could fool you into downloading an app from a smartphone app store. Or they could trick you into visiting a website that moves code onto your machine.The onus is now on consumers and businesses to install the fix on their machines.Keep your software up-to-date. That includes your operating system and apps like your web browser and antivirus software. Microsoft, Mozilla and Google have already released patches for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome to help address the problem.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs, and they carry malware.\u201dYour operating system and apps typically have a button you can click to check for software updates. For example, in Google\u2019s Chrome browser on a computer, you can click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and click Update Google Chrome. To update Windows, click the Start button and click through these buttons: Settings, Update & security, Windows Update and Check for updates. To update the Mac system, open the App Store app and check the Updates tab for the latest software.Amazon, Google and Microsoft said that they had already patched most of the of servers that underpin their cloud computing services, and that largely addresses the problem. But Amazon and Google also said customers might need to make additional changes.To share computing power with customers, cloud services offer \u201cvirtual machines.\u201d These are computers that exist only in digital form. Customers use these virtual machines to run their own software. After Amazon, Google and Microsoft update their machines, customers may have to update the operating systems running on their own virtual machines to guard against some exploits.No. The researchers who discovered Meltdown said that patching systems would slow them down by as much as 30 percent in certain situations. That could be a problem for big cloud systems.Independent software developers also ran tests on a patched version of Linux, the open-source operating system that now drives more than 30 percent of the world\u2019s servers, and saw similar slowdowns.\u201cThere are many cases where the performance impact is zero,\u201d said Andres Frome, a software developer who has tested the new code. \u201cBut if you are running something like a payment system, where a lot of small changes are made to data, it looks like there will be a significant performance impact.\u201dConsumers are less likely to be affected, and Mr. Kocher said slowdowns could dissipate over time as companies refined their patches.According to the researchers who discovered these flaws, including security experts at Google, the memory chip maker Rambus and various academic institutions, Spectre can\u2019t be completely fixed. But patches can solve the problems in some situations. Intel and Microsoft and others said the same.No, according to the researchers. But Spectre is much more difficult than Meltdown for hackers to exploit.Similar to Meltdown, Spectre can steal information from one application and share it with another. For example, an app you download from the web could steal information like passwords from other software on a computer.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert that said the only solution to the threats posed by Meltdown and Spectre would be a full replacement of the chips. But that does not seem feasible, given how many machines are involved. \u201cSpectre is going to be with us a lot longer,\u201d Mr. Kocher said.An Intel vice president, Donald Parker, is adamant that the company\u2019s chips will not need to be replaced. He said that with software patches and \u201cfirmware updates\u201d \u2014 a way of updating code on the chip itself \u2014 Intel and other companies could \u201cmitigate the issues.\u201dNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Wearing Saint Laurent jeans and a black T-shirt, he was walking the five minutes from his apartment in the West Village of Manhattan to the Soho House, where most mornings he does a few hours of emails or meetings before heading to his office a few blocks away.\u201cIt\u2019s the most gratifying feeling, to see it all come together,\u201d he said.If Mr. Huck is awake, he is working, phone in hand \u2014 even when vacationing in Greece or in the Middle East with Mrs. Kardashian West. \u201cHe could be on a camel in Egypt reciting a paragraph from the contract,\u201d said Carla Laur, a commercial endorsement agent at Creative Artists Agency who has worked on dozens of deals with Command Entertainment Group.Mr. Huck suggested his dedication arises from mistrusting his good fortune. \u201cI still have moments where I feel like someone is going to pull the rug from under me and be like, \u2018You actually have to go to law school,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt sometimes all feels like a dream.\u201dThe seeds of success were sown during a snowstorm in 2005, when he was taking a break from studying political science at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Canada, and flipping through the pages of US Weekly. The high-profile publicist Lizzie Grubman had been spotted making out with the singer John Mayer at the New York City hot spot Marquee.\u201cI went home, spent 24 hours on Google researching everything about P.R. and found Lizzie\u2019s number,\u201d Mr. Huck said.Two days later he was in Manhattan for the first time.Wearing a shiny khaki suit and square-toed Diesel shoes, Mr. Huck, positive he looked \u201cso New York,\u201d was given two minutes with Ms. Grubman\u2019s chief financial officer.\u201cI was bumbling all over the place,\u201d Mr. Huck said. \u201cI left the office and I remember doing a Myspace upload in the elevator.\u201dOne hour later, Mr. Cheban, then Ms. Grubman\u2019s partner, called him to come back in. He had a job \u2014 well, an unpaid internship.Mr. Huck abandoned his college apartment and everything in it, packed a duffel bag and stayed on friends\u2019 couches for two years. He worked putting together invitation lists and securing red-carpet press. Sean Combs\u2019s White Party in the Hamptons was one of his first big projects.When Mr. Cheban left Ms. Grubman\u2019s company to return to his own agency, Command PR, which he had started in 1999, he took Mr. Huck with him.The two quickly went from giving brands suggestions of whom they should work with to negotiating the entire deal. They also met and befriended Kim Kardashian, who was then running a successful eBay closet along with the Dash boutique chain she founded with her sisters.While they were at dinner with Kim and Kourtney Kardashian in Los Angeles, Kim said they were planning to do a reality show about their life and their families on the E! network.\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it, but Kim always had conviction,\u201d Mr. Huck said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most brilliant marketers I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d Moreover, \u201cIf I ever need advice, she\u2019s the person I call and it\u2019s straight up, tell it like it is. She\u2019s a pragmatist.\u201dStill, Mr. Huck feels elevated by the experience, and excited for the future.\u201cI want to continue to grow and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When one groom serenaded the other, a band played \u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018He\u2019 Lovely.\u201dIn total, more than 20 suppliers \u2014 including caterers, florists and planners \u2014 donated 40,000 Australian dollars, about $31,470, in services to throw the men, Michael Petchell, 28, and Benjamin Gresham, 29, a wedding just two days after the first same-sex marriages were authorized.\u201cThe industry itself is just excited,\u201d said Wendy McColl, who organized a contest for a free gay wedding, which the newlyweds won. Vendors, she said, are \u201cexcited for the gay community. It\u2019s a great change for Australia as a whole.\u201dTony Richens, who runs the gay website Eikon, said businesses \u201ccan see value down the track.\u201dOther projected benefits include spending from tourists looking to take advantage of the new law, increased consumer confidence, and business from Australian couples who would have otherwise married overseas.Hayley Fisher, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, said pent-up demand will result in a \u201cpop of weddings\u201d over the next few years. But while it was too early to tell, Dr. Fisher cautioned that the long-term economic effects are likely to be modest.\u201cThere is going to be a whole new market, but there will be a stabilization,\u201d she said.Many suppliers in the wedding industry have proactively begun changing their marketing strategies. Some, like Katsu Nojiri, who photographed Thursday\u2019s wedding, are experimenting for the first time with Google ads.Others, like Raphael Kahn, managing director of Zest, which hosts 120 weddings annually at two venues, have begun advertising in same-sex friendly wedding directories.\u201cIt definitely is good for the industry, and we certainly want to be there when it all happens,\u201d Mr. Kahn said.Business listing sites supportive of same-sex marriages say they have seen a burst of suppliers wanting to be included. Alexander Ross, the founder of the wedding guide Mr. Theodore, estimated a 200 percent increase in inquiries for listing requests since November.\u201cAustralia\u2019s not going to see weddings the way we\u2019ve seen weddings in the past,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cThat traditional structure is evolving.\u201dThose changes are affecting all aspects of the industry. Cake designers are designing new styles of wedding cakes. Celebrants are overhauling their material to adapt to the new definition of marriage.Some smaller players who have long served same-sex couples, however, now wonder if they will be overtaken by bigger players.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for the last two years at least, and I\u2019m gay and I have a partner,\u201d Mr. Nojiri, the wedding photographer, said, adding that big studios are now pursuing his usual clients.Other vendors said they had not yet seen an effect of the new legislation.\u201cI\u2019d love to say yes, it\u2019s been a boom, but I haven\u2019t seen a boom yet,\u201d said Dave Cowling, a videographer.Sophie Noble, a spokeswoman for the Grand Pacific Group, which manages five popular Sydney wedding venues, said they saw a surge in bookings from both same-sex and heterosexual couples compared to this time last year.Before the law passed last year, Mr. Petchell and Mr. Gresham considered going to New Zealand to get married, despite the financial strain.\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have any idea of what was involved in a wedding,\u201d Mr. Gresham said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us something we couldn\u2019t have afforded otherwise,\u201d he said of legalization.And it has been a boon for his social life, too.\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to four weddings already this year,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Is a Bitcoin Believer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday and happy new year!\u2022 Bitcoin\u2019s value jumped as Peter Thiel\u2019s venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency.\u2022 Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial\u2019s purchase of MoneyGram.\u2022 The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time.\u2022 Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year.\u2022 The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail.From Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Cozy With Silicon Valley, Democrats Grow Wary of Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In November 2016, Dipayan Ghosh was still reeling from Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat as he left what was supposed to be a celebration party at the Javits Convention Center in New York to attend morning meetings for his job at the Washington offices of Facebook.As Mr. Ghosh, a former White House technology adviser to President Barack Obama, made the four-hour drive, troubling questions started nagging him. What if fake news on Facebook and other sites had an impact on voters? How did the campaigns and any outsiders use ads on the site to influence the election?\u201cThe problems were much broader than we imagined, and it was not just about one tool or platform,\u201d said Mr. Ghosh, who with his co-author, Ben Scott, worked on devising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tech policy platform. \u201cIt\u2019s the profit model underlying the whole digital advertising system.\u201dMr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott are the latest members of the political party that more eagerly embraced Silicon Valley to sharply criticize the tech industry. Tech policy officials from the Obama administration and from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, as well as prominent Democrats in Congress, are demanding changes from companies they had long viewed as too important and nimble for regulations.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut has called for the Federal Trade Commission to restart an antitrust investigation into Google. And Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota has introduced a bill that would update antitrust policies to take more direct aim at the tech sector.\u201cDemocrats and progressives still strongly feel that there are shared values with Silicon Valley, but there is also a real concern over the industry\u2019s increasingly concentrated wealth and power,\u201d said Daniel Sepulveda, an ambassador and deputy assistant secretary at the State Department for the Obama administration.Karen Kornbluh, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that before the election, there was a view of \u201cinternet utopianism\u201d in government. Officials looked to the internet to solve problems in education, income inequality and global democracy. They called on tech executives to help with those initiatives and hired from Google and other tech outfits to bring their expertise into the White House.\u201cSo if you were championing the best things about the internet, it was easy to be disappointed that it was hijacked to subvert the very things it could foster,\u201d Ms. Kornbluh said. But she said few people in government were looking with a full view of how social media and other internet services posed national security, economic and other risks.Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott played a leading role in helping to create the tech-friendly policies that helped companies like Facebook and Google flourish during the Obama administration. But as more information trickled out about the role played by technology firms in Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the presidential election, they, like many Democrats, became disillusioned.\u201cWe were always careful to condition our optimism and our advocacy that this technology was potentially a double-edged sword,\u201d said Mr. Scott, who is a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America. \u201cBut I guess we didn\u2019t expect them to hit home quite as hard as it did.\u201dTitled \u201c#DigitalDeceit: Exposing the Internet Technologies of Precision Propaganda,\u201d their report argues that the interests of internet giants in helping advertisers run persuasive campaigns are aligned with those of someone looking to spread misinformation.The authors suggest a few ways to regulate the advertising technology industry, including requiring more transparency for political advertising, restricting data collection or ad targeting on political issues, and strengthening consumer protection and competition policies.Republicans have also expressed concerns about internet giants. Many on President Trump\u2019s campaign suspected that Google rigged search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, questioning the influence of high-profile supporters of hers like Eric Schmidt, who is the former executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. They were outraged by claims that Facebook manipulated its trending topics feature to push down results related to Republicans.But increasingly, the most vocal criticism is coming from Democrats. Tom Wheeler, Mr. Obama\u2019s head of the Federal Communications Commission, recently called for social media firms to make it easier to figure out how certain information goes viral, who is sending those posts and what impact that activity may have.\u201cThe internet was once heralded as the great democratizing tool,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cThat vision was smashed by the algorithms of the social media platforms.\u201dOn Friday, Twitter said it had found more than 50,000 Russian-linked accounts tweeting election-related content in the 10 weeks preceding the vote. Twitter said it would email notifications to 677,775 people in the United States who followed, retweeted or liked tweets from accounts linked to propaganda efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin.But Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott said it would be a mistake to focus solely on the Russians. They argued that the tools used by the Russians could easily be applied to other misinformation campaigns. In the same way digital advertising campaigns spend relatively small sums of money to reach millions of people, any party with an interest in swaying sentiment can gain access to reams of behavioral data on the internet to target specific audiences.Improvements in artificial intelligence for digital advertising could allow for more precise audience targeting and make the problem even worse, they said.Fundamentally, the problem is that \u201cdisinformation campaigns and legitimate advertising campaigns are effectively indistinguishable on leading internet platforms, \u201d Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Scott wrote.The changes were viewed as a response to the wave of criticism accusing the company of allowing its algorithms to promote misleading news and misinformation. On Friday, Facebook also said it would give priority to news sources that its users ranked as the most credible.Mr. Ghosh said that these changes were significant and might throw off propagators of disinformation in the short term, but that they \u2014 like advertisers \u2014 would adjust. Ultimately, the underlying business model of digital advertising hasn\u2019t changed, and it\u2019s not clear how Facebook will handle content that advertisers pay to promote.\u201cI felt like Facebook was an amazing company, and in many ways I still think it is,\u201d Mr. Ghosh said. \u201cBut something changed in me at the Javits Center.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the center at Harvard that collaborated with New America on a report about the intersection of technology, advertising and disinformation. It was the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, not the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

What that equation results in is higher rates and stable, consistent ad dollars and growth \u2014 and Facebook is looking for ad growth.\u201dMore generally, video content is \u201camong the most shared and commented-upon content on the web,\u201d said Mr. Winkler, who expects videos will now be given priority over text posts on Facebook.\u201cThere is a recognition that Facebook has been, for lack of a better word, toxic,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cIf they have ideas around what the solution to that problem is, and it happens to clear the field for Facebook-owned and -operated content, that\u2019s a happy coincidence.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that Facebook has done here that it hasn\u2019t necessarily done so much in the past is they let the ad model lead the consumer behavior versus the other way around,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the agency 360i. \u201cWatch was built with the premise that ad dollars were coming to video and it would be smart for Facebook to have a video platform.\u201dMs. Hofstetter noted that Watch could potentially benefit if publishers that had relied heavily on Facebook traffic started making fewer videos now. \u201cThis, in turn,\u201d she said, \u201ccould lead to less inventory and push advertisers towards the more premium videos within Facebook Watch.\u201dPublishers could also respond by migrating their videos to Watch, where Facebook could sell more of the pre-roll ads with sound that run before YouTube videos, said Ben Hovaness, executive director of digital activation at Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science agency.\u201cYou can think of the Watch tab as Facebook trying to have its own YouTube inside of it,\u201d he added.Right now, said Mike Dossett, who leads digital strategy at the agency RPA, most Facebook video ads \u201cshow up as a sponsored video from a brand like any other post in your feed.\u201dMr. Dossett said he anticipated a broader transformation of what appeared on Facebook as the company focused on videos that inspired the active participation of its users, like live sports.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see what that might turn into for the type of content Facebook is buying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pretty radically shift the type of video that is populating the platform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Qualcomm $1.2 Billion Over Apple Deal", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean antitrust officials hammered Qualcomm with a $1.2 billion fine on Wednesday, saying the American chip maker, whose technology underpins much of the world\u2019s mobile phone industry, had abused its dominant market position to squeeze out competitors.Those moves have prompted complaints from American technology giants that they are being unfairly targeted, but European Union officials strongly deny the accusations.In the latest decision, European regulators found that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphone chips, abused its market dominance by preventing rivals from competing in the smartphone chip market thanks to an agreement in which it paid Apple to exclusively use its chips in iPhones and iPads between 2011 and 2016.\u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals,\u201d she added. \u201cThese payments were not just reductions in price \u2014 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads.\u201dThe European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, found that Qualcomm\u2019s practices had a significant, detrimental impact on competition in the region. \u201cIt excluded rivals from the market and deprived European consumers of genuine choice and innovation,\u201d the commission said.Ms. Vestager said that she could not say how much Apple had ultimately received from Qualcomm in payments, but that it was in the \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201dShe said that internal documents reviewed as part of the inquiry showed that Apple had seriously considered using chips made by a rival manufacturer, Intel, during the period of its agreement with Qualcomm, but did not do so until the deal with Qualcomm had concluded.If Apple had introduced a smartphone using products from a different chip maker, she said, Apple not only would have lost future payments from Qualcomm, but also would have been forced to pay back some of the money it had already received.Ms. Vestager said that Apple would not face any repercussions because the inquiry had been focused on Qualcomm\u2019s practices. European regulators are also continuing a separate investigation into preliminary findings that Qualcomm sold its chips at below cost price from 2009 to 2011 to force a competitor out of the market.In a statement, Qualcomm said that it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the decision and that it would appeal the ruling to the European Union\u2019s highest court.Qualcomm has been a longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, and its trove of patents, which include ubiquitous processes such as the way applications are downloaded from smartphone app stores and the use of airplane mode, remains one of the most lucrative assets in the world of wireless networking.Founded in 1985, the company helped build the modern mobile phone industry with its technology.

{"Headline": "Moira Donegan Says She Created List of Men in Media Accused of Misconduct", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former editor at The New Republic revealed in a lengthy essay published late Wednesday that she had started the online list of men in the media industry accused of sexual harassment.The editor, Moira Donegan, said she created the Google spreadsheet in October to allow women in the media industry to put in writing what many of them had long discussed in private: the names of men to stay away from, including sexual harassers and abusers. Within hours of its creation, the list grew beyond her expectations, as women shared it with friends and co-workers who anonymously added new names and new accusations.The list, titled \u201cShitty Media Men,\u201d had real consequences, not only for several men named on the list who eventually lost their jobs, but also for Ms. Donegan. In her essay, she wrote that she lost friends and a job after the list was published. (It was not clear what job she meant. On Thursday, The New Republic, the magazine where Ms. Donegan had worked last year, said she did not leave her job there because of the spreadsheet.)The list also became a source of rabid debate in media circles.But Ms. Donegan wrote that Ms. Roiphe sent her an email in December asking her thoughts about the feminist moment. She declined to comment, Ms. Donegan said, but then heard from Harper\u2019s again this week when a fact checker emailed to say that Ms. Roiphe planned to name her in the magazine essay.The outrage aimed at Harper\u2019s on Twitter \u201cmade it seem inevitable that my identity would be exposed even before the Roiphe piece ran,\u201d Ms. Donegan wrote. \u201cAll of this was terrifying.

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy finished off last year on a firm footing, and is poised for more vigorous growth in the months to come.\u201cThe year-end is solid,\u201d said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit. Details within the report, about climbing business investment and depleted inventories, suggest more economic strength than the bare-bones headline number might indicate. \u201cIt portends well for 2018 demand,\u201d he said.Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits.\u201cThe economy\u2019s sustainable trend is around 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.The Commerce Department\u2019s report on the gross domestic product \u2014 which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent \u2014 is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit \u2014 it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December \u2014 and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves.The American economy\u2019s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.Exhilarating stock market gains have also been a worldwide phenomenon. Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out that the major stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea registered gains comparable to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, if not better.\u201cThe U.S. performance doesn\u2019t stand out relative to the rest of the world,\u201d he said.The I.M.F. warned against assuming that the current economic cycle would go on indefinitely, however, particularly given the towering debt of the United States and other countries. By borrowing so much, the government can crowd out other investors and drive up interest rates. At the same time, giant deficits crank up pressure to cut government spending on health care and housing, policing and schools. With less money to go around, spending dries up and consumer demand \u2014 the economy\u2019s primary engine \u2014 slows.\u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the current economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.\u2019s chief economist.An additional, unexpected flaw in recent United States data may come more sharply into focus this year. G.D.P. figures may have been artificially lowered over the last decade because of tax policies that encouraged domestic-based multinationals to shift billions of dollars in domestic profits overseas.The tax-code changes could muddy attempts to measure growth in 2018, and possibly 2019, though. If enough companies stop disguising significant domestic profits as foreign, G.D.P. in the United States would suddenly expand \u2014 without any underlying change in output.\u201cOver the next couple of years, I think there will be a one-time jump in the level of G.D.P. because the profits that Apple, Google, Facebook and others attributed to an offshore tax haven affiliate will now appear in their U.S. accounts,\u201d said Mr. Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.\u201cIf it happens at a larger scale, it will give the appearance of faster G.D.P. growth,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article understated the size of the American economy. Its annual output is more than $19 trillion, not $17 trillion. The article also misstated the year-over-year growth in the gross domestic product in 2015. It was 2.9 percent, not 2.6 percent. And because of an editing error, an outdated estimate was cited for last year\u2019s first-quarter growth. The Commerce Department says the annualized rate was 1.2 percent, not 1.4 percent.Advertisement"}

The rules will let internet service providers block online content, or charge websites for faster delivery to consumers, by rolling back the protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.\u201cThe rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d Michael Beckerman, the association\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday.Netflix, whose data-heavy video streams could face extra charges by internet service providers, also said it would support a legal challenge.The issue of regulating internet service providers to maintain an open internet has wound through the courts and the commission for more than a decade. The repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, attracted strong opposition.Mr. Pai has said the new rules would encourage more investment and innovation by internet service providers. He has also argued that the change would withstand any legal challenge, as it essentially restores the rules to what they were before 2015.The commission declined to comment on Friday.Democratic lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the commission\u2019s action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous bills that could replace the agency\u2019s rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States lawmakers in California, New York and Washington are also considering bills that would recreate the 2015 net- neutrality rules in those states.Public interest groups are trying to make net neutrality an issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections. They have deployed text and email campaigns meant to pressure lawmakers to support a congressional reversal of the commission\u2019s action.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going to court soon to challenge the F.C.C. and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had \u201cawakened the public.\u201dThe strong response to the repeal has also led to some safety concerns. At the commission meeting where the new rules were approved, law enforcement officials briefly cleared the room to address an unspecified security issue.Mr. Pai canceled a scheduled appearance at the tech industry\u2019s CES trade show next week. The commission declined to say why he would not attend, but has previously confirmed that he and his family had recently received threats by phone and email over the net neutrality issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Sweatcoin, a Hot Fitness App, Keep You Off the Couch?", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent evening with a windchill of 11 degrees, I made myself put down a book I had been enjoying and go out on the streets of New York instead.Accumulate 550 sweatcoins, the app beckoned, and I could snag a Fitbit Flex wearable fitness tracker. So there I was on an Arctic evening, deliberately taking a circuitous route to inflate my step count.Sweatcoin\u2019s popularity began to spike last summer. By early September, it had become the most downloaded health and fitness application in the United States on the iOS and Google Play stores combined, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. It has retained that top ranking nearly every week since.Where Sweatcoin\u2019s approach differs from others, however, is in taking its ideas from behavioral economics, the study of how psychology and emotions influence our decision-making, to motivate people to exercise more. Its rise comes as insurers and corporate wellness programs are likewise furiously trying incentives \u2014 including passing out fitness monitors \u2014 to nudge people to improve their behavior.Sweatcoin\u2019s \u201cfirst premise is that physical movement has economic value,\u201d Anton Derlyatka, a Sweatcoin co-founder, told me.Mr. Derlyatka said the app aims to overcome our human tendency to choose immediate gratification \u2014 like doughnuts or binge-watching videos \u2014 over activities like daily exercise that offer long-term benefits. By giving consumers points that can buy goodies, Sweatcoin hopes to incentivize couch potatoes to become more active.\u201cIt\u2019s a tool, a hack, to help all of us, not just the select few, to remain fit,\u201d said Oleg Fomenko, another Sweatcoin co-founder.Could the app change me, a book nerd who innately favors reading over running? Cautiously optimistic, I downloaded Sweatcoin on an iPhone over the holidays.In theory, the app awards one sweatcoin for every 1,000 outdoor steps. But I quickly learned that users often get credit for fewer steps than they expected.For one thing, Sweatcoin immediately shaves your sweatcoin earnings by 5 percent \u2014 in the fine print, the app calls it a commission \u201cto keep our lights on.\u201dFor another thing, the app counts only the steps it thinks you took outside. Bummer. I would get no credit for Zumba, spinning \u2014 or listening to music playlists and dancing around my kitchen while cooking.To help it distinguish outdoor steps, Sweatcoin collects and analyzes GPS signals and motion data from your phone. To improve accuracy, it instructs users to turn off the app\u2019s battery-saver mode and keep the app running in the background.And Sweatcoin gets bossy about it. The first time I swiped the app off, a notice popped up on my phone: \u201cYou killed me! Do not force quit me if you want to generate sweatcoins.\u201d I complied, and my battery paid the price.Frictionless this app was not.But then I noticed that Sweatcoin seemed to frequently skimp on points, too. On a recent day I went for a walk with my sister in the snowy Massachusetts countryside, the app counted less than half my steps as outdoor activity.\u201c Where are my missing 3000 steps!\u201d Ian Wynne, a sports performance consultant in Britain, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is happening a little too often.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating when you are outside and you are sure that you have taken 1,000 more steps than it claims,\u201d Mr. Wynne said. Nevertheless, he planned to continue using Sweatcoin. He regularly exercised, he said, and liked the idea of getting extra credit for the outdoor activities he was already doing.Mr. Fomenko, the Sweatcoin co-founder, told me that the app\u2019s \u201cdraconian algorithm\u201d is meant to deter cheating techniques like, say, strapping a phone to a pet dog. And that fraud-deterrence system may verify fewer steps than users expect, he said.In practice, according to the app\u2019s help section, that means the Sweatcoin algorithm typically verifies 65 percent of a user\u2019s total steps. It also means that some frequent consumer behaviors \u2014 using a protective smartphone cover, walking while connected to public Wi-Fi, walking slowly with small children \u2014 could reduce your step count.In a follow-up email, Sweatcoin\u2019s co-founders said that they would soon hire a data science team \u201cto help us improve the speed and accuracy of this algorithm.\u201d They also said they were working on a verification algorithm to count indoor activity.The current system seemed preposterous to me. What\u2019s the point of an unpredictable fitness app?Nevertheless, after about two weeks of intermittent use, I had earned 47.52 sweatcoins. I was feeling pretty good \u2014 a Fitbit could soon be mine.Then I learned that the rewards could also be fickle.Sweatcoin generates revenue by marketing other companies\u2019 products to its users. When a user redeems reward points for a product through Sweatcoin, the maker of that product pays Sweatcoin a fee.But the Fitbit and some other fitness devices on offer when I signed up had disappeared from the app before I could earn one. Now the reward choices included a workout app for 30 sweatcoins that didn\u2019t interest me \u2014 or the iPhone X for a whopping 20,000 sweatcoins. I calculated that, if I took 13,000 total steps every day, it would take me more than five years to get that iPhone.I felt like Sweatcoin, by offering rewards that seemed near impossible to obtain, could end up demotivating the very people it was trying to nudge to walk more.As a reporter who regularly covers data privacy, I also couldn\u2019t help being troubled by the possibility that the app could share or sell the trove of location and motion data it collects from users.Sweatcoin\u2019s founders said they would never do such a thing. \u201cLet me make it very, very clear,\u201d Mr. Derlyatka said, \u201cwe never, ever sell anybody\u2019s user data to any outside parties.\u201d If the fitness start-up were ever acquired by another company, however, the app\u2019s privacy policy states that \u201cpersonal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.\u201dBut the biggest downside for me was feeling like Sweatcoin\u2019s behavioral engineering cheapened important experiences. When I used the app, instead of concentrating on the friends I was walking with, I kept checking to see how close I was to being able to redeem my sweatcoins for that Fitbit.No trinket or gift card is worth that distraction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pianist of the Resistance Captures a Surprise Award", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeclaring that \u201cthe time of staying in my comfort zone is over,\u201d Mr. Levit, 30, did something that would not be in the least unusual at many kinds of concerts, but is still quite rare in classical music: He spoke directly to his audience, brought up the world outside the concert hall, and unhesitatingly took sides in a political controversy.\u201cYesterday, the greatest economic power in the world has freely elected a bigot, an opportunist, an angry and dangerous man as their new president, as their commander in chief,\u201d Mr. Levit said, going on to denounce Brexit and the rise of the far right in France and Germany.His speech caused a commotion, as audience members called out, both attacking and defending him. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should use the concert stage all the time for political statements,\u201d he said recently. \u201cBut this day was a very traumatic day for me, and I think for all of us: The night before, Donald Trump was elected president. I\u2019d had a concert in London, I took a train to Brussels, I couldn\u2019t sleep all night. And I just wrote down this speech. I felt a certain urgency.\u201dOn Wednesday, Jan. 3, his potent mixture of powerful art and political candor was given a major boost: the $300,000 Gilmore Artist Award, one of the most prestigious, and unusual, prizes in classical music. Granted to a pianist every four years, it is not a competition, so contestants do not even know they are in the running. Instead, a small, anonymous jury travels incognito to concerts around the world, searching for an artist with the potential to make a mark on music.Mr. Levit has certainly, and swiftly, made a mark. It is not easy to achieve stardom as a concert pianist these days, with competitions and the recording industry fading as launchpads. Some conservatories, including the Juilliard School, have cut back on piano students, fearing that the market is saturated. Against those odds Mr. Levit has managed to break through, thanks to a combination of his playing and his daring \u2014 as in a 2015 collaboration with the artist Marina Abramovic on a stark staging of Bach\u2019s \u201cGoldberg\u201d Variations in New York.Mr. Levit and one of his closest friends, Georg Diez, who writes about politics and culture for Der Spiegel, traveled together to the Idomeni refugee camp along the Greece-Macedonia border a couple of years ago to better understand the refugee crisis.\u201cWhat fascinates me about Igor is that art, life and politics are all one,\u201d Mr. Diez said. \u201cYou have to understand suffering, the state of the world, in order to understand music.\u201dMr. Levit was born in 1987 in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (the same city, he noted, as another, slightly younger piano star, Daniil Trifonov), where his mother was a serious pianist and his father an engineer. His family moved to Germany when he was 8 \u2014 in search, he said, of better opportunities \u2014 and settled in Hanover, where his mother still teaches at the conservatory.\u201cWould you write something for me?\u201d Mr. Levit recalled asking.He got a response a few days later. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Well, if you can find somebody to pay for it, sure, why not?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rzewski recalled. \u201cAnd he did.\u201dIn 2005, Mr. Levit won the silver prize at the Arthur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv, but more important, he caught the attention of the pianist Matti Raekallio, who served on the jury. Soon Mr. Levit, who had been having difficulty with one of his teachers in Hanover, was studying with him.\u201cI thought it a scandal that he didn\u2019t win the first prize,\u201d Mr. Raekallio said. \u201cIt was so obvious that this guy could do anything.\u201dAlong the way he was aided by moments of serendipity: In 2014 he served as a concert stand-in for two more established pianists, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Grimaud and Maurizio Pollini. Mr. Levit said that while he has always been serious about his playing, it was only in the last few years that he had found \u201ca certain kind of inner freedom\u201d as a musician.At the same time, his politics \u2014 shaped in part by the experience of being a Jewish immigrant in a Germany with a newly ascendant right flank \u2014 were beginning to evolve. The euro crisis, Occupy Wall Street and the international conflict over migration all played a role.\u201cThe refugee crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cwas a point of no return for me.\u201dWhen Mr. Levit gave his North American debut recital at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014, Alex Poots, who was then its artistic director, was taken by his musicianship and thoughtfulness. He came up with the idea of pairing him with Ms. Abramovic \u2014 but first he had to get them together to see if they had chemistry.They all went out to the Chiltern Firehouse, a chic London hotel, where the deal was sealed at a noisy, crowded bar after midnight, when Ms. Abramovic turned to Mr. Levit and asked him to play something on the piano.\u201cI said, \u2018Marina, I can\u2019t play the piano here, everyone\u2019s dancing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Levit recalled. But the owner silenced the D.J., and Mr. Levit played the final movement of Beethoven\u2019s \u201cHammerklavier\u201d Sonata.Mr. Poots said that the room fell silent: \u201cFrom a noisy bar, full of party and life, you could not hear a pin drop.\u201dThe staging of the \u201cGoldberg\u201d Variations that followed involved the audience wearing noise-blocking headphones while sitting in silence for half an hour while Mr. Levit, at a grand piano, slowly moved down a long runway. When he reached the stage, the headphones came off, and Mr. Levit played.\u201cTo focus backstage? Whatever,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cTo focus together with the audience, in the space the concert will take place? To get into the mood together? Unforgettable.\u201dEarlier this fall Mr. Levit returned to Bozar, for more Beethoven. There were no speeches this time. But Mr. Rzewski came to hear him play, and joined him and some friends for dinner afterward, where they got into a heated discussion about why the far right was making gains in Germany.Then the lovably crusty Mr. Rzewski had a musical complaint. At a recent concert of one of his works, he said, Mr. Levit had faked a tricky passage.The fakery itself did not bother Mr. Rzewski. \u201cI\u2019m the master faker,\u201d he said with a mischievous grin. The problem, he explained, was that Mr. Levit\u2019s solution made a hard section sound easy. \u201cIf a composer writes a difficult piece,\u201d he said, \u201ceverybody should understand it is difficult.\u201dMr. Levit said later that this was something he often thought about while playing, and that it had informed his take on \u201cThe People United,\u201d especially on the recording. \u201cThe only advice he gave me is that a crucial part of any piece is to hear the pianist\u2019s physical endurance,\u201d he said.Now, with the Gilmore Award, Mr. Levit will be given a chance to explore new horizons. The award \u2014 named for a businessman from Kalamazoo, Mich., who was devoted to the piano \u2014 is sometimes likened to the MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant, which also comes as a surprise to its awardees, nominated in secret. Piano competitions have of late largely failed to mint intriguing winners, but the Gilmore has favored complete artists \u2014 young but mature \u2014 like Rafal Blechacz, Kirill Gerstein, Ingrid Fliter, Piotr Anderszewski and Leif Ove Andsnes, more than flashy virtuosos.It is obvious just from looking around Mr. Levit\u2019s sparsely furnished apartment in Berlin that he is no airhead prodigy. Scores and boxed sets share space on the white shelves with books by Thomas Piketty, the economist known for his studies of income inequality; James Baldwin; and Amiri Baraka. Jascha Heifetz and David Oistrakh violin recordings are joined on his iPhone by Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar.A couple of months ago \u2014 before the Gilmore was announced, but after he learned it would be his \u2014 Mr. Levit paced nervously in the living room as his enormous Steinway grand piano went out the window.\u201cThis is awful,\u201d he said, looking at the empty space where the piano, which he had nicknamed Lulu after the willful heroine of Berg\u2019s opera, had stood.Workers wrapped it in plastic; eased it onto his terrace; hoisted it by crane over neighboring trees and past a home for refugees next door; lowered it gently to the street; and loaded it onto a truck bound for Bavaria, where Mr. Levit would play it at a recording session.The piano was given to him a decade ago, at the outset of his career, by the Trustees of Independent Opera at Sadler\u2019s Wells, to help him start out. Now Mr. Levit wanted to pass it on to someone else, and choose a new instrument of his own. It was a bittersweet moment.\u201cI grew up with this instrument,\u201d he said, as it disappeared from his apartment.Last month he sent a text message from Berlin, where a new Steinway grand was making the reverse trip by crane. \u201cMy new roommate is arriving :-),\u201d he wrote. (He named it Monk, after Thelonious.)Now he has a new instrument to adjust to, new concerts to plan, a new recording coming. The 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth, in 2020, will bring plenty of work, too, for a Beethoven specialist. He said that he was still making plans for what to do with the Gilmore prize money.But Mr. Levit also fantasizes about the kind of academic fellowship that would give him time to study, reflect \u2014 and interact. (He has little in common with the stereotypical nose-to-grindstone soloist, living alone in hotel and practice rooms.) One thing that won\u2019t change is his determination not to compartmentalize his political from his artistic self.\u201cThe idea that art is an excuse for not engaging,\u201d he said, \u201cis utterly ridiculous.\u201dFollow Michael Cooper on Twitter: @coopnytimes.Advertisement"}

It was called \u201cWhat Even Matters Anymore?\u201d and starred an increasingly unraveling M.C. played by the evening\u2019s guest host, Jessica Chastain.Ms. Chastain explained it as \u201cthe show where I tell you something our president did or said, and you have to tell me: Does it even matter anymore?\u201dA contestant played by Kate McKinnon was the first to ring in. \u201cThat\u2019s really bad,\u201d Ms. McKinnon said. \u201cThat has to matter, yes.\u201dAs a buzzer sounded, a dejected Ms. Chastain replied: \u201cActually, it does not matter. Zero consequences, and everyone just moves on.\u201dKenan Thompson, playing another contestant, answered: \u201cTo evangelicals, of course it matters. It\u2019s against everything that they stand for.\u201dThe buzzer sounded again. \u201cYou\u2019d think so, but no,\u201d Ms. Chastain said despairingly. \u201cThey say he\u2019s just repented and they forgive him, and Mike Pence is like, \u2018That\u2019s my dude.\u2019\u201dThe game went on, with Ms. Chastain\u2019s character drifting further into delirium and eventually asking the three players to write down anything they thought would matter or lead to consequences for President Trump. The contestants came back with scenarios like \u201cTrump Punches Pope,\u201d \u201cHe Cancels Olympics Because Flags Are \u2018Gay,\u2019\u201d and \u201cSex Tape With Don Jr.\u201dWrong again, Ms. Chastain countered for each: \u201cBecause nothing truly matters \u2014 none of it matters.\u201dPresident Trump maintains that any deal he signs must include a border wall, and he\u2019s been consistent that it must be a solid, physical wall with some parts see-through, some parts fence and some parts empty spaces that just operate on the honor system. And it will be paid for by Mexico with U.S. taxpayer money.Playing the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Beck Bennett then came to the podium to discuss \u201chow not-fat the president is.\u201d Mr. Bennett said his \u201cunbiased, 100 percent accurate health assessment\u201d had found that President Trump weighed \u201ca very svelte 239 pounds\u201d with \u201ca gorgeous, 44-inch Coke-bottle waist.\u201d The president is \u201c75 inches\u201d tall (or 6-foot-3, which is accurate), Mr. Bennett said, \u201cwith legs that \u2014 well, they seem to go on forever,\u201d and he wears a size 12 shoe, \u201cso you can fill in the blanks there.\u201dIn this week\u2019s other memorable moments:\u201cThis week, I was finally able to Google \u2018Stormy Daniels\u2019 on my work computer,\u201d said Colin Jost, the co-anchor.He continued:In an interview from 2011, porn star Stormy Daniels said that while she was having an affair with Donald Trump, he told her she was beautiful and smart, just like his daughter. Which is somehow the grossest thing anyone has ever said to Stormy Daniels. I just love watching Mike Pence through all of this. He\u2019s a button-down, conservative Christian. Now he\u2019s going to go ride-or-die with Caligula. At this point, Pence would probably be more comfortable as a judge on \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u2019\u201dMr. Jost\u2019s co-anchor, Michael Che, added:The worst part about that Stormy Daniels story was that it was so lame. An old rich dude cheated on his wife with a porn star. Clutch my pearls. I thought we\u2019d at least get some freaky details out of it. I mean, Donald Trump grabs women by the vagina as his opener. So, his actual sex must be insane, right? But the craziest thing we got is that he was spanked with a magazine and he\u2019s afraid of sharks. Well, of course he\u2019s afraid of sharks \u2014 the man has a body of a seal.\u201dCecily Strong portrayed Ms. Clifford in a deskside segment on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d in which Mr. Jost introduced her as an \u201cunlikely ally for critics of Donald Trump.\u201dMs. Strong agreed. \u201cI\u2019m like a liberal hero,\u201d she said, \u201ceven though I\u2019m a Republican porn star who loves Sarah Palin. Right? Things are so bad now, there are so many women just desperately trying to figure out how to be empowered by me. And the best they can say is that I\u2019m a female director.\u201dShe added: \u201cNow, I get it, that I\u2019m not what these people envisioned their hero would look like. But guess what, America? I\u2019m the hero you deserve right now.\u201dMs. Bryant said she had \u201cp-hats\u201d for the occasion, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t say the real word because it\u2019s just one of those many words that only the president can use.\u201dHer co-star Leslie Jones strode out and said, \u201cYou mean pussy hats?\u201dLater, Melissa Villase\u00f1or explained why she was dressing up for the march: \u201cLook, I\u2019m a proud feminist, but I\u2019m still trying to catch a husband,\u201d she said.If Ms. McKinnon can play Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, Theresa May, Angela Merkel, Mika Brzezinski, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jeff Sessions, then why not Robert S.

Nobody Won.", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Google Lunar X Prize competition, which has spent the past decade dangling a $20 million prize for the first privately financed venture to make it to the moon, came to a quiet end on Tuesday. Not with the ka-boom of a rocket launch or a winner beaming photos back from the lunar surface, but with a tweet and a statement.Although they were disappointed to not have a winner, the organizers maintained that the competition was a success.\u201cAs a result of this competition, we have sparked the conversation and changed expectations with regard to who can land on the moon. Many now believe it\u2019s no longer the sole purview of a few government agencies, but now may be achieved by small teams of entrepreneurs, engineers, and innovators from around the world,\u201d said a statement from Peter H. Diamandis, the foundation\u2019s founder and executive chairman, and Marcus Shingles, the chief executive.The foundation raised the possibility of a new sponsor or continuing the competition without any cash prizes.At the end of last year, SpaceIL and TeamIndus both came up short in trying to raise needed financing. The parent company of the Hakuto team had the money \u2014 in December, it announced it had obtained $90 million in investment \u2014 but it was counting on piggybacking on TeamIndus\u2019s lander to get to the moon. Moon Express also has the money it needs, but it has yet to have the ribbon-cutting on the new facility where it will assemble its lander.

{"Headline": "Trump and Davos: Not Exactly Best Friends, but Not Enemies Either", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavos MemoDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 When President Trump arrived on Thursday at the conference center where the world\u2019s financial and political elite have been meeting, onlookers crowded a balcony and craned their heads to see the leader who has challenged the very international order that Davos represents. At first, it was quiet. Then someone called out a question.\u201cAre you going to be treated well?\u201d he was asked.\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Mr. Trump replied.The reverse question was unasked but hung in the air: How was he going to treat them?If he was not exactly entering the lion\u2019s den, it was nonetheless a fraught moment for both sides as the America First president ventured into the lair of the we-are-the-world banking titans, corporate magnates and international leaders who have spent decades preaching the virtues of global integration.Rather than confrontation, both sides labored for conciliation, at least to a point. For one afternoon and evening, at least, Mr. Trump threw no protectionist grenades and even broached the possibility, however remote, that he would re-enter a Pacific trade agreement that he scrapped last year, if it were renegotiated. For its part, the Davos crowd welcomed its top critic with a reception and warm words.The mood was strikingly different from a year ago, when Mr. Trump was about to take office and the globalists meeting in this mountaintop getaway reeled in shock, panicked that his campaign promises meant the end of the movement they had nurtured for decades.A year later, many of the business and political elites remain dismissive of him, privately rolling eyes and using words like \u201cmadman,\u201d but there was excitement about economic growth, and the tax cuts and regulatory rollback he has ushered in.\u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s here to be congratulated by the billionaires of Davos or to scold them on behalf of the people who elected him,\u201d said Robert A. Johnson, president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a research institution in New York. \u201cHe will act like he\u2019s doing both.\u201dAsked his message for Davos, Mr. Trump said: \u201cThe real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace, and I think that\u2019s the message. It\u2019s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment, and today has been a very exciting day.\u201dDavos has never encountered anyone quite like Mr. Trump. For one week each year, this ski town is transformed into a festival of deal-making capitalism, international wonkery, late-night parties and earnest save-the-world panel discussions. Heads of state, corporate chieftains, policymakers and celebrities slip and slide along icy streets to stop in glass-enclosed, tech-heavy spaces set up by countries like India and South Africa and companies like Facebook and Google along the Promenade, the main drag.At times, the tensions of the outside world follow them here. The Ukrainians were chagrined to discover this year that the space they rented at Promenade 73 turned out to be right across the street from Russia House at Promenade 72. Grim jokes ensued about the Russians crossing the road to take over a room in Ukraine House.Unlike other visitors, Mr. Trump did not wander the pavilions. He attended a reception in his honor by the forum, and then was host at a dinner for about 15 chief executives from firms like Siemens, Nokia, Nestle, HSBC, Anheuser-Busch and Bayer.As the executives tucked into grilled beef tenderloin or fried Swiss pikeperch with purple carrot pur\u00e9e, Mr. Trump flattered them as \u201csome of the greatest business leaders in the world\u201d and invited them to talk about their businesses, much as he does at cabinet meetings back home. Like his cabinet secretaries, many of the guests volunteered praise of the president and gratitude for his efforts to cut taxes and regulation.The greeting did not surprise everyone. \u201cTrump made a Christmas gift to everyone with those tax rebates,\u201d said Charles-Edouard Bou\u00e9e, chief executive of Roland Berger, a global consultancy with offices in Shanghai and Munich.Even leaders with grievances against the Trump administration seemed intent on playing up to him.An aide to Mr. Trump who arrived before him expressed astonishment that he was being received so warmly by people he had criticized so harshly. But outside the president\u2019s earshot, there was still plenty of skepticism and concern.At a separate dinner on Thursday night, George Soros, the liberal financial trader and philanthropist, called Mr. Trump the vanguard of a new wave of authoritarian rulers that threatens open society.\u201cThe survival of our entire civilization is at stake,\u201d said Mr. Soros, while pointing a finger at \u201cthe rise of leaders like Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.\u201dIn the days before Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival, the leaders of India, Canada, France and Germany used a series of high-profile speeches to mount an aggressive defense of the global trading system, while other officials worried that Mr. Trump and other nationalists posed grave risks.\u201cThe whole world is concerned that the United States is disengaging from the global trade arena,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstrom, trade minister for the European Union. \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned.\u201dBut as he has on immigration in recent days, Mr. Trump toggled between being hard-line and accommodating. In an interview with CNBC to be aired on Friday before his speech, Mr. Trump raised the possibility of rejoining the Pacific partnership, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama but never submitted to Congress amid bipartisan opposition.\u201cI would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe deal was terrible; the way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to be written off by some ill-judged words,\u201d said Nicky Newton-King, chief executive of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. \u201cOur exchange is regarded as world class. We\u2019re completely proud of what we\u2019re able to do in one of these countries the president is so dismissive of.\u201dLynette Wallworth, a virtual reality filmmaker from Australia who has traveled the world to introduce viewers to diverse cultures, expressed hope that Mr. Trump would use his time here to absorb challenging points of view.\u201cHe seems to talk about barriers,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs to listen to the people who are gathered here, who are trying to make an inclusive world.\u201dTolu Oni, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, asked if Mr. Trump was capable of absorbing opinions that conflict with his preconceptions.\u201cI wonder what he will get from this,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that in coming here, there is some degree of learning that national interests are not necessarily in contradiction with being a responsible global citizen.\u201dElisabeth Bumiller, Keith Bradsher and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Warn of Hits From Tax Cuts. Don\u2019t Be Fooled.", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt will sound like bad news.Over the next few weeks, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, household names including Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson, are likely to warn that their financial results will be severely dented, if not altogether wiped out, by huge tax bills that they have to pay to the Internal Revenue Service.Don\u2019t be fooled.The big one-time losses are a prelude to even bigger profits \u2014 a paradox caused by the tax cuts that recently zoomed through Congress and that largely benefit corporations.A couple of provisions in the tax package are prompting many companies \u2014 those based in the United States as well as some foreign corporations with big American presences \u2014 to pay the taxman while anticipating huge savings for decades to come.Until now, companies generally didn\u2019t have to pay federal income taxes on such earnings, at least not immediately, as long as those profits stayed overseas. But if the companies brought the money back to the United States, they would face a 35 percent tax rate (minus whatever they had already paid tax collectors in other countries).American companies currently attribute about $2.8 trillion to their overseas units. The new law requires them to bring the money back to the United States \u2014 or to \u201crepatriate\u201d it \u2014 but at reduced tax rates as low as 8 percent.The phenomenon is likely to be on display in the next few weeks, as companies report financial results that look surprisingly weak because of the tax law.Why? Because the repatriation provision is part of a package likely to deliver vastly larger long-term savings for the world\u2019s biggest multinationals. Mr. Zion estimates the benefit from the repatriation tax break alone could be worth $500 billion to companies compared with the old law \u2014 more than double what they\u2019re paying upfront.And so profit warnings that normally would leave investors shuddering are instead being taken in stride.Apple might eventually fork over about $33 billion to the I.R.S. when those earnings come back to America, Mr. Zion said. But, in yet another oddity caused by the tax package, the company might actually record a one-time benefit to its profits.That\u2019s because, over the years, Apple has set aside money, at least in accounting terms, to cover the potential taxes it might owe on its offshore earnings. But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.Going forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.Under the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)The new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.It is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.In Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.Credit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.Several companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain. They included the German automakers BMW and Daimler, which both said the law would provide a temporary benefit of more than $1 billion.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning to Fool Our Algorithmic Spies", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn a series of studies published in 2012, two psychologists, Ara Norenzayan and Will Gervais, set out to test a simple question: When people think about God, do they feel or act as if they are being monitored? Subjects of varying religiosity were primed to think about God, then asked to complete self-evaluations based on statements like \u201cI am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me\u201d and \u201cNo matter whom I\u2019m talking to, I\u2019m always a good listener.\u201d Results, researchers said, were consistent with what they call the \u201csupernatural-monitoring hypothesis\u201d \u2014 that is, that \u201cthinking of God triggers the same social cognitive processes that are activated by real-time social surveillance.\u201d A sense that you\u2019re being seen \u2014 whether by a fellow human or by a supreme consciousness from which no thought can be withheld \u2014 does seem to change how you see yourself as well as how you behave.Since 2012, online platforms have moved to the center of hundreds of millions more lives, popularizing their particular brands of social surveillance. Services like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are inextricably tied to the experience of being monitored by others, which, if it doesn\u2019t always produce \u201cprosocial\u201d behavior in the broad psychological sense, seems to have encouraged behaviors useful to the platforms themselves \u2014 activity and growth. These businesses serve many different purposes, but the one thing they have in common is that they have figured out new ways to monetize the powerful twin sensations of seeing and being seen by others.But alongside this exhilarating, debilitating, empowering and terrifying human spectacle, these sites have also fostered \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a new but not entirely unfamiliar feeling, that of being watched from above. There is little about the ruthless, marketlike social-media experience that primes you to think about any sort of god. But there are, I\u2019ve noticed, persistent and ever-more-obvious experiences that remind you of another kind of higher power: the automated systems on which these platforms run.Services that used to depend on asking me questions \u2014 What do you like? Whom do you want to follow? \u2014 have started making more assumptions based on my behavior. I\u2019m reminded that my actions are being recorded and factored into my experience when I am greeted on Twitter by a series of recommendations derived, apparently, from things I\u2019ve liked, looked at or reposted. I\u2019m implicitly prompted to think about algorithmic surveillance when, the day after I wasted a few minutes scrolling through a cycling publication\u2019s account, my Instagram app floods my Explore tab with photos of mountain bikes. Weeks after tapping an unfamiliar name on Facebook and scrolling through the recent posts \u2014 a postmarriage surname change, a new profile photo \u2014 this person, a former acquaintance I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, is given the same feed placement as current close friends.These experiences manifest beyond social networks as well. Searches for holiday gifts haunt web browsing, as Amazon \u201cretargeting\u201d ads place the products I looked at, briefly \u2014 a thermos, headphones, binoculars \u2014 next to, above and in the middle of news articles. They find their way back over the walls too, placing reminders of my recorded behavior in my Instagram feed \u2014 ads that say, \u201cWe\u2019d like you to buy running gear,\u201d not quite so loudly as they say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got eyes everywhere.\u201dOf course, this is the deal we have entered into with such services: our data for their products. That this surveillance is happening is obvious, even if the ways we\u2019re reminded of it can still be jarring. Spotify, the music-streaming service, recently began an ad campaign that mined and cheekily broadcast actual individual listening habits: \u201cDear person who played \u2018Sorry\u2019 42 times on Valentine\u2019s Day: What did you do?\u201d; \u201cTo the person in NoLIta who started listening to holiday music way back in June: You really jingle all the way, huh?\u201d The company was boldly showing off its intimate knowledge of current users in an effort to gain new ones \u2014 a harmlessly creepy example of a strategy that could easily backfire.For example, I thought better of searching for a friend with whom I had lost touch, knowing that his posts would then climb the ladder of my Facebook feed, turning a flash of guilt into a persistent reminder of my failure. For work, I sometimes need to watch videos made by a range of toxic, hateful or just unappealing vloggers, and I found that I\u2019d avoid watching them on my phone, waiting instead until I could get to my laptop, where I could more quickly and totally log out, go incognito and avoid filling my future YouTube recommendations with bile. During the holidays, I shopped in anonymous tabs, assuming that gifts could be revealed during an idle Instagram scroll on the couch.As with performing on social media for friends, family or co-workers \u2014 posting your best pictures, documenting your most exciting activities or professionally marketing yourself \u2014 these individually tiny elisions weren\u2019t entirely honest. But unlike these social displays, they were first and foremost intentionally deceptive, and they were rooted in antagonism.Believers in an omniscient God tend to assume that nothing can truly be hidden, including doubt. Pascal\u2019s Wager, for example, which supposes that believing in God is simply a safer bet against even vanishingly narrow odds of eternal damnation, leans on a potentially fatal premise: Surely any conceivable God would know you\u2019re just making a bet? But we ascribe no such powers to algorithms. Machine surveillance can be fooled in small ways and big ones: by the creation of blacked-out spaces, the introduction of strategically tainted data and the performance of a particular version of the self.Social platforms also expect faith from their users: that data will be used responsibly, that at least some forms of privacy among people will be respected. But the flashing reminders of the automatic surveillance on which they are increasingly built can undermine those expectations and remind us instead of our ability to withdraw. Residents in neighborhoods that have been flooded by drivers following directions from Waze \u2014 which is owned by Google and supplies data to for Google Maps \u2014 have resorted to filing false accident reports to divert drivers. Waze has sought to curb these reports, but in so doing, it has come across less as omniscient than unthinking and defensive \u2014 and above all, corporate. Knowing that our maps were watching us produced individual acts of defiance that amounted to collective acts of resistance.Increased awareness of automated surveillance, in other words, is most effective at demystifying the systems doing the watching, not reifying their wisdom and authority. It clarifies our relationships with them: each recommendation or subtle change reminds us not only that we\u2019re being watched, but also that we\u2019ve consented to it. And such awareness will also be a necessity should one or all of these platforms \u2014 through more brazen exploitation, calamitous hacking or even greater sharing with governments \u2014 cause us to well and truly lose faith. They may aspire to divine levels of omniscience, but they risk driving away their followers in the process.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

There was no amoral approach to science, Mr. Lehrer reminded us. Seeing science and the tools and connections it provides as a good in itself is profoundly dangerous and wrong.Founded by young computer engineers, Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley companies have been happy to view their powerful inventions as neutral platforms. Once the posts are up, who cares where they come down? These companies have converted an engineer\u2019s disregard for real-world outcomes into a libertarian ideology that belittles the harms that stem from their platforms and rejects rules and regulations meant to prevent those harms.The public faces the unsatisfying question: Is it better to suffer an engineer\u2019s neglect or an engineer\u2019s concern?Since Facebook\u2019s earliest days, Mr. Zuckerberg has been fascinated by the power to understand and manipulate users by applying algorithms to the data it collects. In 2005, speaking at Stanford, he described how he and a friend were \u201cseeing if we could use the information that we had to compute who we thought were going to be in relationships. So, we tested this about a week later, and we realized that we had over a third chance of predicting whether two people were going to be in a relationship a week from now.\u201d Through this deep knowledge of its users, Mr. Zuckerberg explained, Facebook could determine \u201cwhat actually matters to each person on a more granular level.\u201d\u201cWhen people spend a lot of time passively consuming information \u2014 reading but not interacting with people \u2014 they report feeling worse afterward,\u201d the company said. By contrast, \u201cactively interacting with people \u2014 especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions \u2014 is linked to improvements in well-being.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg says Facebook will be steering users to healthier interactions. \u201cI expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,\u201d he wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cBut I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable. And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.\u201dThe other was \u201cpromoting equality,\u201d which they defined as \u201cmaking sure everyone has access to these opportunities \u2014 regardless of the nation, families or circumstances they are born into.\u201d Often, \u201caccess\u201d appears to mean relying on the internet to provide an education or work opportunity. Connecting people is what keeps society churning, improving. \u201cFor every 10 people who gain internet access, about one person is lifted out of poverty and about one new job is created,\u201d they wrote.Turns out, an enlightened, socially engaged Facebook has a similar outlook as the amoral, audience-seeking Facebook. Each sees connecting online as key to the good life.In other words, don\u2019t count on Facebook to disrupt Facebook any time soon.Noam Cohen is the author of \u201cThe Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball.\u201dI invite you to join me on Twitter, @noamcohen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is \u2018Chain Migration\u2019? Here\u2019s the Controversy Behind It", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe term itself has become a point of contention. Democrats and immigration advocates claim it is a pejorative phrase that demeans recent arrivals. Republicans argue it\u2019s a useful shorthand for family sponsorship.Below is a look at the facts behind recent family/chain immigration patterns, the underlying federal policies that govern them, and a look at how use of the phrase \u201cchain migration\u201d itself has very suddenly become a contentious and polarizing part of the debate.How does the sponsorship process work?After a petition is filed and approved, would-be immigrants are essentially handed a ticket number called a \u201cpriority date\u201d and can only apply for a green card when the State Department calls their number.Depending on the country of origin, a sponsor\u2019s immigration status and the applicant\u2019s relationship to their sponsor, the waiting period can last from months to decades.What is the relationship between \u201cchain migration\u201d and DACA? To apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and must have proof of having arrived in the United States before age 16.If Dreamers are given a pathway to citizenship through legislation, they in turn could sponsor their parents for legal status as well. But those who entered the United States illegally are required to leave the country and wait three or 10 years before applying for an immigration visa. That\u2019s \u201ca significant barrier most would be unlikely to contemplate,\u201d according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.Where does chain migration come in?Why the sudden uptick?Democrats, meanwhile, prefer the term \u201cfamily reunification\u201d and say the practice is a reflection of American values.Leo Chavez, a professor at the University of California at Irvine who studies media representations of immigration, said he had seldom heard \u201dchain migration\u201d in public discourse until the debate over immigration intensified in the last few months.\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to sway public opinion,\u201d Mr. Chavez said, adding that the once-scholarly term has taken on negative connotations as \u201cif it\u2019s a conspiracy, a plot, a threat to the changing demographics.\u201dIt is not unlike \u201canchor baby,\u201d \u201cthe browning of America\u201d or even \u201cDreamers,\u201d on the flip side, Mr. Chavez said. Such phrases have become more common in the ongoing debate about \u201chow you talk about who are citizens, who are members of the nation and who can become Americans. It\u2019s never a settled question. It hasn\u2019t been for 200 years and it isn\u2019t now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s not the building itself, it\u2019s not the site of your first memories or your relatives. It\u2019s not the place where, as the poet Robert Frost wrote, \u201cwhen you have to go there, they have to take you in.\u201dFor me at least \u2014 and perhaps for many of you who have also called many places home \u2014 it\u2019s both more expansive and more specific.Home is knowing where to buy groceries without the help of Google Maps.Home is knowing you have friends who will bring your children home from birthday parties.Home is running into people you know at the park on a sunny afternoon.Home is the little tip a neighbor tells you about the vacation spot that\u2019s off the radar. Or the can\u2019t-be-missed restaurant.And perhaps most of all, it\u2019s realizing you\u2019ve found your people, that you\u2019ve shared a moment or a deeper conversation about something difficult with someone you only met after you moved.Home \u2014 for me, for us, for my family \u2014 is something that exists in many forms and best of all, it\u2019s something that can be learned and experienced anywhere.As Herman Hesse put it: \u201cBut where paths that have an affinity for each other intersect, the whole world looks like home, for a time.\u201dAnd for now, with great appreciation, those intersections are here.I\u2019ll share more in future newsletters about what that means in the coming year for the community of readers and journalists that we\u2019re still building, together. But for now, just know that I\u2019m happy to be back, and back to work.Because let\u2019s be honest: Even though it\u2019s summer, there\u2019s a lot to discuss and a lot of ground to cover.Here are a few items to get the conversation started.______And this quote from a prominent historian: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the presidency completely and utterly transformed in a way I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen since before the Civil War.\u201d______The maps of Australia\u2019s Indigenous languages are a fascinating window into the nation\u2019s history and present.______Two of this year\u2019s locations are in Australia, but the real innovation for 2018 involved a contest that will send one lucky traveler to every single one of the 52.______News and PerspectiveHungry?

Today, the answer is the former.The seed entry for this puzzle was CAVE (AT). After searching for other words that changed significantly in both meaning and pronunciation when AT was appended, I was surprised to find just five others (SAD and WOMB were the other two). So I thought I had a fairly tight theme and continued.My initial submission had BUMPER CARAT in the grid, but cluing it was problematic. I was asked to replace it and to liven up the grid. Only about half of my submitted clues survived the editing process. Will and team definitely polished it up. I thought my clue for MAMMOTH CAVEAT (Proviso about extinct elephants?) was pretty good, but theirs is much funnier.I enjoyed creating this puzzle and hope you had fun solving it.Welcome and congratulations, Ms. Wienberg.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Struggling Artist at 86", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike most struggling artists, Harry Bertschmann is hoping to be discovered. Unlike them, he already has a pedigree: he has shown his work alongside Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell while they were still alive and in their prime. In 1958, a large Bertschmann canvas was featured in the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh, a rarefied achievement for any artist, let alone one in his mid-20s. Since then, Mr. Bertschmann has painted or drawn nearly every day of his adult life, producing a body of work that has been praised by some of the art world\u2019s foremost tastemakers. Yet he has remained virtually unknown.\u201cI had to make money,\u201d Mr. Bertschmann, 86, said one morning in late November as he sat at the dining table of his light-filled, art-filled apartment-studio near the South Street Seaport. And he did, working as a freelance graphic designer creating logos, packaging and advertising for brands like Pond\u2019s cold cream and Bufferin. His success at his day job ensured that he wasn\u2019t hungry, and while he has produced thousands (he has no idea how many thousands) of fine-art paintings, drawings and collages in wildly varied styles, he never persistently sought gallery representation.Over the years there were some exhibitions and acquisitions, notably a 140-work retrospective in 1997 of both his commercial and fine art in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Bertschmann was born and raised. But these accomplishments never amounted to a self-sustaining fine art career. As he reached his 80s, humility and obscurity started getting old, and costly.Now the Bertschmanns find themselves in a tenuous financial position. Mr. Bertschmann no longer does much graphic design, and Mrs. Bertschmann recently retired as the executive director of the Huguenot Society of America. She said that they have been \u201csuffering financially.\u201d Despite living in a lofty one-bedroom apartment near the South Street Seaport, they are retired renters who will not benefit from the gentrification of the neighborhood.On the bright side, she added, a man named Peter Hastings Falk had arranged for a couple of gallery owners to visit in December.Mr. Bertschmann is an elfin man with comely features and a warm smile, Mrs. Bertschmann a strikingly beautiful woman of 85. Last month, both of them were neatly dressed in similar gray V-neck sweaters as they nervously prepared their apartment for the gallerists\u2019 visit. He rarely fails to apologize for what he calls the mess in the living room, where his artwork rests against walls and sits on and in numerous metal cabinets. But the space isn\u2019t remotely untidy. His wife explains his fastidiousness by pointing out, \u201cHe\u2019s Swiss.\u201dLong before the arrival of Art Basel, the international art fair, Mr. Bertschmann\u2019s hometown was an ideal city for a budding artist, with world-class museums, a great university and, most important, an express train that reached Paris in under three hours. \u201cWe would hop on the train,\u201d Mr. Bertschmann recalled. \u201cI was 16 or 17. These trips to Paris were very enlightening for me.\u201d Right after World War II, he said, \u201ceverybody was poor, and along the Seine there were booths, and you saw such fabulous stuff.\u201d He showed off four 18th-century Japanese prints and an African bronze that he\u2019d bought back then for next to nothing.\u201cImagine being that age,\u201d Mrs. Bertschmann said, \u201cand having a taste for those things.\u201dIn 1962 she persuaded Mr. Bertschmann that as an artist, he, too, should come to New York. When her marriage finally ended, her husband moved out of the duplex, and in 1966 she married Mr. Bertschmann \u2014 \u201cmy true love,\u201d she said. They stayed in the duplex for four decades, until about 15 years ago, when the landlord died and their rent (then $3,000 a month) was about to jump.Now they face a similar fate with their current apartment. The once-modest Seaport neighborhood is getting fancier. The Best Western a few doors down is transforming into a Cipriani boutique hotel. With both of them on fixed incomes and with no retirement plans to speak of, their high monthly rent, Mrs. Bertschmann said, has them \u201changing by a string.\u201dOf course, at some point they should have bought an apartment, an option that Mrs. Bertschmann said they considered \u201cso many times.\u201d But they were busy leading creative, exhilarating New York lives. They spent 40 years in an affordable duplex in the most cinematic part of the West Village, so why move? They raised a daughter (Isabelle Kellogg, now a luxury marketer with a grown daughter of her own) and had interesting friends and neighbors, like an editor who worked with Diana Vreeland at Vogue and later Graydon Carter, the longtime Vanity Fair editor, who bought the townhouse next door. Every summer they took a hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps and visited Mr. Bertschmann\u2019s family in Basel.But now their need to pay the bills is overshadowing even their desire for Mr. Bertschmann\u2019s work to get its due. He still draws every day, but he no longer paints. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the money for art supplies,\u201d Mrs. Bertschmann said.Then in November, Mr. Falk told him about Christy and Chester Murray, lifelong collectors and neophyte gallerists. One night about five years ago, a friend and some wine persuaded the Murrays, who had recently retired, to buy a store in Quogue, on the East End of Long Island, and turn it into an art gallery. Mr. Falk thought their taste for New York School painters might draw them to Mr. Bertschmann\u2019s work.The Murrays spent more than two hours there, and left feeling transported. \u201cWe walked in thinking that maybe Harry would be part of a group show,\u201d Christy Murray said, \u201cand left planning a solo show during some of the busiest weeks of the summer.\u201dThe Bertschmanns were almost afraid to believe that their hoped-for lifeline had arrived, but they allowed themselves to celebrate with a bottle of wine. \u201cIt was so wonderful to meet them and to have them be so interested in everything that Harry had done,\u201d Mrs. Bertschmann said. \u201cThey just kept looking and looking.\u201d She called the visit \u201cflabbergasting\u201d and \u201cmagical.\u201d Even Mr. Bertschmann, always affable but rarely effusive \u2014 again, he\u2019s Swiss \u2014 was visibly happy. Could it really be true that all his years of \u201cpainting like a demon possessed,\u201d as Mr. Falk put it, could finally be rewarded?While Mr. Falk views the big picture, Mr. Bertschmann trains his eye on the sketch pad directly in front of him. Every day without fail, he continues to put pencil to paper with such single-minded focus that he doesn\u2019t see his own career arc, or plan for the future. The other day, a guest raised the subject of where he hoped his body of work would end up after he was gone. He appeared genuinely stumped. \u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never given it a thought.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a museum that recently acquired a Harry Bertschmann travel poster for its permanent collection.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Steve Wynn is accused by several former employees of sexual misconduct over the years.\u2022 What he told C.E.O.s in Davos about Nafta and economic growth.\u2022 What\u2019s happening at Dell?Shares of Wynn Resorts tumbled almost 9 percent in afternoon trading after a report of sexual misconduct by its founder and chief executive.From the article by Alexandra Berzon, Chris Kirkham, Elizabeth Bernstein and Kate O\u2019Keeffe:Former employees said they sometimes entered fake appointments in the books to help other female workers get around a request for services in Mr. Wynn\u2019s office or arranged for others to pose as assistants so they wouldn\u2019t be alone with him. They told of female employees hiding in the bathroom or back rooms when they learned he was on the way to the salon.\u201cEverybody was petrified,\u201d said Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the salon. Mr. Nielsen said he and others repeatedly told high-level company executives that Mr. Wynn\u2019s sexual advances were causing a problem, but \u201cnobody was there to help us.\u201dMr. Wynn told the WSJ, \u201cThe idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous\u201d and blamed his ex-wife, Elaine, of instigating the investigation. Ms. Wynn disputed that assertion.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIn a surprise decision, the United States International Trade Commission struck down a Commerce Department recommendation to place steep duties on imported Canadian jets.From the NYT\u2019s Ana Swanson:\u201cThe case was brought by Boeing, which accused the Canadian jet maker Bombardier of subsidizing its products and selling them at unfairly low prices in the United States in violation of American trade rules.\u201d\u201dThe Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries aircraft. But the trade commission, a quasi-judicial body of trade experts, disagreed.As is its usual practice, the commission did not explain the factors behind its decision.Critics cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFor the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency, to unanimously reject the arguments of America\u2019s largest exporter and the Trump administration is a stunning rebuke. It suggests that President Donald Trump may find it as hard to back up some of his tough trade talk as trying to dismantle Obamacare and build a wall on the Mexican border.\u201cFor Boeing, the verdict will redouble the pressure it faces to strike a deal with Embraer, whose E-jet family competes head-on with Bombardier.\u201dPresident Trump used his speech to set out his economic record, while seeking to reconcile his \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionist stance with a call for free trade and foreign investment.Mr. Trump took credit for the strong American economy, which he said had followed \u201cyears of stagnation.\u201d He also pointed to rising stock prices, improving consumer and business confidence, and job growth. Growth in gross domestic product since he took office, however, is similar to that of 2014 and 2015.Addressing the World Economic Forum, the Alpine conclave of business and political elites that American presidents have usually shunned, Mr. Trump said he would \u201calways put America first, just as the leaders of other countries should put their countries first.\u201d\u201cBut America first does not mean America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the United States grows, so does the world.\u201dMr. Trump \u2014 never invited when he was a businessman \u2014 also delivered the message that the United States was open for business, appealing for international investment.But he hit one of his favorite themes: that the global free trade regime has often treated the United States unjustly.\u201cWe cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal, because in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.\u201dMr. Trump specifically mentioned theft of intellectual property and central government direction of economies. In the past, he has linked those practices with China, but on Friday he did not do so.\u2014Richard Perez-PenaCritics\u2019 cornerRob Cox and Una Galani of Breakingviews:\u201cWhat was new in Trump\u2019s Davos appearance aside from the style was the framing of his administration\u2019s approach to trade and the like. Rather than bashing the Chinese for stealing American jobs, he stuck to larger principles of fairness. The United States \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual-property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a rational argument \u2013 and hints at something like leadership.\u201dWhat Salesforce C.E.O. Marc Benioff tweeted after the speech:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHe also spoke openly about the White House\u2019s internal debate about Nafta, and whether he would need to rip it up and start over.Our colleague Peter Goodman told us more about the president\u2019s dinner with European business leaders last night:The message was that the U.S. is open for business and eager to welcome fresh investment. Attendees included the heads of Siemens, Adidas, HSBC and Volvo.Many of the European corporate chieftains arrived at the dinner concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative words about a possible trade war, his harsh treatment of immigrants, his skepticism about climate change, and his apparent disdain for international cooperation. But in the course of a conversation with the C.E.O.s, moderated by Gary Cohn, the dinner appears to have assuaged the worst concerns, leaving many convinced that Mr. Trump employs outrage as a negotiating tactic while pursuing pragmatic aims.\u201cThere\u2019s a very constructive mind-set in the Trump administration to find the best path forward,\u201d one attendee, Vas Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Novartis, said.More from the World Economic ForumIt was taken private by Michael Dell and Silver Lake in 2013 and closed its takeover of EMC, one of the biggest-ever tech deals, in 2016.

{"Headline": "India Clings to Cash, Even as Tech Firms Push Digital Money", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALIGARH, India \u2014 Signs and banners for Paytm, India\u2019s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh\u2019s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads.\u201cPeople recharge in cash,\u201d Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother\u2019s phone.The scene in Mr. Singh\u2019s shop underscores a persistent reality of India\u2019s economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms.\u201cCash is convenient,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google\u2019s products for emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous. You can use it everywhere.\u201dOne reason for tech companies\u2019 optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month.Leading India\u2019s budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India\u2019s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians\u2019 financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.\u201cOur truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,\u201d he said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm\u2019s plans.The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.Mr. Singh\u2019s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm\u2019s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.\u201cWe really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,\u201d said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.Still, the country\u2019s cash economy has endured.Only one-third of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.\u201cPeople feel scared to use these apps,\u201d Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce \u2014 and collect more taxes.Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.\u201cWe have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,\u201d said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. \u201cThat\u2019s our daily job.\u201dThe job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm\u2019s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. \u201cPeople like to spend money on more than just needs,\u201d he said.Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm\u2019s progress because it\u2019s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company\u2019s chief executive, grew up nearby.On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.The problem? Paytm\u2019s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.\u201cThe only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a culturally different country being built.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed research from Mumbai.Advertisement"}

Looking forward to 2018, there\u2019s no reason to think it should be any different. Here are eight tips to help keep your travel expenses nominal and your wallet fat.AARP and AAA have been around since 1958 and 1902. Yet despite the tens of millions of members between them, they\u2019re somehow overlooked as great resources for discounted flights, hotels, rental cars and many other travel-related expenses.It\u2019ll be a few years before I\u2019m ready to join AARP, so in the meantime, I belong to AAA. A regular membership (cost varies by state) gets you the roadside assistance the organization is famous for, as well as discounts on hotels and rental cars. A basic membership also includes $100,000 in travel accident coverage when you book your trip through AAA. An additional fun hidden benefit to membership is that they will handle certain D.M.V. transactions for you, like registration renewal and transfer of vehicle ownership.Play around with combinations of words and figure out what works for you \u2014 an alert for \u201cflight flash sale\u201d to keep up on airline sales, for example, or \u201claptop discount\u201d if you\u2019re looking for a deal on a new computer.

{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.More misconduct newsAndrew\u2019s take:\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them. He did the opposite. He stayed on script and made a compelling argument for investment in the U.S. C.E.O.s from around the world wanted selfies with him.\u201dPer Daniel Yergin of IHS Markit:\u201cHe was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.\u201dAnd Ishmael Sunga of the Southern Africa Confederation of Agricultural Unions:\u201cHe made no controversial statements. He was talking to the crowd of people that he\u2019s been brought up to be part of.\u201dThe bigger pictureMore from Jonathan Swan, David McCabe, Ina Fried and Kim Hart of Axios:The memo argues that a strong 5G network is needed in order to create a secure pathway for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and virtual reality \u2014 and to combat Chinese threats to America\u2019s economic and cyber security. A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.The bigger pictureAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown? Here\u2019s the take of Dan Leal, a pornographer who bought followers:\u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dCoincheck has until Feb. 13 to explain the cause of the incident and how it will stop it happening again.\u201cThe problem now is that innovation is not viewed as an unalloyed way to improve the human condition.

{"Headline": "\u2018Fake News\u2019: Wide Reach but Little Impact, Study Suggests", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindFake news evolved from seedy internet sideshow to serious electoral threat so quickly that behavioral scientists had little time to answer basic questions about it, like who was reading what, how much real news they also consumed and whether targeted fact-checking efforts ever hit a target.Sure, surveys abound, asking people what they remember reading. But these are only as precise as the respondents\u2019 shifty recollections and subject to a malleable definition of \u201cfake.\u201d The term \u201cfake news\u201d itself has evolved into an all-purpose smear, used by politicians and the president to deride journalism they don\u2019t like.The reach of fake news was wide indeed, the study found, yet also shallow. One in four Americans saw at least one false story, but even the most eager fake-news readers \u2014 deeply conservative supporters of President Trump \u2014 consumed far more of the real kind, from newspaper and network websites and other digital sources.While the research can\u2019t settle the question of whether misinformation was pivotal in the 2016 election, the findings give the public and researchers the first solid guide to asking how its influence may have played out. That question will become increasingly important as online giants like Facebook and Google turn to shielding their users from influence by Russian operatives and other online malefactors.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the effect of fake news and a lot of numbers thrown around out of context, which get people exercised,\u201d said Duncan Watts, a research scientist at Microsoft who has argued that misinformation had a negligible effect on the election results. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about this paper is that it focuses on the actual consumers themselves.\u201dIn the new study, a trio of political scientists \u2014 Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College (a regular contributor to The Times\u2019s Upshot), Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter \u2014 analyzed web traffic data gathered from a representative sample of 2,525 Americans who consented to have their online activity monitored anonymously by the survey and analytic firm YouGov.The data included website visits made in the weeks before and after the 2016 election, and a measure of political partisanship based on overall browsing habits. (The vast majority of participants favored Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.)The online behavior of the participants was expected in some ways, but surprising in others. Consumption broke down along partisan lines: the most conservative 10 percent of the sample accounted for about 65 percent of visits to fake news sites.Pro-Trump users were about three times more likely to visit fake news sites supporting their candidate than Clinton partisans were to visit bogus sites promoting her.Still, false stories were a small fraction of the participants\u2019 overall news diet, regardless of political preference: just 1 percent among Clinton supporters, and 6 percent among those pulling for Mr. Trump. Even conservative partisans viewed just five fake news articles, on average, over more than five weeks.There was no way to determine from the data how much, or whether, people believed what they saw on these sites. But many of these were patently absurd, like one accusing Mrs. Clinton of a \u201cSudden Move of $1.8 Billion to Qatar Central Bank,\u201d or a piece headlined \u201cVideo Showing Bill Clinton With a 13-Year-Old Plunges Race Into Chaos.\u201d\u201cFor all the hype about fake news, it\u2019s important to recognize that it reached only a subset of Americans, and most of the ones it was reaching already were intense partisans,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said.\u201cThey were also voracious consumers of hard news,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are people intensely engaged in politics who follow it closely.\u201dGiven the ratio of truth to fiction, Dr. Watts said, fake news paled in influence beside mainstream news coverage, particularly stories about Mrs. Clinton and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Coverage of that topic appeared repeatedly and prominently in venues like The New York Times and the Washington Post.The new study does not rule out the possibility that fake news affected the elections, said David Rand, an associate professor of psychology, economics and management at Yale University.Americans over age 60 were much more likely to visit a fake news site than younger people, the new study found. Perhaps confusingly, moderately left-leaning people viewed more pro-Trump fake news than they did pro-Clinton fake news.One interpretation of that finding, Dr. Rand said, may be that older, less educated voters who switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 were particularly susceptible to fake news.\u201cYou can see where this might have had an impact in some of those close swing states, like Wisconsin,\u201d Dr. Rand said. \u201cBut this of course is a matter of conjecture, reasoning backward from the findings.\u201dThe study found that Facebook was by far the platform through which people most often navigated to a fake news site. Last year, in response to criticism, the company began flagging stories on its site that third-party fact-checkers found to make false claims with a red label saying \u201cdisputed.\u201dMost people in the new study encountered at least some of these labels, but \u201cwe saw no instances of people reading a fake news article and a fact-check of that specific article,\u201d Dr. Nyhan said. \u201cThe fact-checking websites have a targeting problem.\u201dIn December, Facebook announced a change to its monitoring approach. Instead of labeling false stories, Facebook will surface the fact-checks along with the fake story in the user\u2019s news feed.Advertisement"}

Will Meryl be snubbed? Will \u201cGet Out\u201d get a lot of love? Unclear. But we have early answers to some of the other pressing questions of the season.\u2022 What are the chances of another repeat of #OscarsSoWhite? Slim, thanks to smashing performances by Mary J.

The acting nominations are decided by the actors\u2019 branch \u2014 at 1,218 members, the largest one in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \u2014 and many had already submitted their ballots by the time the article appeared.Mr. Franco\u2019s widely praised performance as real-life oddity Tommy Wiseau, the man behind the cult hit \u201cThe Room,\u201d had also already earned a best actor nomination from SAG-Aftra, the union behind the Screen Actors Guild Awards.But still. Mr. Franco could easily be in the running, which would hand the Oscars host, Jimmy Kimmel, a ready-made joke if there ever was one, whether Mr. Franco shows or not.But the ceremony isn\u2019t until March 4, with each day bringing a shift in the #MeToo terrain, and each new allegation being met with a torrent of conflicting reactions. Consider all that has happened just in the week and a half since the Golden Globes:\u2022 Ashley Judd, one of the early Weinstein accusers and a deeply involved supporter of Time\u2019s Up, told the BBC that Mr. Franco\u2019s response was \u201cterrific.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019ve all behaved \u2014 at a certain level \u2014 unconsciously, and done things that were insensitive, inappropriate, without necessarily understanding that they were.\u201d Mr. Franco now counts among the very few accused men to publicly garner support.\u2022 And then there are the controversial accusations, followed by a backlash, and a backlash to the backlash, against Aziz Ansari, made by an anonymous woman. (He has said he \u201ctook her words to heart and responded privately.\u201d)All of which is to say, who the heck knows what the climate will be like when Oscars day dawns on March 4.

{"Headline": "Crowdsourcing the Commute", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTalk to Leigh Weaver, who commutes by bus from Livingston, N.J., to Midtown Manhattan, about what getting to work used to be like, and you\u2019ll hear the all-too-familiar grievances about grinding traffic, suffocating crowds and cranky drivers.\u201cI was willing to do whatever I had to do to make this happen,\u201d said Ms. Weaver, 43, a senior program manager for Google.OurBus, which started in May 2016 with a route from Kendall Park, N.J., near Princeton, to Midtown, is one of a handful of tech companies aiming to ease commuter stress by crowdsourcing rides and then developing apps that offer the routes in demand. Using available vehicles from existing charter bus services, it currently offers two routes from New Jersey to Midtown, and has plans to start a third one from Monroe later this year.Once a route has been established, riders purchase tickets through an app, guaranteeing them a seat \u2014 so no more standing in the aisle, squeezed against other passengers. Vehicles come equipped with Wi-Fi. OurBus and Boxcar buses have bathrooms onboard and charging outlets next to the seats. And riders using Chariot and OurBus can track the progress of their vehicles on their phones.\u201cIt seems so much more convenient for people to go to their phone and to be able to see when the bus is coming and then to be able to get on the bus and know that it\u2019s a new bus and somebody is taking care of it,\u201d said Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group for innovative approaches to transportation in the New York region. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be so crazy. Public transit shouldn\u2019t be miserable.\u201dEstablishing a new commuter bus route takes more planning than requesting a car share. Riders have to rely on dozens of other passengers agreeing to sign on, and the company has to establish a route, a bureaucratic process that can take months.Ms. Weaver, who commutes from Livingston, contacted OurBus after years spent riding Community Coach, a bus line owned by Coach USA. \u201cI begged them to consider us,\u201d she said of the first email she sent to OurBus in September 2016. Community Coach buses were often late, she said, broke down and were so crowded that they would sometimes pass her by, leaving her waiting on a cold suburban street corner with no idea when another one might arrive.Scott Sprengel, a vice president at Coach USA, said that the company is aware of the issues. \u201cWe are proactively meeting with our customers to meet their demands,\u201d he said. To address the crowds and the delayed service (not to mention the competition), Coach began testing online ticketing with a small group of riders on last week. If the pilot program is a success, the company plans to expand online ticketing to all commuters, said Sean Hughes, a Coach spokesman. (Currently passengers must buy paper tickets from a clerk at Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York.)\u201cNight and day doesn\u2019t even do it justice,\u201d Ms. Weaver said of her new commute. \u201cYou almost get your life back.\u201dA ticket from Livingston costs $8.60 a ride, which is slightly cheaper than Community Coach ($9.60). Coach buses, however, come more frequently. And on a recent cold December morning, four Coach buses stopped at a West Orange Park and Ride in the 25 minutes that a reporter waited for one Ourbus, watching the bus creep closer on the app (it arrived on time). While commuters filled the Coach buses, another line of riders dutifully waited for the alternative.Beth Fitzgerald, 61, a legal secretary who lives on 18th Street and First Avenue in Manhattan, regularly commutes by Chariot to and from her office on 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m the only one in the van,\u201d she said. Ms. Fitzgerald loves the service, saying it has transformed her commute. She used to take two city buses, a trip that could take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Now, her ride is consistently 10 minutes long, and the drivers handed out candy on Halloween. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d she said.Chariot sees itself as a bridge between the first and last mile of travel for riders whose subway or ferry stop might be just out of reach. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing people back to mass transit,\u201d said Ali Vahabzadeh, the chief executive of Chariot, which also operates shuttles in Austin, Seattle and San Francisco. Mr. Vahabzadeh sees the looming shutdown of the L train as an opportunity to step in. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a doomsday scenario,\u201d he said.But commuters want relief. Consider Boxcar, which started last April as an app for commuters to rent daily parking spots near New Jersey train stations, paying around $6.50 a day. The company was a few months old when the Morris and Essex lines were rerouted to Hoboken during the so-called Summer of Hell. Seeing an opportunity, Boxcar partnered with charter bus companies to run buses from towns along the affected train line into Midtown. When riders requested more stops in Manhattan, the company provided the service.But Jennifer Rowland thinks the one-way commute in the morning is worth it. \u201cI pay for the ease of the ride,\u201d said Ms. Rowland, 49, a Boxcar rider who lives in Chatham and works for a media investment company in Midtown. \u201cI am a single mother of five children. There are so many reasons to be stressed out. Commuting shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kazakhstan Cheers New Alphabet, Except for All Those Apostrophes", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authoritarian leader\u2019s talent for balancing divergent interests, however, suddenly seems to have deserted him over an issue that, at first glance, involves neither great power rivalry nor weighty matters of state: the role of the humble apostrophe in writing down Kazakh words.The Kazakh language is currently written using a modified version of Cyrillic, a legacy of Soviet rule, but Mr. Nazarbayev announced in May that the Russian alphabet would be dumped in favor of a new script based on the Latin alphabet. This, he said, \u201cis not only the fulfillment of the dreams of our ancestors, but also the way to the future for younger generations.\u201dThe decision, however, raised a tricky issue: how to write down a tongue that has no alphabet of its own but has always used scripts imported from outside.The president\u2019s ardent intervention in Kazakhstan\u2019s passionate debate over a new script and his proposed solution \u2014 he wants lots and lots of apostrophes \u2014 have highlighted how virtually everything in this former Soviet land, no matter how small or obscure, hinges on the will of a single 77-year-old man, or at least those who claim to speak for him.\u201cThis is the basic problem of our country: If the president says something or just writes something on a napkin, everybody has to applaud,\u201d said Aidos Sarym, a political analyst and member of a language reform commission set up last year.Mr. Nazarbayev, he added, deserves credit for turning Kazakhstan into the most stable and prosperous country in a region that has been battered by political upheaval and economic decay. But language, Mr. Sarym noted, \u201cis a very delicate sphere that cannot be dictated by officials.\u201dAs in many newly independent countries struggling to create a sense of national identity after subjugation by a foreign power, language in Kazakhstan is a highly sensitive issue. Many people here, including ethnic Kazakhs, still often speak Russian.But since emerging from the ruins of the Soviet Union as an independent country in 1991, Kazakhstan has steadily chipped away at the legacy of Moscow\u2019s political and cultural hegemony.The shift to the Latin alphabet, to be completed by 2025, has been widely cheered as a long overdue assertion of the country\u2019s full independence from Russia \u2014 and its determination to join the wider world. The main objections have come from the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow and ethnic Russians living in Kazakhstan.Far less popular, however, has been a decision by the president in October to ignore the advice of specialists and announce a system that uses apostrophes to designate Kazakh sounds that don\u2019t exist in other languages written in the standard Latin script.The Republic of Kazakhstan, for example, will be written in Kazakh as Qazaqstan Respy\u2019bli\u2019kasy.In a country where almost nobody challenges the president publicly, Mr. Nazarbayev has found his policy on apostrophes assailed from all sides.Linguists, who had recommended that the new writing system follow the example of Turkish, which uses umlauts and other phonetic markers instead of apostrophes, protested that the president\u2019s approach would be ugly and imprecise.Others complained the use of apostrophes will make it impossible to do Google searches for many Kazakh words or to create hashtags on Twitter.\u201cWe are supposed to be modernizing the language but are cutting ourselves from the internet,\u201d Mr. Sarym said.Uzbekistan, which dropped Cyrillic in favor of the Latin script to write its own Turkic language in the 1990s, has an alphabet that sometimes requires apostrophes but not nearly as many as those mandated by Mr. Nazarbayev.\u201cNobody knows where he got this terrible idea from,\u201d said Timur Kocaoglu, a professor of international relations and Turkish studies at Michigan State, who visited Kazakhstan last year. \u201cKazakh intellectuals are all laughing and asking: How can you read anything written like this?\u201dThe proposed script, he said, \u201cmakes your eyes hurt.\u201dThe uproar is testing the limits of Mr. Nazarbayev\u2019s approach to government: He brooks no opposition but is also keenly attuned to the public mood. Signaling a possible willingness to change course, an influential ally of the president, the head of the Senate, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said last month that it was \u201cstill too early\u201d to start using apostrophes in newspapers and elsewhere because \u201ca final decision\u201d had not yet been made.How to transcribe Kazakh, a Turkic language developed by nomadic herders without an alphabet of their own, has long been a particularly fraught issue. For centuries, it was written using the script of Arabic, the language of Islam, which most Kazakhs have long at least nominally practiced.Kazakhstan switched briefly to the Latin alphabet at the start of the last century, and Russia\u2019s Communist leaders after the 1917 revolution initially supported the use of a Latin script.Later, growing fearful of pan-Turkic sentiment among Kazakhs, Uzbeks and other Turkic peoples in the Soviet Union, Moscow between 1938 and 1940 ordered that Kazakh and other Turkic languages be written in modified Cyrillic as part of a push to promote Russian culture. To try to ensure that different Turkic peoples could not read one another\u2019s writings and develop a shared non-Soviet sense of common identity, it introduced nearly 20 versions of Cyrillic, Mr. Kocaoglu said.After leading Kazakhstan to independence, Mr. Nazarbayev, concerned with a backlash from the country\u2019s large ethnic Russian population, stalled on demands from nationalists for a swift revival of the Latin script. Other newly independent countries with similar Turkic languages like Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan all stopped using Cyrillic, but they had far smaller Russian populations.\u201cWe all wanted to create our own states and our own cultures to help us escape from the collapsing Soviet Union,\u201d said Anar Fazylzhanov, the deputy director of the Institute of Linguistics in Almaty, the country\u2019s business and cultural capital. \u201cBut changing the alphabet was much more politically difficult in Kazakhstan.\u201dIn the past two decades, however, the demographic balance has shifted in favor of ethnic Kazakhs, following the departure of many ethnic Russians, whose numbers fell from about 40 percent of the population at independence to about 20 percent today. This opened the way for Mr. Nazarbayev to endorse the axing of Cyrillic.\u201cCyrillic was part of Russia\u2019s colonial project and many see the Latin alphabet as an anti-imperial move,\u201d said Dossym Satpayev, a prominent Kazakh political commentator.The Russian Orthodox Church and Russian nationalists protested what they interpreted as a sellout to the West and an attack on Russian culture. Kazakhstan even had intelligence reports, according to experts familiar with the matter, that the Russian Parliament was preparing a statement praising Mr. Nazarbayev as a great statesman and pleading with him to preserve Cyrillic so as to cement his legacy as a leader who has kept the peace among different ethnic groups.Because Kazakh features many sounds that are not easily rendered into either the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets without additional markers, a decision needed to be made whether to follow Turkish, which uses the Latin script but includes cedillas, tildes, breves, dots and other markers to clarify pronunciation, or invent alternative phonetic pointers.In August, the linguists proposed using an alphabet that largely followed the Turkish model.The president\u2019s office, however, declared this a nonstarter because Turkish-style markers do not feature on a standard keyboard.The scholars on the language commission, led by Erden Kazhybek, the head of the Institute of Linguistics in Almaty, then suggested using digraphs, or several letters to indicate a single sound, like \u201cch\u201d in English.The modified Latin alphabet put forward by Mr. Nazarbayev uses apostrophes to elongate or modify the sounds of certain letters.For example, the letter \u201cI\u201d with an apostrophe designates roughly the same sound as the \u201cI\u201d in Fiji, while \u201cI\u201d on its own sounds like the vowel in fig. The letter \u201cS\u201d with an apostrophe indicates \u201csh\u201d and C\u2019 is pronounced \u201cch.\u201d Under this new system, the Kazakh word for cherry will be written as s\u2019i\u2019i\u2019e, and pronounced she-ee-ye.\u201cWhen scholars first learned about this, we were all in shock,\u201d Mr. Kazhybek said. Tipped off about the president\u2019s proposals in advance, he had rushed to Astana, the Kazakh capital, to plead for a reconsideration but was told that apostrophes were not going away.The only reason publicly cited by Mr. Nazarbayev to explain why he did not want Turkish-style phonetic markers is that \u201cthere should not be any hooks or superfluous dots that cannot be put straight into a computer,\u201d he said in September. He also complained that using digraphs to transcribe special Kazakh sounds would cause confusion when people try to read English, when the same combination of letters designates entirely different sounds.But others saw another possible motivation: Mr. Nazarbayev may be eager to avoid any suggestion that Kazakhstan is turning its back on Russia and embracing pan-Turkic unity, a bugbear for Russian officials in both czarist and Soviet times.Also likely playing a role in the president\u2019s active involvement has been his advancing age and the question of how he will be remembered when he eventually steps down or dies.\u201cThe president is thinking about his legacy and wants to go down in history as the man who created a new alphabet,\u201d said Mr. Satpayev, who supports the switch to Latin script but not the president\u2019s version. \u201cThe problem is that our president is not a philologist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Duffin was wandering through a museum in Pasadena, Calif., last summer when he paused before a 17th-century painting of a bearded warrior in armor.\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, that is really funny, he looks just like me,\u2019\u201d Dr. Duffin recalled. Then he moved on.But his wife, Beverly Simmons, was stunned by the resemblance. \u201cShe came running after me and said, \u2018You have to come back and look at this painting!\u201d Dr. Duffin said.Dr. Duffin had found his art twin. So the couple did what millions of people have discovered as a new way to interact with art \u2014 something that has exploded with new popularity in recent weeks thanks to a new feature in a Google museums app.But Dr. Duffin and his wife were pioneers last summer, using old-fashioned serendipity. He stood next to the oil painting, a work by the Dutch artist Jan van Bijlert displayed at the Norton Simon Museum. He turned sideways, raised his chin and narrowed his eyes. His wife captured the moment with her iPhone.Some set out specifically to find their twin, in an engaging pastime that gives museum visits a new focus. Others, like the Duffins, have stumbled on theirs as they wander.As anyone who regularly looks at a social media feed knows by now, millions more need never leave home or cross a border to find that uniquely familiar face on some obscure etching. They just upload a selfie and let technology do the sleuthing.Dr. Duffin said he was amused by his moment with the unknown soldier, described by the museum as probably a more mythological than human figure. But the resemblance had an impact on his life after he posted the photograph on Twitter, where it was widely shared without identifying him by name.\u201cA month later, all of a sudden, it started to get a lot of play in the press,\u201d Dr. Duffin, a professor of music at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said in an interview. \u201cI would get email messages from people I had not heard from in years who knew immediately it was me.\u201dWith people seeking selfies that make a connection going back in time, museums are using the opportunity to engage with visitors.Leslie C. Denk, the director of external affairs for the Norton Simon Museum, said the museum had noticed some visitors posting photographs of themselves posing like works of art, particularly alongside sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol.\u201cArt has the power to transport us through time, and so I think it\u2019s a joy to recognize ourselves, a friend or even a pet, in an artwork from centuries ago,\u201d she said.\u201cIn our galleries, visitors frequently seek out their museum doppelg\u00e4nger or attempt to mimic works of art \u2014 usually as they search for the perfect Instagram shot,\u201d said Katie Getchell, the deputy director and chief brand officer at the Boston museum.At the Brooklyn Museum, selfies with artworks are also popular. \u201cThe success of Google\u2019s project comes as no surprise to me, or probably to anyone else who works in a museum,\u201d said Brooke Baldeschwiler, the museum\u2019s senior manager of digital communications. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple. People love to see themselves in art.\u201d\u201cMy grandmother got Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential portrait,\u201d said Patrick Lenihan, a spokesman for Google.Far from the virtual realm, Greco-Roman antiquities, Egyptian funerary portraits and the contemporary people who resemble them are being brought together in an exhibit in Canada called \u201cMy 2,000-Year-Old Double.\u201dWesley Rowell, 57, who works in New York City, was one of them.He will appear alongside his art twin, a sculpture of an unidentified man from the third century B.C.\u201cTo think about the lives, the generations, between him and me in New York City, is kind of bizarre,\u201d Mr. Rowell said. \u201cI keep going back to that human need, to feel like I am connected to everything that was before me.\u201dAmanda Bullis, 29, an actor who lives in Jersey City, was chosen for her similarity to a face carved onto a vessel, dating between 300 and 201 B.C.Ms. Bullis sat for hours for hair and makeup. \u201cIn that moment I was able to embody her,\u201d she said, adding that it made her think about her ancestry. \u201cI just found it interesting that I am part of a larger humanity that has been evolving and changing, but largely the same, over thousands of years.\u201dDr. Duffin, the Ohio professor, said he did not think much more about his art twin after he posed with the painting in California. He is accustomed, he added, to being mistaken for another bearded fellow.Strangers often ask him, \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you look like Santa Claus?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my answer is, \u2018Not since yesterday.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM May Finally Stop Shrinking. But Is It a Turnaround?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five and a half years, nearly the entire tenure of its chief executive, Virginia M. Rometty, IBM has reported a steady erosion of revenue.Selling off its chip manufacturing and smaller data-center computer businesses contributed to the decline. So, too, did the fact that new businesses like cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence had not yet grown big enough to make up for the downturn in IBM\u2019s traditional hardware and software products.But IBM\u2019s half-decade losing streak will most likely end on Thursday, analysts predict, when the company reports its quarterly performance.The crossover to growth would be a long-awaited bright spot for Ms. Rometty and IBM, a challenged giant that has been overshadowed in recent years by the younger technology giants on the West Coast.Even if IBM delivers a revenue gain, however, the bigger question facing the company remains: Has Ms. Rometty turned it around?Skeptics abound. IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company\u2019s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cIs a turnaround afoot? I don\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company\u2019s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers.The new businesses \u2014 \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d IBM calls them \u2014 now account for 45 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations \u2014 and gained converts.The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM\u2019s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM\u2019s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year.IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward.Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google.The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis \u2014 all delivered via the cloud and available \u00e0 la carte.IBM\u2019s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter.\u201cWe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.\u201dCompanies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure.AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant\u2019s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM \u2014 a longtime technology supplier to AT&T \u2014 was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T\u2019s president of business operations.The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.\u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201dThat was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.\u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201dThe start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an A.I. \u2018Cat-and-Mouse Game\u2019 Generates Believable Fake Photos", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "Advertisement\nThe woman in the photo seems familiar.She looks like Jennifer Aniston, the \u201cFriends\u201d actress, or Selena Gomez, the child star turned pop singer. But not exactly.She appears to be a celebrity, one of the beautiful people photographed outside a movie premiere or an awards show. And yet, you cannot quite place her.That\u2019s because she\u2019s not real. She was created by a machine.At a lab in Finland, a small team of Nvidia researchers recently built a system that can analyze thousands of (real) celebrity snapshots, recognize common patterns, and create new images that look much the same \u2014 but are still a little different. The system can also generate realistic images of horses, buses, bicycles, plants and many other common objects.The project is part of a vast and varied effort to build technology that can automatically generate convincing images \u2014 or alter existing images in equally convincing ways. The hope is that this technology can significantly accelerate and improve the creation of computer interfaces, games, movies and other media, eventually allowing software to create realistic imagery in moments rather than the hours \u2014 if not days \u2014 it can now take human developers.In recent years, thanks to a breed of algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, companies like Google and Facebook have built systems that can recognize faces and common objects with an accuracy that rivals the human eye. Now, these and other companies, alongside many of the world\u2019s top academic A.I. labs, are using similar methods to both recognize and create.Nvidia's images can't match the resolution of images produced by a top-of-the-line camera, but when viewed on even the largest smartphones, they are sharp, detailed, and, in many cases, remarkably convincing.For example, look at the two photos below and see if you can figure out which person is real.Like other prominent A.I. researchers, the Nvidia team believes the techniques that drive this project will continue to improve in the months and years to come, generating significantly larger and more complex images.\u201cWe think we can push this further, generating not just photos but 3-D images that can be used in computer games and films,\u201d said Jaakko Lehtinen, one of the researchers behind the project.As it built a system that generates new celebrity faces, the Nvidia team went a step further in an effort to make them far more believable. It set up two neural networks \u2014 one that generated the images and another that tried to determine whether those images were real or fake. These are called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. In essence, one system does its best to fool the other \u2014 and the other does its best not to be fooled.\u201cThe computer learns to generate these images by playing a cat-and-mouse game against itself,\u201d said Mr. Lehtinen.10 MINUTES8 HOURS16 HOURS1 DAY2 DAYS3 DAYS4 DAYS5 DAYS6 DAYS7 DAYS8 DAYS9 DAYS10 DAYS14 DAYS16 DAYS18 DAYS\u201cWe now have a model that can generate faces that are more diverse and in some ways more realistic than what we could program by hand,\u201d he said, referring to Nvidia\u2019s work in Finland.But new concerns come with the power to create this kind of imagery.With so much attention on fake media these days, we could soon face an even wider range of fabricated images than we do today.\u201cThe concern is that these techniques will rise to the point where it becomes very difficult to discern truth from falsity,\u201d said Tim Hwang, who previously oversaw A.I. policy at Google and is now director of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, an effort to fund ethical A.I. research. \u201cYou might believe that accelerates problems we already have.\u201dResearchers are also using a wide range of other machine learning techniques to edit video in more convincing \u2014 and sometimes provocative \u2014 ways.The results are not completely convincing. But the rapid progress of GANs and other techniques point to a future where it becomes easier for anyone to generate faux images or doctor the real thing. That is cause for real concern among experts like Mr. Hwang.Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, an organization that analyzes current events using publicly available images and video, pointed out that fake images are by no means a new problem. In the years since the rise of Photoshop, the onus has been on citizens to approach what they view online with skepticism.But many of us still put a certain amount of trust in photos and videos that we don\u2019t necessarily put in text or word of mouth. Mr. Hwang believes the technology will evolve into a kind of A.I. arms race pitting those trying to deceive against those trying to identify the deception.Mr. Lehtinen downplays the effect his research will have on the spread of misinformation online. But he does say that, as a time goes on, we may have to rethink the very nature of imagery. \u201cWe are approaching some fundamental questions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Technology Is (and Isn\u2019t) Changing Our Reading Habits", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Alexandra Alter, who covers the books industry for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Given that you write about the books industry, how do you prefer to read books? On a Kindle or iPad or some other device, or printed books? I still love print books and find it to be a much more relaxing and immersive experience, but when I\u2019m reading books for work \u2014 honestly, the bulk of my reading \u2014 the Kindle is incredibly convenient. I have all my books on a single device that I always have with me. I read advance copies of books that way: Publishers send me digital copies through NetGalley or Edelweiss, sites where book industry professionals and critics can get digital copies of books before they\u2019re published.I like that e-books are searchable, which is helpful for fact-checking, and the device stores all my notes and highlights, so I can quickly look stuff up when I\u2019m writing. And I can read with one hand on a crowded train. One of my mild phobias is being trapped somewhere, on a plane or a stalled train or in a line, with nothing to read, and I also have the Kindle reader app on my iPhone, so I always have my entire library with me.How is technology affecting the publishing industry?About a decade ago, when Amazon introduced its first e-reader, publishers panicked that digital books would take over the industry, the way digital transformed the music industry. And for a while, that fear seemed totally justified. At one point, the growth trajectory for e-books was more than 1,200 percent. Bookstores suffered, and print sales lagged. E-books also made self-publishing easier, which threatened traditional publishers.One possible reason is that e-book prices have gone up, so in some cases they\u2019re more expensive than a paperback edition. Another possibility is digital fatigue. People spend so much time in front of screens that when they read they want to be offline. Another theory is that some e-book readers have switched to audiobooks, which are easy to play on your smartphone while you\u2019re multitasking. And audiobooks have become the fastest-growing format in the industry.Self-publishing has been one of the most fascinating corners of the industry to me. There have been a handful of massively successful self-published authors who have started their own publishing companies, and they\u2019ve started to publish other \u201cself-published\u201d authors. But publishers have survived so far through consolidation, and we\u2019ll probably see more of that.What will be the fate of physical bookstores? And what do you think about Amazon\u2019s bookstores?I\u2019ll be curious to see how Indigo Books, the Canadian chain, will do here next year when it expands into the United States. Maybe it will shake up the model.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?I am, my family would confirm, not great with gadgets. It would be fair to say that I\u2019m actively bad with them. I\u2019m wary of some of the new home assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home, not necessarily because I\u2019m paranoid about my conversations being recorded \u2014 Amazon and Google already know everything about me \u2014 but because my kids would likely be yelling at the devices all the time, and the Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande songs would play in an endless loop.What tech is popular with your family?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing.

{"Headline": "Congress Approves Six-Year Extension of Surveillance Law", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday voted to extend by six years a law that authorizes the National Security Agency\u2019s warrantless surveillance program, essentially ending a cycle of debate over wiretapping and privacy that began with the leaks in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, a former intelligence contractor.Under Section 702, the government, without a warrant, may collect from American companies, like AT&T and Google, the emails, texts, phone calls and other private messages of foreigners abroad \u2014 even when those targets communicate with Americans.Congress last extended that law without changes in 2012. But after Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks in 2013, a bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers pushed to impose far more sweeping warrant requirements on queries for Americans\u2019 information that was swept in by government surveillance.With Thursday\u2019s final vote, that effort failed.Complicating matters, the bill does impose a limited new warrant requirement for F.B.I. agents to read any emails of an American who is already the subject of an open criminal investigation. But that requirement is so narrowly written that it would not apply to the overwhelming majority of such searches, including national-security investigations and assessments of criminal tips before an investigation is opened.\u201cWe need our armed forces and intelligence community to protect us, and they need us to give them the tools to do it,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Thursday.But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said passing the bill without amendments was \u201ca dereliction of duty by a Congress that has a responsibility to protect Americans\u2019 freedoms, as well as our country\u2019s security.\u201d He vowed to keep fighting \u201cto protect Americans from unnecessary government spying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many others aren\u2019t.The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines.According to the WSJ, \u201cthe bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments.\u201dBannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\u201dIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine.

{"Headline": "For His Next Act, Ken Chenault Turns His Focus on Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookEver since Kenneth I. Chenault announced last fall that he would retire as chief executive of American Express, he has been fielding phone calls from companies looking to hire him.It\u2019s not surprising. Mr. Chenault is one of the most prominent African-American chief executives in the world and the man who led American Express through 9/11 and the financial crisis. When it came to selecting his next act, he was bound to have a wide variety of choices.In the last two weeks, he has announced he was joining the boards of Facebook and Airbnb. And for the last several weeks, he\u2019s been trying to keep one more secret \u2014 perhaps his biggest \u2014 about his future plans.\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI literally have been inundated,\u201d he reluctantly acknowledged, almost embarrassed, when we spoke Monday. \u201cPeople have talked to me about some very large companies and some digital technology companies. Obviously, I can\u2019t say from a confidentiality standpoint.\u201dThe recruiters can stop calling. On Tuesday, he will announce he has a new full-time job. Mr. Chenault, a name long synonymous with Wall Street, will soon become a staple of Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He will be chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, one of the most successful venture firms of the past two decades, with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap, Stripe and Warby Parker.Mr. Chenault \u2018s choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture.As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society\u2019s challenges.This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.\u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Chenault\u2019s management skills may be a perfect fit for the role General Catalyst needs him to fill. As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.\u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201dMr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.\u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201dIt is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.Mr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble, which gives him insight into what\u2019s going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.\u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: The Incomplete Vision of \u2018Anatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe experience of watching the documentary \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u201d is a lesson for our times. As its title suggests, it is a head-to-battered-toe consideration of a male ballet dancer that takes you from studio to stage and points in between. It is formally conventional and draws on the usual zippy you-are-there moments with lots of gabby talking heads. What elevates it, though, is its charming \u2014 and from all accounts \u2014 deeply talented subject, Marcelo Gomes. So after it was over I eagerly searched Google for him on my phone only to discover that the day before, on Dec. 21, he had resigned from the American Ballet Theater after he was accused of sexual misconduct.These revelations aren\u2019t in \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer,\u201d which was produced, directed and shot by David Barba and James Pellerito. And while the accusations don\u2019t invalidate the documentary, they have inevitably transformed its generally breezy, sometimes teary and altogether upbeat portrait. The movie is a classic underdog story, that of a Brazilian prodigy who \u2014 with a great deal of raw talent and drive, along with the kindness and encouragement of family and friends \u2014 matures into a genius of dance. Now, invariably, every painstaking step of that journey, each beat and milestone, comes with an unsettling asterisk as delight at his artistry mixes with doubt about his character.Documentary portraits of this type often incorporate testimonials from affable, encouraging experts who smilingly help burnish the subject\u2019s reputation. \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u201d is stuffed with such enthusiastic recommendations, including from numerous dancers \u2014 Misty Copeland, Julie Kent and Veronika Part \u2014 with whom Mr. Gomes partnered over his career. The love for him just pours off the screen in these moments, as does the respect and admiration. These persuasive testimonials are scattered among the dances, festivals and interstitial sections in which the energetic, very peripatetic Mr. Gomes quiets down and settles in for some intimate on-camera sharing.Much of this is agreeable, or at least was. In retrospect, the sheer amount of gush in the movie, all the praise and feverish shouts of bravo, underscores the limits of affirmational documentaries. It is also a reminder that a movie\u2019s meaning is made (and remade) by its viewers, not just its content. Mr. Barba and Mr. Pellerito set out to create a portrait of Mr. Gomes, who comes across as an extremely nice guy. When I saw the movie in December, their portrayal seemed rather too fluffy and fawningly one-note, but it was also hard to resist. Mr. Gomes can be thrilling to watch even when partly obscured by a partner\u2019s dress, but it may be that more of him was hidden from us than this movie suggests.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Media Men\u2019 List Creator Outs Herself, Fearing She Would Be Named", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started with a tweet on Tuesday afternoon.By Wednesday morning, five writers were said to have pulled stories planned for future issues of Harper\u2019s Magazine \u2014 an effort to pressure the magazine not to reveal the name of the woman who first assembled a Google spreadsheet listing men in the media industry accused of sexually inappropriate behavior.And by Wednesday night, after hours of debate about the matter on social media, there was a surprising turn: The woman whose identity the campaign had sought to protect revealed herself in a first-person essay on New York magazine\u2019s web vertical The Cut.At issue was an article Harper\u2019s had scheduled for the March edition written by the essayist Katie Roiphe. Writers and editors posted on Twitter that the article would reveal the identity of a person who had created the spreadsheet, first circulated in October, that identified men who were said to have acted in a predatory manner toward women.The spreadsheet, called Shitty Media Men, lists the names of 70 men in the industry, along with allegations against them ranging from questionable behavior to rape.The list comes with a disclaimer advising readers to take its contents with a grain of salt, since some of the material was described as \u201crumors.\u201d The document includes the names of some men who have been fired from media jobs since it was first shared.In an email interview on Tuesday, Ms. Roiphe said her article did not name the woman who started the list.\u201cI am looking forward to talking about what is actually in the piece when it actually comes out,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not \u2018outing\u2019 anyone. I have to say it\u2019s a little disturbing that anyone besides Trump views Twitter as a reliable news source.\u201dBut in an article published Wednesday night on the website of New York magazine, the author of the list revealed herself to be a writer named Moira Donegan. And the concern over naming names seemed almost moot.Ms. Donegan, who wrote that she had graduated from college in 2013, began by explaining that she was the person who had first \u201ccollected a range of rumors and allegations of sexual misconduct, much of it violent, by men in magazines and publishing.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe anonymous, crowdsourced document was a first attempt at solving what has seemed like an intractable problem: how women can protect ourselves from sexual harassment and assault.\u201dAfter acknowledging that the list had its pitfalls and made many people uncomfortable, she explained that she had never expected it to gain the attention of people beyond the group of women in media who were its intended audience.But as more and more women added their own names and descriptions of inappropriate behavior to it, the list began to circulate far and wide. It was mentioned in an article on BuzzFeed and a version was posted on Reddit.\u201cI had imagined a document that would assemble the collective, unspoken knowledge of sexual misconduct that was shared by the women in my circles: What I got instead was a much broader reckoning with abuses of power that spanned an industry,\u201d Ms. Donegan wrote.It is likely that the Harper\u2019s article, which had yet to reach its final version on Wednesday, will be revised to reflect Ms. Donegan\u2019s revealing herself as the person who created what became an important document at a time when powerful men in the media and other fields have been called out and punished not only for instances of alleged rape and sexual assault, but also for modes of behavior that seemed acceptable in workplaces just a decade ago.Hours before the publication of Ms. Donegan\u2019s story on The Cut, Ms. Roiphe said that she herself did not know the identity of the person who had started the list and added, \u201cI would never put in the creator of the list if they didn\u2019t want to be named.\u201dGiulia Melucci, a spokeswoman for Harper\u2019s, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell the steps of the editing process.\u201d Through a spokeswoman, James Marcus, the editor of Harper\u2019s, declined to comment.An email exchange obtained by The New York Times shows that, during the editing process, a Harper\u2019s fact checker contacted a person said to be a creator of the list and said the article identified her as someone \u201cwidely believed\u201d to be one of the people behind it.Harper\u2019s said that the fact-checking email exchange did not mean the name was ever meant to be included in the final version. \u201cFact-checking is part of reporting,\u201d Ms. Melucci said.Ms. Roiphe added, \u201cI would not have mentioned it without her approval. I want to be clear on that.\u201d\u201cThe risk of doxxing is high,\u201d Ms. Tortorici wrote, referring to the practice of online critics publishing people\u2019s personal, private information against their ideological opponents without their consent. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201dBy Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Cliffe, who declined to comment for this article, had pledged to pay more than $19,000 to reporters who had pulled their stories from Harper\u2019s, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Ms. Melucci, the Harper\u2019s spokeswoman, said she had no knowledge of writers pulling stories from the magazine.She has continued writing in a contrarian vein, publishing five nonfiction books, a novel and articles in Slate, Vogue and other publications.Since the first social media posts about the Harper\u2019s article appeared on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Roiphe has undergone something of a trial by Twitter, with numerous insults hurled her way.Ms. Roiphe said she was not surprised by how people were responding to her on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a little ironic,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I do address in the piece exactly the sort of Twitter hysteria that we are seeing here.\u201dGiven the speed of media in the age of social platforms, the subject of the article she has been working on for Harper\u2019s underwent a substantive change just hours after she spoke those words.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article erroneously included a magazine among the publications for which the essayist Katie Roiphe has written. Ms. Roiphe\u2019s work has not been published in Dissent magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dropbox Is Said to Be Planning to Go Public This Year", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySilicon Valley has birthed many highly valued and hugely hyped start-ups in recent years, including Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest. Few of those companies have made it out onto the stock market successfully.And Wall Street investors must also be convinced that Dropbox can continue to attract customers, even as tech giants like Google and Microsoft have freely offered their own online data storage services.Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures, said a Dropbox I.P.O. would be seen as a harbinger for start-ups. \u201cWill unicorns realize they have to grow up and grow out of their Peter Pan mentality?\u201d he asked, adding that a public offering for Dropbox would also help set the scene for whether other unicorns \u201creignite and grow, or do they fade away?\u201dDropbox filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission, affording the company time to make its preparations away from the glare of potential investors. It has hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to help underwrite the initial offering, said the people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Dropbox plans to hire more banks as advisers, they said.The company is aiming to begin trading on a stock market in the spring, one of these people added, cautioning that the timing of an I.P.O. is fluid and may change. The timing will partly depend on the receptiveness of investors who may have been burned by market debuts that later soured.Over all, 2017 proved to be relatively robust for initial offerings, with 160 companies raising $35.6 billion in the United States, up significantly from 2016, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm. But bankers and analysts said many of the biggest potential market debutantes would likely sit on the sidelines for another year, having already raised enormous sums in the private markets.Founded over a decade ago by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dropbox was one of the first companies to popularize file storage via the web.\u201cWhat Drew and the team have accomplished is something that we are proud of in the tech community and should be proud of as a country,\u201d said Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, which has not invested in Dropbox.Since then, Mr. Houston and his management team have focused on containing costs while building out features like collaboration services and shared document creation.One big question that hangs over a potential I.P.O. is what sort of valuation Dropbox would command as a public company. Its closest point of comparison is Box, another Silicon Valley online data storage provider, but one that focuses more on big corporate clients like General Electric and Procter & Gamble. (Dropbox has taken aim at smaller companies, but has argued in the past that it spends less to acquire new customers.)Dropbox is likely to argue that its bigger user base and greater reliance on word of mouth to gain consumers should mean that it is valued higher than Box.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated which companies may file plans for public offerings confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any company can make such a filing, not just companies that generate less than $1 billion a year in revenue.Nellie Bowles contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Who and what are they?\u201dThe thing I liked about this puzzle is that there is a big H made of black squares in the middle of the grid, which made me believe that the composer was perhaps Haydn or Handel, but that turned out to be a red herring. Or my own mistake, which is highly likely.It turns out that the composer is Ludwig van BEETHOVEN, which is right there in the middle of the grid. You don\u2019t see him? Take a closer look at the Across entries in the center:35A: BEET + H + 36A: OVEN = BEETHOVENCrossing that is a pair of EARPHONES, which is one way to listen to him.21D: EARP + H + 39D: ONES = EARPHONESAnd I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t include the Monty Python sketch about our composer:1A: \u201cHelp during the fall?\u201d is a good clue for GRAB BAR.

Will, however, liked EARPHONES, which could also be paired with Beethoven, better, so I reworked some of the original grid. I think gimmicks like this in a Friday or Saturday are fun and add something to otherwise-themeless puzzle.I think you\u2019re right, Mr. Kahn.Crossword editor Will Shortz appeared on the \u201cWeird Work\u201d podcast to talk about his job.

{"Headline": "Alexa, We\u2019re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors.The challenge isn\u2019t finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom.A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions.Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 \u201cskills\u201d \u2014 third-party apps that tap into Alexa\u2019s voice controls to accomplish tasks \u2014 it makes available.But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, \u201cpeople are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that there is something that\u2019s going to drive people to use these.\u201dThere is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon.Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services \u2014 like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals.With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes.Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant.For now, consumers\u2019 satisfaction with their smart speakers \u2014 and by extension, the onboard assistants \u2014 is helped in part by the fact they didn\u2019t pay a lot to get them into their homes.Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he\u2019s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that.\u201cThere\u2019s only certain things I use it for, but I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my taxes with it.\u201dPaul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances.\u201cThe more interesting functionality is yet to come,\u201d Mr. Erickson said. \u201cPart of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we\u2019re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.\u201dCompetitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software.Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories \u2014 although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language.Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 \u2014 or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units.There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren\u2019t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad\u2019s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They allow a plaintiff to sue a variety of defendants by claiming that they acted together and seek an award of triple damages, a bonanza in some business disputes that can run into millions of dollars.

{"Headline": "Tackling the Internet\u2019s Central Villain: The Advertising Business", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSo who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online?This isn\u2019t that hard. You don\u2019t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It\u2019s the advertising business, stupid.And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain \u2014 and perhaps even reform.But the online ad machine is also a vast, opaque and dizzyingly complex contraption with underappreciated capacity for misuse \u2014 one that collects and constantly profiles data about our behavior, creates incentives to monetize our most private desires and frequently unleashes loopholes that the shadiest of people are only too happy to exploit.And for all its power, the digital ad business has long been under-regulated and under-policed, both by the companies that run it and by the world\u2019s governments. In the United States, the industry has been almost untouched by oversight, even though it forms the primary revenue stream of two of the planet\u2019s most valuable companies, Google and Facebook.\u201cIn the early days of online media, the choice was essentially made \u2014 give it away for free, and advertising would produce the revenue,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association that represents companies in the digital ad business. \u201cA lot of the things we see now flow out from that decision.\u201d\u201cTechnology has largely been outpacing the ability of individual companies to understand what is actually going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really an unregulated stock market effect to the whole thing.\u201dThe company also pointed to several steps it had taken recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our ad policies, hired more ad reviewers, and created a new team to help detect and prevent abuses,\u201d said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising. \u201cWe\u2019re also testing a tool that will bring more transparency to ads running on our platform. We know there is more work to do, but our goal is to keep people safe.\u201dA spokesman for Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, said it was constantly policing its ad system, pointing out recent steps it has taken to address problems arising from the ad business, including several changes to YouTube.The role of the ad business in much of what\u2019s terrible online was highlighted in a recent report by two think tanks, New America and Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The report chronicles just how efficient the online ad business has become at profiling, targeting, and persuading people. That\u2019s good news for the companies that want to market to you \u2014 as the online ad machine gets better, marketing gets more efficient and effective, letting companies understand and influence consumer sentiment at a huge scale for little money.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEither you have a brilliant technology that permits microtargeting to exactly the people you want to influence at exactly the right time with exactly the right message \u2014 or you\u2019re only reaching a small number of people and therefore it couldn\u2019t be influential.\u201dThe tinkering continued on Tuesday, when Facebook also said it would ban ads promoting crypto currency schemes, some of which have fallen into scammy territory.Yet these are all piecemeal efforts. They don\u2019t address the underlying logic of the ad business, which produces endless incentives for gaming the system in ways that Google and Facebook discover often only after the fact. Mr. Rothenberg said this was how regulating advertising was likely to go \u2014 a lot of fixes resembling \u201cWhac-a-Mole.\u201dOf course, there is the government. You could imagine some regulator imposing stricter standards for who has access to the online ad system, who makes money from it, how it uses private information and how transparent tech companies must be about it all. But that also seems unlikely; the Honest Ads Act, a proposal to regulate online political ads, has gone nowhere in Congress.I stand by that view, but now I also regret dismissing his warning so cavalierly. Socially, politically and culturally, the online ad business is far more dangerous than I appreciated. Mr. Cook was right, and we should have listened to him.Advertisement"}

Some at the Los Angeles Times feared he would focus more on pageviews and advertising than on quality journalism.In a statement announcing the changes on Monday, Justin C.

The Thomas fire had burned them, creating wounds that oozed with blood and, in some cases, scorching off their paw pads completely.Dr. Jamie Peyton had worked mostly on domestic animals before she was asked to help with the bears. Still, she thought she had a solution: fish skin.She created a homemade salve for the bears\u2019 paws and also began sterilizing tilapia skin, which she cut into pieces. Then she sewed the fish skin over the wounds and wrapped her handiwork in rice paper and corn husks.The bears got treated for the last time on Jan. 17 before they were placed into separate trailers for the long journey home. They arrived later that night, and the next day, wildlife officials drove the bears deep into the Los Padres National Forest.They placed the bears into the dens that officials had made for them; they say each bear has been fitted with a satellite collar so the caretakers can continue to watch them from afar.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Total Recall: A Reader\u2019s Guide to Memory Gain", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReader\u2019s NotebookHere in the valley of my mid-50s, I try not to get into a swivet over my occasionally faulty memory: Sometimes the mind has a mind of its own. But when I read this chilling passage \u2014 \u201cI am dementing. I am dementing. I am dementing.\u201d \u2014 from Gerda Saunders\u2019s recent memoir \u201cMemory\u2019s Last Breath: Field Notes on My Dementia,\u201d I found myself starting to panic.In a world increasingly dominated by the Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon hegemony, we hear a lot about the threat to privacy. But isn\u2019t memory just as vulnerable? Now that, as the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer writes in \u201cWorld Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech,\u201d \u201cour phone is an extension of our memory; we\u2019ve outsourced basic functions to algorithms,\u201d doesn\u2019t the world seem like an ever-larger parking lot that has mysteriously swallowed our Toyota? Don\u2019t we all wish, now more than ever, that acquaintances came equipped with their own \u201cPreviously on this series \u2026\u201d trailer?Mr. Foer and Ms. Saunders aren\u2019t the only writers on this beat. Recent books by Robert Sapolsky, Michael Lemonick, Felicia Yap, Emily Barr, Dale Bredesen, Val Emmich, Oliver Sacks and Elizabeth Rosner, among others, have addressed the theme of non-historical memory. Last July alone, more than a dozen books specifically about the topic, most of them self-published, were released.You\u2019d expect the themes of amnesia or powers of recall to be prevalent in thrillers or in memoirs by trauma survivors or over-beveraged rock stars, but even literary fiction is getting in on the act. In Rachel Khong\u2019s sly, diaristic \u201cGoodbye, Vitamin,\u201d a 30-year-old who moves back home learns she has to care for a dementing father who has started leaving his pants in trees. In Alissa Nutting\u2019s outrageous sex comedy \u201cMade for Love,\u201d a woman on the lam from her tech pioneer husband discovers that he has implanted a chip in her brain that allows him to download all her experiences.A majority of the recent or upcoming books about the topic, though, are nonfiction works that take a prescriptive approach to memory loss. I recently spent a month trying to follow the dictates of two of them, both written by doctors: Daniel G. Amen\u2019s \u201cMemory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss and Remember What Matters Most\u201d and Andrew E. Budson and Maureen K. O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cSeven Steps to Managing Your Memory: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not, and What to Do About It.\u201dThe first thing I noticed about these two workbook-type tomes is, because they\u2019re not intended to be read straight through, they repeat information so frequently as to render a reader frantic about his mental health. I kept wanting to ask Dr. Amen, a physician with his own chain of clinics: Didn\u2019t you pimp turmeric 10 pages ago? Before reading the books, I\u2019d taken eight memory tests that I\u2019d found on various websites, to get a baseline of my powers of recall. Consolingly, I\u2019d tested slightly above average for my age. But once turmeric started to ominously reappear, I felt like Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cMother.\u201dOn the diet and exercise front, the two books were mostly in agreement: Strangely, neither wants you to lie on the couch while idly nursing a stick of French butter. (But take heart, both books want you to eat a little dark chocolate each day. Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor, who teach neurology at Boston University, don\u2019t even stipulate that it needs to be unsweetened.)For me, the doctors\u2019 bodily prescriptions fell into two categories: Things I Already Do, and Things I Can\u2019t Be Bothered to Change. On the former front: I dance two hours a week, walk briskly 30 minutes a day and consume a lot of vegetables and water but not much alcohol or butter. On the latter: Hands off my trusty colleagues caffeine and baked goods, not to mention my occasional visitors, Mr. Charred Meats and Ms. Marijuana.When it came to recommended activities, this Scrabble enthusiast was dismayed to learn from Mr. Budson and Ms. O\u2019Connor that \u201cthere is not currently strong enough evidence for us to suggest the use of brain-training games.\u201d Rather, they encourage you to learn new skills or information while being social. To this end, I took an Iyengar yoga class. I chatted up a friend about the recent Mayweather-McGregor boxing bout. I had a CVS employee show me how to use a price scanner, and a church employee tell me what an undercroft is. (\u201cAre we in the undercroft now?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes, we\u2019re in the undercroft,\u201d he told me. I felt like I\u2019d wandered into a young adult novel about hot, troubled teens who foil the time-space continuum.)In a similar vein, Dr. Amen encourages you to undertake various activities while using your non-dominant hand. Slight splattery mayhem ensued in my kitchen one night when I tried to slice 30 or so cherry tomatoes in half with my left hand for a salad. It looked like an audience at La Scala had had very strong feelings about our floor tiles.Two of the books\u2019 dictates seemed like they were demonstrably working. First, Dr. Amen recommends that you spend 15 minutes a day in deep prayer or meditation, which \u201creliably activates the prefrontal cortex.\u201d Of the 30 days I tried meditating \u2014 I stare at a spot on the wall, and repeatedly clear my mind \u2014 I was unable to focus eight times and fell asleep once. But two of the sessions led to the most productive workdays I\u2019ve had all year.I also noticed good results with memorization techniques wherein you create images in your mind. One of these is a rhyme that runs, \u201cOne is a bun, two is a shoe, three is a tree\u201d and so on up to 10. Thus, if given a list of words to memorize that starts \u201csally, smokey, desperate,\u201d I\u2019d first imagine the \u201cAll in the Family\u201d co-star Sally Struthers bursting from a hot dog bun; then a pair of shoes being barbecued; and then a tree whose roots spell out \u201ckill me now.\u201d Equally effective was imagining walking through our apartment and finding the 10 words, in groups of two or three, in various rooms. So, I\u2019d imagine opening our front door and finding Sally Struthers, on fire, playing a nonspeaking juror on \u201cLaw and Order.\u201dIn the end? I will probably keep meditating. I will definitely keep imagining 1970s sitcom stars emerging from breadstuffs. To celebrate my gains, I thought about buying Robert Wright\u2019s \u201cWhy Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.\u201d But, given my attention deficit, the better bet might be Mike McCormack\u2019s much-lauded novel \u201cSolar Bones,\u201d about an Irishman ruminating, Molly Bloom-style, on his whole life: It\u2019s written as one sentence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Flurry of Lawsuits Filed to Fight Repeal of Net Neutrality", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The legal fight against the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s recent repeal of so-called net neutrality regulations began on Tuesday, with a flurry of lawsuits filed to block the agency\u2019s action.One suit, filed by 21 state attorneys general, said the agency\u2019s actions broke federal law. The commission\u2019s rollback of net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d the attorneys general said, and a reversal of the agency\u2019s longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, said the new F.C.C. rules would harm internet entrepreneurs who could be forced to pay fees for faster delivery of their content and services to consumers. A similar argument was made by another group that filed a suit, the Open Technology Institute, a part of a liberal think tank, the New America Foundation.Suits were also filed on Tuesday by Free Press and Public Knowledge, two public interest groups. Four of the suits were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Free Press suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers \u2014 allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online,\u201d said Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the suit by the state officials.The lawsuits have long been expected. The filings on Tuesday, petitions to begin the suits, kick off what is expected to be an extended legal and political debate about the future of internet policy.Democrats have rallied to fight the F.C.C.\u2019s repeal of net neutrality, which was passed in a 3-to-2 party line vote in December. The agency is led by Ajit Pai, a Republican nominated by President Trump. All of the attorneys general involved in the suit filed on Tuesday are Democrats.The lawsuits have the support of the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech firms including Google and Netflix, giving the various legal challenges financial support and the clout of companies. The companies say internet service providers have the incentive to block and throttle their sites in order to garner extra fees.The F.C.C. declined to comment on the suits. But it did point to a part of its order that prohibits legal challenges until the new rules are submitted into the federal registry. The F.C.C. is expected to enter the new rules into the federal registry in the coming days or weeks.The states said they could file a petition to the United States Court of Appeals, starting the process to determine which court would hear the case. That is the action the attorneys general, as well as Mozilla and the Open Technology Institute, took on Tuesday.The states that signed onto the lawsuit include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said the decision to roll back the agency\u2019s declaration of broadband as a utility-like service will harm consumers.\u201cInternet access is a utility \u2014 just like water and electricity,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in a statement. \u201cAnd every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider.\u201dIn a release, Mr. Schneiderman said the agency\u2019s roll back disregarded a record of evidence that internet service providers\u2019 could harm consumers without rules. A similar argument was made by Mozilla.\u201cEnding net neutrality could end the internet as we know it,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla\u2019s chief business and legal officer in a blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are committed to fighting the order. In particular, we filed our petition today because we believe the recent F.C.C. decision violates both federal law as well as harms internet users and innovators.\u201dThe issue of net neutrality has been fought in court challenges twice before in the past decade. The rules adopted in 2015, which set rules that sites could not be blocked or throttled, were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals in 2016 after legal challenges by telecom companies. The F.C.C. vote in December was to roll back those 2015 rules.Success by members of Congress is unlikely, particularly in the House, where Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would have to agree to bring the resolution to a vote. The president will also have to agree to the resolutions, if they were passed, but the White House has expressed its support of the rollback of net neutrality rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "FeatureYes, it\u2019s driven by greed \u2014 but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.Supported bylayer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maidOn the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fusion GPS Founder Hauled From the Shadows for the Russia Election Investigation", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From the start, he was a central casting misfire \u2014 the dark artist slicing through the capital by electric scooter, a cloak-and-dagger digger better known to former colleagues for scratching his bare belly in plain office view.Mr. Simpson\u2019s life has not been boring for some time now. It has, perhaps inevitably, become news.As investigators circle President Trump\u2019s administration over ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Simpson, a 53-year-old Wall Street Journal veteran-turned-master of high-dollar research, has arrived at the biggest story of either of his careers, lurching to the center of the Russia-tinged scandal that clouds the presidency.For months, Mr. Simpson\u2019s name has ricocheted across the halls of Congress and the airwaves of Fox News, becoming shorthand in conservative circles for purported investigatory overreach and counterconspiracies against the White House. Questions about his research have become central to Republican attempts to discredit not just Fusion but the very existence of inquiries into Mr. Trump, including the efforts of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Simpson himself has been hauled before three congressional committees for some 20 hours of questions and answers, placing him among the most significant players in the Trump-Russia affair, if math is the metric.\u201cUncooperative,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said of Mr. Simpson\u2019s turn before the Judiciary Committee, which he leads.\u201cVery cooperative,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Simpson also appeared.Mr. Simpson can be both of these things \u2014 according to interviews with dozens of friends, colleagues and investigative targets \u2014 and a few more: brash, obsessive, occasionally paranoid, perhaps with cause.The name of the firm, founded in 2010, was intended to represent a \u201cfusion\u201d of journalism and business intelligence. The \u201cGPS\u201d hinted aspirationally at a global reach.In practice, Fusion\u2019s task has often translated, roughly, to finding unsavory things about unsavory people, at the behest of not-especially-savory clients. The firm often represents corporations, hedge funds or law firms, providing a sort of public-records forensics that resembles journalism. It leans on its understanding of the news media, and its contacts among reporters, to elevate its clients and squeeze their adversaries.In election years, political opposition research can consume more of Mr. Simpson\u2019s time, with bipartisan demand.The pay is good. And the targets are rich.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out the puzzle,\u201d said Stuart Karle, a friend and the former general counsel for The Journal. \u201cThat animates him. It always has.\u201dMore notable to some lawmakers is Mr. Simpson\u2019s connection to two figures with deep bonds to Russian power, who have long fought for a pet Kremlin cause: Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a lawyer known as a formidable Moscow insider.The two have worked to turn back the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 American law detested by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, that punishes Russian human rights violators. And together with Mr. Simpson, the trio worked on behalf of a Russian-owned company accused by the United States government of laundering some of the funds stolen in a fraud uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, after whom the act was named.\u201cHe\u2019s a professional smear campaigner and liar for money,\u201d Mr. Browder said of Mr. Simpson. \u201cThe credibility of anything that he does is in question.\u201dMr. Simpson was in court with Ms. Veselnitskaya hours before the Trump Tower meeting and saw her again shortly after it, his lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, confirmed. But these contacts were related to Mr. Simpson\u2019s work on the case for BakerHostetler, Mr. Levy said, and Fusion only learned about the Trump Tower meeting in news reports last year.\u201cWe collect facts,\u201d Fusion said in a statement, describing itself as a research company. \u201cOccasionally, the facts turn out to be helpful to people we deplore, like Vladimir Putin, or undermine people for whom we have considerable sympathy, like William Browder.\u201dFor his efforts, Mr. Simpson has been presented with a defamation lawsuit and a congressional subpoena demanding bank records, which the firm is fighting in court, saying it could jeopardize a confidential client list in an industry where privacy is paramount. A legal defense fund has been formed, one of Fusion\u2019s lawyers, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., said, adding that the firm\u2019s legal costs had by now outstripped all compensation for investigations into Mr. Trump and his links to Russia during the campaign.But the work has not stopped. Fusion continues to look into ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, according to several people briefed on the research. Mr. Simpson\u2019s specific areas of focus, and information about any current benefactors, are closely guarded.\u201cGlenn\u2019s a relentlessly digging sort of guy,\u201d said Tim Burger, a friend and former colleague. \u201cIf there is a document out there about anything, he will find it.\u201dThe marriage made enough sense on paper: the former spy and the former scribe, feeling their way through second acts of lives spent investigating furtive actors who preferred to be left alone.Mr. Steele, now in his 50s, had worked undercover in Moscow in the 1990s, later serving as the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6.Like Mr. Simpson, he had changed careers in 2009, opening his own commercial intelligence firm.Like Mr. Simpson, according to people who know them, he came to hold a dark view of Mr. Putin.Mr. Simpson connected with Mr. Steele, whom he had met in 2009, when they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance who knew of their shared interest in investigating Russian corruption. They quickly got to work.As a former spy inside Russia, Mr. Steele was ill positioned to travel there himself. He hired native speakers to call informants inside the country and communicated discreetly with his own connections.The research also described a series of contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.In time, Mr. Steele shared some of his information with the F.B.I.\u201cHe felt he was witnessing a national security crime in progress,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who declined to be interviewed for this article but addressed some questions via email. \u201cI did not object, and did not ask for permission from our clients. Chris was the national security professional, so I deferred to him.\u201dBy then, Mr. Simpson\u2019s period of relative anonymity had come and gone, replaced by a spotlight that has exacerbated the kind of distrust endemic to his line of work.His name was back in the paper the next day. It had been awhile since that happened against his will.Mr. Simpson was a high school senior, not yet 18.It was nearly graduation for Conestoga High School\u2019s Class of 1982, and Mr. Simpson capped the first day of spring at his family\u2019s home in a Philadelphia suburb with a Saturday night party, stocked with alcohol. After an evening of hard drinking, a friend staggered outside and into the road. He was struck by a car and killed.At once, a reckoning gripped the region. Mr. Simpson\u2019s mother, Jane, was charged with allowing her son to hold the party. A front-page article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, centered on Mr. Simpson\u2019s gathering, detailed the rise of binge drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a release,\u201d Mr. Simpson was quoted telling the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to forget.\u201dThe most serious charges against Mrs. Simpson were dismissed. But the episode was an early signpost of an often tumultuous life for her son, vacillating from swashbuckling fact-finding to bursts of trauma and back again.In his early 20s, as a student at George Washington University, Mr. Simpson broke his neck in a car crash. In his late 30s, he turned back spinal cancer.\u201cHe had a very strong sort of ethical backbone,\u201d said Jim Glassman, the former editor in chief of Roll Call, a publication dedicated to covering Congress and Mr. Simpson\u2019s professional home before he joined The Journal. \u201cHe was a terrific reporter, kind of a prodigy.\u201dBefore long, the book industry beckoned. Mr. Simpson\u2019s \u201cDirty Little Secrets,\u201d written with Larry J. Sabato, focused on political corruption.One section tackled the burgeoning field of opposition research: \u201cThere is relatively easy money to be made,\u201d it read. \u201cThe scrupulous and unscrupulous alike are attracted to offer their wares.\u201dBy the time he reached The Journal in 1995, Mr. Simpson had assumed an eclectic place among the capital\u2019s constellation of influencers \u2014 a hard-charging reporter with a deep Rolodex, a weakness for Bob Dylan and an unquenchable thirst for revelry, mischievous or otherwise. The weekend of his Arkansas wedding to Mary Jacoby, who was also at Roll Call, included skeet shooting, chicken fried steak and a write-up previewing the festivities in The Washington Post.His home in Washington\u2019s Friendship Heights became a rollicking hub for journalists blowing off steam, with sporadic appearances from political power brokers. His Journal desk became a gathering place for half-eaten sandwiches and burps he would not bother stifling.After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. Simpson turned his attention abroad, eventually relocating to Brussels, pursuing stories on the financial sources of terrorism. He was sued repeatedly in foreign courts. The Journal suffered losses in legal fees, if not credibility, on his account.\u201cGlenn Simpson changed 800 years of English libel law,\u201d Mr. Karle, the paper\u2019s former general counsel, said of one case. \u201cIt was the first significant decision from the House of Lords that found that a journalist had behaved well.\u201dBy the late 2000s, the ground at The Journal, and across journalism, had begun to shift. Rupert Murdoch assumed control of the newspaper. The industry, generally, allowed less latitude for the kinds of costly, long-term investigations that were Mr. Simpson\u2019s trade.In 2009, Mr. Simpson announced he was leaving the profession to start SNS Global, a research company that predated Fusion, with a Journal peer, Susan Schmidt. On his last day, former reporters there recalled, Mr. Simpson brought his dog, a dachshund-beagle mix named Irving, to join him in the office, loudly encouraging him to defecate near some editors. (It is not clear if Irving obliged.)But before he was gone, Mr. Simpson had wandered down rabbit holes that would prove instructive.The name has not helped.\u201cFUSION GPS SCANDAL,\u201d read a recent headline from Sean Hannity on Fox News, stretching across the top of a studio monitor. From this screen, he connected a series of rectangles with short white lines to allege a Fusion-powered megaconspiracy against Mr. Trump.Yet Fusion\u2019s typical mandate, even defenders acknowledge, is not dripping with nobility.Few Washington industries traffic in sainthood. Many are mercenary in nature. And Fusion seems to be of a piece, hustling for its cut from an office in Dupont Circle.Amid skepticism over the dossier, Fusion has trumpeted Mr. Steele\u2019s strong standing in the intelligence community, noting that the former spy is trained to screen out disinformation.Still, at a firm that casts itself as a collector of facts, the dossier is not the equivalent of a finished news article, in journalism parlance. It is more a compilation of prepublication notes, requiring further vetting.But Mr. Simpson has bristled at the idea that the dossier is some kind of liberal fever dream. Its broad conclusions \u2014 once outlandish themselves \u2014 have already proved prescient, the firm has argued. Sometimes the conspiracy is true.\u201cMore than a year has gone by since these memos were produced,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cI have not become aware of any disinformation.\u201dDavid Enrich contributed reporting from New York.

They would let me play and do my own version of what they said. I would say 75 to 85 percent of it was me.Did you have to audition?I auditioned like four times. The final was a Skype audition with the director. It was super uncomfortable. I\u2019m not used to auditioning over Skype. I\u2019m used to doing other things on Skype. I said, \u201cIf I start coming out of my shirt or something like that, remind me where I\u2019m out.\u201d They had me do the character four or five different ways, and two weeks later I got the job and had to fly to New Orleans in three days.Had you met your co-stars before? Were you intimidated working with them? I hadn\u2019t met anybody. I was ready for it. I feel like they\u2019re people just like I\u2019m a person, so why would I be intimidated? We\u2019re all the same. I was just excited. Very excited.You were the first black female comic to ever host \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d What did that feel like, breaking that barrier?I had auditioned for \u201cS.N.L.\u201d three different times, so to me it was, \u201cFinally, I\u2019m here.\u201d And I was super grateful to be there in that capacity, as opposed to as a regular performer. To be a host is a super big honor. I couldn\u2019t believe I was the first black woman comedian to do it. I Googled and saw that Whoopi Goldberg had been on it, so I reached out to her. I said, \u201cHave you ever done \u201cS.N.L.\u201d? She said, \u201cOnly a sketch.\u201d I said, \u201cYou never hosted?\u201d And she said, \u201cYou the first, bitch, you better do a good job.\u201dWas it a surprise, winning the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best supporting actress? I didn\u2019t know that existed. I had to ask people, \u201cWhat is the importance of it?\u201d Jada called me and told me, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She was like, \u201cGirl, it is an honor.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy is it an honor?\u201d And she said, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor because they don\u2019t like people.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah they do, they gotta like somebody.\u201d And she said, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get in. You did a good job.\u201d I still had to Google them to try to figure out how prestigious they were.Well thank you for taking the time. It\u2019s been wonderful speaking with you. Thank you, it\u2019s wonderful speaking with you too, girl. I hope you get a million dollars or meet the man of your dreams. I hope something magical happens for you, girl.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Adds More Scrutiny to Top-Tier Videos", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since, YouTube has been scrambling to come up with new policies that give advertisers more control over where their ads go and provide additional assurance that the videos on the online service are better screened.\u201cThere\u2019s no denying 2017 was a difficult year, with several issues affecting our community and our advertising partners,\u201d Paul Muret, a Google vice president, wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe are passionate about protecting our users, advertisers and creators and making sure YouTube is not a place that can be co-opted by bad actors.\u201dThe company said the YouTube Partner Program would now accept advertisements only for video creators whose videos have garnered 4,000 \u201cwatch hours\u201d over the last 12 months and have at least 1,000 subscribers. YouTube said a four-minute video watched by more than 60,000 people would most likely surpass that watch hours threshold.The new standard is an update to a rule, announced in April, that said only creators with more than 10,000 lifetime views on their videos would be able to collect advertising money. YouTube said a standard based solely on views did not filter out enough \u201cbad actors\u201d and that coupling the watch hours with subscribers would make it harder to game the system.The challenge for YouTube is to make sure advertisements don\u2019t show up next to troublesome content without cutting off the revenue stream of smaller video makers whose niche content helps make YouTube different from mainstream television.YouTube also pledged that humans would screen all videos from creators who are part of Google Preferred, which the company says is limited to the top 5 percent of all content on YouTube when measured by popularity and engagement. YouTube created the Google Preferred tier as a way to assure advertisers that they could place advertisements on the best YouTube content, while allowing creators to generate guaranteed revenue from videos.In the blog post, YouTube said all of the Google Preferred videos in the United States would be vetted by humans by mid-February. The new monitoring system will extend globally by the end of March.While Google has long argued that the volume of video content on YouTube makes it hard to rely solely on human screeners, computers have not mastered the nuances required to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate content.In December, YouTube said it planned to hire thousands of reviewers to screen content on the site and remove inappropriate content.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Restaurant Where the Bathroom Soap Complements the Meal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI like to get a bit of a surprise when I go to the bathroom at a restaurant,\u201d the Danish chef Adam Aamann explains when asked why he has taken a hands-on approach \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to the restrooms in his new restaurant. Diners freshening up at Aamanns 1921 \u2014 which opened in Copenhagen in August and offers a modern take on classic Danish cuisine \u2014 are given a choice of two liquid soaps. One smells of lemon, cedar, bergamot and thyme; the other carries notes of lemon, bergamot, orange and rosemary. Both were handmade by Aamann himself.\u201cI like to throw myself at things I haven\u2019t tried before,\u201d he says, standing in the kitchen of his three-story house in Osterbro, one of Copenhagen\u2019s smartest neighborhoods. \u201cI also thought it would be an extraordinary way of tickling people.\u201dIt won\u2019t surprise seasoned observers of the Danish culinary scene that Aamann is making his own soap. The 43-year-old is credited with restoring the reputation of smorrebrod. The dish had fallen out of fashion when, in 2006, Aamann opened a deli in Copenhagen and began making it with fresh, seasonal ingredients produced from scratch, such as fermented herring, pickled vegetables and sourdough bread. (For Aamanns 1921, he even bought a stone mill so that he could produce his own flour.)At the time, Aamann\u2019s decision to focus on smorrebrod was unusual: Few chefs took the lunchtime staple seriously, while contemporaries such as Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the head chef at Noma, were focused on the big picture \u2014 promoting sustainability, seasonality and Nordic culinary traditions such as fermenting and curing to bring about a food revolution and change the way Danes ate. But Aamann\u2019s gambit paid off, and today he\u2019s one of Denmark\u2019s best known chefs: He is the author of four cookbooks, presents a food program on DR, Denmark\u2019s public service broadcaster, and in 2007 received a prestigious award from the Danish Gastronomic Academy. Last year\u2019s launch of Aamanns 1921 \u2014 his fourth restaurant \u2014 merely confirmed his reputation as Copenhagen\u2019s smorrebrod king.Still, most restaurateurs might have found someone else to produce \u2014 if not procure \u2014 the soap used in their restaurant\u2019s bathrooms. Both of those options were \u201con the table, too, of course,\u201d Aamann says. But, of soapmaking, he says, \u201cBut then I Googled it and saw it wasn\u2019t that complicated.\u201dTo prove his point, Aamann sets up a production line on his kitchen countertop, where last August he produced about 20 liters of soap for the new restaurant. His method involves combining precise amounts of organic ingredients \u2014 including distilled water, foaming agents and aromatic essential oils \u2014 which he buys online.He begins by combining oils in a jar, counting each drop sotto voce, and jotting down the total \u2014 a procedure that makes him resemble an apothecary. Aamann tests numerous combinations, constantly making adjustments. (\u201cLet\u2019s try 10 drops of thyme, seven of lemon.\u201d) Sometimes he crinkles his nose. (\u201cToo much mint, it\u2019s a bit toothpaste-y.\u201d) Other times he beams as if he\u2019s solved a puzzle. Once satisfied with the ratio, he scales up the quantities and mixes everything in a large aluminum bowl.Indeed, with its spoons and spatulas, the process resembles baking \u2014 though Aamann likens it to making snaps, the distilled spirit that\u2019s flavored with botanicals and typically paired with smorrebrod. \u201cYou could make a nice snaps using quince, but you might need something else to give it edge, like oak,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with soap. If you use cedar oil, which is warm and spicy, it would go with herbs such as rosemary and thyme, or citric oils like bergamot.\u201d (Other advice for would-be soapmakers? \u201cFollow your nose.\u201d)So far, diners are delighted with Aamann\u2019s soap. \u201cIt\u2019s had a huge impact on guests, with many wanting to know where to buy it,\u201d he says. His peers, however, are \u201cannoyed they didn\u2019t come up with the idea themselves,\u201d he jokes.Aamann has no plans to sell his soap, however. Instead, he wants to ramp up production and make enough for all of his restaurants. And with supplies of the first batch running low, Aamann is working on new \u201crecipes,\u201d using ginger, mint and cinnamon. But he won\u2019t be drawn out on the details. After all, it\u2019s meant to be a surprise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Push Back After Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures.Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action.\u201cThere tends to be a follow-on effect, particularly when something happens in a big state like California,\u201d said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at nonprofit consumer group, Public Knowledge, which supports net neutrality efforts by the states.Bills have also been introduced in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Washington. The issue has also attracted some support in governor mansions. In Washington, for example, Gov. Jay Inslee reiterated his support for a state law in a speech this week.\u201cWhen Washington, D.C., takes away that protection, we must protect net neutrality for our people, for our businesses and for the virtues of free speech,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said.And any such state law could be challenged in courts. The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new order, which rolled back rules passed in 2015, blocks state and city governments from creating their own net neutrality laws. The commission said different state laws were too difficult for an internet service provider, like Verizon or Charter, to follow because the internet does not recognize state borders and transfers traffic between states.\u201cThe internet is the ultimate form of interstate commerce, which is clearly only within the authority of the F.C.C.,\u201d said Bret Swanson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in telecommunications policy.\u201cPeople should not be intimidated by the F.C.C. simply saying it has pre-emptive authority, and we need to dig into the sources of that claim, which are a lot weaker than the F.C.C. makes it out to be,\u201d said State Representative Drew Hansen, a Democrat who has introduced one of two net neutrality bills in Washington in recent weeks.The Federal Communications Commission declined to comment but pointed to the section of its order that pre-empts states from creating their own net neutrality rules.Supporters of net neutrality are attacking the agency\u2019s repeal of the 2015 rules in other ways as well. On Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced that he had enough support to force a vote on a congressional resolution to bring back the rules. He gained an important Republican supporter, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who said she would vote in favor of it. Such a measure is a long shot in the House, however, and would also need President Trump\u2019s signature.\u201cNet neutrality will be a major issue in the 2018 campaigns, and we are going to let everyone know where we stand and where they stand,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference, warning Republicans to vote in favor of the Democratic-led resolution.In addition, lawsuits against the commission are expected shortly after the policy becomes official. Last week, a lobbying group for big technology companies including Facebook, Google and Netflix announced that it planned to join the lawsuits, giving the opposition substantial new resources. More than a dozen state attorneys general have also announced plans to sue the commission.But state lawmakers say they cannot wait around to see what happens with those efforts.State Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who introduced the other bill in Washington, said net neutrality was an important safeguard for small businesses that might not be able to pay internet service companies for fast speeds. Even though Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the repeal, she said many Republicans in her state supported her bill.\u201cThis is not a partisan issue here,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cEveryone is concerned about equal access to the internet and being able to participate in the 21st-century economy.\u201d\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t protect consumers, the State of California will,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.In New York, Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat, said a few internet service providers already had too much power over the marketplace and should not be given the ability to charge websites more for faster delivery to users.This month, she introduced a bill that would hold back state telecom projects from broadband providers that blocked, throttled or gave priority to sites that paid for faster access. Legislators in Rhode Island and North Carolina have introduced or are considering similar bills that are more focused on government contracts than telecom law, they say.\u201cWe are threading a needle here,\u201d Ms. Fahy said, \u201cbut this is the best way to get at consumer protection, because state projects are huge and this will really affect the internet service providers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Gunman Took Elaborate Steps to Hide His Tracks, New Documents Show", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he meticulously planned the Las Vegas attack, the man responsible for the worst mass shooting in modern American history took elaborate steps to stymie the inevitable law enforcement investigation, according to federal court documents unsealed on Friday.The F.B.I. search warrants shed new light on the degree to which the gunman, Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others when he opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October, planned the attack and prepared for the aftermath. One of the warrants described how Mr. Paddock \u201cdestroyed or tried to hide digital media devices.\u201dInvestigators said he used anonymous communications devices, including a prepaid cellphone, to cover his tracks and employed a \u201clevel of sophistication which is commonly found in mass casualty events.\u201d\u201cPaddock planned the attack meticulously and took many methodical steps to avoid detection of his plot and to thwart the eventual law enforcement investigation that would follow,\u201d the F.B.I. said.Mr. Paddock\u2019s motive for the attack remains unknown.The search warrants, which were approved by judges shortly after the shooting, said three cellphones belonging to Mr. Paddock were found in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, including two that investigators searched and one that they could not unlock. An F.B.I. agent wrote that he believed \u201cif there were any information related to a potential conspiracy, it would be found within\u201d the locked phone, which used a Google operating system.The search warrants detail how law enforcement focused on Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Mr. Paddock. She has not been charged with a crime and has spoken to investigators several times, and her lawyer has said she was not aware of Mr. Paddock\u2019s deadly plans. The investigation is continuing, and the warrants only reflect its early stages.\u201cShe has been identified thus far as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack,\u201d according to one of the documents.She told investigators she occasionally helped Mr. Paddock load magazines. The F.B.I. said there was no evidence that she knew of his plans or had been deceptive, but it cautioned soon after the shootings that she was still the \u201csubject of intensive review.\u201dMs. Danley corroborated much of what had been previously pieced together by investigators, but she has been adamant that she had no prior knowledge of Mr. Paddock\u2019s intention to carry out the mass shooting.According to the documents, it appears that Mr. Paddock relied on the internet to buy many of the items used in the attack, including guns and ammunition, during the 12 months leading up to it.He spent \u201csignificant time and expense prior to the attack purchasing and caching weapons\u201d and other items, such as glass cutters and suitcases. The authorities have said he used the glass cutters so he could fire out of his hotel window at the people below, who were attending a country music concert.Much of what investigators found in the hotel room had already been made public, but the search warrants add additional details. The F.B.I. said there were hundreds of rounds of spent ammunition as well as \u201cpreloaded high-capacity magazines,\u201d found in suitcases that Mr. Paddock had brought to the room. Investigators also found body armor, range finders and a homemade gas mask.Investigators also revealed that Mr. Paddock may have been treated for \u201cunidentified medical conditions.\u201d In October, Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock\u2019s physical and mental health seemed to have deteriorated in recent months.In an affidavit submitted as part of a search warrant application, an investigator said that access to Ms. Danley\u2019s email account could \u201clead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan and Marilou Danley\u2019s possible involvement.\u201d The authorities also requested information about several Instagram accounts that they believed were connected to Ms. Danley.In their requests for data from Instagram, investigators said they were seeking \u201cevidence showing the possession, use, purchase or sale of firearms, firearms accessories, ammunition or explosives by Paddock.\u201d They also sought information about Ms. Danley\u2019s \u201cstate of mind as it relates to the crime under investigation\u201d and the identities of anyone who communicated with her about what would amount to violations of federal weapons laws.Ms. Danley deleted her Facebook account just hours after the attack, investigators wrote in their affidavit. At 12:30 a.m., about two-and-a-half hours after the shooting began, she changed the status of her account to private. By 2:46 a.m., she had deleted the account entirely.In September, the court records suggested, Mr. Paddock ordered from Amazon a holographic weapon sight that investigators believe he ultimately used during the assault. On Friday night, Amazon listed the same model, which was described as \u201cdesigned for close-in combat speed and versatility.\u201d The price is $429, according to the listing, which said the sight \u201cimproves target acquisition, boosts accuracy and increases control.\u201dThe F.B.I. also discovered emails between two accounts connected to Mr. Paddock. One from early July indicated that Mr. Paddock had begun taking steps to carry out the attack, referring to a \u201cbump stock,\u201d an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster.In an email Mr. Paddock sent on July 6 to an account that also may have belonged to him, he wrote: \u201ctry an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area.\u201d Another email sent between the accounts read, \u201cfor a thrill try out bumpfire ar\u2019s with a 100 round magazine.\u201d By \u201car,\u201d Mr. Paddock appeared to be referring to rifles.The affidavit later adds that \u201cinvestigators have been unable to figure out why Stephen Paddock would be exchanging messages related to weapons that were used in the attack between two of his email accounts,\u201d and that it was possible that someone else was controlling one of the accounts. If that was the case, the investigator said, the F.B.I. needed to identify that person. Receiving a search warrant for that account \u201cwill lead investigators to determine the full scope of Stephen Paddock\u2019s plan,\u201d an F.B.I agent wrote to the judge.Alan Blinder and Mitch Smith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Extends Surveillance Law, Rejecting New Privacy Safeguards", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to extend the National Security Agency\u2019s warrantless surveillance program for six years with minimal changes, rejecting a push by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to impose significant privacy limits when it sweeps up Americans\u2019 emails and other personal communications.The vote, 256 to 164, centered on an expiring law that permits the government, without a warrant, to collect communications from United States companies like Google and AT&T of foreigners abroad \u2014 even when those targets are talking to Americans. Congress had enacted the law in 2008 to legalize a form of a once-secret warrantless surveillance program created after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Hours before the vote, President Trump set off last-minute turmoil as Republicans scrambled to secure enough support to extend the law without new privacy constraints.The legislation must still pass the Senate. But fewer senators appear to favor major change to spying laws, so the vote on Thursday in the House was the pivotal test.Effectively, the vote was almost certainly the end of a debate over 21st-century surveillance and privacy rights that broke out in 2013 after the leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden.The Senate began considering the newly approved House bill on Thursday afternoon; Senators Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, are expected to oppose the measure in the coming days. But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, moved to essentially ensure that no amendments to the House legislation would be considered, and it appeared to be on a path to final approval when senators return to Washington next week.Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures in 2013 ushered in a period of intense interest in surveillance. Civil libertarians and conservative skeptics of government power worked together to push for new limits, while intelligence and law enforcement agencies and their backers in Congress from across party lines \u2014 and in both the Obama and Trump administrations \u2014 tried to hold the line.The post-Snowden privacy movement secured its largest victory in 2015 when Congress voted to end and replace one of the programs that Mr. Snowden exposed, under which the N.S.A. had been secretly collecting logs of Americans\u2019 domestic phone calls in bulk. But lawmakers who hoped to add significant privacy constraints to the warrantless surveillance program, too, fell short on Thursday.Before voting to extend the law, known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, the House rejected an amendment that would have imposed a series of new safeguards. That proposal included a requirement that officials obtain warrants in most cases before hunting for, and reading, emails and other messages of Americans that were swept up under the surveillance.Supporters of those changes contended that the overhaul was needed to preserve Fourth Amendment privacy rights in the internet era. But intelligence and law enforcement officials argued that it was unnecessary, and dangerous, to limit security officials from being able to freely gain access to information the government already possessed.Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican of California who leads the House Intelligence Committee, celebrated the outcome. \u201cThe House of Representatives has taken a big step to ensure the continuation of one of the intelligence community\u2019s most vital tools for tracking foreign terrorists,\u201d he said.The program\u2019s surveillance can be used for all foreign intelligence purposes. The sharpest points of the debate centered on when information about Americans that is gathered by the program can be used for criminal investigations unrelated to terrorism.Representative Justin Amash, the Republican of Michigan who sponsored the privacy measures, expressed disappointment but vowed to keep fighting.\u201cWe had a bipartisan coalition who worked very hard to protect people\u2019s rights, and we will continue to fight and continue to educate our colleagues about it,\u201d Mr. Amash said.The House bill that was approved on Thursday does contain a gesture toward requiring officials to obtain a warrant to read Americans\u2019 emails that are collected under the program. But it is written so narrowly that it will not protect the overwhelming majority of citizens\u2019 information that is queried in the warrantless surveillance repository.Specifically, a warrant would be required only if an F.B.I. agent wants to look at emails about a subject of an open criminal investigation for which there is no national security angle. It would not apply to security-related queries by any intelligence or law-enforcement agency, nor to requests from F.B.I. agents who are following up on criminal tips but have not yet opened formal investigations.Matthew Olsen, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency and the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said that while he had concerns about how the F.B.I. would distinguish between criminal and national security cases, the overall thrust of the bill was a positive step.\u201cCongress has made clear that it is lawful to search using U.S. person identifiers for information that could help stop terror attacks and catch spies without a warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the way the intelligence community has been operating under 702, and that is the way it will continue to operate if this bill becomes law.\u201dBut Mr. Amash expressed hope that Mr. Trump might yet intervene to push for more changes to the legislation in the Senate.Just before debate began on Thursday, the president posted a statement on Twitter that suggested skepticism about the surveillance bill.Mr. Trump wrote the message shortly after a libertarian legal analyst on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Andrew Napolitano, appealed directly to him to go another route. Mr. Napolitano added that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cwoes\u201d began with surveillance.The president\u2019s tweet enraged Republican leaders who have been trying to renew the 702 law more or less intact. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Mr. Trump spoke by phone until he posted his next message, a senior Republican congressional aide said.Fewer than two hours later, the president appeared to reverse himself on the issue in another statement on Twitter.Despite the confusion, Republican leaders pushed forward, counting on moderate Democrats and Republicans to reject the proposed overhaul and pass the extension bill. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, lobbied members in a House cloakroom before the vote.Some of the most conservative Republicans in the House joined with some of the most liberal Democrats in the failed bid for more privacy protections. Ultimately, 58 Republicans joined 125 Democrats in voting for the overhaul amendment, while 55 Democrats joined 178 Republicans in rejecting it. On Twitter, Mr. Snowden observed that it would have passed had fewer Democrats broken ranks.But Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said afterward that by rejecting the overhaul amendment, the House had avoided imposing \u201ca crippling requirement in national security and terrorism cases.\u201d\u201cWe were certainly thrown into plenty of turmoil with the president\u2019s tweets this morning and that made everything look quite speculative,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cI do think the underlying bill makes a sensible compromise.\u201dNoah Weiland contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Even on the Internet, What\u2019s Old Is New Again", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryIt is indisputable that the internet \u2014 facilitated by both vast improvements in access and computing power \u2014 has had a disruptive impact on not just business but politics and many aspects of our daily lives. Demonstrating precisely what that impact is, however, has been remarkably challenging. Pronouncements on the topic have a tendency to be overblown. \u201cTransformational,\u201d \u201cexponential\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d are increasingly favored adjectives, whether they are applicable or not.The impression that the world is changing faster today than ever before has become conventional wisdom. Yet the magnitude of change that occurred between when America galloped into World War I on horses and dropped the atomic bomb feels more significant than that undergone since the first dot-com domain name was registered. This observation is not meant to diminish the importance of the seismic changes wrought by the digital age, but rather to suggest the relevance of historical context often absent from the conversation.The internet itself is a network of networks. The ability to communicate and transact across its vast reach is indeed unprecedented and represents the basic infrastructure of what has been termed the \u201cnetwork society.\u201d Mr. Ferguson\u2019s book does far more than simply track the use of the word \u201cnetwork\u201d from its introduction in English language publications in the late 19th century, when it \u201cwas scarcely used,\u201d to the modern day, when he points out that it appeared in 136 articles in The New York Times during just the first week of 2017. Rather he seeks to reframe the entirety of human history as an endless tug-of-war between eras in which powerful hierarchical institutions predominate (the Tower of the title) only to be undermined by the influence of emerging networks (the corresponding Square). In Professor Ferguson\u2019s telling, these networks are invariably co-opted by reconstituted hierarchies and the process begins again.The new industrial, financial and communications networks that emerged during this time did not, however, overturn the hierarchical nature of things. This dominant structure survived both world wars, according to Professor Ferguson, with the mid-twentieth century actually representing the \u201czenith of hierarchy.\u201d His account shows how the ability to navigate and influence these and other nascent networks determined which empires thrived in the reconfigured hierarchical orders.One does not have to completely buy in to the book\u2019s reframing of key social and political turning points to find the narrative both captivating and compelling. Whether describing the surprisingly ineffective 18th century network of the mysterious Illuminati that continue to be the subject of crank conspiracy theorists or the shockingly effective 20th century network of Cambridge University spies working for the Soviets, Professor Ferguson manages both to tell a good story and provide important insight into the specific qualities that power successful networks.Attempting to cover so much ground in such short space (\u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is less than half the length of Professor Ferguson\u2019s recent biography of Henry Kissinger) risks fatal oversimplification. The book\u2019s most impressive accomplishment is to avoid such a fate. Professor Ferguson provides a credible summary of contemporary network theory and makes clear that \u201ca hierarchy is just a special kind of network\u201d in which nodes communicate up and down but never connect laterally. There are no true pure hierarchies \u2014 Stalin\u2019s Russia probably comes closest \u2014 and the greatest strength of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that it generally avoids caricature. Instead, it emphasizes the critical questions of what distinguishes network effectiveness and what happens when networks interact.Professor Ferguson brings us up to the present with a discussion of the technology giants that have emerged in the last few decades. His focus is on their political and economic influence. He includes an interesting discussion of the similarities and differences between the impact of the internet and the printing press.There is a burgeoning literature in management journals and business books that focuses on the internet\u2019s influence on business strategy rather than politics. In some ways, this work reflects a variation on the paradigm described by Professor Ferguson. Corresponding to the discussion of \u201cold hierarchies\u201d are businesses that rely on high fixed costs to build barriers to competitive entry, whereas the disruptive \u201cnew networks\u201d are constructed on digital platforms made possible by the internet. These new businesses, it is argued, fuel so-called \u201cnetwork effects\u201d that lead inevitably to winner-take-all marketplaces.These analyses, however, have lacked the historical perspective of \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d In place of the nuanced discussion of how hierarchies and networks interact, is a broad-brush assertion that scale achieved through network effects is inherently superior to that based on old-fashioned fixed costs.In fact, platforms are no more a peculiarly modern phenomenon than networks are, and their digital incarnations are not necessarily better businesses than those that came before. Analog malls had the benefit of their shoppers being many miles away from competing malls and their retail tenants being committed to long-term leases. On the internet, platform competitors are only a click away and relationships are notoriously transactional.The important lesson of \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d is that the existence of a network, or network effects for that matter, should be the beginning not the end of the analysis. The critical questions relate to the network\u2019s key characteristics and how it interacts with other networks and hierarchies.The same is true of platform businesses, which are of highly diverse quality depending on their structural attributes and the ecosystems within which they operate. It is not a coincidence that the two largest and most enduring purely digital platforms \u2014 Google and Amazon \u2014 are not primarily network-effects businesses, but instead are companies that benefit from leveraging multiple, complementary sources of competitive advantage including, notably, traditional fixed-cost scale.Predicting the viability of new business models requires a careful understanding of both history and industry structure. If \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d encourages digital business strategists and venture capitalists to take this to heart, it will have made an important, if unexpected, contribution.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "The Plight of Working Women, as Seen by the Woman in the Corner Office", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionOne wonders what Damore would make of Joanne Lipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said: What Men Need to Know (and Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of title, but one that seems eerily prescient in light of our continuing national conversation about sexual politics in the workplace. Lipman was until recently the editor in chief of USA Today and chief content officer of its parent company, Gannett, and as she documents in her book, even before the exposure this fall of the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s decades of sexual predation (and the swift deposition of powerful men in entertainment, technology, politics, news, art and finance brought down by similar charges), men were already pretty freaked out about what they should and shouldn\u2019t say to their female colleagues. It\u2019s a situation that one could argue has gotten only more complicated since Lipman began writing this investigation into why the gender gap and its offspring \u2014 the wage gap, the achievement gap, the confidence gap, the respect gap, etc. \u2014 persist, despite decades of near parity in the numbers of men and women who work.Lipman has pitched her plea to men, as she understands that they need to be at the forefront of any systemic change, but she seems to understand that her primary readers will most likely be women. (As she discovered while researching her book, most diversity training fails because it puts men on the defensive \u2014 as if they were all guilty of crossing an ever-shifting line. It\u2019s hard to imagine a man eyeing her book and thinking: \u201cJust what I\u2019ve been waiting for! Women tell me what I need to know!\u201d The title of her second chapter, \u201cShe\u2019ll Make You More Successful,\u201d may have more appeal.) Lipman has sympathy for men in power, writing in her introduction that \u201cthe politics and vocabulary of \u2018inclusion\u2019\u201d have made it \u201cmore fraught than ever for men to engage in this dialogue.\u201d Citing the rise of \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and, with them, a pervasive fear of \u201coffending any outsider group,\u201d she asks, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t men \u2014 especially the white men who dominate the upper reaches of business \u2014 be spooked?\u201dIt\u2019s an unfortunate opening salvo, as one could surmise that Lipman\u2019s compassion for white men burdened by the demands of \u201coutsiders\u201d is the organizing principle for what\u2019s to come. It\u2019s not. Instead, she offers a persuasive examination of the innumerable institutionalized prejudices, roadblocks and often unconscious undermining that women face in nearly every aspect of public and private life. Some of her facts will be familiar to H.R. directors, women\u2019s studies scholars and reporters who cover gender equality. They will likely be revelatory to nearly everyone else. Lipman\u2019s not wrong that those with power are loath to give it up: One study by Catalyst, an organization devoted to working women, found that 74 percent of men surveyed on what undermines their support for gender equality said fear \u2014 of loss of status, of other men\u2019s disapproval and of making a mistake \u2014 all of which, Lipman writes, has men \u201cwalking around on eggshells.\u201d But she also believes that most men, certainly those in the upper echelons of management, \u201cdon\u2019t need beating up with a two-by-four. They\u2019d like to see an equitable workplace, they just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do about it.\u201d She\u2019s here to tell them; here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re paying attention.Lipman, a former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and the founding editor of the short-lived Cond\u00e9 Nast business magazine Portfolio, is a skilled assembler of data and a graceful storyteller. She starts with a sketch of just how male by default the universe is, from the standard office temperature (set to accommodate the higher metabolic rate of 40-year-old, 154-pound, suit-wearing men) and male-centric design at Apple (the iPhone 6 Plus was too big for many women\u2019s hands and pockets) to the potentially dangerous side effects for women of the original prescribed doses of Ambien, a drug that was tested only on men, a still-common practice. All due, in part, to the lack of women in decision-making roles across industries and sectors, which, the data clearly show, is a financial mistake.A lot of assertions in the book begin with \u201cstudies have shown\u201d\u2014 a suspicious tactic. (Was the study that found a new potion \u201celiminated every wrinkle in a week\u201d conducted with the 12 people who work at that beauty start-up? Or was it a double-blind, controlled trial by a credible research team?) Yet each fact here is carefully accounted for on the nearly 50 pages of notes at the end of the book. It\u2019s not necessarily persuasive to read that \u201cmultiple studies have found that adding women to all-male teams leads to greater financial success,\u201d but this claim is bolstered by data from several sources, including The Journal of Financial Economics (\u201cFemale executives make more profitable acquisitions and take on less debt than male executives\u201d), Catalyst (\u201cFirms with the most female board members outperform those with the least by almost every financial measure\u201d) and the Credit Suisse Research Institute (\u201cCompanies whose top management is at least half female post returns on equity that are 19 percent higher than average\u201d).In the working world, well, it gets worse: A Carnegie Mellon University study found that when an equal number of job-seeking men and women visited 100 recruitment sites, men were shown the ad for the highest-paying job six times more often than women were. Lipman dismantles the so-called \u201cpipeline theory,\u201d which posits that when women enter the work force at the same rate as men, they will reach management positions in equal numbers. In the early 1990s, more than half of law-school students were women, so, according to the pipeline theory, by now 50 percent of partners at law firms should be women as well. But by 2013, women held just 17 percent of those jobs, a pattern that Lipman says holds steady across \u201cany\u201d industry.She also debunks James Damore\u2019s argument that the lack of gender parity at Google (about 70 percent of its employees are male) is a failure of nature by citing the in-house experts the company assigned to fix the problem. She interviews Brian Welle, a Google data scientist, and Laszlo Bock, a former head of its People Operations, who began working on the issue in 2006 and who eventually determined that Google\u2019s employees \u201cclearly had blind spots about their own prejudices against women and minorities.\u201d (Google\u2019s famously elaborate hiring process, in which candidates are evaluated, primarily by men, for their \u201cGoogleyness\u201d \u2014 the qualities that made them likely to fit in at the company \u2014 presumably had something to do with this.)The Google case study is among several Lipman uses to propel a narrative about the uncertain status of women in the workplace. She recounts how jealousy of the woman who built the Tupperware company into a household name in the 1950s drove its founder to fire her and write her out of the company\u2019s history, and she explains why Iceland is the only country in the world where men and women share power in almost equal numbers: After the global financial crisis of 2008, Icelanders embraced the idea that the bank failures were, as the female director of the country\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it, the result of a \u201cpenis competition\u201d among bankers. Not only did Icelanders jail unscrupulous bankers but they also elected more women to government posts, including that of prime minister, and mandated that women make up 40 percent of corporate boards.Lipman needs these stories to help give dimension to her statistics \u2014 though many women may find the statistics comforting all on their own, if only because they document an unease that many feel but can\u2019t name. For instance: Women are 15 percent less likely to get promoted than men, in part because men get promoted for \u201cpotential,\u201d while women get promoted for performance. And both men and women would rather work for a male boss \u2014 they\u2019d even take a lower salary to ensure it. The self-annihilating absurdity of this last fact underlies some of the more important insights in \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d which have to do with the unconscious bias women seem to have against themselves. Women in academia spend more time than men revising papers, in part because they\u2019re reluctant to burden anyone with what they feel is subpar work but also because they\u2019re so much more sensitive to criticism and hope to eliminate the possibility of any. Women underestimate their abilities at the same rate that men overestimate theirs, and a woman\u2019s self-esteem is more closely tied to compliments and criticism from her boss, with praise being more meaningful to women than even a raise or a promotion.There is much to recommend this book, especially now, when record numbers of women are organizing, preparing to run for office and demanding change. So it\u2019s a bit disheartening to get to the end with only a handful of paragraphs on sexual harassment. Lipman managed to fold in a reference to Harvey Weinstein, but if there\u2019s one thing missing, it\u2019s a consideration of how sexual harassment, and the perhaps less quantifiable issue of why men fear ascendant women, lead to the disparities that she documents so persuasively. She is optimistic that men are capable of acting not only out of self-interest \u2014 though it\u2019s true, more female colleagues will make them richer \u2014 but out of the same moral imperative that once led privileged white men to abolish slavery and to \u201cgive\u201d women the right to vote. Lipman offers 12 \u201ctips and takeaways\u201d for moving forward, one of which inspired her title. To address what we might call the \u201cacknowledgment gap,\u201d she exhorts those paying attention in a meeting to repeat a statement that a woman has already made, to ensure she\u2019s recognized for it. Like her other suggestions, it\u2019s a nice idea, one that\u2019s been circulating among working women for a while. It reinforces her conviction that we must be vigilant in matters large and small if we want to shift the culture.

{"Headline": "California Today: Thousands of Volunteers Count the Homeless in Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Across Los Angeles, they sleep in tents, under tarps or out in the open air, and their numbers are growing. Last year the population of homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles increased 23 percent, and officials believe the numbers have continued to rise.This week the city will start to find out just how much.Starting Tuesday night in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San Gabriel Valleys, thousands of volunteers fanned out to neighborhoods to count the homeless, an annual three-day exercise that in recent years has confirmed an alarming crisis in Los Angeles County.The count, along with demographic surveys, will help policymakers decide how to spend public money: $355 million per year raised by Los Angeles county from a special sales tax, and a $1.2 billion city bond issue to build housing for the homeless.Once mostly associated with Skid Row, the vast tent encampment in downtown Los Angeles, the homeless are now spread out across the city, setting up tents under highway overpasses and moving into affluent neighborhoods like Bel-Air, where a wildfire that threatened the area\u2019s mega-mansions was sparked last year by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment.As the homeless population has grown, the old stereotypes \u2014 of single men, mentally ill or addicted \u2014 have been upended. Now the crisis, not just in Los Angeles but across California, is closely connected with another of state\u2019s challenges: an overheated housing market. Many of those who have recently fallen into homelessness have jobs, but have been pushed to the streets by skyrocketing rents.\u201cI think the causes are pretty clear and explicit,\u201d said Peter Lynn, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. \u201cLos Angeles is absolutely at the center of a crisis of housing affordability.\u201dAre you one of the volunteers? Or, if you did you not participate, do you have an experience to share about your interactions with the homeless? We\u2019d like to hear from you at CAtoday@nytimes.com(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)We recently asked you what you thought about a bill that was introduced recently by two state lawmakers from Los Angeles to name surfing the state\u2019s official sport.You had plenty to say.\u201cRidiculous.\u201d\u201cAbsurd.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d\u201cAll for it.\u201dThere was no consensus, clearly, but the question stirred passions.Some said that surfing, even though it is closely identified with California culture, is not reflective of the state\u2019s diversity, both in matters of ethnicity and race and geography. \u201cSurfing \u2014 a white man\u2019s sport,\u201d one reader wrote. Another wrote that surfing is, \u201ccharacterized by young whites, mainly males, mainly from middle-class to affluent backgrounds in coastal areas. Let\u2019s try again folks.\u201dArguing in favor, one writer, of the \u201cearly Boomer generation,\u201d said that surfing is already the state\u2019s unofficial sport. \u201cBringing this phenomenon into \u2018official\u2019 status will celebrate exactly what we Californians already know. Hang ten!\u201dSome offered up alternatives, saying they were more democratic. Sports like soccer, hiking, biking, skateboarding and skiing. Others said they were fine with it if doing so would give California more ability to protect the oceans, and push back on a Trump administration plan to open coastal areas to offshore drilling.Still others thought the question was simply a waste of time, for lawmakers and readers, and wondered why we were having the discussion in the first place.

In 2010, she had just returned home to Washington from Los Angeles, where she\u2019d been doing another one of the odd jobs she\u2019d collected over the years \u2014 color commentary on ill-advised video stunts for the TV show \u201cWorld\u2019s Dumbest.\u201d She was still in her cute L.A. clothes, still made up, and she went out to Timbers, a local restaurant. She was having drinks with a friend when she spotted one Joe Price, a heating and air-conditioning worker, on the karaoke stage. He was singing \u201cGreat Balls of Fire.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going, damn, he\u2019s got beautiful eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean the eyes are the center to your soul, O.K.? You might have a nice butt, but I want to see the eyes.\u201d Within weeks she proposed to him. Within those same weeks she was carrying their baby. She had never met anyone so gentle or kind; she had never known a man to just love her, not for her skating abilities or for what she might potentially become, but for her. They married, and she changed her last name, like lots of people do. O.K., I told her. Tonya Price it is.We were at a lounge called 38 Below, which is skating-themed. Hockey and figure skates, including a signed pair of hers, hang over the bar, which features a \u201cfrost rail\u201d that makes its surface look and feel like an ice rink. \u201cBut you should use Tonya Harding in your story,\u201d she said. I told her I probably can\u2019t; if her name is Tonya Price I should call her Tonya Price \u2014 paper of record and all that. She objected. \u201cBut Tonya Harding is who people know.\u201d Which is a good point. She is Tonya Price but you cannot deny that she is also Tonya Harding. This is basically how this entire story goes: There are facts, and then there is the truth, and you can\u2019t let one get in the way of the other or you\u2019ll never understand what she\u2019s trying to tell you.But therein lies the problem: Whatever her name is, she looks an awful lot like Tonya Harding. So even when she meets a stranger and says, \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Tonya Price,\u201d the person will narrow his eyes and say, \u201cWait, aren\u2019t you\u2026.?\u201dLord knows she\u2019s tried to be understood. Over the years, \u201cE! True Hollywood Story\u201d came along. \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d came along. Oprah came along. But the focus was so much about what happened in 1994; it was never about before or after, and if you want to understand her at all, you have to understand her childhood and her early adulthood. They all told her that they would let her explain, and each time she felt like she didn\u2019t really get her message across, because each time, it came down to: Well, did you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Did you know more than you said? Did you actually plan the attack? Are you sorry? Are you still sorry?Then, in 2014, the screenwriter Steven Rogers watched the ESPN documentary \u201cThe Price of Gold,\u201d and decided to reach out. ESPN had given a rounder, more nuanced look at Ms. Harding and where she came from. It laid out the facts: How on Jan. 6, 1994, six weeks before the Lillehammer Olympics (and two nights before the conclusion of the United States Figure Skating Championships), Ms. Kerrigan was clubbed on the knee by a man with a collapsible baton. An F.B.I. investigation found that the man had been hired by Shawn Eckardt, a friend of Jeff Gillooly\u2019s, who was Ms. Harding\u2019s ex-husband. In the end, Ms. Harding pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution \u2014 meaning that she knew who had done the attack, but only afterward, and that she didn\u2019t report it immediately.The prosecution believed that she was much more involved than what the plea bargain encompassed, but they accepted the plea since it included a felony charge. She was sentenced to three years of supervised probation, 500 hours of community service, a $100,000 state fine, and was tasked with setting up a $50,000 fund to benefit the Special Olympics, reimbursing the Multnomah County prosecutor\u2019s office $10,000 in costs, undergoing a psychiatric examination and participating in any court-ordered treatment. And then there was this: She was forced to surrender her membership to the United States Figure Skating Association. Eventually, the association barred her for life.Mr. Rogers, who wrote the 2015 movie \u201cLove the Coopers,\u201d asked her agent for the option to her story \u2014 her whole story \u2014 for $1,500, with more if the film actually got made and recouped its costs. The initial money wasn\u2019t much, just enough for a month\u2019s rent really, and she didn\u2019t know if it was worth the hassle. But her agent said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d The worst had already happened.All these years later, she\u2019s still punished for what she did, but also for what she didn\u2019t do. People still think she herself held a baton over Ms. Kerrigan\u2019s leg that day. People still think she was married to Mr. Gillooly (who has since changed his last name to Stone), who planned the attack and was sentenced to two years in prison for racketeering, but they were divorced by then.At the very least, people still think she herself hired the guy who attacked Ms. Kerrigan, Shane Stant, and they have never forgiven her for it. \u201cI\u2019ve had rats thrown into my mailboxes, [expletive] left on my door, left in my mailbox, all over my trucks. You name it, it\u2019s been done to me.\u201d Sometimes she pulls up to a traffic light and a man in the next car will make oral sex gestures at her.Maybe I could just call her Tonya in the story, I said. Just to avoid confusion. She put her hands on mine. Her nails are unicorn purple with glitter particles that she swears are not fake (which, I don\u2019t know) and they are unchipped the way they need to be when you are chopping wood one day and promoting a movie the next. \u201cYou have to say Tonya Harding,\u201d she said. Tonya Price hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She is a relatively recent invention with nothing on her rap sheet. It\u2019s Tonya Harding who has a few things she would like to clear up.Ms. Harding was trailed by her BFF, Erica Manary, an E.R. nurse she met because their husbands are friends; they got married within a week of each other and then had sons within a year of each other and that just sealed it. Ms. Manary liked her instantly when they met in 2010, and made a conscious decision not to Google her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to refresh myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to learn from her perspective.\u201dMs. Harding swiped on her lipstick perfectly without a mirror: one coat of Wet n Wild 523B (Light Berry Frost) covered by a layer of Wet n Wild 530D (Dark Pink Frost). She laced up her tiny Harlick skate boots that she had painted pantyhose beige, which were attached to gold-plated MK Vantage blades, and put stirrups over her leggings and beneath the blades so that her lines would look longer and she would look taller. (She\u2019s barely 5-foot-1.) She took a puff from her asthma inhaler, straightened her ponytail in its pink scrunchie, aligned her bangs, and stood up. The song \u201cLow\u201d came on and she said, \u201cI love this song!\u201d and hopped out onto the ice while Ms. Manary shimmied her shoulders to the music from behind the plexiglass.When Ms. Harding got out there with her first jump, the girls who had been practicing all morning now looked like total amateurs by comparison. At 47, she still holds so much power in those thighs and so much grace in her hands and posture. People said that her sin \u2014 before her other sins \u2014 was not being the Disney princess Barbie doll that the Figure Skating Association demanded of its skaters. \u201cI hated the word \u2018feminine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminded me of a tampon or a panty liner.\u201d Has anyone ever interrogated the notion of why the highest achievement in the female-centered sport of figure skating is exertion without expression of exertion? Has anyone ever said screw it all and flipped on the Tone L\u014dc and just gone for it like she did? Has anyone ever made skating look so fun?Ms. Harding skates sometimes, but not as much as she used to. What would be the point? Her ban by the U.S.F.S.A. as a skater and a coach should leave her open to professional skating \u2014 say like in an exhibition or the Ice Capades \u2014 but \u201cbecause everything is owned by the association,\u201d she said, there are very few corners of it in which she can still meaningfully participate. Say she taught young skaters for $50 an hour at the rink, she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to bring them to competition, so, again, what\u2019s the point?She married and had her boy, who changed her life by refocusing her attention on someone who wasn\u2019t her. She and her husband would spend hours hunting together, just as she used to do with her beloved father \u2014 Mr. Price with a muzzleloader and Ms. Harding with a bow and arrow because she wanted \u201cto give the animal a 50-50 chance to make it interesting and fair\u201d (and also because felons aren\u2019t technically supposed to possess guns in Washington State). Do you know how good of an archer she is? She says she has successfully done no fewer than eight Robin Hoods \u2014 shooting an arrow that splits another arrow, which itself was already in a bull\u2019s-eye, 30 yards away \u2014 and that\u2019s nothing compared to her fishing skills. (But she doesn\u2019t want to elaborate. \u201cSome people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you eat a carrot you\u2019re killing it.\u201d) Also, she can build anything. She can fix anything. She had a life. It was going fine. She had made some kind of peace with the idea that she\u2019d never really be understood.So she watched it a few times, and the shock wore off, and there from the comfort of her living room, sitting beside the only romantic partner she has ever felt loved by and safe with, she watched what had happened in her life and realized that she never really stood a chance.Which is not to say that the movie is totally accurate. As I said, there are some things she would like to clear up. Such as:First, because of the way it\u2019s edited, it makes it look as though she hunted for rabbits and that is how she got her fur coat. Not true. She bought that coat. She loves fur coats and has two now, one of them a mink that she would like to wear to the premieres but the last thing she needs is those carrot-rights people telling her she\u2019s a monster for wearing mink.Second, the movie made it seem as if she has a dirty mouth. She wants you to know she does not. \u201cTrust me I don\u2019t say the word [expletive] 120 times a day. That might come out once in a while when something really bad happens or I hurt myself. I mean, the movie portrayed me as this person who cussed every 10 seconds and I don\u2019t cuss like that.\u201d There\u2019s a scene in the movie in which she confronts a table of judges about her low scores despite a stellar performance. In it, she gets frustrated and gives them an obscene directive involving male anatomy. Never happened, she said. \u201cI would never say that.\u201d\u201cI did not go to the judges on the ice and talk to them like that in front of everyone. When I spoke to the judges they were in the back hallway room telling me you need to have better dresses. I go, \u2018Well if you can find me $5,000 to make me a dress then I\u2019ll wear it and I won\u2019t have to sew these anymore.\u2019 I go, \u2018You know what? Out of my face!\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s it? I asked. That\u2019s it, she confirmed. Those are her only objections. Which was confusing, because the movie doesn\u2019t vindicate her by a long shot. It presents both sides of the story, both her and her ex-husband\u2019s, and neither comes across looking particularly innocent. Nothing else you want to clear up? I asked.On a couch at 38 Below, she leaned back, frustrated, made her hands into fists and rubbed her eyes. It\u2019s exhausting. Nobody ever gets it. She\u2019s been waiting for a way to tell the world that the abuse she endured was so much worse than they thought, that she was so much poorer than people could imagine. And then all people want to know is whether or not there\u2019s something she\u2019s not admitting to.The reason she loves the movie is because it conveys something she doesn\u2019t feel was ever conveyed before. There were mitigating circumstances. Her life was terrible. She was beaten. She was threatened. You don\u2019t get this way unless you were counted out completely. Her own mother didn\u2019t seem to love her. The only time in her life she ever got anywhere was when she circumvented the rules and took for herself what appeared to be given to the Nancy Kerrigans of the world. Ms. Kerrigan was from a working-class family too, but she was loved. Her parents drove her to practices and cheered for her and cried with joy. She had Vera Wang skating outfits! Tonya had nothing. She had costumes that her mother made with sequins everywhere so that her thighs got cut up; then she had to make them herself, earning point deductions for the quality. She danced to ZZ Top while the others were dancing to Mozart. They had trainers and dietitians and Tonya was eating broccoli and cheese from the Spud City where she worked at the mall. She had asthma. She had muscles.\u201cI was always told I was fat. I was ugly. I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. \u2018If you don\u2019t smile and follow through they\u2019re not going to give you the marks. If you wear that ribbon they\u2019re not going to give you the marks. If you wear that dress they\u2019re not going to give you the marks.\u2019\u201dThis has nothing to do with exoneration; it hasn\u2019t for a long time. Her side of the story is not about guilt or innocence \u2014 the discussion over guilt and innocence ended right about the time she completed her community service, as far as she\u2019s concerned \u2014 but about the finer points of being Tonya Harding: respect, mitigating circumstances, how we treat people and what we expect from them in the first place.I told her about the essays I\u2019d read about how we should have been kinder and protected her back then. She doesn\u2019t want to hear it. What do we know about her? We never asked. She doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Sufjan Stevens\u2019s lovely song about her. Did he call her first to talk to her? Did any of those people writing their defenses of her call her up and ask if they could make money using her name? No! \u201cWho gives these people permission to use my name?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t need our protection now, thank you very much. She needed it back then. Where were our think pieces then? \u201cYou all disrespected me and it hurt. I\u2019m a human being and it hurt my heart,\u201d she said, her hand karate chopping the table lightly with every word for emphasis. \u201cI was a liar to everybody but still, 23 years later, finally everybody can just eat crow. That\u2019s what I have to say.\u201d\u201cMonica Lewinsky?\u201d she asked, incredulous, using a modified version of the same obscene phrase involving male anatomy that she had just said she would never use. \u201cIn the Oval Office! You don\u2019t think that there\u2019s something wrong with that? She disrespected the country.\u201dBut you were both so young, I said. And the press was so hard on you before they\u2019d heard the full \u2014\u2014Everything she did back then was a continuation of the things she had always been rewarded for, which were her scrappiness and her invention and her survival. Was she supposed to play by the rules and let her talent rot inside her extraordinary body? She\u2019s saying that for girls like her, playing nice and fair would have gotten her nowhere. If it had worked out, we would say she was the manifestation of the American dream. Now instead we just say she\u2019s very American.It was getting late when we left the restaurant. Ms. Harding stood under an awning in front of her truck and took a puff off her inhaler. \u201cDon\u2019t describe my truck, O.K.?\u201d she said. A few months ago, someone vandalized her truck and it\u2019s under investigation. I thanked her for her time, and then she thanked me. She told me that the media had screamed at her and tricked her and lied to her and attacked her. No one ever sat down and bought her a drink and asked her for her side of the story. She came over to me and put her head against my chest, which is where it came up to on me. \u201cYou have a heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI can hear it.\u201dHere\u2019s the thing: A lot of what she said wasn\u2019t true. She contradicted herself endlessly. But she reminded me of other people I\u2019ve known who have survived trauma and abuse, and who tell their stories again and again to explain what had happened to them but also to process it themselves. The things she said that were false \u2014 they were spiritually true, meaning they made her point, and she seemed to believe them. So much has been made about the tone of the movie \u2014 does it play abuse for laughs? Does it love her or hate her? Is she vindicated? Do we forgive her? Sit with her for an hour and you will understand that there might be no other way to go with the material. This is how she sounds. It would also be wrong to portray her as anything other than who she is.With her head against my chest, I leaned down and hugged her. Here is something I\u2019ll never understand, that you can be sitting across the table from someone who certainly did something bad, who appears to show no remorse for it and you can still feel the oxytocin rush of love and sympathy for her. \u201cThis world is a bitch, girl,\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t end up in a ditch, girl.\u201d She looked up at me and smiled and then Mrs. Price hopped into her truck and drove home to her husband and son, who were eagerly awaiting her return.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Men Who Want to Live Forever", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWould you like to live forever? Some billionaires, already invincible in every other way, have decided that they also deserve not to die. Today several biotech companies, fueled by Silicon Valley fortunes, are devoted to \u201clife extension\u201d \u2014 or as some put it, to solving \u201cthe problem of death.\u201dIt\u2019s a cause championed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the TED Talk darling Aubrey de Gray, Google\u2019s billion-dollar Calico longevity lab and investment by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. The National Academy of Medicine, an independent group, recently dedicated funding to \u201cend aging forever.\u201dAs the longevity entrepreneur Arram Sabeti told The New Yorker: \u201cThe proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn\u2019t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it.\u201d Of all the slightly creepy aspects to this trend, the strangest is the least noticed: The people publicly championing life extension are mainly men.Not all of them, of course. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn received the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, protein caps on chromosomes that may be a key to understanding aging. Cynthia Kenyon, the vice president for aging research at Calico, studied life extension long before it was cool; her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Laura Deming, now runs a venture capital fund for the cause. But these women are focused on curbing age-related pathology, a concept about as controversial as cancer research. They do not appear thirsty for the Fountain of Youth.Professor Blackburn\u2019s new book on telomeres couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cDoes our research show that by maintaining your telomeres you will live into your hundreds?\u201d it says. \u201cNo. Everyone\u2019s cells become old and eventually we die.\u201d Ms. Kenyon once described her research\u2019s goal as \u201cto just have a healthy life and then turn out the lights.\u201d Even Ms. Deming, a 23-year-old prodigy who worked in Ms. Kenyon\u2019s lab at age 12, points out that \u201caging is innately important to us.\u201dFew of these experts come close to matching the gaudy statements of the longevity investor and \u201cbiohacker\u201d Dave Asprey, who has told journalists, \u201cI decided that I was just not going to die.\u201d Or those of Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who has tested an anti-aging gene therapy he developed on himself, who claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of things that will need to be done to achieve life spans into at least hundreds of years. But we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Or of the 74-year-old fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who during a promotional clip receives injections of his own stem cells to reverse his aging while declaring: \u201cPonce de Le\u00f3n had the right idea. He was just too early. That was then. This is now.\u201dI came across Mr. Nygard\u2019s ode to human endurance three years ago while beginning research on a novel about a woman who can\u2019t die, and watching that video allowed me to experience something close to life extension. As Mr. Nygard compared himself to Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin while dancing with a bevy of models \u2014 or as a voice-over explained, \u201cliving a life most can only dream of\u201d \u2014 nine minutes of YouTube expanded into a vapid eternity, where time melted into a vortex of solipsism.At that time I was immersed in caring for my four young children, and this paean to everlasting youth seemed especially stupid. I recall thinking that if this was eternal life, death didn\u2019t seem that bad.But now, as powerful men have begun falling like dominoes under accusations of sexual assault, that video with its young women clustered around an elderly multimillionaire has haunted me anew. As I recall my discomfort with the proclamations of longevity-driven men who hope to achieve \u201cescape velocity,\u201d I think of the astonishing hubris of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, those who saw young women\u2019s bodies as theirs for the taking.Much has been said about why we allowed such behavior to go unchecked. What has remained unsaid, because it is so obvious, is what would make someone so shameless in the first place: These people believed they were invincible. They saw their own bodies as entirely theirs and other people\u2019s bodies as at their disposal; apparently nothing in their lives led them to believe otherwise.Historically, this is a mistake that few women would make, because until very recently, the physical experience of being a woman entailed exactly the opposite \u2014 and not only because women have to hold their keys in self-defense while walking through parking lots at night. It\u2019s only very recently that women have widely participated in public life, but it\u2019s even more recently that men have been welcome, or even expected, to provide physical care for vulnerable people.Only for a nanosecond of human history have men even slightly shared what was once exclusively a woman\u2019s burden: the relentless daily labor of caring for another person\u2019s body, the life-preserving work of cleaning feces and vomit, the constant cycle of cooking and feeding and blanketing and bathing, whether for the young, the ill or the old. For nearly as long as there have been humans, being a female human has meant a daily nonoptional immersion in the fragility of human life and the endless effort required to sustain it.The most obvious cure for today\u2019s gender inequities is to put more women in power. But if we really hope to create an equal society, we will also need more men to care for the powerless \u2014 more women in the boardroom, but also more men at the nurses\u2019 station and the changing table, immersed in daily physical empathy. If that sounds like an evolutionary impossibility, well, it doesn\u2019t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it. It is surely worth at least as much investment as defeating death.Perhaps it takes the promise of immortality to inspire the self-absorbed to invest in unsexy work like Alzheimer\u2019s research. If so, we may all one day bless the inane death-defiance as a means to a worthy end.But men who hope to live forever might pause on their eternal journey to consider the frightening void at invincibility\u2019s core. Death is the ultimate vulnerability. It is the moment when all of us must confront exactly what so many women have known all too well: You are a body, only a body, and nothing more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While You Were Sleeping", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump poses a huge dilemma for commentators: to ignore his daily outrages is to normalize his behavior, but to constantly write about them is to stop learning. Like others, I struggle to get this balance right, which is why I pause today to point out some incredible technological changes happening while Trump has kept us focused on him \u2014 changes that will pose as big an adaptation challenge to American workers as transitioning from farms to factories once did.Two and half years ago I was researching a book that included a section on IBM\u2019s cognitive computer, \u201cWatson,\u201d which had perfected the use of artificial intelligence enough to defeat the two all-time \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champions. After my IBM hosts had shown me Watson at its Yorktown Heights, N.Y., lab, they took me through a room where a small group of IBM scientists were experimenting with something futuristic called \u201cquantum computing.\u201d They left me thinking this was Star Wars stuff \u2014 a galaxy and many years far away.Last week I visited the same lab, where my hosts showed me the world\u2019s first quantum computer that can handle 50 quantum bits, or qubits, which it unveiled in November. They still may need a decade to make this computer powerful enough and reliable enough for groundbreaking industrial applications, but clearly quantum computing has gone from science fiction to nonfiction faster than most anyone expected.Who cares? Well, if you think it\u2019s scary what we can now do with artificial intelligence produced by classical binary digital electronic computers built with transistors \u2014 like make cars that can drive themselves and software that can write news stories or produce humanlike speech \u2014 remember this: These \u201cold\u201d computers still don\u2019t have enough memory or processing power to solve what IBM calls \u201chistorically intractable problems.\u201d Quantum computers, paired with classical computers via the cloud, have the potential to do that in minutes or seconds.For instance, \u201cwhile today\u2019s supercomputers can simulate \u2026 simple molecules,\u201d notes MIT Technology Review, \u201cthey quickly become overwhelmed.\u201d So chemical modelers \u2014 who attempt to come up with new compounds for things like better batteries and lifesaving drugs \u2014 \u201care forced to approximate how an unknown molecule might behave, then test it in the real world to see if it works as expected. The promise of quantum computing is to vastly simplify that process by exactly predicting the structure of a new molecule, and how it will interact with other compounds.\u201dQuantum computers process information, using the capabilities of quantum physics, differently from traditional computers. \u201cWhereas normal computers store information as either a 1 or a 0, quantum computers exploit two phenomena \u2014 entanglement and superposition \u2014 to process information,\u201d explains MIT Technology Review. The result is computers that may one day \u201coperate 100,000 times faster than they do today,\u201d adds Wired magazine.Classical computers don\u2019t solve \u201cbig versions of this problem very well at all,\u201d she said, like trying to crack sophisticated encrypted codes, where you need to try a massive number of variables, or modeling molecules where you need to account for an exponential number of interactions. Quantum computers, with their exponential processing power, will be able to crack most encryption without breaking a sweat.It\u2019s just another reason China, the N.S.A., IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Google are now all racing \u2014 full of sweat \u2014 to build usable quantum systems.\u201cIf I try to map a caffeine molecule problem on a normal computer, that computer would have to be one-tenth the volume of this planet in size,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, head of research at IBM. \u201cA quantum computer just three or four times the size of those we\u2019ve built today should be able to solve that problem.\u201dBut, again, look at where we are today thanks to artificial intelligence from digital computers \u2014 and the amount of middle-skill and even high-skill work they\u2019re supplanting \u2014 and then factor in how all of this could be supercharged in a decade by quantum computing.This will be a challenge for developed countries, but even more so for countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, China and India \u2014 where huge numbers of youths are already unemployed because they lack the education for even this middle-skill work THAT\u2019S now being automated.It\u2019s why IBM\u2019s C.E.O., Ginni Rometty, remarked to me in an interview: \u201cEvery job will require some technology, and therefore we\u2019ll need to revamp education. The K-12 curriculum is obvious, but it\u2019s the adult retraining \u2014 lifelong learning systems \u2014 that will be even more important.\u201dArtificial intelligence \u201cis the opportunity of our time, and skills are the issue of our time. Some jobs will be displaced, but 100 percent of jobs will be augmented by A.I.,\u201d added Rometty. Technology companies \u201care inventing these technologies, so we have the responsibility to help people adapt to it \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just giving them tablets or P.C.s, but lifelong learning systems.\u201dTo back that up, said Rometty, IBM designed Pathways in Technology (P-Tech) schools, partnering with close to 100 public high schools and community colleges to create a six-year program that serves large numbers of low-income students. P-Tech schools offer calculus and physics alongside workplace skills \u2014 problem solving, writing and job interviewing. These skills are reinforced through mentorships and internships with IBM and more than 300 other companies. Kids graduate in six years or less with both a high school diploma and an associate junior college degree.\u201cThe graduation rates are four times the average, and those getting jobs are at two times the median salary,\u201d said Rometty, \u201cand many are going on to four-year colleges.\u201dEach time work gets outsourced or tasks get handed off to a machine, \u201cwe must reach up and learn a new skill or in some ways expand our capabilities as humans in order to fully realize our collaborative potential,\u201d McGowan said.Therefore, education needs to shift \u201cfrom education as a content transfer to learning as a continuous process where the focused outcome is the ability to learn and adapt with agency as opposed to the transactional action of acquiring a set skill,\u201d said McGowan. \u201cInstructors/teachers move from guiding and accessing that transfer process to providing social and emotional support to the individual as they move into the role of driving their own continuous learning.\u201dAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to distract from the \u201cTrump Reality Show,\u201d but I just thought I\u2019d mention that Star Wars technology is coming not only to a theater near you, but to a job near you. We need to be discussing and adapting to its implications as much as we do Trump\u2019s tweets.Advertisement"}

While the two Jessicas share a name, photograph and whimsical bio \u2014 \u201cI have issues\u201d \u2014 the other Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments, cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography, retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200 million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.The accounts that most resemble real people, like Ms. Rychly, reveal a kind of large-scale social identity theft. At least 55,000 of the accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis.\u201cI don\u2019t want my picture connected to the account, nor my name,\u201d Ms. Rychly, now 19, said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone would even pay for it. It is just horrible.\u201dIn November, Facebook disclosed to investors that it had at least twice as many fake users as it previously estimated, indicating that up to 60 million automated accounts may roam the world\u2019s largest social media platform. These fake accounts, known as bots, can help sway advertising audiences and reshape political debates. They can defraud businesses and ruin reputations. Yet their creation and sale fall into a legal gray zone.\u201cThe continued viability of fraudulent accounts and interactions on social media platforms \u2014 and the professionalization of these fraudulent services \u2014 is an indication that there\u2019s still much work to do,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the spread of fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.Despite rising criticism of social media companies and growing scrutiny by elected officials, the trade in fake followers has remained largely opaque. While Twitter and other platforms prohibit buying followers, Devumi and dozens of other sites openly sell them. And social media companies, whose market value is closely tied to the number of people using their services, make their own rules about detecting and eliminating fake accounts.Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, denied that his company sold fake followers and said he knew nothing about social identities stolen from real users. \u201cThe allegations are false, and we do not have knowledge of any such activity,\u201d Mr. Calas said in an email exchange in November.The Times reviewed business and court records showing that Devumi has more than 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors and models. In most cases, the records show, they purchased their own followers. In others, their employees, agents, public relations companies, family members or friends did the buying. For just pennies each \u2014 sometimes even less \u2014 Devumi offers Twitter followers, views on YouTube, plays on SoundCloud, the music-hosting site, and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional-networking site.The actor John Leguizamo has Devumi followers. So do Michael Dell, the computer billionaire, and Ray Lewis, the football commentator and former Ravens linebacker. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who today presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, has hundreds of thousands of fake Devumi followers, as does Akbar Gbajabiamila, the host of the show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d Even a Twitter board member, Martha Lane Fox, has some.At a time when Facebook, Twitter and Google are grappling with an epidemic of political manipulation and fake news, Devumi\u2019s fake followers also serve as phantom foot soldiers in political battles online. Devumi\u2019s customers include both avid supporters and fervent critics of President Trump, and both liberal cable pundits and a reporter at the alt-right bastion Breitbart. Randy Bryce, an ironworker seeking to unseat Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, purchased Devumi followers in 2015, when he was a blogger and labor activist. Louise Linton, the wife of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, bought followers when she was trying to gain traction as an actress.Devumi\u2019s products serve politicians and governments overseas, too. An editor at China\u2019s state-run news agency, Xinhua, paid Devumi for hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter, which the country\u2019s government has banned but sees as a forum for issuing propaganda abroad. An adviser to Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, bought tens of thousands of followers and retweets for Mr. Moreno\u2019s campaign accounts during last year\u2019s elections.Kristin Binns, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not typically suspend users suspected of buying bots, in part because it is difficult for the business to know who is responsible for any given purchase. Twitter would not say whether a sample of fake accounts provided by The Times \u2014 each based on a real user \u2014 violated the company\u2019s policies against impersonation.\u201cWe continue to fight hard to tackle any malicious automation on our platform as well as false or spam accounts,\u201d Ms. Binns said.Unlike some social media companies, Twitter does not require accounts to be associated with a real person. It also permits more automated access to its platform than other companies, making it easier to set up and control large numbers of accounts.Tweets from a Twitter bot look just like those of a normal user, but a bot\u2019s tweets are generated by a computer program, rather than a person. Below are three examples of common bot types you might encounter on Twitter and an approximation of the code controls them.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cSocial media is a virtual world that is filled with half bots, half real people,\u201d said Rami Essaid, the founder of Distil Networks, a cybersecurity company that specializes in eradicating bot networks. \u201cYou can\u2019t take any tweet at face value. And not everything is what it seems.\u201dIncluding, it turns out, Devumi itself.Last year, three billion people logged on to social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and China\u2019s Sina Weibo. The world\u2019s collective yearning for connection has not only reshaped the Fortune 500 and upended the advertising industry but also created a new status marker: the number of people who follow, like or \u201cfriend\u201d you. For some entertainers and entrepreneurs, this virtual status is a real-world currency. Follower counts on social networks help determine who will hire them, how much they are paid for bookings or endorsements, even how potential customers evaluate their businesses or products.High follower counts are also critical for so-called influencers, a budding market of amateur tastemakers and YouTube stars where advertisers now lavish billions of dollars a year on sponsorship deals. The more people influencers reach, the more money they make. According to data collected by Captiv8, a company that connects influencers to brands, an influencer with 100,000 followers might earn an average of $2,000 for a promotional tweet, while an influencer with a million followers might earn $20,000.Genuine fame often translates into genuine social media influence, as fans follow and like their favorite movie stars, celebrity chefs and models. But shortcuts are also available: On sites like Social Envy and DIYLikes.com, it takes little more than a credit-card number to buy a huge following on almost any social media platform. Most of these sites offer what they describe as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d followers, never quite stating whether real people are behind them. Once purchased, the followers can be a powerful tool.\u201cYou see a higher follower count, or a higher retweet count, and you assume this person is important, or this tweet was well received,\u201d said Rand Fishkin, the founder of Moz, a company that makes search engine optimization software. \u201cAs a result, you might be more likely to amplify it, to share it or to follow that person.\u201dTwitter and Facebook can be similarly influenced. \u201cSocial platforms are trying to recommend stuff \u2014 and they say, \u2018Is the stuff we are recommending popular?\u2019\u201d said Julian Tempelsman, the co-founder of Smyte, a security firm that helps companies combat online abuse, bots and fraud. \u201cFollower counts are one of the factors social media platforms use.\u201dTo better understand Devumi\u2019s business, we became a customer. In April, The Times set up a test account on Twitter and paid Devumi $225 for 25,000 followers, or about a penny each. As advertised, the first 10,000 or so looked like real people. They had pictures and full names, hometowns and often authentic-seeming biographies. One account looked like that of Ms. Rychly, the young Minnesota woman.But on closer inspection, some of the details seemed off. The account names had extra letters or underscores, or easy-to-miss substitutions, like a lowercase \u201cL\u201d in place of an uppercase \u201cI.\u201dDevumi claims to use its own \u201cprivate network of hand-picked real and active Twitter users and influencers\u201d. In reality, it sells bots with stolen profiles. Here are the details that give them away.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusThe next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: no profile pictures, and jumbles of letters, numbers and word fragments instead of names.But company records reviewed by The Times revealed much of what Devumi and its customers prefer to conceal.Most of Devumi\u2019s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. In interviews, their explanations varied. They bought followers because they were curious about how it worked, or felt pressure to generate high follower counts for themselves or their customers. \u201cEveryone does it,\u201d said the actress Deirdre Lovejoy, a Devumi customer.While some said they believed Devumi was supplying real potential fans or customers, others acknowledged that they knew or suspected they were getting fake accounts. Several said they regretted their purchases.\u201cIt\u2019s fraud,\u201d said James Cracknell, a British rower and Olympic gold medalist who bought 50,000 followers from Devumi. \u201cPeople who judge by how many likes or how many followers, it\u2019s not a healthy thing.\u201dMs. Ireland has over a million followers on Twitter, which she often uses to promote companies with whom she has endorsement deals. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance, for example, said that the former model was one of its most influential Twitter \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d celebrities who are paid to help promote products.But in January last year, Ms. Ireland had only about 160,000 followers. The next month, an employee at the branding agency she owns, Sterling/Winters, spent about $2,000 for 300,000 more followers, according to Devumi records. The employee later made more purchases, he acknowledged in an interview. Much of Ms. Ireland\u2019s Twitter following appears to consist of bots, a Times analysis found.A spokeswoman said that the employee had acted without Ms. Ireland\u2019s authorization and had been suspended after The Times asked about the purchases. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thought he was fulfilling his duties, but it\u2019s not something he should have done,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Rona Menashe.Several Devumi customers or their representatives contacted by The Times declined to comment, among them Mr. Leguizamo, whose followers were bought by an associate. Many more did not respond to repeated efforts to contact them.A few denied making Devumi purchases. They include Ashley Knight, Mr. Lewis\u2019s personal assistant, whose email address was listed on an order for 250,000 followers, and Eric Kaplan, a friend to Mr. Trump and motivational speaker whose personal email address was associated with eight orders. A Twitter account belonging to Paul Hollywood, the celebrity baker, was deleted after The Times emailed him with questions. Mr. Hollywood then sent a reply: \u201cAccount does not exist.\u201dMany of these celebrities, business leaders, sports stars and other Twitter users bought their own followers, records show. In other cases, the purchases were made by their employees, agents, family members or other associates.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusOver two years, the Democratic public relations consultant and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen bought more than a half-million fake followers from Devumi. Ms. Rosen previously spent more than a decade as head of the Recording Industry Association of America. In an interview, she described the purchases as \u201can experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked.\u201d She made more than a dozen purchases of followers from 2015 to 2017, according to company records.Other buyers said they had faced pressure from employers to generate social media followers. Marcus Holmlund, a young freelance writer, was at first thrilled when Wilhelmina, the international modeling agency, hired him to manage its social media efforts. But when Wilhelmina\u2019s Twitter following didn\u2019t grow fast enough, Mr. Holmlund said, a supervisor told him to buy followers or find another job. In 2015, despite misgivings, he began making monthly Devumi purchases out of his own pocket.\u201cI felt stuck with the threat of being fired, or worse, never working in fashion again,\u201d said Mr. Holmlund, who left in late 2015. \u201cSince then, I tell anyone and everyone who ever asks that it\u2019s a total scam \u2014 it won\u2019t boost their engagement.\u201d (A Wilhelmina spokeswoman declined to comment.)Several Devumi customers acknowledged that they bought bots because their careers had come to depend, in part, on the appearance of social media influence. \u201cNo one will take you seriously if you don\u2019t have a noteworthy presence,\u201d said Jason Schenker, an economist who specializes in economic forecasting and has purchased at least 260,000 followers.Not surprisingly, Devumi has sold millions of followers and retweets to entertainers on the lower and middle rungs of Hollywood, such as the actor Ryan Hurst, a star of the television series \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d In 2016 and 2017, he bought a total of 750,000 followers, about three-quarters of his current count. It cost less than $4,000, according to company records. Mr. Hurst did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Mr. Aiken and Ms. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.More than a hundred self-described influencers \u2014 whose market value is even more directly linked to their follower counts on social media \u2014 have purchased Twitter followers from Devumi. Justin Blau, a popular Las Vegas-based D.J. who performs as 3LAU, acquired 50,000 followers and thousands of retweets. In an email, Mr. Blau said a former member of his management team bought them without his approval.At least five Devumi influencer customers are also contractors for HelloSociety, an influencer agency owned by The New York Times Company. (A Times spokeswoman said the company sought to verify that the audience of each contractor was legitimate and would not do business with anyone who violated that standard.) Lucas Peterson, a freelance journalist who writes a travel column for The Times, also bought followers from Devumi.But her Twitter account \u2014 and her brother\u2019s \u2014 are boosted by thousands of retweets purchased by their mother and manager, Shadia Daho, according to Devumi records. Ms. Daho did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her by email and through a public relations firm.Mr. Pallen at first denied buying those followers. After The Times contacted Ms. Greiner, Mr. Pallen said he had \u201cexperimented\u201d with the company but \u201cstopped using it long ago.\u201d A lawyer for Ms. Greiner said she had asked him to stop after learning of the first purchases.Still, records show, Mr. Pallen bought Ms. Greiner more Devumi followers in 2016.Marketing consultants sometimes buy followers for themselves, too, in effect purchasing the evidence of their supposed expertise. In 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, a former adjunct professor at the University of Southern California who calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading celebrity branding authority,\u201d began buying hundreds of thousands of fake followers from Devumi.He did not respond to requests for comment. But in his recent best-selling book, \u201cThe Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells,\u201d he had a different explanation for his rising follower count. \u201cMy social media following exploded,\u201d Mr. Sehdev claimed, because he had discovered the true secret to celebrity influence: \u201cAuthenticity is the key.\u201dAmong the followers delivered to Mr. Sehdev was Ms. Rychly \u2014 or at least, a copy of her. The fake Rychly account, created in 2014, was included in the purchase orders of hundreds of Devumi customers. It was retweeted by Mr. Schenker, the economist, and Arabella Daho, the teenage influencer. Clive Standen, star of the show \u201cTaken,\u201d ended up with Ms. Rychly\u2019s stolen social identity. So did the television baker Mr. Hollywood, the French entertainer DJ Snake and Ms. Ireland. (DJ Snake\u2019s followers were purchased by a former manager, and Mr. Standen did not respond to requests for comment.)The fake Ms. Rychly also retweeted at least five accounts linked to a prolific American pornographer named Dan Leal, who is based in Hungary and tweets as @PornoDan. Mr. Leal, who has bought at least 150,000 followers from Devumi in recent years, is one of at least dozens of customers who work in the adult film industry or as escorts, according to a review of Devumi records.In an email, Mr. Leal said that buying followers for his business generated more than enough new revenue to pay for the expense. He was not worried about being penalized by Twitter, Mr. Leal said. \u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dDevumi has sold at least tens of thousands of similar high-quality bots, a Times analysis found. In some cases, a single real Twitter user was transformed into hundreds of different bots, each a minute variation on the original.Individually, fake accounts are hard to detect. Study their group behaviour, and incriminating patterns begin to emerge.By Richard Harris and Mark HansenThese fake accounts borrowed social identities from Twitter users in every American state and dozens of countries, from adults and minors alike, from highly active users and those who hadn\u2019t logged in to their accounts for months or years.The fake account remained dormant until last year, when it suddenly began retweeting Devumi customers continuously. This summer, the fake Mr. Dodd promoted various pornographic accounts, including Mr. Leal\u2019s Immoral Productions, as well as a link to a gambling website.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019d take my identity \u2014 I\u2019m a 20-year-old college student,\u201d Mr. Dodd said. \u201cI\u2019m not well known.\u201d But even unknown, Mr. Dodd\u2019s social identity has value in the influence economy. At prices posted in December, Devumi was selling high-quality followers for under two cents each. Sold to about 2,000 customers \u2014 the rough number that many Devumi bot accounts follow \u2014 his social identity could bring Devumi around $30.The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi\u2019s brand. The high-quality bots are usually delivered to customers first, followed by millions of cheaper, low-quality bots, like sawdust mixed in with grated Parmesan.Some of Devumi\u2019s high-quality bots, in effect, replace an idle Twitter account \u2014 belonging to someone who stopped using the service \u2014 with a fake one. Whitney Wolfe, an executive assistant who lives in Florida, opened a Twitter account in 2008, when she was a wedding planner. By the time she stopped using it regularly in 2014, a fake account copying her personal information had been created. In recent months, it has retweeted adult film actresses, several influencers and an escort turned memoirist.\u201cThe content \u2014 pictures of women in thongs, pictures of women\u2019s chests \u2014 it\u2019s not anything I want to be represented with my faith, my name, where I live,\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, who is active in her local Southern Baptist congregation.Other victims were still active on Twitter when Devumi-sold bots began impersonating them. Salle Ingle, a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Colorado, said she worried that a potential employer would come across the fake version of her while vetting her social media accounts.\u201cI\u2019ve been applying for new jobs, and I\u2019m really grateful that no one saw this account and thought it was me,\u201d Ms. Ingle said. Once contacted by The Times, Ms. Ingle reported the account to Twitter, which deactivated it.After emailing Mr. Calas last year, a Times reporter visited Devumi\u2019s Manhattan address, listed on its website. The building has dozens of tenants, including a medical clinic and a labor union. But Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, do not appear to be among them. A spokesman for the building\u2019s owner said neither Devumi nor Bytion had ever rented space there.Like the followers Devumi sold, the office was an illusion.In real life, Devumi is based in a small office suite above a Mexican restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., overlooking an alley crowded with Dumpsters and parked cars. Mr. Calas lives a short commute away, in a penthouse apartment.Mr. Calas, who is 27, grew up in South Florida, where as a teenager he learned web design and built sites for local businesses, according to earlier versions of his personal web page available on the Internet Archive.Eventually he taught himself techniques for search engine optimization \u2014 the art of pushing a web page higher in search results. While in high school, he began taking classes at Palm Beach State College, where he earned an associate degree in 2012, according to a school spokeswoman. Within a few years, Mr. Calas was claiming to have built dozens of online businesses serving 10 million customers, now under the Bytion umbrella.\u201cI started this company with a thousand dollars in the bank, without investors, and only the burning passion for success,\u201d Mr. Calas wrote last year on the job-listing site Glassdoor.According to former employees interviewed by The Times, turnover was high at Devumi, and Mr. Calas kept his operation tightly compartmentalized. Employees sometimes had little idea what their colleagues were doing, even if they were working on the same project.Dozens of Devumi\u2019s customer service and order fulfillment personnel are based in the Philippines, according to company records. Employing overseas contractors may have helped Mr. Calas hold down costs. But it also appears to have left him vulnerable to a kind of social identity theft himself.His copycat company used a similar name \u2014 DevumiBoost \u2014 and copied the design of Devumi\u2019s website, Mr. Calas alleged. The fake Devumi even listed the same phantom Manhattan address. Over a stretch of days last July, Mr. Boado, posing as a Devumi employee, emailed hundreds of Devumi customers to inform them that their orders needed to be reprocessed on DevumiBoost. Then he impersonated the customers, too, emailing Devumi under different aliases to ask that Devumi cancel the original orders. Mr. Boado, according to Mr. Calas, was trying to steal his customers. (Mr. Boado did not respond to emails seeking a response to Mr. Calas\u2019s claims.)Mr. Calas\u2019s lawsuit also revealed something else: Devumi doesn\u2019t appear to make its own bots. Instead, the company buys them wholesale \u2014 from a thriving global market of fake social media accounts.Scattered around the web is an array of obscure websites where anonymous bot makers around the world connect with retailers like Devumi. While individual customers can buy from some of these bare-boned sites \u2014 Peakerr, CheapPanel and YTbot, among others \u2014 they are less user-friendly. Some, for example, do not accept credit cards, only cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.But each site sells followers, likes and shares in bulk, for a variety of social media platforms and in different languages. The accounts they sell may change hands repeatedly. The same account may even be available from more than one seller.Devumi, according to one former employee, sourced bots from different bot makers depending on price, quality and reliability. On Peakerr, for example, 1,000 high-quality, English-language bots with photos costs a little more than a dollar. Devumi charges $17 for the same quantity.The price difference has allowed Mr. Calas to build a small fortune, according to company records. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $6 million in sales during that period.Last month, Mr. Calas asked for examples of bots The Times found that copied real users. After receiving the names of 10 accounts, Mr. Calas, who had agreed to an interview, asked for more time to analyze them. Then he stopped responding to emails.Ms. Binns, the Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not proactively review accounts to see if they were impersonating other users. Instead, the company\u2019s efforts are focused on identifying and suspending accounts that violate Twitter\u2019s spam policies. In December, for example, the company identified an average of 6.4 million suspicious accounts each week, she said.All of the sample accounts provided by The Times violated Twitter\u2019s anti-spam policies and were shut down, Ms. Binns said. \u201cWe take the action of suspending an account from the platform very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we want to aggressively fight spam on the platform.\u201dThe company also suspended Devumi\u2019s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.Yet Twitter has not imposed seemingly simple safeguards that would help throttle bot manufacturers, such as requiring anyone signing up for a new account to pass an anti-spam test, as many commercial sites do. As a result, Twitter now hosts vast swaths of unused accounts, including what are probably dormant accounts controlled by bot makers.Former employees said the company\u2019s security team for many years was more focused on abuse by real users, including racist and sexist content and orchestrated harassment campaigns. Only recently, they said, after revelations that Russia-aligned hackers had deployed networks of Twitter bots to spread divisive content and junk news, has Twitter turned more attention to weeding out fake accounts.Leslie Miley, an engineer who worked on security and user safety at Twitter before leaving in late 2015, said, \u201cTwitter as a social network was designed with almost no accountability.\u201dSome critics believe Twitter has a business incentive against weeding out bots too aggressively. Over the past two years, the company has struggled to generate the user growth seen by rivals like Facebook and Snapchat. And outside researchers have disputed the company\u2019s estimates for how many of its active users are actually bots.Small design changes over a number of years has placed an increasingly greater focus on user engagement with replies, retweets and likes in Twitter\u2019s timeline.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cWe\u2019re working with completely unregulated, closed ecosystems that aren\u2019t reporting on these things. They have a perverse incentive to let it happen,\u201d said Mr. Essaid, the cybersecurity expert. \u201cThey want to police it to the extent it doesn\u2019t seem obvious, but they make money off it.\u201dIn January, after almost two years of promoting hundreds of Devumi customers, the fake Jessica Rychly account was finally flagged by Twitter\u2019s security algorithms. It was recently suspended.But the real Ms. Rychly may soon leave Twitter for good.\u201cI am probably just going to delete my Twitter account,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa and Felipe Villamor.

{"Headline": "California Today: Can a New Leader Deliver High-Speed Rail?", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Brian P. Kelly, the head of California\u2019s State Transportation Agency, was appointed this week to run the state\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, the organization charged with overseeing construction of what would be America\u2019s first high-speed train system. This week a consultant to the authority reported that the cost of the first segment under construction, a 119-mile span in the Central Valley, has risen to $84 million per mile from $66 million per mile. Mr. Kelly spoke to us on Wednesday. (Our chat has been edited and condensed below.)(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The Bay Area this week had a fleeting flashback to the Google bus protests of a few years ago. Four buses that shuttle Apple employees and one chartered by Google were apparently targeted Tuesday on I-280, which runs between San Francisco and Silicon Valley.Images on social media showed the shattered glass of bus windows. No one was hurt.\u201cIt might have been a BB gun \u2014 we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Officer Art Montiel, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol. \u201cIt could have been somebody throwing a rock.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear like there was anything high powered like an actual gun or a rifle,\u201d Officer Montiel said. \u201cEither way it\u2019s a concern for us.\u201dIt could of course just have been the work of kids without any political agenda. But it\u2019s also possible that it was another reminder of the still potent resentment over what old-guard San Franciscans describe as the tech industry swallowing their city.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs\u2019s Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four.\u201cDecember\u2019s relatively weak jobs and wage growth figures give policymakers a breather. But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201dVia Recode:\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify.\u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201dThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales. Via CNBC:\u201cExplain to me where this market is rich? It\u2019s not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don\u2019t see the overvaluation. World growth is higher.\u201dFrom Mr. Schmidt\u2019s story:Legal experts said that of the two primary issues Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating \u2014 whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying the president to a possible crime of obstruction.But the experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case.So a steady drip of excerpts \u2014 from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians \u201ctreasonous\u201d to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing \u2014 is about to become a flood.The Washington flyaroundThe responseYes, corporations like Apple will have to repatriate overseas earnings under the new code. And the tax analyst David Zion estimates that they will pay some $235 billion.As J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor, told Jesse Drucker of the NYT, multinationals have sought a change like this for over a decade:\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the legislation if they didn\u2019t want it.\u201dBut investor reaction yesterday was fairly muted: American depositary receipts in Royal Dutch Shell and BP, for instance, each rose less than 1 percent.What the proposal will doThe plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.What it won\u2019tImmediately green-light drilling.Who\u2019s opposedMore from Eric Newcomer of Bloomberg:Kalanick, who owns 10 percent of the company, had offered to sell as much as half of his stake \u2014 the maximum board members were allowed to tender. He had to pare back the amount because of limits outlined in the agreement between Uber and the buyers, the people said.The tech flyaroundWho\u2019s in the running, according to Ben Fritz and Keach Hagey of the WSJ:The media flyaround \u201cThis is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The End of the Social News Era? Journalists Brace for Facebook\u2019s Big Change", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cNobody knows exactly what impact it\u2019ll have, but in a lot of ways, it looks like the end of the social news era,\u201d Jacob Weisberg, the chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group, said on Friday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Facebook traffic has been declining all year, so they\u2019ve been de-emphasizing news. But for them to make such a fundamental change in the platform \u2014 I don\u2019t think people were really anticipating it.\u201dAlthough Facebook users craved conversation and journalists gave them things to talk about, the relationship between the platform and media outlets was imperfect from the start.Facebook became a news powerhouse with reluctance, and journalism executives allied themselves with it mostly out of necessity, given the two billion Facebook users who were often a screen-tap away from an article or video.Over the years, as Facebook and media companies entangled themselves with each other, users\u2019 feeds that had once been filled with chatter about graduations, changing relationship statuses and other subjects belonging to the private sphere morphed into digital spaces rife with public matters \u2014 news! \u2014 and the endless and endlessly contentious comment threads that went with them.The uncle you once looked up to, it turned out, had a habit of sharing rude memes that you did not want to see, much less Like.That led to a problem for Facebook, which needs its users to linger, so that it can deliver more highly targeted ads \u2014 that\u2019s how the company made a net profit of $10.2 billion in 2016.Facebook says its changes will improve the \u201cwell-being\u201d of its users. In an effort to usher in this new mood of online pleasantness, its product teams will drop the former goal of helping people find \u201crelevant content\u201d as they test the \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d thesis.The shift in strategy comes, not coincidentally, after a year in which Facebook came under governmental scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech. Mr. Zuckerberg gave his interview to The Times as his company was preparing for a Jan. 17 hearing, the second Capitol Hill inquiry into the online spread of extremist propaganda. During hearings last fall, Facebook told Congress that agents working for a Kremlin-linked company had disseminated content that reached an estimated 126 million users in the United States in 2016.As a result of Facebook\u2019s attempt to distance itself from an overheated news cycle and make a return to its friends-and-family roots, publishers who depended on it for traffic are likely to find themselves in trouble.News outlets that have built a strong bond with readers and viewers through other means will be watching closely, to see whether the size of their audiences \u2014 and corresponding advertising dollars \u2014 will shrink in the coming months.\u201cChanging the terms rapidly is really bringing into focus just how powerful the platforms have become and how the infrastructure is a very difficult place for publishers to operate and navigate,\u201d John Ridding, the chief executive of The Financial Times, said. \u201cThat has big implications for how people receive news, where they find it and what the quality of their news is.\u201dJonah Peretti, the chief executive of BuzzFeed, highlighted the tensions between media organizations and the internet giants Facebook and Google in December, when he publicly criticized the mega-platforms that have fueled the site\u2019s success.\u201cGoogle and Facebook are taking the vast majority of ad revenue, and paying content creators far too little for the value they deliver to users,\u201d Mr. Peretti wrote in a memo published on BuzzFeed.\u201cFacebook is just desperate to get into China, and it will never do that unless it censors news \u2014 and this is actually a neat solution to that,\u201d Mr. Weisberg, the Slate chairman, said. \u201cIf you only have news on the platform shared by users, users who live under repressive regimes don\u2019t have access to real news and can\u2019t share it, because it\u2019s legally prohibited.\u201dAs the site is now, every Facebook user sees a different set of posts and ads. These are ranked and tailored to what their online habits have suggested about their interests. Although Facebook prioritizes certain material \u2014 like those birth announcements that quickly draw Likes and comments \u2014 there are no firm rules for what pops up high in a given feed. In the coming weeks, though, users are likely to notice a reduction in how many posts appear from media organizations.\u201cBecause space in News Feed is limited, showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means we\u2019ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers,\u201d Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook\u2019s News Feed, wrote in a blog post on Thursday.Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The Times, was skeptical of the Facebook plan.\u201cIf this change is as significant as they describe it, news organizations will go out of business or succeed based on a change that they didn\u2019t necessarily have input on,\u201d Mr. Kint said. \u201cIt reads as something that will drive up engagement and probably push away policy risk, because they\u2019re not allowing news properties to have the same sort of presence in their feeds.\u201dMr. Kint added that he had hoped that it would have found a way to weed out hoaxes and made-up news stories that did not penalize publishers.Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said he was expecting the changes to kick in any day. He added that he had not heard from Facebook about what it will mean for his company and, like others in the media industry, he suggested that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s company should be less mysterious.\u201cAs always, it would be good to see transparency from any platform, particularly Facebook, as to how they are going about deciding what constitutes quality,\u201d Mr. Narisetti said.For media companies, a reliance on the company as a driver of traffic has proved an unreliable business model. A Facebook campaign against clickbait, for instance, sent click-dependent publishers like Upworthy into a tailspin several years ago.The algorithm changes will almost certainly affect ad-supported media companies like BuzzFeed and Bustle, which depend in part on Facebook for eyeballs. Publishers that have lately persuaded readers to pony up for subscriptions, including The Washington Post and The Times, will also have to confront likely declines in traffic.As he has at the start of each year since 2009, Mr. Zuckerberg began 2018 by letting his audience in on the personal challenges he hoped to conquer. The chief one he mentioned in his Jan. 4 Facebook post was making the site he co-founded in 2004 a force for good. His company\u2019s return to its scrapbook roots seems to be part of his attempt to live up to that aim.\u201cThe world feels anxious and divided,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cand Facebook has a lot of work to do \u2014 whether it\u2019s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Pot Entrepreneurs Go When the Banks Just Say No", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "FeatureAs the legal markets for marijuana spread, a small credit union is solving a big problem: what to do with all the cash.Supported byBehzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh\u2019s small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations.One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna\u2019s manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver\u2019s north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants\u2019 flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out.Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh\u2019s office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse \u2014 Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh\u2019s \u201cmurse,\u201d for man purse \u2014 and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. \u201cOne day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,\u201d Behzadzadeh reminisced. \u201cI put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars.\u201d When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. \u201cSo Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there\u2019s a thousand dollars!\u201d They laughed heartily. \u201cIf we had bank accounts,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, \u201cit\u2019d be much easier.\u201dGrowing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase \u2014 and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for.In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners\u2019 personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado\u2019s, with the potential for many more banking headaches.But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law.Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state\u2019s financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry\u2019s biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery \u2014 a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000\u201d while someone fills out money orders.To manage these accounts, Seefried \u2014 working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution \u2014 created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried\u2019s bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients\u2019 finances and operations. \u201cI said it in every interview in the beginning,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201c\u2009\u2018You have to understand: We\u2019re going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.\u2019\u2009\u201dFive other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry. (They don\u2019t lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it\u2019s difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did.Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. \u201cHer openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,\u201d says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state\u2019s banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. \u201cShe understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,\u201d he said. (She has also written a book, \u201cNavigating Safe Harbor,\u201d about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn\u2019t been indicted, and she hasn\u2019t been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small \u2014 \u201cless than 20 percent,\u201d she says.Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. \u201cSundie,\u201d he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. \u201cShe wants my firstborn\u201d \u2014 and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business.After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling.Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh\u2019s companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cThat way, I know I counted them.\u201dSeefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, \u201cnobody wanted to talk about it.\u201d Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana \u2014 permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States \u2014 in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. \u201cIt prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,\u201d says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016.Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana \u2014 among them Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor\u2019s director of marijuana coordination, \u201cis a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean.\u201dBut that\u2019s not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado\u2019s first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze.Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado\u2019s lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union\u2019s volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. \u201cAll he kept saying to me during my research was, \u2018Sundie, there\u2019s no safe harbor.\u2019\u2009\u201d The credit union\u2019s accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman\u2019s prison memoir, \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201dSeefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado\u2019s board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking.Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote \u201cThe Canon of Medicine\u201d a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn\u2019t stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money.Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. \u201cI knew that this is a business of compliance before it\u2019s anything marijuana,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult.\u201dState and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado\u2019s marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna\u2019s extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he\u2019s obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day\u2019s end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men \u2014 apart from Angel, they were all men \u2014 supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh\u2019s office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives.But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up.So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days\u2019 worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day\u2019s total \u2014 the money had already been counted at the store, twice \u2014 but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh\u2019s big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan.When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the \u201cgenie bottle\u201d) over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he\u2019d been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash.Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh\u2019s employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime \u2014 clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora \u2014 and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone \u2014 insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive \u2014 replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh\u2019s cameras at Avicenna couldn\u2019t have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. \u201cIt would only take one really effective rip-off gang,\u201d Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, \u201cto terrorize that industry.\u201dOnce the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor\u2019s bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado\u2019s rules. Treasury\u2019s guidance implies that a bank can\u2019t properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California\u2019s large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won\u2019t implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest.Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company\u2019s ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they\u2019ve gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives \u2014 larger than typical, say, or from a new source \u2014 the banker holds the money until the client can account for it.Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. \u201cYou cannot bank what you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Seefried says.Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren\u2019t willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it.Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union\u2019s books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity.This sort of meticulous banking isn\u2019t cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don\u2019t actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year \u2014 less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won\u2019t reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution\u2019s sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million.Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor\u2019s marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million.For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. \u201cBanking,\u201d Koski says, \u201cjust provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out.\u201dOliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. \u201cI found out that he wasn\u2019t blowing smoke,\u201d she told me. (I couldn\u2019t tell if she intended the pun.) \u201cThat was my whole thing: You\u2019re just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope.\u201d She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn\u2019t produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation.Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh\u2019s financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh\u2019s compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check \u2014 almost always \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. \u201cIf you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201chow would you catch who did that?\u201d\u201cCut a bud off\u201d \u2014 the phrase in Oliver\u2019s Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado\u2019s marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant\u2019s scent after a few hours on site. The industry\u2019s brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: \u201cadult use\u201d for \u201crecreational\u201d and \u201ccannabis\u201d for \u201cmarijuana.\u201dElsberg replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 we have cameras on everything.\u201d The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s legal,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI checked his sosh\u201d \u2014 Social Security number. \u201cI checked his driver\u2019s license.\u201d He deadpanned, \u201cI sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too.\u201dNext, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch\u2019s history. She visited the grow next door (\u201cI\u2019m surprised they have as many cameras that they do,\u201d she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights.The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change,\u201d Oliver said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M.\u201dBehzadzadeh\u2019s machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn\u2019t even touch it himself.A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh\u2019s face. \u201cWait \u2014 I\u2019m not going to give my business to somebody else!\u201d he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn \u2014 maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. \u201cI have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I\u2019m not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201dOliver kept pressing. \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is loading the machine for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. \u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that\u201d \u2014 Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll make you coffee.\u201dThe robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. \u201cIf they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, \u201cit would have literally broken my back.\u201d But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them \u2014 Seefried had predicted as much \u2014 but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh\u2019s business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck.Yet despite Safe Harbor\u2019s efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn\u2019t want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor\u2019s waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years\u2019 worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt.Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor\u2019s existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry \u2014 the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn\u2019t missed any suspicious activity. \u201cIt cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201cThat\u2019s one client, with one problem.\u201d She plans to raise fees in the next couple months.Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii\u2019s handful of state-licensed dispensaries.In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. \u201cWe are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don\u2019t want us teaching them incorrectly,\u201d she says.One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. \u201cI came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,\u201d he says. \u201cThe longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic.\u201dRobb Mandelbaum is a regular contributor to Forbes and wrote the \u201cYou\u2019re the Boss\u201d blog for The Times.

{"Headline": "I Used to Insist I Didn\u2019t Get Angry. Not Anymore.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "FeatureOn female rage.Supported byOf course it wasn\u2019t anger when I was 4 years old and took a pair of scissors to my parents\u2019 couch \u2014 wanting so badly to destroy something, whatever I could. Of course it wasn\u2019t anger when I was 16 and my boyfriend broke up with me, and I cut up the inside of my own ankle \u2014 wanting so badly to destroy something, whatever I could. Of course it wasn\u2019t anger when I was 34 and fighting with my husband, when I screamed into a pillow after he left the house so our daughter wouldn\u2019t hear, then threw my cellphone across the room and spent the next 10 minutes searching for it under the bed, and finally found it in a small pile of cat vomit. Of course it wasn\u2019t anger when, during a faculty meeting early in my teaching days, I distributed statistics about how many female students in our department had reported instances of sexual harassment the year before: more than half of them.A faculty member grew indignant and insisted that most of those claims probably didn\u2019t have any basis at all. I clenched my fists. I struggled to speak. It wasn\u2019t that I could say for sure what had happened in each of those cases \u2014 of course I couldn\u2019t, they were just anonymous numbers on the page \u2014 but their sheer volume seemed horrifying. It demanded attention. I honestly hadn\u2019t expected that anyone would resist these numbers or force me to account for why it was important to look at them. The scrutiny of the room made me struggle for words just when I needed them most. It made me dig my nails into my palm. What was that emotion? It was not sadness. It was rage.In \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d her account of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton describes the pressure not to come across as angry during the course of her entire political career \u2014 \u201ca lot of people recoil from an angry woman,\u201d she writes \u2014 as well as her own desire not to be consumed by anger after she lost the race, \u201cso that the rest of my life wouldn\u2019t be spent like Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens\u2019s \u2018Great Expectations,\u2019 rattling around my house obsessing over what might have been.\u201d The specter of Dickens\u2019s ranting spinster \u2014 spurned and embittered in her crumbling wedding dress, plotting her elaborate revenge \u2014 casts a long shadow over every woman who dares to get mad.If an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her suffering: ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. It\u2019s as if the prospect of a woman\u2019s anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized.Whenever I listened to my favorite female singers, it was easier for me to sing along to their sad lyrics than their angry ones. It was easier to play Ani DiFranco on repeat, crooning about heartbreak \u2014 \u201cDid I ever tell you how I stopped eating/when you stopped calling me?\u201d \u2014 than it was to hear her fury, and her irritation at the ones who stayed sad and quiet in her shadow: \u201cSome chick says/Thank you for saying all the things I never do/I say, you know/The thanks I get is to take all the [expletive] for you.\u201dI kept returning to the early novels of Jean Rhys, whose wounded heroines flopped around dingy rented rooms in various European capitals, seeking solace from their heartbreak, staining cheap comforters with their wine. Sasha, the heroine of \u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d \u2014 the most famous of these early picaresques of pain \u2014 resolves to drink herself to death and manages, mainly, to cry her way across Paris. She cries at cafes, at bars, in her lousy hotel room. She cries at work. She cries in a fitting room. She cries on the street. She cries near the Seine. The closing scene of the novel is a scene of terrifying passivity: She lets a wraithlike man into her bed because she can\u2019t summon the energy to stop him, as if she has finally lost touch with her willpower entirely. In life, Rhys was infamous for her sadness, what one friend called \u201cher gramophone-needle-stuck-in-a-groove thing of going over and over miseries of one sort and another.\u201d Even her biographer called her one of the greatest self-pity artists in the history of English fiction.It took me years to understand how deeply I had misunderstood these women. I\u2019d missed the rage that fueled Plath\u2019s poetry like a ferocious gasoline, lifting her speakers (sometimes literally) into flight: \u201cNow she is flying/More terrible than she ever was, red/Scar in the sky, red comet/Over the engine that killed her \u2014 the mausoleum, the wax house.\u201d The speaker becomes a scar \u2014 this irrefutable evidence of her own pain \u2014 but this scar, in turn, becomes a comet: terrible and determined, soaring triumphant over the instruments of her own supposed destruction. I\u2019d always been preoccupied with the pained disintegration of Plath\u2019s speakers, but once I started looking, I saw the comet trails of their angry resurrections everywhere, delivering their unapologetic fantasies of retribution: \u201cOut of the ash/I rise with my red hair/And I eat men like air.\u201dI\u2019d loved Rhys for nearly a decade before I read her final novel, \u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d a reimagining of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d whose whole plot leads inexorably toward an act of destructive anger: The mad first wife of Mr. Rochester burns down the English country manor where she has been imprisoned in the attic for years. In this late masterpiece, the heroines of Rhys\u2019s early novels \u2014 heartbroken, drunk, caught in complicated choreographies of passivity \u2014 are replaced by an angry woman with a torch, ready to use the master\u2019s tools to destroy his house.It wasn\u2019t that these authors were writing exclusively about female anger rather than female sorrow; their writing holds both states of feeling. \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d excavates the deep veins of sadness running beneath an otherwise opaque act of angry destruction, and Plath\u2019s poems are invested in articulating the complicated affective braids of bitterness, irony, anger, pride and sorrow that others often misread as monolithic sadness. \u201cThey explain people like that by saying that their minds are in watertight compartments, but it never seemed so to me,\u201d Rhys herself once wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all washing about, like the bilge in the hold of a ship.\u201dIt has always been easier to shunt female sadness and female anger into the \u201cwatertight compartments\u201d of opposing archetypes, rather than acknowledging the ways they run together in the cargo hold of every female psyche. Near the end of the new biopic \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Tonya Harding\u2019s character explains: \u201cAmerica, they want someone to love, but they want someone to hate.\u201d The timing of the film\u2019s release, in late 2017, seemed cosmically apt. It resurrected a definitional prototype of female anger \u2014 at least for many women like me, who came of age during the 1990s \u2014 at the precise moment that so many women were starting to get publicly, explicitly, unapologetically angry.Harding was an object of fascination not just because of the soap opera she dangled before the public gaze \u2014 supposedly conspiring with her ex-husband and an associate to plan an attack on her rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan \u2014 but also because she and Kerrigan provided a yin and yang of primal female archetypes. As a vision of anger \u2014 uncouth and unrestrained, the woman everyone loved to hate, exploding at the judges when they didn\u2019t give her the scores she felt she deserved \u2014 Harding was the perfect foil for the elegant suffering of Kerrigan, sobbing in her lacy white leotard. Together they were an impossible duo to turn away from: the sad girl and the mad girl. Wounded and wicked. Their binary segregated one vision of femininity we adored (rule-abiding, delicate, hurting) from another we despised (trashy, whiny, angry). Harding was strong; she was poor; she was pissed off; and eventually, in the narrative embraced by the public, she turned those feelings into violence. But \u201cI, Tonya\u201d illuminates what so little press coverage at the time paid attention to: the perfect storm of violence that produced Harding\u2019s anger in the first place \u2014 her mother\u2019s abuse and her husband\u2019s. Which is to say: No woman\u2019s anger is an island.In the documentaries I watched, I found Harding difficult to like. She comes off as a self-deluded liar with a robust victim complex, focused on her own misfortune to the exclusion of anyone else\u2019s. But what does the fact that I found Harding \u201cdifficult to like\u201d say about the kind of women I\u2019m comfortable liking? Did I want the plotline in which the woman who has survived her own hard life \u2014 abusive mother, abusive husband, enduring poverty \u2014 also emerges with a \u201clikable\u201d personality: a plucky spirit, a determined work ethic and a graceful, self-effacing relationship to her own suffering?The vision of Harding in \u201cI, Tonya\u201d is something close to the opposite of self-effacing. The film even includes a fantastical re-enactment of the crime, which became popularly known as the \u201cwhack heard round the world,\u201d in which Harding stands over Kerrigan\u2019s cowering body, baton raised high above her head, striking her bloody knee until Harding turns back toward the camera \u2014 her face defiant and splattered with Kerrigan\u2019s blood. Even though the attack was actually carried out by a hired hit man, this imagined scene distills the version of the story that America became obsessed with, in which one woman\u2019s anger leaves another woman traumatized.These two seemingly contradictory versions of Harding and Kerrigan \u2014 raging bitch and innocent victim, or bad-girl hero and whiny crybaby \u2014 offered the same cutout dolls dressed in different costumes. The entitled weeper was the unacceptable version of a stoic victim; the scrappy underdog was the acceptable version of a raging bitch. At first glance, they seemed like opposite stories, betraying our conflicted collective relationship to female anger \u2014 that it\u2019s either heroic or uncontrollably destructive \u2014 and our love-hate relationship with victimhood itself: We love a victim to hurt for but grow irritated by one who hurts too much. Both stories, however, insisted upon the same segregation: A woman couldn\u2019t hurt and be hurt at once. She could be either angry or sad. It was easier to outsource those emotions to the bodies of separate women than it was to acknowledge that they reside together in the body of every woman.That night, my sense of guilt \u2014 my shame at being someone deemed worthy of protection, and at the ways that protection might endanger others \u2014 effectively blocked my awareness of my own anger. It was as if my privilege outweighed my vulnerability, and that meant I wasn\u2019t entitled to any anger at all. But if I struggled to feel entitled to anger that night in Nicaragua, I have since come to realize that the real entitlement has never been anger; it has always been its absence. The aversion to anger I had understood in terms of temperament or intention was, in all honesty, also a luxury. When the black feminist writer and activist Audre Lorde described her anger as a lifelong response to systemic racism, she insisted upon it as a product of the larger social landscape rather than private emotional ecology: \u201cI have lived with that anger, on that anger, beneath that anger, on top of that anger ... for most of my life.\u201dAfter the Uma Thurman clip went viral, the Trinidadian journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael tweeted: \u201c*interesting* which kinds of women are praised for public anger. I\u2019ve spent my whole career reassuring people this is just my face.\u201d Michelle Obama was dogged by the label of \u201cangry black woman\u201d for the duration of her husband\u2019s time in office. Scientific research has suggested that the experience of racism leads African-Americans to suffer from higher blood pressure than white Americans and has hypothesized that this disparity arises from the fact that they accordingly experience more anger and are simultaneously expected to suppress it. The tennis superstar Serena Williams was fined over $80,000 for an angry outburst against a lineswoman at the U.S. Open in 2009: \u201cI swear to God, I\u2019ll [expletive] take this ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat.\u201d Gretchen Carlson, a Fox anchor at the time, called another one of Williams\u2019s angry outbursts in 2011 a symbol of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with our society today.\u201d Carlson, of course, has since come to embody a certain brand of female empowerment: One of the leading voices accusing the late Fox News chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, she recently published a book called \u201cBe Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back.\u201d But the portrait on its cover \u2014 of a fair-skinned, blond-haired woman smiling slightly in a dark turtleneck \u2014 reminds us that fierceness has always been more palatable from some women than from others.In her seminal 1981 essay, \u201cThe Uses of Anger,\u201d Audre Lorde weighs the value of anger differently than Nussbaum: not in terms of retribution, but in terms of connection and survival. It\u2019s not just a byproduct of systemic evils, she argues, but a catalyst for useful discomfort and clearer dialogue. \u201cI have suckled the wolf\u2019s lip of anger,\u201d she writes, \u201cand I have used it for illumination, laughter, protection, fire in places where there was no light, no food, no sisters, no quarter.\u201d Anger isn\u2019t just a blaze burning structures to the ground; it also casts a glow, generates heat and brings bodies into communion. \u201cEvery woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions,\u201d Lorde writes, \u201cwhich brought that anger into being.\u201dConfronting my own aversion to anger asked me to shift from seeing it simply as an emotion to be felt, and toward understanding it as a tool to be used: part of a well-stocked arsenal. When I walked in the Women\u2019s March in Washington a year ago \u2014 one body among thousands \u2014 the act of marching didn\u2019t just mean claiming the right to a voice; it meant publicly declaring my resolve to use it. I\u2019ve come to think of anger in similar terms: not as a claiming of victimhood but as an owning of accountability. As I write this essay eight months pregnant, I don\u2019t hope that my daughter never gets angry. I hope that she lives in a world that can recognize the ways anger and sadness live together, and the ways rage and responsibility, so often seen as natural enemies, can live together as well.Advertisement"}

Then when a motion sensor detects a person in the house, like your house cleaner, it sends an alert to your phone. When you arrive home, a camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks.The real star is artificial intelligence, the culmination of software, algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated. It is A.I. that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you, or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect a person.\u201cIt\u2019s less about the hardware, and more about what\u2019s inside,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at CES. For consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices, A.I. is never as exciting, she said \u2014 but it\u2019s the magic that is making hardware evolve.That artificial intelligence will take center stage at CES also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years. It has become less of a venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers, and instead has turned into a showcase for nascent technologies.Here are some highlights you can expect from next week\u2019s show.Smaller tech companies have teamed up with Amazon to bring voice-controlled smarts to their products. Devices like light bulbs, car stereo accessories, robovacuums, home security systems and even coffee makers will work with Alexa. In addition, thousands of companies have developed \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, that work with Alexa voice commands. Sonos, a premium audio brand, recently released a speaker with Alexa functionality built in.\u201cIf I had to make a bet, it\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.Now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home.Consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them, and can then alert people when spots free up. Or a garbage can that can notify a waste collection facility when the container is full, or street lamps planted throughout a city that could monitor air quality.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the smart home,\u201d Mr. Gownder said. \u201cThe smart city is elevating that to the next level.\u201dNext week, companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure.Self-driving-car enthusiasts like Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, dream of a future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes.\u201cYour car doesn\u2019t drive itself, at least not reliably for a long period of time,\u201d said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.Still, at CES, carmakers like Ford, Hyundai, BMW and Audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self-driving tech, like smarter parking assistance and less error-prone collision avoidance. These are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles, but some features may appear in cars in the coming years.With 5G, wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download a movie in less than five seconds \u2014 roughly 100 times faster than the current network technology, 4G. Even more important, 5G is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times.(One caveat: the wireless industry is not expected to roll out 5G until 2020. Telecom equipment makers and tech companies are still fighting over which of their technologies should be standardized globally.)\u201cIt could be foundational to the next generation of advancements,\u201d said Greg Roberts, an executive at Accenture, a tech consulting firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more talk around the potential of 5G to remove the barriers around bandwidth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s Not That Much Fashion in FX\u2019s Big Versace Drama", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA highly anticipated follow-up to the \u201cThe People vs. O.J. Simpson\u201d focuses on life in and out of the closet \u2014 not as a shopper, but as a gay man.LOS ANGELES \u2014 Has fashion\u2019s big moment on television finally arrived with the docudrama \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace,\u201d the long-awaited installment of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d that begins airing on Wednesday on FX?Not exactly.\u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t want to do \u2018O.J.\u2019-lite,\u201d said Brad Simpson, an executive producer of the series. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have the exact same tone or vibe because we felt like that\u2019s something we couldn\u2019t match. This is much more about crime.\u201d\u201c\u2018O.J.\u2019 was very frenetic,\u201d said Ryan Murphy, another executive producer. \u201c\u2018Versace\u2019 is lot slower and grander in its compositions. That\u2019s one of the turn-ons of the show for me. Every season, we\u2019re going to take on a crime, we\u2019re going to look at broader social issues, and every season will have a different tone.\u201dThis one is two-toned. There is the color of Mr. Versace (Edgar Ramirez), whose over-the-top sensibility brought celebrities to the front row, and who helped nurture his younger sister, Donatella (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), into a star in her own right. In the series, life is getting better for Mr. Versace before his death: His fashion house is about to go public; he is out and proud, rare for high-profile gay men at the time; and though he is H.I.V. positive, new medication is making him stronger.Then there is the darkness of Mr. Cunanan (Darren Criss), who had a taste for the high life but appears to have made few earnest efforts to get there. The series focuses on his hideous unraveling from social climber to killer. In all, he murdered five people, including two friends, and at least three, and possibly four, gay men.Much of the series is based on \u201cVulgar Favors,\u201d Maureen Orth\u2019s 1999 book about Mr. Cunanan, from which the Versace family has distanced itself. \u201cThe Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about Mr. Gianni Versace,\u201d the fashion label said in a statement last week. \u201cSince Versace did not authorize the book on which it is partly based nor has it taken part in the writing of the screenplay, this TV series should only be considered as a work of fiction.\u201dRegardless of its genre, ratings estimates indicate that roughly half the audience that tuned into \u201cThe People vs. O.J. Simpson\u201d will not return for this season, said John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, and he\u2019s just fine with that.\u201cWe\u2019ve made a show that by definition that a gay man that\u2019s lived through this experience is going to have a richer, deeper connection to this material than a straight guy who lived through that period of time,\u201d Mr. Landgraf said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not the most commercial choice you could make in America, but the way you get to great television is to ask people to go into experiences that are compelling but that are challenging.\u201dHe said he was inspired to do the show because he was living in Los Angeles at the time and gay men in all major national metropolises were transfixed by the story, and terrified Mr. Cunanan would be arriving in their city next. But when Mr. Murphy proposed a season about Mr. Cunanan three years ago \u2014 well before the Simpson series debuted \u2014 it gave his colleagues pause.Nina Jacobson, a producer of the series, politely nodded along before she went home to Google the killer. \u201cI was pretty much in the dark,\u201d she said. Brad Simpson, another producer, had a dim memory, too, and wondered if there was \u201cenough meat on the bone.\u201dCompared with the abundance of coverage around the O.J. Simpson case (tons of books, boundless archives of material), the public\u2019s fascination with Mr. Cunanan\u2019s murder spree was faded like a pair of acid-washed jeans.But the producers saw bigger themes in Ms. Orth\u2019s book. If Mr. Simpson\u2019s trial touched on racism and sexism, the Cunanan tale connected to something else: the shame of the closet, the remarkable difficulty of being openly gay in the 1990s.\u201c\u2018American Crime Story\u2019 at its core only works if you\u2019re telling a bigger story about a societal ill,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Can we do something on homophobia in the \u201990s and the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policies at the time that I think and ruined so many lives?\u2019 And it\u2019s more topical than ever now with this president who is all about discrimination and exclusion.\u201dRicky Martin, who plays Mr. Versace\u2019s longtime lover Antonio D\u2019Amico, was himself in the closet in 1997. During multiple time jumps in the series, Antonio is presented as both devoted lover when Mr. Versace was in the closet, and then devoted and even happier lover after he came out.Mr. Martin said that his performance was informed by two things: just how much better it is to be proudly out now, and the embarrassment that he felt considering how he treated his former partners while he kept his sexuality secret.\u201cI went back to my life and what my life was in the \u201990s: big closet,\u201d he said. \u201cI made my lovers be like Antonio where he was kept in the shadows and kept in the dark back in the \u201990s. It took me back to a place, where, see, it was not necessary. I go back to Harvey Milk where he said everyone has to come out and we have to normalize this. So for me, I was playing both roles. I was playing the man coming out and the relief of it, and the lover, the victim.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard for Mr. Murphy to secure Mr. Martin\u2019s participation.Never one to miss a red-carpet opportunity, the house of Armani last week blasted out a news release announcing that it had dressed Mr. Martin, Mr. Criss and Finn Wittrock, the actor who plays one of the Cunanan victims, for the Los Angeles premiere of \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace.\u201dMs. Cruz chose a Stella McCartney dress for the premiere. A 2009 Academy Award winner for her performance in \u201cVicky Cristina Barcelona,\u201d she called Donatella Versace, with whom she had come into contact \u201chere and there\u201d over the years, after being cast.\u201cShe said to me, \u2018If somebody is doing this and play me, I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cruz said. \u201cWe spoke for one hour. It was a very good conversation.\u201d (Ms. Versace did make one request of the producers, which was granted: that neither of her two children be portrayed in the series.)Ms. Cruz said she watched hundreds of hours of tape of Ms. Versace to master her Italian accent and mannerisms, and that her portrayal was intended to be one of \u201crespect and love.\u201dAnd she said that early last week, Ms. Versace sent her flowers and that the two have been texting like middle-schoolers.As for Mr. Ramirez, he found access to his character through compassion for the intense scrutiny Mr. Versace faced post-mortem. Mr. Versace \u201cwas killed twice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was killed physically, and he was killed so to speak morally and socially.\u201dThe show\u2019s main accomplishment, according to Mr. Ramirez? \u201cI think it\u2019s the redemption of Gianni Versace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Bets on A.I. Open a New Frontier for Chip Start-Ups, Too", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, tech industry financiers showed little interest in start-up companies that made computer chips.How on earth could a start-up compete with a goliath like Intel, which made the chips that ran more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers? Even in the areas where Intel didn\u2019t dominate, like smartphones and gaming devices, there were companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that could squash an upstart.But then came the tech industry\u2019s latest big thing \u2014 artificial intelligence. A.I., it turned out, works better with new kinds of computer chips. Suddenly, venture capitalists forgot all those forbidding roadblocks to success for a young chip company.Today, at least 45 start-ups are working on chips that can power tasks like speech and self-driving cars, and at least five of them have raised more than $100 million from investors. Venture capitalists invested more than $1.5 billion in chip start-ups last year, nearly doubling the investments made two years ago, according to the research firm CB Insights.The explosion is akin to the sudden proliferation of PC and hard-drive makers in the 1980s. While these are small companies, and not all will survive, they have the power to fuel a period of rapid technological change.It is doubtful that any of the companies fantasize about challenging Intel head-on with their own chip factories, which can take billions of dollars to build. (The start-ups contract with other companies to make their chips.) But in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things, these start-ups are racing toward one of two goals: Find a profitable niche or get acquired. Fast.\u201cMachine learning and A.I. has reopened questions around how to build computers,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the global infrastructure at Google for several years and is now a partner at Sequoia, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Sequoia has invested in Graphcore, a British start-up that recently joined the $100 million club.After that, a second Silicon Valley start-up, Cerebras, grabbed five Nervana engineers as it, too, designed a chip just for A.I.By early 2018, according to a report by Forbes, Cerebras had raised more than $100 million in funding. So had four other firms: Graphcore; another Silicon Valley outfit, Wave Computing; and two Beijing companies, Horizon Robotics and Cambricon, which is backed by the Chinese government.Raising money in 2015 and early 2016 was a nightmare, said Mike Henry, chief executive at the A.I. chip start-up Mythic. But \u201cwith the big, aquisition-hungry tech companies all barreling toward semiconductors,\u201d that has changed, he said.China has shown a particular interest in developing new A.I. chips. A third Beijing chip start-up, DeePhi, has raised $40 million, and the country\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has explicitly called for the production of Chinese chips that challenge Nvidia\u2019s.Because it\u2019s a new market \u2014 and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power \u2014 many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start-ups have a chance against entrenched giants.The first big change will most likely come in the data center, where companies like Graphcore and Cerebras, which has been quiet about its plans, hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of A.I. Among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality.Researchers at places like Microsoft and Google, which has built its own chip just for A.I., \u201ctrain\u201d neural networks by extreme trial and error, testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end. They often sit at their laptops, staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data. Chip designers want to streamline this process, packing all that trial and error into a few minutes.Today, Nvidia\u2019s G.P.U.s can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks, but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient, said Scott Gray, who was an engineer at Nervana before joining OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.So in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks, start-ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them.Graphcore, for example, is building chips that include more built-in memory so that they don\u2019t need to send as much data back and forth. Others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster.\u201cThis is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system,\u201d Mr. Coughran, of Sequoia, said.But this is only part of the change. Once neural networks are trained for a task, additional gear has to execute that task. At Toyota, autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as a way of identifying pedestrians, signs and other objects on the road. After training a neural network in the data center, the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car.A number of chip makers \u2014 including start-ups like Mythic, DeePhi and Horizon Robotics \u2014 are tackling this problem as well, pushing A.I. chips into devices ranging from phones to cars.It is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work. Designing and building a chip takes about 24 months, which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won\u2019t arrive until this year. And the chip start-ups will face competition from Nvidia, Intel, Google and other industry giants.But everyone is starting from about the same place: the beginning of a new market.Advertisement"}

I wear them all day, switching between phone calls and music \u2014 and sometimes I just leave them in my ears during conversations (looking ridiculous). Still, the amount of time you\u2019ll save no longer untangling wires is real.As for information, I\u2019m on Twitter too much; it is still the best news feed out there. (I have two Twitter accounts; one that\u2019s very public and one under another name I use only to follow people for work. I find it works better than creating \u201clists.\u201d) I occasionally use Buffer to coordinate social media posts when we're launching something new or trying to push out a particular story.I sometimes use a service called Relationship Science, which is a fascinating way to understand the connections between the people I cover. Think Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, or in this case, Six Degrees of Jamie Dimon.Despite being an unabashed Apple aficionado \u2014 I also have an Apple Watch \u2014 I happen to use Google apps for much of my life since it\u2019s so easy to collaborate on documents with colleagues and coordinate calendars. (And yes, Google Maps is still better than Apple Maps.) I use Slack to communicate with everyone at work, especially when I\u2019m traveling and not in the office.I\u2019m on airplanes too much, so I\u2019m also a devotee of Bose noise-canceling headphones. Other key pieces of travel technology: Hearos Xtreme earplugs for overnight flights are the best on the market (trust me, I\u2019ve tried them all); if you need to block out light to sleep on a flight or you\u2019re stuck in a hotel room that has terrible shades, get yourself a Lonfrote sleep mask, which is so much better than the freebie on your flight. I carry a handful of extra portable power packs to charge devices on the road. And I always keep a stash of RxBars (blueberry, pumpkin or peanut) with me; they're about as healthy as you can get when it comes to packaged and packable food.What could be better?I still want a bigger, longer lasting battery on the iPhone. I can never get enough battery life \u2014 and I have battery anxiety looking at the percentage icon dwindle throughout the day if I haven\u2019t found a place to plug in. Same for the AirPods, though I\u2019ve found that\u2019s less of an issue for me.On my Apple Watch, I desperately want to be able to adjust the sensitivity that activates the screen when I turn my wrist to look at it. (Hey, Apple Watch team: I\u2019d make it a bit more sensitive so it turns on more frequently, even at the cost of battery life.)In your years of writing about deals, which tech merger do you think has had the most significant impact on people\u2019s lives?You also appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d How has technology changed live broadcasting and your experience as an anchor?It has probably changed the most on the production side of TV. It used to be that you needed a truck and satellite hookup wherever you\u2019d go. We\u2019d travel with an army of production and technical personnel. But these days you can use services like LiveU, which basically puts an entire satellite truck in a shoe box that connects to the internet or wirelessly using cellular towers. I was just in China and Saudi Arabia, and we broadcast entire three-hour live shows with only a handful of people and no satellite connection.What tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Sonos is pretty great. We have a handful of Sonos speakers in our home for music and TV. We also have an Echo and Google Home speaker. I\u2019m thinking about getting the Sonos One, which is supposed to incorporate Alexa, Google Assistant and ultimately access to Apple all in one device.I read magazines on an app I love called Texture; it\u2019s like Netflix for magazines. If you\u2019re a magazine junkie, it is so worth it.Apple has more than $250 billion in cash. Which companies do you think it should buy, and why?I used to think they should make a big deal, but these days I\u2019m less certain. The next big thing in computing is clearly going to be artificial intelligence and health care. I imagine I\u2019d be investing in those spaces aggressively \u2014 but the potential takeover targets are less obvious.Advertisement"}

Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it\u2019s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys.The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends \u2014 developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks \u2014 who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order.There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize.They also remember who laughed at them and when.James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats.

There\u2019s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of ros\u00e9 while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn\u2019t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week.\u201cI do I.C.O.s.

Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: \u201cProbably not,\u201d he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he\u2019s skeptical that it can add to his life.\u201cI literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,\u201d he said.A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken.

He carries with him a coin that reads, \u201cmemento mori,\u201d to remind himself he can die any day.

There\u2019s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they\u2019ll be targeted and robbed since there\u2019s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive.

Mr. Fickel is known in the community for \u201cgoing full YOLO\u201d and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him.\u201cI\u2019m taking over her education,\u201d Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms.Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers.\u201cIt\u2019s the entire world reorganizing itself,\u201d Mr. Fickel said. \u201cWe could get rid of our armies because for the first time you\u2019ll have people saying, \u2018I want to vote for a global order.\u2019 It\u2019s the internet waking up \u2014 it\u2019s the internet grabbing its pitchfork.

She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.\u201dShe had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said.

{"Headline": "You Asked About CES 2018. We Answered.", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementWhy does Apple, the most valuable company in the world, boycott CES?Apple doesn\u2019t exhibit at trade shows in general. In 2008, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was pulling out of Macworld Expo, the Apple-centric trade show, where he had previously announced a number of important Apple products, including the original iPhone in 2007. Apple\u2019s reasoning was that the company had retail stores all over the world that could showcase Apple products. In addition, the company had the clout and budget to host keynotes, or marketing events to unveil products, independent of a giant trade show, where companies are competing for attention from the press. Many companies, like Amazon, Samsung Electronics and Google, have followed suit and introduced products at their own events.Here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: Over my last decade attending CES, Apple cast a long shadow over the conference despite not having an official presence. Many companies were making things that worked with the iPhone or iPad, like cases, speakers or apps. But this year, Apple doesn\u2019t seem very relevant here. The show now revolves around Amazon and Google and their battle for domination with voice assistants. There are a good number of companies here showing smart home products that work with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant and choosing to skip out on Apple\u2019s HomeKit because of the stricter privacy requirements and extra fees associated with making products that are certified to work with HomeKit. So the show seems to have moved on from one giant to two others.I've been attending CES for 5 years and feel really underwhelmed by the products showcased at the event this year. I feel like we need to figure out how to \"make gadgets great again.\" Analysts, entrepreneurs, and journalists I've talked to in Vegas this week shared similar impressions. Has CES gotten too big? Does it need to be more selective? What's going on?PG, that is definitely the sentiment among journalists and exhibitors I\u2019ve chatted with this week. I think this year is an incremental phase in consumer technology. A couple of years ago, virtual reality was the hot new tech at CES, with brand-new products like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets that worked very well. And Alexa was just starting to become popular, along with smart home accessories. This year, we\u2019re seeing those technologies mature with improved features that make them more capable. That isn\u2019t very exciting, but at the end of the day consumers will be getting better products in the coming year.What does it say about the state of tech companies and organizations that there are no female keynote speakers at CES, yet there are female robot strippers being showcased at the event? (CES added two female keynote panelists after backlash, but the point remains).In some ways, that mirrors the tech industry. The overwhelming majority of tech executives in Silicon Valley are white men. Tech companies have acknowledged their diversity issues, but over the years there has been little progress.How has the Spectre/Meltdown vulnerabilities been addressed at CES, if they have been?His statement was disappointing because downplaying the problem could make consumers complacent. Meltdown can be fixed with software updates for your operating system, browser and other important apps. But Spectre is an issue that can\u2019t be completely fixed with a software patch; tech companies can only mitigate the vulnerability with software updates. The bottom line is you have to be diligent about keeping your software up-to-date. And you should also run an ad blocker to prevent malicious code from infecting you through ad networks when you\u2019re browsing the web.What \"left-field\" finds did you stumble upon?I saw some pretty goofy gadgets, like a piece of rolling luggage with an electric scooter built into it. Can you imagine riding your luggage through the crowd at the airport? I also saw a robot sherpa \u2014 it was basically a big trunk for carrying heavy objects \u2014 that follows you around as you walk. It had sensors to avoid colliding with you.Brian, hi. I'm hoping that CES will bring announcements for in-wall light switch dimmers that don't require me to buy a separate hub. I don't need Alexa in my light switch, though I do want it to talk with her. Ideally, the same company would also have in-wall on/off switches and outlet controllers, so I don't need to have different apps to manage different switches. Thanks!Adam, I understand \u2014 a separate bridge or hub, which establishes a connection between your Wi-Fi router and a smart home device, is ugly and a waste of space. The good news for you is I did see some bridge-free light switch dimmers at CES. One example is Belkin\u2019s Wemo dimmer switch, which only requires a Wi-Fi connection to work with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. I think you will continue to see companies shift away from hubs toward Wi-Fi connections built into their appliances. The downside of this, in my experience, is that Wi-Fi-equipped smart home devices occasionally lose their connection with your Wi-Fi router, and you sometimes have to power cycle them (turn the power off and back on) to regain a connection. With a light dimmer, that might require flipping your circuit breaker, but hopefully not.What do you see as some of the big trends in the \u201csmart kitchen\u201d space? And who do you think is leading the charge as an appliance manufacturer?The smart kitchen, which is a segment of the smart home where devices are internet-connected, is very interesting to me because each big manufacturer is approaching it in a different way. Samsung is selling a very expensive smart fridge that is equipped with a 21.5-inch touchscreen and voice controls; the company is focused on making the kitchen the center of the home, where families convene and spend quality time together. (I don\u2019t know about your family, but that\u2019s never been my experience.) Whirlpool\u2019s smart kitchen vision is to try to make it easier for you to figure out what to cook with the ingredients you have. The company is offering an app that lets you use your smartphone camera to scan the ingredients in your pantry or fridge so that the software can give you some ideas of what to cook. It\u2019s tough to say who is leading the charge because these are fairly new ideas, so we will have to see what resonates with consumers.Just curious to know about any new technology in locks. I run an Airbnb and I\u2019m interested in battery technologies as most locks suck battery juice, especially the Wi-Fi models.Nick, I\u2019m not a fan of smart locks. Every type has flaws.There are complete lock systems that include the dead bolt, door handle, keypad and electric locking system that talks to a smartphone. These are the most robust solutions, but they don\u2019t fit on all doors. One lock I tried from Schlage didn\u2019t work on two different doors; I probably would\u2019ve had to cut new holes into the doors, which is a pain.Another approach to take instead is to try the robotic arm that attaches to your dead bolt and turns it. These are marketed as the simplest to install. The August lock is an example. But the reality is that when you install these devices, you need to make sure you have a modern high-quality deadbolt that can withstand being locked and unlocked repeatedly by a robot arm. In addition, you will need to change the batteries frequently, probably every other month.How are technology developers working to increase security with internet-connected devices?The tech giants that offer virtual assistants for controlling smart home devices \u2014 Apple, Google and Amazon \u2014 continually issue software updates with security updates. It\u2019s those smaller brands making the smart home accessories that you need to be wary of. While many smart home products work great, their security teams probably are not as thorough or experienced as the people that work for large tech companies. How will new large smart appliances like refrigerators and washing machines begin to pop up in the average American home or apartment? I find there is still a large amount of 10-plus years old appliances (that function fine of course) that still occupy many living spaces. But with a revolution in technology that senses how much water to use when cleaning your clothes or when you should buy a new container of milk, how long would you predict it would take for the technology of today to become the standard?It will likely be a very long time. Many of these smart appliances have premium price tags. A smart refrigerator with Alexa controls, for example, costs upward of $4,000. It\u2019s unclear why you would pay that much for a refrigerator when you can just put a cheap Echo Dot ($50) on your counter. It\u2019s also important to note that smart appliances have been around for many years. There are high-end ranges priced upward of $5,000 that include buttons you can press to tell the oven what you are cooking so it can set the temperature and time accordingly. At the end of the day, these features are a novelty: If you\u2019re going to spend that much on a range, you\u2019re probably a pretty good cook and know what temperature and timing to use to cook a roast or casserole. Smart home appliances need to be cheaper and have more useful applications before they reach the mainstream. Until then, they are an impractical luxury.I just purchased a 4K, OLED HDR TV. Anything at CES suggest it will be obsolete anytime soon?Nope, you\u2019re in good shape. At CES, LG demonstrated a so-called 8K TV, which has quadruple the resolution of 4K TV. But rest assured that your 4K OLED HDR TV, which is the best type of television you can buy right now, won\u2019t be obsolete for years. That\u2019s because content makers are taking their sweet time to transition from 1080P resolution to 4K, meaning there isn\u2019t much 4K video to watch right now, but there will be more coming over time. In addition, streaming devices like the Apple TV just recently added support for 4K. In other words, we\u2019re only at the beginning of the adoption curve with these TVs, so sit back and enjoy your fancy television set.Given the push now to sell OLED TVs, what could they possibly do to improve picture quality, especially since content quality is not keeping up?\u201cOLEDs can still improve quite a bit. For professional users, Sony makes a reference OLED that is an RGB OLED while consumer models are white OLEDs right now with color filters. The RGB version is over 50 percent brighter, and has more saturated, true colors for bright areas (fires, skies, leaves, and so on). Sony also just demoed a 10,000 nit LCD (a higher peak brightness than current OLED TVs) which is a long way off, but the extra brightness made everything look more like real life. 4K Blu-ray content, and streaming content, already has picture information that an OLED cannot correctly display. While they do look great, and are what I use as a reference, they still have a lot of room to improve, even with our current content.\u201dSamsung has announced a 146-inch 8k TV called The Wall. Is there a market for this type of \u201cconsumer\u201d product, how successful do you think this will be? And will other companies do the same?I wouldn\u2019t expect this to be a consumer product. When picking screen size, you should consider the distance between where you are sitting and where the television is placed. In order to properly consume a 146-inch television, you would have to live in an enormous house with a huge amount of space in the living room. Many products shown at CES are merely demonstrations of what tech companies are capable of doing today; very few actually materialize into products you will buy on Amazon or at Best Buy.Are mobile phones trending towards more user friendly or less user friendly this year?Less friendly. If you look at the sheer number of features that Apple and Google keep adding to iOS and Android year after year, mobile operating systems are becoming increasingly complex. (As an iOS user, I find the Mail app\u2019s user interface to be confusing, and I find it perplexing that Apple hid the useful Airdrop feature in a menu that is difficult to find.) In addition, now that Apple has nixed the physical home button on the iPhone X, the way we use phones is poised to change significantly in the coming year. In both Android and iOS, we are increasingly relying on touch gestures that are not as intuitive to discover as pressing a physical button.Should I replace my recent vintage Apple Time Capsule router with an Eero or similar mesh network device?The other benefit of modern mesh networking systems is that they automatically apply software updates with the latest security enhancements. Many older routers require the consumer to manually download the updates, and I don\u2019t know anyone who would even remember to do that. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Brace for Europe\u2019s New Data Privacy Rules", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs.Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information.And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center \u2014 a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served.With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley\u2019s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.\u201cEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,\u201d said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. \u201cG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.\u201dEuropean officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.\u201cThere has not been any pushback from American companies,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cIf anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.\u201dOfficials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google\u2019s director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. \u201cWhen G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation\u2019s mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services \u2014 from Gmail to its Cloud storage services \u2014 to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone\u2019s data.\u201cFor a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,\u201d Mr. Golan said.Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.The new privacy center would give Facebook a \u201cvery good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules.\u201cWe embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,\u201d Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. \u201cWe began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company.\u201dHow the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online.\u201cWhere the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see real changes across the board.\u201dMs. Jourov\u00e1 said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens.\u201cThere will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Beneath apple pie, baseball, and the glitz and glamour of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d, there has always been a side that most Americans have the decency to be ashamed of.America was built on slavery and racism, but the credit was taken by Europeans.In school, we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. We read speeches by Lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. In present-day America, we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.Racism has been ingrained into American society. Beyonce\u2019s quote sums it up best. In a speech she gave when presenting Colin Kaepernick with the Muhammed Ali Legacy Award, she said, \u201c...racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.\u201d She is right. America\u2019s dark underbelly should be shamed, it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards, the thing that we apologize for and work to end. It should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. I see the uprisings of racism in high school, unfortunately - it\u2019s not my classmates\u2019 fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. It is America\u2019s fault, it is society, it is generations and generations who failed us.Is America backsliding on race? No. Are individuals backsliding on race? Now that is a different story. I think as a whole, America has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the America we live in today is slightly comparable to the \u201cearlier, uglier\u201d version. I agree with Sterling Tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. Everything needs to be politically correct. Some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. Who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. Do I feel as if America is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? No, I do not. I think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. All over social media whether the person is young or old, white or black, they have something political to say. Racism is a two way street. One race should not be at fault for being more \u201cracist\u201d than the other because wouldn\u2019t that be considered racist too? Ever since Donald Trump has been elected, racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. In my opinion, I think racism is on the rise, and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism.I feel as if racism is on the rise we\u2019ve had plenty of killings in the United States on the account of another race not liking African Americans and it\u2019s not fair. Being a young African American lady I have experienced a lot of racism as I\u2019ve gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. I get on social media and run across racism. But its going to continue to be on the rise because Americans let this be acceptable.Do I believe that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d? No. America has always been ugly, it\u2019s just covered up. America has a foundation of prejudice, and many minorities suffer from this today. The fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly.Since the election of Trump, more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. I have certainly heard racial slurs in person, but where I see the most insensitive comments is on social media. I see people responding to Trump\u2019s barbaric tweets about immigrants, people say that \u201cOnly REAL Americans should be here\u201d. My response to that is that any of us who are black, white, or asian are not \u201creal Americans\u201d, we trace back to elsewhere. The only true Americans race was nearly decimated. In fact, the people who are often told to \u201cgo back to their country\u201d are Mexicans and people from Central and South America. What many don\u2019t understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount Native American ancestry.Therefore, this is their country. They\u2019re the \u201creal Americans\u201d.I believe that America is turning back \u201cinto an uglier version of itself\u201d because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. This idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. This is not fair because everyone is born equal, and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. Donald Trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the \u2018way to make America great again\u2019 and to get rid of the people that don\u2019t belong. The people that don\u2019t belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. In this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief._________What London is doing is a great need of society today. Neighbors don\u2019t talk to each and people just don\u2019t care about each.Yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? How many people here in the last year or so have1. Picked up medicines for a sick person 2. Consoled a grieving soul. 3. Sat with an elderly person 4. Sat with a friend and lent them an ear.We talk about all the big issues in the world but don\u2019t we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with.Anxiety, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. We all face it, whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time, loneliness never seems to go away. Young or old, friendly or shy, confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous, illness creator, so why not arm ourselves against? In the U.K, they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness, and how more than 200,000 Britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! The fight against this battle starts in the U.K with a minister for loneliness, but in the U.S, no action has been made. We have almost 5X as many residents as the U.K, and I will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness, and still no action. We arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer, so why not try and fight loneliness. Just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. Just one group \u2026 one difference maker._________I don\u2019t plan on going to college so I can lounge around and sit in a lazy river, especially one that my friends and I paid 85 million dollars for. According to the article, tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. Now if that\u2019s true; then I want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students\u2019 money, but this time, for completely useless renovation projects. How could anyone in good faith, knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. I truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that I\u2019m just going to be in debt for even longer after I get out of college.I completely agree with the author of this article. Student debt is a huge problem in the US, and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. College is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in, and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in, and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. Colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics aren\u2019t helping. While it is true that students need to relax, having expensive amenities won\u2019t make or break that\u2013there\u2019s plenty to do on campuses alreadyAfter perusing the article about the \u201ctop 25\u201d in the nation, I believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. There are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. In the beginning of this article, amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. As I looked through the attached top 25 article, my opinion changed. Some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance, such as a lazy river or bowling alley. On the other hand, if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus, then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. Having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science, or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college, where you get to study what you want and find your true self. Going to a college with amazing classrooms, labs, and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there.Watch out \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re falling into the same trap that the author warns about. When you use language like \u201cfind your true self\u201d and \u201cunforgettable experiences\u201d, you\u2019re falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. If you take both your coursework and your education seriously, your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. College can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration, but don\u2019t idealize it too much.College will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply, and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value, and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. But \u201cfinding your true self\u201d is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.You\u2019re right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new, upgraded laboratories. If you want to study sciences, that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities, and if you want to study art, a new art gallery on campus may provide value. If your dream is to study history, though, you\u2019re much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access, though \u2014 not a fancy new humanities building. Be very discerning about what resources you actually need, and be realistic about what resources you\u2019re likely to take advantage of.There is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. They may be nice to use, but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. At L.S.U., the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. This is not something they should have to use fees for when they\u2019re already on a tight budget. Textbooks, tuition, and food costs add up.Adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions, but that shouldn\u2019t be their number one priority. They should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. A student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool, they should go there because the school offers amazing classes, fits what they want to major in, and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful.Lavish amenities attract students. But they also harden people against forgiving student loans.I think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. College students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum, and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. These amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. Studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful.Water parks are nice, but students, parents, alumni, and\u2014yes, members of the school\u2019s oversight board\u2014should have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. Students, why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach, or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? Campus leaders, why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (Outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the school\u2019s liability should a student get hurt\u2014admins, are you listening?) If I were a college student today, then the last thing I\u2019d want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus that\u2019s causing me stress!_________My family has many cooking traditions, some new and some old. Spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, my mother\u2019s homemade green chili, and my father\u2019s famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my family\u2019s diverse food catalog. No matter what happens earlier that day, I can always count on my parents to make a delicious, home-cooked dinner. New recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with.Just the other night, my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas, chicken, rice, mushrooms, and spices in it. I am very open to trying new foods. This is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and I were younger: Two bites of everything. No exceptions. Full, complete bites. This rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether it\u2019s escargot, alligator, calamari, sushi, or just a simple steak.My family and I don\u2019t really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions, but we have made some of our own that I\u2019m sure will be passed down. These traditions are usually held on the holidays. On Superbowl Sunday, if that\u2019s considered a holiday, my sister and I have a dessert cook-off. We don\u2019t really pick who wins or losses(even though I\u2019m the obvious winner), instead, we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game.Another tradition we have falls on Christmas. It is called the Kong Fu Panda Pizza. I believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the Kong Fu Panda after eating it. It is rolled out croissant bread with eggs, cheese, and bacon bits on top. A couple days later, New Year\u2019s Eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own, homemade Coke Floats.Lastly, there\u2019s a tradition that has died out that I wish we would decide to continue. It would happen on Sunday after church. My family and my cousin\u2019s family would all go to my grandma\u2019s for a big, home-cooked lunch. We would have green beans, peas, fried chicken, barbeque, slaw, biscuits, and potatoes; finished off with a nice, cold glass of sweet tea. Later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.I thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have, but I wish we had more. I love food and it\u2019s something that everybody can relate to. It also brings people together.My family and I have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. For example - for all holidays, we cook a variety of German food - Kebassi, Spaetzel, etc. We also make Slovakian food, such as a really good recipe for Bondukis. When I personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen, it makes me feel like I\u2019m really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. I can celebrate my German and Slovakian culture, and learn more about it, while I help cook. My parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake, so, it helps me to feel more informed.In the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. We top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. In the winter time my family eats Ukrainian perogies and soup. These are an everyday meal. My favorite time is summertime because I get to spend time with my family outdoors. Participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people I love eating what I love.My parents were both raised in lower middle class households with Northern European lineages; essentially, meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word.They were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up, turning to more exotic fare. They raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. My mom loves to reminisce about the time that I asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. I grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. My parents\u2019 refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual, ready to try almost anything you put in front of me!_________I think this political cartoon relates to President Trump\u2019s recent comments about certain countries. Many of you may know the inappropriate things our President said, in spite of our country\u2019s reputation of acceptance of many cultures, whether they are wealthy or not. The statue of liberty now reads: Give Me Your Norwegians. People should be able to come from anywhere, by choice. The statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag, symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by President Trump\u2019s actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process.President Trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. He says it is because of terrorism, or because they are not wealthy countries, but in reality it is just people who are not like him. President Trump is shutting out the rest of the world, isolating our country. Multiple countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, Chad, and predominantly Muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time Trump\u2019s presidency is over. This will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. Immigrants do not steal our jobs, they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. Immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our \u201cfree\u201d nation.The cartoonist is using the comment on the Statue of Liberty to send the message that President Trump\u2019s recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. The cartoonist is implying that America only wants to have white, law abiding immigrants come to our country. This is the complete opposite position the US had in late 1800\u2019s/early 1900\u2019s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the US for a better and brighter future. But the other implied message is that the US has a big immigration problem, which needs to be handled very carefully. Unfortunately, I do not think that the US will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. I also feel that President Trump should really think before he speaks or Tweets, because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously.The original inscription on the Statue of Liberty is well know for the phrase, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019 s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what America is supposed to represent. This political cartoon In is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. The Statue of Liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable._________I feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO\u2019s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will \u201cstop significant touch-ups of images\u201d.Every weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world.The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don\u2019t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone.The world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the \u201cgive me this, give me that\u201d norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. \u201cWhere does this product come from?\u201d, \u201cIs this brand cruelty-free?\u201d, \u201cDoes this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?\u201d, and \u201cHow does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?\u201d are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed.Even if a company isn\u2019t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us.I think in the past, companies didn\u2019t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities.One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company\u2019s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create \u201ca new capitalism\u201d by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don\u2019t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate.When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years.When it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it\u2019s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase.For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no \u2018Our Story\u2019 page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That\u2019s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren\u2019t as fortunate as me.Milton Friedman said \u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities\u201d, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative.It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called \u201cGen X\u201d, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn\u2019t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it.The extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that \u201cmake short term sense\u201d but eventually threaten their \u201clong term viability,\u201d as said by Jana in the article.Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock\u2019s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, \u201cWe know that we\u2019re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!\u201d, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I\u2019ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it.I think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap?_________What do you do when there\u2019s nothing to do? You take out your phone. What do you do when there\u2019s something to do? You take out your phone. Replace \u2018phone\u2019 with \u2018cigarette\u2019, and we\u2019re back in the 50s. Unlike cigarettes, though, phones don\u2019t have addiction warnings. Like cigarettes, they should. In German, there\u2019s one word for both \u2018addiction\u2019 and \u2018dependence\u2019. When we\u2019re addicted to something, it\u2019s synonymous to being dependent on it. Instead of asking yourself if you\u2019re addicted, ask the following: \u201cDo I take out my phone when I\u2019m in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being?\u201d If the answer is yes, you\u2019re dependent, ergo, addicted. \u201cDo I take out my phone the moment I feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air?\u201d Yes? Addicted. Dependent. Obsessed. Possessed. You name it.Phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. It is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. I think of it as like eating junk food. You need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. Fast food companies don\u2019t go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc. It is up to us to make that choice for ourselves.I think phones should not come with addiction warnings. Tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. It is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. I feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings, the overall outcome wouldn\u2019t change. Yes, there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage, like phones giving a report on how you spent your time, but in the end it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary. People know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. It is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not.It is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device, the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. People use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance, people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. Now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company.The most I would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because it\u2019s like buying Netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people don\u2019t get addicted to it and slack off on their work.With the addition of smartphones, Smart speakers(Alexa and Google Home), and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore, were always connected.The threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. If Apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then I believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. Because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive._________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Wall of Love Outside a Jail", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaria stood outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, on a recent evening, looking up. The jail loomed above, a concrete bulwark more than a dozen stories high and lined in narrow windows. Behind one of them was her husband.Maria, who wished to be identified only by her first name because of her husband\u2019s notoriety, had been standing there for hours. She had flown in from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, for the weekend, only to learn she would not be allowed inside.The sun was going down and it was time to go; she had a flight to catch. But first, she went to her rental car and pulled out what looked like a rolled-up poster and some packing tape. \u201cA little message for my husband,\u201d said Maria, 33, in Spanish, walking over to a warehouse across the street from the jail.A section of the wall had been covered in signs. \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day Chris B.\u201d \u201cHappy Thanksgiving Luchie.\u201d \u201cI Love You Payroll.\u201d \u201cStay Strong Hubberz. We Got This.\u201d There were signs in Spanish, posters in Hebrew. Some were handwritten and covered in tape to protect them from the elements. Others were printed on durable plastic. They hung amid scraps of tape, deflated balloons and the tattered remnants of even older signs.Maria\u2019s sign said, in pink marker, \u201cTe amo, Gordo.\u201d \u201cI love you, Big Guy.\u201dBut inmates\u2019 families are also bound to the jail, where they pay weekly visits and gather to celebrate birthdays and holidays \u2014 and, lately, to post signs.The signs are clustered at one end of the low-slung warehouse that faces the detention center, on 29th Street. There is no formal system behind the effort, no Facebook group. Like Maria, who said she had noticed the signs during a previous visit, relatives see them and come back with their own. It\u2019s a gesture of last resort.A spokeswoman for Herman Quay, the jail\u2019s warden, said in an email that the jail was concerned about the posters only if they affected \u201cthe security or orderly running\u201d of the detention center, and that the jail \u201cencourages inmates to maintain family ties.\u201d Some jail personnel, who said they were not authorized to give their names, said that inmates were occasionally reprimanded for banging on their windows after spotting a family member posting a sign below.From his cell, Varick Winters, 26, who is in for drug-related offenses and violation of parole, could look out and see families arriving for visiting hours, posting signs and waving, he said through his mother, Leann Winters, who relayed questions by phone. Asked whether the message wall boosted morale, he said, \u201cIt makes you want to cooperate.\u201dIn most cases, inmates are allowed visitors on one day of the week. These visits can be whittled down to less than an hour, relatives say, because of the time-consuming process of entering the building, or they can be forbidden altogether depending on the inmate\u2019s risk factor or whether the jail is on lockdown.Relatives say the signs are a way to communicate when they can\u2019t visit, to show affection on a special day, and to defy a system that strictly limits personal touches: Mail is inspected, gifts must be ordered through a third-party vendor like Amazon, and in the visiting area, the only items that can be handed over are small bills and food from the vending machines.Another reason relatives post signs is that inmates not only can see them from above, but also can respond.\u201cHe\u2019s told me where he is,\u201d said Maria, pointing to the light. \u201cThat\u2019s why I know it\u2019s mine.\u201dThe Metropolitan Detention Center lies on a waterfront strip of Sunset Park known as Industry City. The area, once thoroughly industrial, has recently begun to transform as outlets, showrooms and start-ups open in redeveloped buildings. But around the jail, the view remains treeless and desolate.No one can say exactly when people began posting signs on the warehouse, but an image captured by Google Earth shows it was completely blank in 2013. A spokesman for Con Edison, which owns the warehouse, said that the signs were periodically removed and that the current batch would soon be taken down. In the meantime, the rain and the wind do much of the work.But new ones always appear.On a recent evening, Jeffrey, 17, and his brother Jason, 8, took the subway from the South Bronx to Sunset Park and walked to the jail. Jeffrey held Jason\u2019s hand as they crossed under the Gowanus Expressway toward the water\u2019s edge.The routine was familiar. The boys went into the jail to get the form they filled out before every visit, then joined visitors sitting in a glass-encased room outside to wait for their number to be called.They were there to see their father, who was detained on narcotics charges by the F.B.I. in the early hours of Jeffrey\u2019s birthday last February. Their mother was also arrested. She was released on a bond but could face deportation to Mexico. Because their mother was not allowed to visit their father, Jeffrey said he brought his three younger siblings to see him on his visiting day every week. They took turns.Last summer, Jeffrey made a sign for his father. \u201cHe asked the officer: \u2018May I have a chance to peek outside? Because my son put up a poster.\u2019 I put it right there with a picture of my mother and the four of us,\u201d he said, pointing to the warehouse.The poster said, as Jeffrey recalled, \u201cWe hope our father will be reunited again with our mother, his wife and his four children.\u201d It wasn\u2019t up for long; Jeffrey said he was told by a jail employee that the poster could be considered graffiti, so, after about two weeks, he took it down.By Christmas Day, Maria\u2019s sign had been smeared by the rain and snow and new ones had appeared. There was a poster wishing Misha a Merry Christmas and another that said Feliz Navidad. A Santa Claus decoration and some tinsel had been hung.As visiting hours began, a car pulled up, then another and another. Abraham Lebowitz had come from Monroe, N.Y. He had posted the signs in Hebrew earlier in the year, he said, \u201cfor a few people inside\u201d from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Satmar sect. They announced a religious celebration and the opening of a new building. \u201cJust to make a connection,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should see what is happening in the outside world.\u201dNot everyone\u2019s visiting day fell on Christmas, but some families had come anyway. In one car was the family that had posted the sign that said \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day, Chris B.\u201d months before. They had driven from East New York, Brooklyn. \u201cWe try to come as often as we can,\u201d said Khaiya Tucker, bundling her 2-year-old daughter Aubrey and holding her up so her grandfather could see her from his cell. She pointed to a blinking light on the third floor. \u201cLook, Bree-Bree, it\u2019s your G-Pops,\u201d she said.An icy wind swept in off the water, and down the street another family huddled beside their idling sport utility vehicle, holding up a bedsheet that said, in permanent marker, \u201cMerry Xmas We Love You Bebo.\u201d They had come from Queens to send a message to Victor, 30, who they said was arrested on drug-related charges about five months ago.\u201cI\u2019m here because I miss him,\u201d said his mother, who gave only her first name, Sonia, holding the sheet as it twisted and flapped in the wind. \u201cI want him to know I love him.\u201dUpstairs, a cell lit up.\u201cHis light went on. I saw it!\u201d she said.The family waved and blew kisses as the lights flicked on and off. Victor\u2019s father, Victor Sr., began to weep.Visitors rushed past, hunkered down. The puddles on the street had turned to ice. But Victor\u2019s family stayed outside, stomping against the cold, laughing, looking up. As long as that light was there, it was hard to leave.Finally, they got in the car, and Sonia\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Victor, calling from a shared jail phone. \u201cI just happened to look outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see anybody there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, in Sign of Health Ambitions, Adds Medical Records Feature for iPhone", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the latest indication of Apple\u2019s growing ambitions in the digital health market, the tech giant on Wednesday unveiled a new feature that would allow users to automatically download and see parts of their medical records on their iPhones.The feature is to become part of Apple\u2019s popular Health app. It will enable users to transfer clinical data \u2014 like cholesterol levels and lists of medications prescribed by their doctors \u2014 directly from their medical providers to their iPhones, potentially streamlining how Americans gain access to some health information.A dozen medical institutions across the United States \u2014 including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles \u2014 have agreed to participate in the beta version of the new feature. Apple plans to open the beta test to consumers on Thursday.Apple said it will not see consumers\u2019 medical data, which is encrypted and stored locally on the iPhone, unless the user chooses to share it with the company.\u201cIt\u2019s really strange to me that you can easily pull up all of your spending record on your credit card going back a long way in every detail, yet your health is way more important and you don\u2019t have easy access to your health information,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe want to make sure that consumers are empowered with information about their health.\u201dApple, more than the others, has been reticent to publicize its long-term vision for health technology. But recent product introductions, like the new health records feature, highlight how focused Apple is on using its iPhone, Apple Watch and apps to give people more control over their health care.A review of Apple\u2019s current job openings also gives clues about the company\u2019s wider ambitions in the health care sector.According to the company\u2019s site, Apple is seeking a hardware engineer to develop \u201cnext-generation\u201d health sensors for products like the iPhone and iPad; software engineers for the company\u2019s \u201chealth special projects team\u201d to join \u201can exciting new project at an early stage\u201d; an engineering manager for the company\u2019s motion technologies team \u201cto help shape the next set of groundbreaking features\u201d in fitness and health; and a biomedical scientist to help design studies for health, wellness and physiological measurement apps.\u201cWe will empower you to engage with a variety of internal teams and external partners to continually question the limitations of technology implemented in health products,\u201d says an Apple job description for a health tech hardware development engineer.An earlier version of this article misstated when Apple plans to allow consumers to try testing the new Health app feature that allows users to automatically download and see parts of their medical records on their iPhones.

{"Headline": "New Jersey Town Aims to Keep App-Guided Outsiders Off Its Streets", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEONIA, N.J. \u2014 Monday was Day 1 of this borough\u2019s unusual response to a deluge of traffic from navigation apps, and change was in the air.Perhaps it was the scores of \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d signs newly placed at the foot of streets across the borough, with the affected hours, and a small indication that residents are exempt. Or the 3,000 yellow tags that now hang in residents\u2019 vehicles, allowing local police to tell with a quick glance whether a vehicle is from out of town.Or maybe it was just the handful of news helicopters that hovered above the borough at 5:45 a.m., ready to document what Leonia had wrought by instituting a near-total ban on out-of-town motorists on its streets during the morning and afternoon rush hours.\u201cWe are not looking to create a police state here,\u201d Chief Rowe said. \u201cThe name of the game is to work with the traffic navigation apps and put these streets out of play. That\u2019s the key here.\u201dFor weeks, the police here have coordinated with officials at Waze, Google Maps and Apple Maps so that the apps no longer include the 60 affected streets when directing motorists around traffic tie-ups. In his office at police headquarters, Chief Rowe proudly displayed a screen shot on his phone from 9 a.m. It showed a field of red dots on Apple Maps, indicating closed streets across the borough.With three exits from the New Jersey Turnpike, Leonia offers tantalizing shortcuts through the community, whose suburban streets of Tudors and split-level homes make the borough feel a world away from one of the busiest bridges in the country and one of the biggest cities in the world.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very unique situation,\u201d Chief Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect storm of traffic.\u201dResidents have complained that they sometimes cannot pull out of their driveways because their road has bumper-to-bumper traffic. The new ban on nonresident cars applies to 60 streets in the borough and runs from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week. But those employed in the borough can also apply for the yellow vehicle tags.On Monday, some residents here expressed relief that local officials had moved to reclaim the borough\u2019s bygone suburban serenity. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be good for Leonia,\u201d said Kathy Bianchi, a retiree who lives on Glenwood Avenue, which sees traffic both from a local school and overflow traffic from nearby highways.But Mrs. Bianchi said she had received pushback from people in neighboring towns. \u201cOne of my spin partners said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re not going to let me come through Leonia, I won\u2019t let you come through my town,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t kidding.\u201dIndeed, when Leonia\u2019s council voted in favor of the ordinance last month, some commuters from outside the area lashed out at the borough, while others questioned the measure\u2019s legality. (Borough officials say the ordinance should pass legal muster, pointing to former court cases that upheld similar restrictions around the country.)Even some Leonia residents questioned the legal footing of the ban, however. Scott Greenberg, a video editor who commutes to and from his job in Stamford, Conn., said he would resent being told to keep out of other towns. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s constitutionally viable,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are using the guise of safety and getting ambulances through the town to justify the ban.\u201dBut Chief Rowe said that safety was a main impetus for the new ordinance, pointing to the death in 2014 of a 60-year-old woman who was hit by a school bus. Although the accident was not directly related to traffic congestion, Mr. Rowe believed it was a factor.\u201cWe had 90-minute delays on the George Washington Bridge that day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people are stuck in traffic for a long period, their nerves become frayed and their attention span is altered.\u201dChief Rowe said that the police department would soon decide when to begin enforcing the ban. The first Monday of February, the 5th, was a likely date for officers to begin handing out summonses that carry a $200 fine. But he wanted to give as many people as possible, especially commuters from nearby towns, the opportunity to get into a new routine.\u201cFor some people, that\u2019s the way they have traveled for many years \u2014 it\u2019s muscle memory,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWe will do everything to keep it fair. This is not a revenue-raising scheme by any means. If we feel that the education phase needs to be extended, up to a month, we will certainly do that.\u201dThe focus of the education campaign was near the train station, where vehicles are no longer allowed to make a right turn from Fort Lee Road onto Station Parkway. Instead, they must drive another block to Grand Avenue, one of three county or state roads in Leonia that will remain open to all cars at all times.Chief Rowe said that most of the drivers who ignored the sign and made the turn seemed genuinely unaware of the change. \u201cNone of my officers reported any negative encounters,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one was rude. And obviously the people we saw who were residents gave us the thumbs up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Using a Paper Planner", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn college, my entire life fit neatly inside my paper planner. It housed my to-do lists, class assignments, due dates, phone numbers, scribbles \u2014 you name it. These days, my phone has taken over most of those tasks, and while apps are convenient and fun to use, there was something satisfying about checking in with this planner every day.\u201cIf you\u2019re using your phone, you\u2019re going into different apps for different purposes,\u201d Ms. Reeve said. \u201cYour calendar won\u2019t do everything: You might be using a separate to-do list app, you might be using a separate app for notes. So one of the benefits is having this one book that can have everything in it. You can have it all in one place, and it can be almost as portable as a phone.\u201cAfter years of digitizing your entire life, going back to paper can be vexing, though. If you want to make the switch, here\u2019s how.Make a list of things you want to be able to do with a paper planner that you\u2019re already doing digitally. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018what does this planner need to do for me?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Reeve suggested. \u201cAnd then see what checks off the boxes that you need.\u201d To give you a guideline, Ms. Reeve said that planners typically serve one of five functions:Before you actually buy your planner, think about what you want it to do and how you want to use it, considering these five functions. This will make it so much easier to find the right journal for the job.Once you know the function of your planner, ask yourself some additional questions to narrow down your choices. For example, does your planner need to be portable? \u201cThere are some bigger planners that we really like,\u201d Ms Reeve said. \u201cThey\u2019re folio-type planners that sit on your desk, but they give you a lot more room for writing.\u201d If you have a small desk or you move around when you work, that might not be ideal. So decide how much space you want for your writing. Will you need to take your planner with you everywhere you go, or can it live on your desk?Consider the material, too. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is go out to a store and touch the planner, feel it and really look at it,\u201d Ms. Reeve said. Rather than ordering online, shopping for your planner in-person will give you a better idea of the paper quality. Plus, you can also see if it will fit in your purse, laptop bag or backpack.Finally, come up with a plan for your planner. If you\u2019re like me, your entire life is digital, and you track your schedule with an online calendar and to-do list app. Before you ditch them completely, keep tabs on the events you track with these apps \u2014 birthdays, deadlines, random notes \u2014 then add them to your paper planner accordingly.This sounds obvious, but if you have recurring tasks that your to-do list app adds automatically, the process can get confusing. Make a list of those recurring tasks, and don\u2019t forget to put them on your planner each week, month or quarter. It might even help to write down those tasks on a separate page in your planner. For example, if you have a meeting at 2 p.m. every other Wednesday, write that down on a \u201cRecurring Reminders\u201d page that you check each time you plan out your day, week or month.Rather than jump ship completely, you might also gradually introduce paper planning back into your life. For example, I use Google Calendar to keep track of important dates. Rather than write down these many, many dates in my new paper planner, I decided to keep my monthly digital calendar and simply use my paper planner as a weekly scheduler. Every Friday, I plan my upcoming week, look at my digital monthly calendar, and write down any important due dates. As I get into the habit of writing everything down, perhaps I\u2019ll add my monthly schedule to the mix.All this said, I did find one downside to using a paper planner. As portable as it may be, it will never match the accessibility of your phone, which can make scheduling difficult. For example, one night as I hopped into bed, my phone buzzed. \u201cCan you have this assignment done by next Wednesday?\u201d a client asked. I wanted to check my schedule and email her back, but I remembered I wasn\u2019t using my digital app anymore, and I didn\u2019t have my paper planner in bed with me. \u201cI guess this will have to wait until tomorrow,\u201d I thought. I put down my phone and went to bed.Come to think of it, though, maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing.Advertisement"}

In 2017, that number skyrocketed to 117.Others are responsible, too, though. In the last five years, premium cable has seen 45 percent growth in the number of original programs and basic cable networks a 40 percent rise, and even the broadcast networks have grown by 29 percent, according to FX. This doesn\u2019t even include the large number of non-scripted reality or documentary series.Even lesser-known shows are plugging along. \u201cFuller House,\u201d a Netflix revival of the old ABC family sitcom, released its third season, to little fanfare, last year.\u201cSomeone will tweet me, and they will be, like, \u2018I watched all four seasons in two days,\u2019\u201d the Australian comedian Josh Thomas said last year about his show, \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d \u201cThat took me five years to fill that two days,\u201d he added, with an expletive for emphasis.Still, the freewheeling spending of the streaming services has prompted more networks to spend more than they usually would.

{"Headline": "How to Plan a Last-Minute Trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not too late to plan a trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Here\u2019s how to score a cheap flight, find a place to stay, and catch the games.For me, a Korean-American adopted to the United States the year of South Korea\u2019s first Olympics in 1988, the 2018 encore has been an occasion I\u2019ve long anticipated. Now, three decades later, the Pyeongchang Winter Games are nearly upon us. And my life so far, book ended by Olympics, feels close to coming full circle.While the Winter Olympics never attract the same crowds as its splashier warm-weather sibling, the Pyeongchang Games have faced even greater challenges, due in part to their proximity to the peninsula\u2019s demilitarized zone, a mere 40 miles away. To alleviate anxiety, Pyeongchang Organizing Committee spokeswoman Nancy Park said, organizers are working with intelligence agencies, conducting safety drills and communicating with everyone involved. \u201cIn Korea, the average Korean isn\u2019t that concerned,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for international visitors, we know that it\u2019s a concern, so we try to get out all the information about what it is that we\u2019re doing.\u201dRound-trip, nonstop flights between the U.S. and Seoul routinely go for well over $1,400. But this winter season, despite the Olympics, they\u2019re a bargain. Travelers coming from New York can still secure direct flights for around $1,150 on Korean Air or Asiana. Connecting flights are less than $1,000 on China Eastern. From Los Angeles, they\u2019re even cheaper, with nonstop on Singapore Airlines as low as $800 and one stop on China Eastern around $570. From Chicago, expect to spend about $1,150 for direct and $900 for connecting.Depending on your sporting interests, the prices vary widely, with qualifier rounds costing much less than medal events. For women\u2019s ice hockey, for example, the preliminaries are as little as $23.44 a ticket, while the gold medal game is $295.03 and up. Some sports, like bobsleigh, skeleton and luge, have completely sold out already. Others, like figure skating, are available on an event-by-event basis, with the most high profile ones snatched up long ago. Sixty percent of tickets have been sold, according to Ms. Park\u2019s estimates, so while plenty still remain, it\u2019s best to order as soon as you can.Among the Mountain Cluster\u2019s venues: Alpensia, home to the biathlon, cross-country skiing and ski jumping events; Phoenix Snow Park, for freestyle skiing and snowboarding; the Olympic Sliding Centre, for bobsleigh, skeleton and luge; and Jeongseon and Yongpyong Alpine centers. This Cluster is also the site of the opening and closing ceremony, at Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, and the medal ceremonies, at Pyeongchang Olympic Plaza. About 30 miles east in Gangneung, the Coastal Cluster will host the ice sports, including figure skating, speed skating, curling and hockey. When selecting a lodging locale, spectators should consider the cluster they plan to patronize the most. The other option is South Korea\u2019s capital. \u201cIt really depends on what you want to see. Not everyone wants to see just the competitions,\u201d Ms. Park said. For spectators hoping to do a lot of sightseeing in Seoul, it\u2019s a good idea to set up there and commute into PyeongChang for the Games. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iranian Authorities Block Access to Social Media Tools", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As protests in Iran stretched into their sixth day on Tuesday, the Iranian authorities continued to restrict access to social media tools that have become key sources of information to antigovernment demonstrators.Telegram, a messaging app that is widely used in Iran, has been blocked since Dec. 31, while internet access has been sporadically cut off to several cities where protests have taken place, according to cybersecurity researchers monitoring internet activity in the country. Access to other social media platforms like Instagram has also been intermittent.Social media and messaging apps have become crucial to antigovernment demonstrators around the world, as a means of both organizing and delivering messages to other citizens. Not surprisingly, restricting access to such technology has become as important to government crackdowns as the physical presence of the police.Many social media tools \u2014 as well as a number of products that encrypt internet conversations \u2014 have long been unavailable in Iran. Twitter and Facebook have been banned since 2009, although many Iranians still find ways to use them. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, even opened a Facebook account. But messaging apps like Telegram, which claims some level of encryption, report wide usage in the country.\u201cThe Iranian government is active on Telegram, as is the president, and members of Parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cIranians use it to sell clothes or find doctors, she added. \u201cIn the last week it has become a key source of information about the protests.\u201dIn the past, some Iranians have found ways to get around government restrictions by using tools that evaded Iran\u2019s censorship technology. But economic sanctions imposed on the country have made access to some of those tools more difficult, said Collin Anderson, a cybersecurity researcher who planned to publish a report this week about Iran\u2019s capabilities.Take, for example, the Google App Engine, a service intended to be used as a platform for developing and hosting web applications. In countries where they are otherwise banned, messaging apps that encrypt conversations often use the Google App Engine to conceal their activity within Google\u2019s traffic.But Google believes that it is not allowed to offer its Google App Engine in Iran because of the sanctions. That makes it tough to offer Iranians apps like Signal, which is commonly used in other countries to protect internet communications from surveillance.\u201cGoogle has chosen to adhere to the strictest letter of the law regarding sanctions in Iran, and by doing so they are blocking Iranians from this service,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Google could be worried that technology would be used by nuclear scientists in a potential violation of sanctions. But \u201cthe reality is that the ban affects everyday Iranians\u2019 ability to use a tool that could keep them safe,\u201d he said.Mr. Anderson argued that Google could white list, or unblock, certain applications like Signal. In doing so, Google could allow the app to become widely available in Iran in a matter of hours.Google declined to comment on its policies regarding the use of its technology in Iran.Sanctions have also forced many Iranians to use smartphones and applications that have been jailbroken, a term used when a manufacturer\u2019s restrictions are removed to allow a user to install unauthorized software. But jailbroken phones and apps cannot be updated, leaving their users open to hackers and government monitors that take advantage of bugs in outdated software.\u201cIranians are tech-savvy but by using jailbroken phones they leave themselves really vulnerable,\u201d Ms. Dagres said.The communication crackdown prompted an online outcry that included President Trump, who posted on Twitter over the weekend that Iran had \u201cclosed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!\u201dMs. Dagres argued that tweets from officials in other countries do little, but allowing access to more communications tools would help protect protesters. As it is, she said, Iranians have proved to be resourceful in finding ways to communicate.\u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way,\u201d Ms. Dagres said. \u201cIranians have been living under sanctions for years, and they have always found a way to get online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Toronto, Mr. Tory said, had only \u201cmade the playoffs.\u201dBut regardless of the outcome, the announcement that the city remains a contender showed how much progress Toronto, and the surrounding region, have made in establishing themselves as a major technology center.Amazon offered few details on Thursday about how it had come up with its 20 finalists. Unlike several other finalists, the region offered no tax or other incentives. But Mr. Tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues.In sharp contrast to President Trump\u2019s efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds.\u201cWe\u2019re able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world,\u201d Mr. Tory said.\u201cWe have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full,\u201d Mr. Tory said.But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever-escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker.

{"Headline": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Backing Up Photos", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d says the award-winning National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, about backing up her photos. \u201cI\u2019ve had hard drives fail throughout my career. For example, back when I first started as a photographer, I had a very nice hard drive system in my home, and the whole thing failed.\u201d In retrospect, Ms. Vitale says, she would have definitely set the system up differently.\u201cI lost some historic moments from the first part of my career,\u201d she says, \u201cand they\u2019re gone forever.\u201dMs. Vitale may shoot photos differently from how most of us capture images these days \u2014 she shoots with a digital single-lens-reflex camera (or DSLR). But her cautionary tale should resonate, since many of the same vulnerabilities exist when photographing with smartphones. In other words, if you\u2019re snapping away without a backup plan for your photos, beware: In an instant, you could lose them all, forever.Before I explain how to back up your photos, it\u2019s useful to understand one important aspect of digital photos that relates to storing them properly. Namely, image resolution.Every digital photo has a certain image resolution, which is the total number of pixels that make up a photo. If an image you shot on your smartphone, say, is 4,000 pixels high by 3,000 pixels wide, it contains a total of 12 million pixels (the height multiplied by the width). Since one million pixels is known as a megapixel, the resolution of your smartphone image is 12 megapixels.But right now, most websites, including social media and even photo-printing sites, aren\u2019t designed to truly store photos. That\u2019s because when you back up your photos, you want to be able to retrieve an image file that is as close to, if not identical to, the original photo you captured on your phone or digital camera. That\u2019s also why you want to carefully choose a backup solution, whether it\u2019s online or an external hard drive.The important takeaway here is that you should consider using a combination of services and solutions to safely back up photos. Ideally, store them both online and on two external hard drives (one stored locally and another at a different location). However, at the very least, consider using one online backup, which lets you copy and transfer the photos on your phone, as well as other devices, to an alternate location.By contrast, you get free, unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, allowing you to automatically back up all images from your phone, computer and other devices. Google also recently updated its app for desktop computers, which now can automatically upload photos directly into Google Photos when transferring images from your camera to your computer, which is very convenient.However, Google Photos has limitations as well. If you shoot photos with a resolution larger than 16 megapixels, they\u2019ll be downsized, which some photographers find unacceptable. At this time, smartphones mostly capture 12- or 16-megapixel photos, which won\u2019t be affected, but some models already exceed that limit, as do many digital cameras.Both Amazon Prime Photos and Dropbox have their pros and cons, too. If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account.Dropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB).As the name implies, external hard drives, which range in price from $50 (one to two TB) to $350 and up (eight TB), are like the storage that\u2019s built into your computers, except they\u2019re connected externally. Most hook up via a USB connection, although there are other methods. (For instance, network attached storage, or NAS, drives, connect via an Ethernet line to your home or office network.) As with your internal drive, there are many ways to transfer, copy, or sync your photos. You can also automate your backup using your computer\u2019s operating system, the external hard-drive\u2019s software, or a third-party backup software app or service.Our personal library of images generally doesn\u2019t end with just our digital photos. Many of us also own precious prints, photo albums, slides and negatives, some of which can be decades old.Whatever backup system you eventually select, whether it\u2019s just an online solution or a combination of several services and hard drives, it\u2019s important to monitor the system. Be sure to periodically check it and make sure it\u2019s backing up your photos correctly.Consider these tips from Jill Duffy, Ami Vitale and myself, when backing up your images:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Era That Made It a Verb, Xerox, in a Sale, Is Past Tense", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Xerox introduced its popular copying machines in 1959, their wizardry was considered as high tech as the iPhone when Steve Jobs presented it to the world almost 50 years later.But just as Xerox made carbon paper obsolete, the iPhone, Google Docs and the cloud made Xerox a company of the past.\u201cXerox is the poster child for monopoly technology businesses that cannot make the transition to a new generation of technology,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.The move offers a stark reminder that no matter how high a company may fly, it is still vulnerable to the next big breakthrough. Xerox joins once formidable tech companies like Kodak and BlackBerry that lost the innovation footrace.Under the deal, Fujifilm will own just over 50 percent of the Xerox business. There are plans to cut $1.7 billion in costs in coming years. Fujifilm said its joint venture with Xerox would cut its payroll by 10,000 workers worldwide.How Xerox fell so far is a case study in what management experts call the \u201ccompetency trap\u201d \u2014 an organization becomes so good at one thing, it can\u2019t learn to do anything new.Xerox traces its origins to the founding in 1903 of the M. H. Kuhn Company. But it was an invention dreamed up in a makeshift Queens lab in the 1930s \u2014 a forerunner of the Silicon Valley garages used by the likes of Mr. Jobs \u2014 that changed Xerox\u2019s trajectory.That invention, by Chester Carlson, a patent lawyer, led to the creation of the modern copy machine. He even came up with a term for the process: \u201cxerography.\u201d In 1959, Xerox, which had won the right to explore the technology, offered the office copier that went mainstream.Its corporate name even became a verb.During the good times, Xerox invested in new technology. In the 1970s, it set up a research center in Palo Alto, Calif., far away from its East Coast headquarters. Its goal was to invent the office technology of the future.The technologists at the lab, the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, did not invent the computer mouse and graphical-user interface. But they refined them and built a usable prototype personal computer, the Alto. More than 1,000 Altos were made and put to work, including a few in Jimmy Carter\u2019s White House.In 1979, in a visit that is the stuff of business legend, Mr. Jobs toured the lab. Later, the ideas he saw there found their way into the Apple Macintosh.Over the years, Apple has had its own ups and downs. But whenever Mr. Jobs became convinced that something new was afoot, he moved forcefully and refocused the company. He did not fall into the competency trap, and today Apple is the most valuable corporation in the world.At Xerox, when the corporate managers took over its personal computer project and tried to commercialize the Alto, named the Xerox Star, they priced it at more than $16,000. It flopped.The Xerox Star was priced more like a copier, an expensive office machine, rather than a personal computer. In 1981, the same year the Star came to market, IBM introduced its PC for business, pricing it at less than $1,600. Three years later, the Apple Macintosh sold for about $2,500.In the 1980s, with the patents on its copier technology expiring, Xerox faced stiff competition from lower-cost Japanese competitors like Canon and Ricoh. With its business under pressure, Xerox dabbled in financial services. It bought a casualty insurer, Crum & Forster, and an investment management firm, Van Kampen Merritt.The move into financial services ran into trouble, and the company sold it all off in the 1990s.Since then, Xerox has struggled with the rise of email and the move by offices around the world to send and share documents electronically. Less paper and fewer copies undermined the company\u2019s once lucrative franchise.In recent years, Xerox moved to recast itself more as a business services supplier, helping companies streamline their flow of documents and work in fields like health care, human resources and financial compliance. It won some high-profile contracts \u2014 like operating the computer and payment systems behind E-ZPass highway tolls.\u201cWe believe Xerox still has potential, but it will go the way of Kodak if there aren\u2019t major changes,\u201d Mr. Icahn said in December.Xerox never managed to get ahead of the digital wave to enjoy anything like its former prosperity.Under the deal announced on Wednesday, Xerox, of Norwalk, Conn., will become part of an existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, which sells office products and services in the Asia-Pacific region. As part of the deal, it will issue a combined $2.5 billion in cash dividends to its shareholders.The combined company is expected to have $18 billion in annual revenue and will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under Xerox\u2019s ticker symbol, XRX.\u201cI am confident that Fujifilm\u2019s ability to drive change as well as its experience of successful reinvention will give a competitive edge to the new Fuji Xerox,\u201d Shigetaka Komori, chairman and chief executive officer of Fujifilm, said in a written statement.Fujifilm still makes film, but it has branched out considerably, using its chemical and imaging technology in products as varied as ingredients in cosmetics and medical equipment.Xerox\u2019s shares, which have been mostly flat in recent years despite a broad run-up in the stock market, rose about 12 percent over the past month in anticipation of a deal.The joint venture with Fuji, begun in the early 1960s, has been a bright spot for Xerox, said Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor at the Brandeis International Business School.Initially the stronger partner, Xerox has benefited from shared technology and know-how from its Japanese partner. The merger, Mr. Gomes-Casseres said, is probably the best path ahead for Xerox.\u201cThey could have failed years ago without Fuji,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Sells A.I. for Building A.I. (Novices Welcome)", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has been using artificial intelligence to build other artificially intelligent systems for the last several months.Now the company plans to sell this kind of \u201cautomated machine learning\u201d technology to other businesses across the globe. On Wednesday, Google introduced a cloud-computing service that it bills as a way to build a so-called computer vision system that suits your particular needs \u2014 even if you have little or no experience with the concepts that drive it.If you are a radiologist, for example, you can use CT scans to automatically train a computer algorithm that identifies signs of lung cancer. If you run a real estate website, you can build an algorithm that distinguishes between living rooms and kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.At least that is the pitch. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a Ph.D. in machine learning,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing group. \u201cBut you can still build a highly accurate machine learning model.\u201dGoogle uses the technique while building systems that can recognize faces, products, landmarks and other objects in photos. In some cases, these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers.The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms.At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston\u2019s DataRobot and Silicon Valley\u2019s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future.\u201cThey aim to automate data science in general,\u201d said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore.The question is whether these new services will work as advertised and how rapidly they will evolve in the years to come.Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others already offer cloud-computing services that let businesses add existing machine learning algorithms to their own products. A company can take a Microsoft computer vision algorithm, for example, and slip it into a new smartphone app.But with its new service, Google goes a step further, providing an automated way for businesses to build new algorithms. Businesses can upload their own images, provide a list of objects pictured in these images and train their own computer vision systems, tackling tasks that aren\u2019t necessarily handled by existing technology, according to Google.Initially, Google will open this service only to a small group of businesses. A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price.Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google\u2019s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I.\u201cIt is really powerful technology,\u201d said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies.But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. \u201cThese services are only as good as their parts,\u201d said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. \u201cAnd humans still supply some of the parts.\u201dGoogle says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement. In a matter of minutes, it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer\u2019s images. Given more time, it can build a model from scratch, specifically for the problem at hand.If you are a zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist inside the Google cloud group, all you have to do is supply the right images. \u201cYou upload jaguars and giraffes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you are done.\u201dAll that remains is determining how well it works.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World\u2019s Computers", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201cWhat actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,\u201d said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability \u201chas existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.\u201d It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of A.W.S. and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers \u2014 and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers\u2019 data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability \u2014 at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel\u2019s business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.\u201cIntel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIntel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.\u201dThe researchers who discovered the flaws notified various affected companies. And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.For now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel\u2019s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is \u201cgoing to live with us for decades,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.\u201cWhereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve really screwed up,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThere\u2019s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.\u201dThe Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.The researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.The second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.\u201cThis will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It\u2019s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.\u201dFollow Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @nicoleperlothAdvertisement"}

(GroupM, where Mr. Norman remains a consultant, claims it\u2019s responsible for one out of every three ads worldwide.)While television and newspapers were the dominant forces in his native England when Mr. Norman started his career, he began working with online advertising in the mid-1990s, taking on challenges like increasing listings on search engines like Excite and AltaVista.Later, he guided brands and colleagues through the heydays of MSN and Yahoo and the rise of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and streaming TV. Along the way, Mr. Norman became known for sharing his insights at industry events and in trade publications, always with a healthy dose of dry British wit.Mr. Norman recently spoke with The New York Times about where the media and advertising worlds are now and where he thinks they are going. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.There is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.The people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.At the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters. Then it was held by this display triumvirate of Yahoo, MSN and AOL and, separately, search by Google. And it took quite a long time to get here.If you asked anyone in 2009, \u2018Guess what the combined market shares of Google and Facebook will be in 2017,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure there would have been anyone that would have come close.How long do you think will they maintain that position? It kind of depends on what Google and Facebook allocate their resources to, and like everybody else, it depends on how they manage to navigate actual and potential regulatory environments going forward. I think if they were both worried about a thing today, it would be what regulators think about them, because they\u2019re not at the peak of their popularity with those folks at the moment, it would seem to me.I think that\u2019s why people are so interested in the Amazon story and were so interested in the Snap story and were so interested in Twitter\u2019s story \u2014 because everyone\u2019s looking for the next one to break through.What\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to look and feel completely different that disrupts how people interface with the world around them? My guess is that five to seven years from now, there will be at least one company that people will think of in the top five most important enterprises in advertising that simply doesn\u2019t exist now.Imagine a massively emboldened Hulu.If Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.You could have things like day-after episodes of new drama of the Hulu model and then the entire movie libraries of Universal, Fox, Disney, Pixar and all of the other stuff with it.Then what happens if that same group of people says to the broadcasters of the world: \u201cWhat we have here is a working business model of what the studio system plus the broadcast system can look like in a new world, with a tiered-option model based on some combination of live, day-after, on-demand, paid, ad-funded and so forth, and basically you could slice it whichever way you\u2019d like for your market. We\u2019ve got the content block and the technology license block so that everyone can build their own castle in all these markets.\u201dIt may not be owned 100 percent by one company, but it could be a new phenomenon that could be a kind of distributed monopoly, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really thought about.And this could potentially run ads?Because you\u2019re using the same underlying systems, you suddenly have a data pool that crosses all of that content, all of those users and potentially all of those markets. People are asking the question about what\u2019s the third force? That would probably be the answer.What\u2019s another way that could go?I think if I learned one thing over my career, it is that Newton was right: The objects that are in motion stay in motion, and that motion tends to accelerate, hit plateaus and reaccelerate.Given the asymmetry of certain enterprises in the world, you kind of wonder as to whether or not new Disney, with all of its IP, has in fact become the juiciest peach in the world to be consumed by Apple.If Apple was going to make a \u201cone bound and you\u2019re serious\u201d move into the video content business globally, and the provision of video service business globally, it could make sense. You then have most of Hulu and all of the IP in Pixar, Marvel and all of the other things that Bob Iger has been assembling over the years, and you have ESPN. That wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place to start, and they could do it for 30 percent of their market cap.You can on one hand take it at face value and say that Facebook is taking a step back to their roots. The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.The one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?What have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that? It seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news. I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big appetite for Facebook saying, \u201cWe would like 20 news organizations to provide news bulletin programming for Facebook Watch.\u201dWe know there are dozens and dozens of news organizations around the world, or at least a dozen or two that include The Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, the BBC and so on, who are, for the most part, the keepers of truth in news and the people who keep the public informed.And it seems odd to me that if you have aspirations to take up a very significant part of the media consumption time of the public that you do not have an overt policy for the dissemination of news and to participate in the funding of news for your audience.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Mr. Amazon, Steps Out", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "Mr. Bezos is the world\u2019s richest person and can afford virtually any luxury. But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age. He is 54, not 53.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "German Lawmaker Who Called Muslims \u2018Rapist Hordes\u2019 Faces Sanctions", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A right-wing German lawmaker was temporarily blocked by Twitter after she referred to \u201cbarbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men,\u201d and prosecutors are now looking into whether her remark violated the country\u2019s hate-speech laws.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of police in NRW tweeting in Arabic,\u201d Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. \u201cAre they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men?\u201dFacebook later removed that post, Ms. von Storch told her followers. She vowed not to be silenced by the new law, but to continue to \u201ccall out problems by name.\u201d She went on to insist that the young men who had sexually harassed German women were \u201cnot Protestant Swedes, not Catholic Poles, not Orthodox Russians, not Jewish Israelis and not Buddhist Thais. The overwhelming majority of them are young Muslim men for whom women and followers of other faiths are second-class citizens.\u201dThe party ran on a platform arguing that Islam was incompatible with the German Constitution.Ulf Willuhn, a spokesman for state prosecutors, said on Tuesday that his office had been alerted to Ms. von Storch\u2019s statement by the Cologne police and was also looking into a statement of support for her, made by a leader of the party, Alice Weidel. As news of the investigation spread, private citizens filed dozens more complaints.Unlike the United States, Germany has very strict laws governing hate speech and comments that denigrate ethnic and religious groups, a legacy of its dark, totalitarian past. The new law regarding social media companies solidified the country\u2019s position as one of the most aggressive in moving against online hate speech.Prosecutors must now decide whether there is sufficient evidence of criminal action to open a formal investigation that could lead to charges, Mr. Willuhn said. But before that step can be taken, Germany\u2019s Parliament would have to lift immunity.Many of the Alternative for Germany\u2019s followers are active on social media, and the party claims nearly three times as many followers on Facebook than either of the country\u2019s two largest parties, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats or the center-left Social Democrats.Digital and human rights groups and others had warned that the new law \u2014 which was passed last year, but fully took effect on Monday \u2014 placed too much of the burden of patrolling the internet on companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Snapchat. Under the law, the companies are required to to remove any content that is illegal in Germany \u2014 such as Nazi symbols or Holocaust denial, but also any remarks that could be considered calling for incitement \u2014 within 24 hours of it being brought to their attention.Within 24 hours of its posting, Facebook had removed the video and closed the man\u2019s account, citing its content. The company later restored the post and apologized for the error, but only after dozens of users had complained about the decision.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate, Rebuffing Privacy Concerns, Clears Path to Extend Surveillance Law", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate cleared the path on Tuesday for Congress to extend the National Security Agency\u2019s warrantless surveillance program for six years with minimal changes, rejecting bipartisan calls to first vote on amendments that would have imposed significant new privacy protections when the program sweeps up Americans\u2019 emails.The vote, 60 to 38, narrowly overcame a procedural obstacle to an up-or-down vote on the surveillance extension bill, showing that there is probably sufficient support in the Senate to give it final approval and send it to President Trump\u2019s desk this week.The vote centered on a law known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. It permits the government to, without a warrant, collect from American companies, like AT&T and Google, the emails, phone calls, text messages and other communications of foreigners abroad who have been targeted for intelligence surveillance \u2014 even when they communicate with Americans.While Senate approval of the bill has been widely expected, the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s vote was not certain because several lawmakers \u2014 including Senators Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky \u2014 had vowed to filibuster the legislation, meaning the approval of 60 of the 100 senators was necessary to overcome that procedural delay tactic.The vote was close, and was held open longer than expected at a 58-to-38 split while the holdouts fell under heavy lobbying by their colleagues. Ultimately, two more senators \u2014 John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, and Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri \u2014 voted for the legislation, getting to the 60-vote threshold.The vote was also closely watched because civil liberties-minded liberals have been pressuring Democrats to oppose the surveillance extension without the sort of changes the House rejected last week. Such pressure suggests that the vote could have political reverberations if progressive-leaning voters treat it as a litmus test in future contests like the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.First enacted in 2008, the law codified a form of the N.S.A. warrantless surveillance program that the Bush administration secretly created after the Sept. 11 attacks. In 2012, Congress extended it for five years without changes. It is now up for renewal for the first time since the 2013 leaks by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden set off a broad debate about surveillance and privacy.Before the vote, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Paul held a news conference with several other senators who argued that the bill as written was insufficient and who objected to a maneuver by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, to prevent lawmakers from getting a chance to vote on amendments to it.But introducing the Senate session soon afterward, Mr. McConnell emphasized that the law did not permit warrantless collection targeting Americans or people known to be in the United States and urged his colleagues to permit a vote on the House bill without amendment.\u201cWith respect to foreigners on foreign soil, 702 gives the men and women who keep us safe a vital tool they need to fulfill their missions,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cFive years ago, Congress reauthorized the title with overwhelming bipartisan support. It\u2019s imperative that we do so once again.\u201dRepublicans who broke party ranks to oppose Mr. McConnell\u2019s effort to move forward on the bill without amendments included Ted Cruz of Texas, Steve Daines of Montana, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mr. Paul.Democrats who supported Mr. McConnell\u2019s move included Tom Carper of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Ms. McCaskill, Bill Nelson of Florida, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Warner of Virginia and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Angus King, independent of Maine, also voted to move forward on the bill.Complicating matters, the bill contains a gesture toward creating a requirement that the authorities get a warrant for such surveillance when F.B.I. agents already have a criminal investigation open into an American with no national-security angle. Mr. Warner, who is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cited that provision as meaningful reform.But critics noted that the provision is so narrowly written that it would not apply most of the time when government officials query Americans\u2019 private information, such as security-related searches by any agency, or F.B.I. searches when agents are pursuing ordinary criminal tips before opening a formal investigation. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told colleagues it was a \u201csham\u201d requirement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Your Child a Phone \u2018Addict\u2019?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI have spent the past 15 years helping teens with organization and time management. Many parents of kids I work with are conflicted about their teens\u2019 smartphone use. They appreciate the convenience of having access to their children and the potential safety benefits. And, in an age of social media socialization, teenagers use messaging apps to stay in touch with friends and make social plans, some of which can be positive.When a high school student I work with broke his neck playing football this past fall, his smartphone became a crucial link not just to friends, but also to others dealing with similar injuries. After watching videos of others documenting their recovery on YouTube, he connected with some via Facebook Messenger and began conversations he found \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201dFor some teens, the constant potential feedback loop from notifications and messaging might create a fear of missing out, or FOMO. And although there is currently no official medical recognition of \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d as a disease or disorder, the term refers to obsessive behaviors that disturb the course of daily activities in a way that mirrors patterns similar to substance abuse.In my work with students, I\u2019ve found that even teenagers who want to curb their phone use may find it difficult to self-regulate without parental guidance. Creating daily and weekly offline time as part of the family routine is helpful, and finding a way to have a once- or twice-yearly extended period of time off \u2014 at a summer camp or outdoor expedition without Wi-Fi, or on a family trip \u2014 may provide the reset teens need to break negative habits.For parents thinking of getting their kids smartphones, providing incremental and compartmentalized access can help establish good habits and prevent problematic dependency. Parents sometimes hand down their old iPhones as a first phone for a child in elementary school. I encourage parents to get their kids flip phones first, and wait until they have developed good overall habits before giving them a smartphone.Just as kids learn to ride bikes with training wheels or get junior licenses when they learn to drive, kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to manage their first smartphones all by themselves. Fortunately, there are ways to manage use and help kids develop better tendencies, and much of it requires a delicate balance of parental modeling and involvement.For parents of teens who have smartphones, making the effort to understand how, where and why kids are spending time on their phone is critical.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Electric Cars\u2019 Prospects Brighten, Japan Fears Being Left Behind", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFUJI, Japan \u2014 At a factory near the base of Mount Fuji, workers painstakingly assemble transmissions for some of the world\u2019s top-selling cars. The expensive, complex components, and the workers\u2019 jobs, could be obsolete in a couple of decades.The threat: battery-powered electric vehicles.Their designs do away with the belts and gears of a transmission, as well as thousands of other parts used in conventional cars. Established suppliers are nervous, especially in Japan, where automaking is a pillar of the economy \u2014 and where industrial giants have been previously left behind by technological change.\u201cIf the world went all-E.V. today, it would kill my business,\u201d said Terry Nakatsuka, chief executive of Jatco, the company that owns the transmission factory, using a shorthand term for electric vehicles.With 7,000 workers, Jatco is part of a vast ecosystem of carmakers and suppliers that provides one in 10 Japanese jobs, accounts for a fifth of national exports and generates more profit than any other industry in Japan.Japan is scrambling to ensure it has a future in an electric-car world. Toyota, the country\u2019s largest automaker, pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids but has long been skeptical about consumers\u2019 appetite for cars that run on batteries alone. Now, under pressure from foreign rivals like Tesla, the company says it is developing a batch of new electric models.The Japanese government has made managing the shift to next-generation vehicles a priority, but critics say its approach lacks focus. It has bet big on hydrogen fuel cells, an alternative technology to plug-in rechargeable batteries that is struggling to win widespread support.The fear is that once again, Japan will miss a big technological shift.In the consumer electronics sector, the transition to new products like flat-screen televisions and digital music players undermined once-ubiquitous Japanese brands. Innovation in the digital era became the domain of Silicon Valley, while mass production shifted to China.As a result, some storied names in the world of technology \u2014 Sharp, Toshiba, Sanyo \u2014 have disappeared or no longer resonate with the world\u2019s consumers the way they once did.\u201cWhat really puts Japan on the defensive is the idea that the tech revolution is coming to the car industry,\u201d said James Kondo, a visiting professor at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo who has worked with technology companies in the United States and Japan.\u201cThe industry is at the center of everything, not just economically but psychologically, and it\u2019s facing fundamental change,\u201d he added.At the annual Tokyo Motor Show this autumn, some of Japan\u2019s biggest carmakers sought to dispel concerns that they had underinvested in electric vehicles.Toyota and Honda prominently displayed new electric prototypes. Previously, they had expressed doubt that cars relying entirely on rechargeable batteries would prove reliable enough, or able to travel far enough, that consumers would embrace them.Their focus has instead been on developing cars that extract energy from onboard hydrogen fuel cells. Enthusiasm for that technology has faded in other countries, in part because it would require huge and expensive new infrastructure for delivering hydrogen to drivers.Japan is becoming an increasingly isolated hydrogen booster.Toyota displayed a new fuel-cell prototype at the show alongside its plug-in model. And the government remains committed to pouring money into transformative \u201chydrogen society\u201d projects, with plans to build 320 hydrogen stations for cars by 2025.\u201cThe trend toward electric vehicles is growing, and sales are increasing, but we can\u2019t suddenly jump to E.V.s,\u201d Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s industry minister, said in September, defending the government\u2019s commitment to hydrogen.Not all of Japan\u2019s carmakers have been avoiding electric vehicles. Nissan was an early advocate of battery-only cars, introducing its Leaf all-electric model in 2010.Other automakers are now starting to branch out more widely. This month, Toyota announced a battery-development partnership with Panasonic, which supplies lithium-ion batteries to Tesla, the upstart American maker of electric cars. Toyota said it would introduce 10 new electric models by the early 2020s, with the aim of selling one million all-electric vehicles a year by 2030.The Toyota-Panasonic tie-up shows how some nontraditional auto suppliers in Japan stand to gain from the shift to electric. Panasonic, which lost billions of dollars over the last decade as its television business shriveled, has turned auto parts into its fastest-growing division, selling sensors and cockpit consoles as well as batteries.Some in the industry, pointing to Tesla\u2019s problems in expanding production, say big companies like Toyota are ultimately better positioned to take electric vehicles to the mass market.But the rapid shifts in the landscape have unnerved many in the industry. Like the phones and televisions of today, the cars of tomorrow may be distinguished less by how solidly they are built than by the software that runs them, and how cleverly they are designed and marketed. Already, Apple and Google \u2014 technology companies with a knack for giving people what they want \u2014 are exploring getting into the auto industry.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Akio Toyoda, Toyota\u2019s chief executive, said last year.Mr. Nakatsuka, the Jatco chief executive, understands the danger as well as anyone. His company is pushing a simplified transmission system that he says could be installed in electric vehicles to reduce stress on their motors and batteries.But he says Jatco\u2019s best hope is that takeup of electric vehicles will be slow.\u201cCountries are moving very fast, and carmakers are moving faster, too, but consumers are still not convinced,\u201d he said, citing unresolved questions about electric vehicles\u2019 range, safety and durability.For now, Jatco, which is jointly owned by Nissan, Mitsubishi and Suzuki, is focused on nearer-term threats, like Japan\u2019s worsening labor shortage and price competition from rivals.It is automating its factories as fast as it can. Transmissions contain about 400 separate parts, which must be precisely assembled, and their production is hard to leave to robots. But Jatco says its next assembly line will be 70 percent automated, up from 40 percent for its most recently completed line.Eventually, it wants robots to do 100 percent of the work \u2014 meaning that by the time electric cars turn transmissions into museum pieces, there may be few human jobs left to lose.Mr. Nakatsuka said he did not expect transmission-less, battery-powered cars to take a big chunk of the market until at least 2030.\u201cAfter that,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be retired.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Design for One Turns Into Design for All", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookMatthew Walzer was a college-bound teenager with cerebral palsy when he sent a letter to Nike several years ago. He explained that he had trouble tying laces and slipping into shoes without help.But he didn\u2019t want sneakers that looked clunky and clinical. He wanted Nikes, stylish ones like other students wore that worked for him.In response, the company introduced a line called FlyEase. They\u2019re slip-ons with a zipper that seals the back and then Velcro-ties the top in one simple motion.Not incidentally, they look fantastic.A pair is now on view at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in \u201cAccess+Ability,\u201d a show organized by Cara McCarty and Rochelle Steiner.See for yourself:Nearly a century ago, tubular metal furniture by Marcel Breuer helped reinvent the wheelchair. Chairs by Charles and Ray Eames, classics of midcentury modernism, evolved from a molded plywood splint the couple devised for wounded soldiers.But too often products made for people with different physical, cognitive and sensory abilities have been ugly, feebly designed and stigmatizing.They\u2019ve been developed not by designers but by engineers. And engineers haven\u2019t always taken their cues from people who have disabilities, the ones who know best what they need and want.The exhibition makes plain why design matters. It points toward a generational change in thinking, not just about designing for difference but about diversity and inclusion. Make a specialty item easier to use \u2014 and at the same time, fun, cool and beautiful \u2014 and that item may be embraced and used by all. The real issue isn\u2019t disability. It\u2019s choice.Graham Pullin is one of the designers of a prosthesis in the show, called Hands of X. I called him the other day. He cited the example of eyeglasses, which doctors used to call \u201cmedical appliances.\u201d Then fashion designers got involved.Annual global sales of eyewear now approach $100 billion. You can imagine if hearing aids were given the same treatment. They might end up looking like the Bedazzled and Bejeweled Earring Aid, by Elana Langer, in \u201cAccess+Ability\u201d:It turns out that one out of five adults in the United States has some disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 one out of 20 children. That\u2019s a demographic and economic motivator. But we also know that when people feel better about themselves, medical outcomes improve.\u201cThe utility of the most functional object in the world will go to waste if potential users don\u2019t connect with it and can\u2019t see themselves using it,\u201d said Donald Strum, a principal for product and graphic design at Michael Graves Architecture and Design. Graves\u2019s firm has rethought, among many medical devices, walking sticks, so they work better and use interchangeable handles, colors and tips, which let customers personalize them.Mr. Strum told me he approached Target about producing a line of medical equipment a decade ago. The company declined. Back then, its marketing department didn\u2019t find the idea sexy. If other retailers took the lead, company officials said, they might follow.Well, the climate has clearly changed. Target now offers adaptive clothing. There\u2019s a Target puffer jacket in the show, designed by Mari Anderson Bogdan, with Velcro seams and zip-on sleeves to serve young people who have trouble dressing.Zappos has gotten into the game, too, selling reversible shirts, coats, dresses and pants, in response to parents who petitioned the online retailer to offer shoes and clothes, easy on and off, for children with disabilities.And now Tommy Hilfiger has its own line of pants, shirts, jackets, sweaters and dresses, using magnetic closures instead of buttons and snaps.Hilfiger has teamed up with MagnaReady, a company started a few years ago by Maura Horton, then a former clothing designer, whose husband suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease. He had trouble buttoning his shirt. Ms. Horton saw an opportunity, not an obstacle. As with other products in the show, the impetus for better design came from the ground up, in this case not from someone with the disability but from a family member.You don\u2019t have to have Parkinson\u2019s or arthritis or a prosthetic hand to prefer magnets to buttons and snaps, or to like the idea, and look, of Velcro seams and zippered sleeves. There\u2019s a white dress shirt with magnetic closures in the show, which could easily be marketed straight to mainstream consumers, never mind the \u201cadaptive\u201d label. Likewise, pairs of brightly patterned compression socks by Top & Derby.They provide a good example of how design alters the social and business calculus. Compression socks help increase the circulation of blood and minimize swelling from prolonged sedentariness. They\u2019re often worn by people with diabetes or high blood pressure. You may picture them in tan, black or white, next to the bunion pads at the drugstore.But, as it happens, fashion models wear compression socks, too, because they spend long stretches of time on airplanes. So do athletes. And what models and athletes wear moves a lot of merchandise.Compression socks in stylish patterns are just stylish socks that happen to have a medical value for some customers. Any fashion-conscious consumer with a little cash to spare might consider them.When I got home from the show, I Googled a picture of the Nike FlyEase for my teenage son but didn\u2019t tell him the back story. He loved they way they looked.Then I recounted the sneakers\u2019 origins. Would he still wear them? I asked.\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked me back.And that response points toward the generational shift. \u201cMillennials are incredibly nonjudgmental and accepting,\u201d said Leslie Speer, a designer of a prosthetic leg in the exhibition.Ms. Steiner, the co-curator, agreed: \u201cWhen I talk to my design students about inclusive design, there is no snickering, not even a hint of doubt. They simply take it for granted that it\u2019s part of a designer\u2019s job today.\u201dThis is plain logic, really. All our shoes, coats and sweaters, the beds we sleep on, the forks and knives we eat with, our lamps and loudspeakers, stairs and elevators, central heat and air-conditioning exist to compensate for what every human being, to some degree, lacks and needs.\u201cSuper normal\u201d is a term that the designers Jasper Morrison and Naoto Fukasawa coined some years ago to describe a class of everyday, mostly anonymous products. Super normal chairs, lamps and bottle openers don\u2019t try too hard to be noticed; they\u2019re part of life, they do their jobs. And we would miss them if they weren\u2019t around.\u201cHow super normal can a prosthetic hand be?\u201d is, in essence, the question posed by Hands of X. The project envisions prosthetic hands made from ordinary, tasteful, mix-and-match materials like wood, leather, felt and metal. Muji was an inspiration. It pictures the acquisition of hands becoming similar to picking eyeglass frames or a paint color for a car: unremarkable and at the same time an expression of personal identity.\u201cWe think of prosthetic hands mostly in two forms,\u201d Mr. Pullin told me. \u201cThere is anatomical realism \u2014 meaning those pink, plastic hands \u2014 or bionic, \u2018Terminator\u2019 hands. Our focus with Hands of X was on people in the middle who don\u2019t want to hide their disability, but also don\u2019t want to become poster children for some futuristic, superhuman narrative, which carries with it a fairly exhausting notion of \u2018triumph over adversity.\u2019\u201dHis phrase for Hands of X: \u201cNo triumph, no tragedy.\u201d\u201cOur stuff is not cheap,\u201d Mr. Palibroda acknowledged, \u201cbut we\u2019re the cheapest prosthetic cover company by far, and we get daily pushback from the industry. Distributors and clinicians are constantly telling us to quadruple our prices.\u201dMs. Wanner said that keeping the covers relatively affordable is partly about changing the public conversation: \u201cWe want an 18-year-old girl to be able to afford our cover and feel fabulous. Part of the annoyance of being an amputee is that in public people are always seeing prostheses and asking the amputees to explain what happened, so they\u2019re constantly made to relive trauma. Our desire is that people see these covers and say, \u2018cool legs,\u2019 like \u2018cool boots.\u2019\u201dNobody wants pity, Ms. Wanner added: \u201cWe all want the same thing. We all want to feel amazing.\u201dAn earlier version of this critic\u2019s notebook misstated the surname of one of the designers who coined the term \u201csuper normal.\u201d He is Jasper Morrison, not Meyerson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expect 2018 to Be More Sane? Sorry, It\u2019s Not Going to Happen", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHappy new year to you and yours, of course, but I\u2019m going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You\u2019re fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded.Sure, as in any year, a lot of good things could happen in 2018, and perhaps lots of bad things will happen, too. (How\u2019s that for a prediction?) But there is a deeper and more unsettling certainty about the ride upon which we\u2019ve all just embarked: A lot of probably very crazy things will happen in 2018.Get ready for even more events that don\u2019t follow the rational course, and narratives that appear unmoored from the laws of politics, business and science. The background sensation of uncertainty that has pervaded much of the last two years isn\u2019t going to abate. Just the opposite \u2014 my columnist\u2019s Spidey sense tells me it\u2019s only going to get worse. Strap in.Yet what has happened is rather quite different. Instead of revealing unseen order and predictability in the world, technology has unleashed a cascade of forces that have made the world more volatile \u2014 and thus made the future hazier and more open to out-of-the-blue results.Some of this isn\u2019t news. In 2016 and 2017, the world began to appreciate how smartphones and social networks can upend what we once considered the natural order. Tech has helped undercut the power of incumbent institutions \u2014 governments, political parties, the media, the patriarchy \u2014 and it has created a new class of geopolitical actors whose presence and ricocheting power we\u2019re all still getting used to: trolls, terrorists, conspiracy theorists, social-media activists, hackers and cyptocurrency bugs, among others.These dynamics aided many of the biggest and most surprising stories in the last couple of years \u2014 Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the emergent resistance movement against him, the #MeToo avalanche, the decline of Uber, the rise of Bitcoin.Yet even as a barrage of surprising stories plays out, many of us have yet to come to grips with the permanence of this chaos. People seem to have a latent, hopeful sense that things are going to calm down, that we\u2019re on the cusp of a more normal news cycle. I suspect that\u2019s wrong. Chaos is the new normal; the apprehension you feel every time you get a notification on your phone \u2014 the fear that you don\u2019t know what fresh horror it could bring \u2014 isn\u2019t an overreaction but an adaptation. Thanks to phones and Facebook, anything really could happen tomorrow.\u201cThere are just a lot more variables in play,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cThink about how a single tweet from Donald Trump can have all these strange reverberations across the world. You can almost apply chaos theory to Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\u201dOne of the touchstone ideas of chaos theory, which is the study of dynamic systems, is the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d \u2014 the idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to huge differences in outcomes, like how a butterfly flapping its wings in Peru can cause a hurricane in Houston.But it\u2019s not just that one-off stories cause huge cascades; it\u2019s that in a connected world, there are now so many one-off stories capable of setting off cascades, and no one knows which ones will hit.Note how Mr. Trump was not brought down by the series of sexual harassment claims against him during the presidential campaign \u2014 and yet just a few months later, claims against a host of other powerful men spiraled into a culture-shaping movement that has upended many parts of the economy.As if all that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s another complication to fold into the chaos: Technology isn\u2019t stopping. The pace of technological change is in many cases too fast for anyone of us to comprehend or get used to; as a result, just as the world seems to get its head around one new force unleashed by tech, another comes along to discombobulate our efforts to respond to it.For example, in the last year and a half, social networks have tried several ways to tamp down the misinformation flowing online. Their efforts have been fitful at best, but already they risk being outdated. Soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality software will make it trivially easy to create not just text-based misinformation but entirely fake audio and video, too.In the run-up to the 2018 election, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have vowed to take on the kinds of misinformation and trolling that ran amok in 2016. But what if social media is hit with a wave of explosive, realistic-looking viral videos whose authenticity can\u2019t be confirmed? It\u2019s highly unlikely that the social networks, the news media or the political class will know how to respond to such a situation.Mr. Rose pointed out that in the long span of human history, periods of turbulence aren\u2019t unusual; technological change often prompts social and political instability and unpredictability. What is unusual now is that many of us aren\u2019t used to this sort of chaos.\u201cSo I do think people are now realizing the world is less predictable than we thought it was,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cBut in some ways that\u2019s a return to normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Devumi vende seguidores de Twitter y retuits a celebridades, negocios y cualquier persona que quiera ser m\u00e1s popular o ejercer influencia en internet. Usando un conjunto de al menos 3,5 millones de cuentas automatizadas \u2014cada una de ellas ha sido vendida muchas veces\u2014 la compa\u00f1\u00eda le ha proporcionado a sus clientes m\u00e1s de 200 millones de seguidores en Twitter, seg\u00fan revel\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n de The New York Times.Las cuentas que m\u00e1s se parecen a las personas reales, como la de Rychly, muestran el patr\u00f3n de una especie de robo de identidad social a gran escala. Al menos 55.000 cuentas de Devumi usan los nombres, fotos de perfil, lugares de origen y otros detalles personales de usuarios reales de Twitter, incluidos menores de edad, seg\u00fan un an\u00e1lisis de datos realizado por el Times.\u201cNo quiero que mi foto est\u00e9 relacionada a esa cuenta, ni mi nombre\u201d, dijo Rychly, quien ahora tiene 19 a\u00f1os. \u201cNo puedo creer que alguien pague por eso. Es simplemente horrible\u201d.En noviembre, Facebook revel\u00f3 a sus inversores que ten\u00eda al menos el doble de usuarios falsos que los estimados anteriormente, lo que indica que existen unas 60 millones de cuentas automatizadas en la plataforma de medios sociales m\u00e1s grande del mundo. Estas cuentas falsas, conocidas como bots, pueden ayudar a influenciar a las audiencias publicitarias y replantear los debates pol\u00edticos. Pueden afectar negocios y arruinar reputaciones. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista legal, su creaci\u00f3n y venta est\u00e1n en una zona gris.\u201cLa continua viabilidad de cuentas fraudulentas e interacciones en las plataformas de redes sociales, y la profesionalizaci\u00f3n de estos servicios fraudulentos, es muestra de que todav\u00eda hay mucho trabajo por hacer\u201d, dijo el senador dem\u00f3crata de Virginia Mark Warner, quien tambi\u00e9n es miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Inteligencia del Senado de Estados Unidos, que ha estado investigando la propagaci\u00f3n de cuentas falsas en Facebook, Twitter y otras plataformas.El fundador de Devumi, German Calas, neg\u00f3 que su compa\u00f1\u00eda vendiera seguidores falsos y dijo que no sab\u00eda nada sobre las identidades sociales robadas a los usuarios reales. \u201cLas acusaciones son falsas y no tenemos conocimiento de ninguna de esas actividades\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Calas en un intercambio de correos electr\u00f3nicos en noviembre.En momentos en que Facebook, Twitter y Google se enfrentan a una epidemia de manipulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y noticias falsas, los seguidores falsos de Devumi fungen como la infanter\u00eda de las batallas pol\u00edticas en l\u00ednea. Los clientes de esa empresa incluyen tanto a partidarios ac\u00e9rrimos de Donald Trump como a comentaristas liberales y conservadores de la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense.A diferencia de algunas empresas de redes sociales, Twitter no exige que sus cuentas est\u00e9n vinculadas a una persona real. Tambi\u00e9n permite un mayor acceso automatizado a su plataforma que otras compa\u00f1\u00edas, lo que facilita la creaci\u00f3n y el control de grandes cantidades de cuentas.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cLas redes sociales son un mundo virtual en el que la mitad son bots y el resto es gente real\u201d, dijo Rami Essaid, fundador de Distil Networks, una empresa de ciberseguridad que se especializa en erradicar redes de bots. \u201cNo puedes aceptar sin m\u00e1s lo que dice un tuit. Y no todo es lo que parece\u201d.Resulta que eso incluye a Devumi.El a\u00f1o pasado, tres mil millones de personas iniciaron sesi\u00f3n en redes como Facebook, WhatsApp o la china Sina Weibo. El anhelo colectivo del mundo por establecer una conexi\u00f3n no solo ha cambiado la composici\u00f3n de la lista de las 500 empresas con mayor valuaci\u00f3n de Fortune y reformulado el mundo de la publicidad, sino que ha creado un nuevo indicador de estatus: la cantidad de personas que te siguen, te dan me gusta o te agregan como \u201camigo\u201d. Para algunos artistas o empresarios, ese estatus virtual es un factor de influencia en el mundo real. Los conteos de seguidores en redes sociales pueden determinar qui\u00e9nes los contratan, cu\u00e1nto les pagan por patrocinios o compromisos e, incluso, c\u00f3mo los clientes potenciales eval\u00faan sus productos o negocios.Una cantidad alta de seguidores tambi\u00e9n es clave para los influenciadores que aspiran a marcar tendencia o para las estrellas de YouTube a quienes las empresas les dan miles de millones de d\u00f3lares al a\u00f1o para patrocinar sus productos. Mientras m\u00e1s alcance tengan esas personalidades, m\u00e1s dinero ganan. De acuerdo con datos de Captiv8, una empresa que vincula a los influenciadores con las marcas, alguien con 100.000 seguidores puede ganar hasta 2000 d\u00f3lares por un solo tuit promocionado, mientras que alguien con un mill\u00f3n de seguidores podr\u00eda cobrar hasta 20.000 d\u00f3lares.La fama genuina a veces conlleva una influencia real en redes sociales, con los fan\u00e1ticos que siguen a sus estrellas de cine favoritas, a cocineros c\u00e9lebres y modelos. Pero tambi\u00e9n hay atajos disponibles: en sitios como Social Envy y DIYLikes.com tan solo se requiere dar un n\u00famero de tarjeta para comprar un ej\u00e9rcito de seguidores en cualquier plataforma social en l\u00ednea.\u201cVes a un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s alto o una mayor cantidad de retuits y supones que esa persona es importante o que a ese tuit le fue bien\u201d, dijo Rand Fishkin, fundador de Moz, compa\u00f1\u00eda que desarrolla software de optimizaci\u00f3n y posicionamiento en motores de b\u00fasquedas. \u201cComo resultado, es m\u00e1s probable que t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n lo amplifiques, lo compartas o que sigas a esa persona\u201d.Twitter y Facebook pueden ser influenciadas de manera similar. \u201cLas plataformas sociales quieren recomendarte cosas y dicen: \u2018\u00bfLo que estamos recomendando es popular?\u2019\u201d, dijo Julian Tempelsman, cofundador de Smyte, firma de ciberseguridad que ayuda a empresas a combatir el fraude y abuso en l\u00ednea y a los bots. \u201cLa cantidad de seguidores es uno de los factores que toman en cuenta\u201d.Para entender mejor el negocio de Devumi, contratamos sus servicios. En abril, el Times cre\u00f3 una cuenta de prueba en Twitter y le pag\u00f3 a Devumi 225 d\u00f3lares por 25.000 seguidores; alrededor de un centavo de d\u00f3lar por cada uno. Como se promete, los primeros 10.000 parec\u00edan ser personas reales. Ten\u00edan fotograf\u00edas y nombres completos, la ciudad en la que se encontraban y biograf\u00edas que parec\u00edan ser aut\u00e9nticas. Una cuenta se asemejaba a la de Rychly, la joven de Minnesota.Pero vistas m\u00e1s de cerca hab\u00eda detalles extra\u00f1os. Los nombres de las cuentas ten\u00edan letras de m\u00e1s o usaban guion bajo o sustitu\u00edan letras tan similares que el cambio era casi imperceptible, como una ele min\u00fascula en vez de una i may\u00fascula.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusLos siguientes 15.000 seguidores de Devumi eran m\u00e1s claramente sospechosos: no ten\u00edan im\u00e1genes de perfil y en vez de nombres ten\u00edan una mezcla de letras, n\u00fameros y fragmentos de palabras.Pero los registros de la empresa revisados por el Times revelan mucho de lo que Devumi y sus clientes prefieren ocultar.La mayor\u00eda de los compradores mejor conocidos de Devumi venden productos, servicios o a s\u00ed mismos en las redes. En entrevistas dieron explicaciones variadas: compraron a los seguidores porque ten\u00edan curiosidad sobre c\u00f3mo funcionaba o se sintieron presionados para tener un n\u00famero de seguidores m\u00e1s altos para ellos mismos o para sus clientes. \u201cTodos lo hacen\u201d, dijo la actriz Deirdre Lovejoy, clienta de Devumi.Aunque algunos dijeron que cre\u00edan que Devumi les daba fan\u00e1ticos potenciales o clientes reales, otros admitieron que sab\u00edan o sospechaban que las cuentas eran falsas. Varios dijeron arrepentirse de haber hecho la compra.\u201cEs un fraude\u201d, dijo James Cracknell, remador brit\u00e1nico y medallista de oro ol\u00edmpico que le compr\u00f3 50.000 seguidores a Devumi. \u201cLa gente que juzga seg\u00fan cu\u00e1ntos me gusta o cu\u00e1ntos seguidores\u2026 no es algo saludable\u201d.Kathy Ireland tiene m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de seguidores en Twitter, que usa frecuentemente para promocionar empresas con las que tiene acuerdos de patrocinio. Pero en enero del a\u00f1o pasado Ireland solo ten\u00eda unos 160.000 seguidores. El mes siguiente, un empleado de su agencia de licencias de marca, Sterling/Winters, gast\u00f3 unos 2000 d\u00f3lares para conseguir 300.000 seguidores m\u00e1s, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi. El empleado despu\u00e9s hizo m\u00e1s adquisiciones, seg\u00fan reconoci\u00f3 en una entrevista. Un an\u00e1lisis del Times hall\u00f3 que la mayor\u00eda de los seguidores de Ireland parecen ser bots.Una portavoz dijo que ese empleado actu\u00f3 sin la autorizaci\u00f3n de Ireland y que hab\u00eda sido suspendido despu\u00e9s de que el Times pregunt\u00f3 al respecto. \u201cEstoy segura de que pens\u00f3 que estaba cumpliendo con sus responsabilidades, pero no es algo que deber\u00eda haber hecho\u201d, dijo la vocera, Rona Menashe.Varios clientes de Devumi o sus representantes contactados por el Times se negaron a hacer comentarios. Muchos otros no respondieron a intentos reiterados para contactarlos.Muchas de las celebridades, l\u00edderes empresariales, astros deportivos y otros usuarios de Twitter compraron a sus seguidores directamente, de acuerdo con registros. En otros casos, la compra fue hecha por agentes, familiares, empleados y otros asociados.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBeliusHillary Rosen, consultora en relaciones p\u00fablicas y colaboradora de CNN, compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s de medio mill\u00f3n de seguidores falsos a Devumi en dos a\u00f1os. En una entrevista, dijo que esas compras fueron hechas \u201ccomo experimento\u201d para ver \u201cc\u00f3mo funcionaba\u201d. Hizo m\u00e1s de una decena de adquisiciones entre 2015 y 2017, de acuerdo con los registros de Devumi.Otros clientes dijeron que se hab\u00edan sentido presionados por sus empleadores para tener m\u00e1s seguidores. Marcus Holmlund era el encargado de redes sociales de la agencia de modelaje Wilhemina. Poco despu\u00e9s de haber llegado al puesto, un supervisor le dijo que no estaba consiguiendo suficientes seguidores y que deb\u00eda o comprarlos o encontrar otro empleo. Holmlund termin\u00f3 pagando \u00e9l mismo por las cuentas a Devumi antes de dejar la empresa en 2015 (una portavoz de Wilhemina se neg\u00f3 a hacer comentarios).\u201cMe sent\u00ed pasmado por la amenaza de ser despedido o, lo que es peor, nunca poder volver a trabajar en la industria de la moda\u201d, dijo Holmlund. \u201cDesde entonces le digo a quienes me preguntan que es un enga\u00f1o\u201d.Varios clientes de Devumi reconocieron que hab\u00edan comprado bots porque sus carreras depend\u00edan, en parte, de aparentar tener influencia en redes sociales. \u201cNadie te toma en serio si no tienes una presencia notoria\u201d, dijo Jason Schenker, economista que se especializa en pron\u00f3sticos econ\u00f3micos y que ha comprado unos 260.000 seguidores.M\u00e1s de cien personas que se describen a s\u00ed mismas como influenciadores \u2013cuya val\u00eda en t\u00e9rminos monetarios est\u00e1 aun m\u00e1s vinculada a la cantidad de seguidores\u2013 han comprado las cuentas falsas de Devumi. Justin Blau, un popular DJ cuyo nombre art\u00edstico es 3LAU, adquiri\u00f3 50.000 seguidores y miles de retuits. En un correo electr\u00f3nico, Blau dijo que un exmiembro de su equipo de administraci\u00f3n los compr\u00f3 sin su aprobaci\u00f3n.Las cuentas de los hermanos, seg\u00fan los registros de Devumi, son potenciadas por miles de retuits que compr\u00f3 su madre y m\u00e1nager, Shadia Daho. (Quien no respondi\u00f3 a varios intentos de contactarla por correo y v\u00eda una empresa de relaciones p\u00fablicas).Al principio, Pallen neg\u00f3 haber adquirido esos seguidores. Despu\u00e9s de que el Times contact\u00f3 a Greiner, Pallen afirm\u00f3 que hab\u00eda \u201cexperimentado\u201d con la empresa pero que \u201cdej\u00f3 de hacerlo hace mucho tiempo\u201d. Un abogado de Greiner dijo que ella le pidi\u00f3 que dejara de hacerlo cuando se enter\u00f3 de las primeras compras. Sin embargo, los registros muestran que Pallen le compr\u00f3 m\u00e1s seguidores a Greiner en 2016.Los consultores de mercadotecnia tambi\u00e9n compran a seguidores para s\u00ed mismos, como si compraran la evidencia para respaldar su supuesta pericia. En el 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, exprofesor de la Universidad de California del Sur que se autodenomina \u201cla autoridad l\u00edder del mundo en marcas de celebridades\u201d, comenz\u00f3 a comprar cientos de miles de seguidores falsos a Devumi.La Rychly falsa tambi\u00e9n retuite\u00f3 por lo menos cinco cuentas vinculadas al porn\u00f3grafo estadounidense Dan Leal, quien vive en Hungr\u00eda y usa la cuenta @PornoDan. Leal ha comprado unos 150.000 seguidores a Devumi en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y es uno de al menos doce clientes de esa empresa que son parte de la industria del entretenimiento adulto.En un correo, Leal dijo que la compra de seguidores para su negocio le ha generado m\u00e1s que suficientes ganancias para compensar el gasto. A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que no le preocupa ser penalizado por Twitter. \u201cUn sinf\u00edn de figuras p\u00fablicas, empresas, bandas musicales, etc., compran seguidores\u201d, escribi\u00f3. \u201cSi Twitter tuviera que sacar a todos los que lo hacen no quedar\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente ninguno de ellos\u201d.Devumi ha vendido decenas de miles de bots de alta calidad que son similares, de acuerdo con un an\u00e1lisis del Times. En algunos casos un solo usuario real de Twitter fue transformado en cientos de diferentes bots; cada uno una variante con cambios m\u00ednimos respecto al original.Por Richard Harris y Mark HansenLas cuentas falsas utilizaron identidades sociales de usuarios de Twitter registrados en los cincuenta estados que componen Estados Unidos y en decenas de pa\u00edses que eran tanto adultos como menores de edad; replicaron la informaci\u00f3n de usuarios muy activos y de quienes no hab\u00edan iniciado sesi\u00f3n en meses o hasta en a\u00f1os.Esta no tuvo actividad sino hasta el a\u00f1o pasado, cuando comenz\u00f3 a retuitear de manera continua a clientes de Devumi.\u201cNo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 replicaron mi identidad; soy un estudiante universitario de 20 a\u00f1os\u201d, dijo Dodd. \u201cNo soy alguien conocido\u201d. Pero incluso as\u00ed la identidad social de Dodd tiene valor en la econom\u00eda de la influencia. De acuerdo con los precios publicados en diciembre, Duvemi vend\u00eda a seguidores de alta calidad por menos de dos centavos. Si la identidad social de Dodd es vendida a unos dos mil clientes \u2013el n\u00famero promedio que siguen las cuentas bots de Devumi\u2013 esta empresa se har\u00eda con unos 30 d\u00f3lares.Esas identidades sociales robadas son claves para la marca Devumi. Los bots de alta calidad son los que usualmente llegan primero a los clientes, seguidos por unos de baja calidad; como si entregaran queso parmesano rallado junto con aserr\u00edn.Algunos de los bots de alta calidad de Devumi de hecho remplazan a una cuenta inactiva \u2013alguien que dej\u00f3 de usar el servicio\u2013 con una falsa. Whitney Wolfe, asistente ejecutiva que vive en Florida, abri\u00f3 una cuenta de Twitter en 2008, cuando ayudaba en la planeaci\u00f3n de bodas. Para cuando dej\u00f3 de usarla en 2014 ya hab\u00eda sido creada una cuenta falsa con su informaci\u00f3n personal, que ha retuiteado las publicaciones de actrices de la industria pornogr\u00e1fica y a varios influenciadores.\u201cEse contenido \u2013de mujeres en tanga y fotograf\u00edas de los pechos de mujeres\u2013 no es para nada lo que quiero que se asocie a mi fe, a mi nombre o a donde vivo\u201d, dijo Wolfe, quien es parte de una congregaci\u00f3n baptista.Otras v\u00edctimas segu\u00edan siendo activas en Twitter cuando los bots de Devumi empezaron a suplantar su identidad. Salle Ingle, ingeniera de 40 a\u00f1os que vive en Colorado, dijo que le preocupaba que un posible empleador se topara con la versi\u00f3n falsa si revisaba su actividad en redes sociales como parte del proceso de contrataci\u00f3n. Cuando el Times le avis\u00f3 sobre la cuenta, ella contact\u00f3 a Twitter y logr\u00f3 que fuera desactivada.Despu\u00e9s de enviarle el correo a Calas el a\u00f1o pasado, un reportero del Times visit\u00f3 la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan que lista el sitio web de Devumi. En el edificio rentan decenas de oficinas, pero Devumi y su empresa matriz, Bytion, no parecen estar entre los arrendatarios. Un portavoz del due\u00f1o del edificio dijo que ni Devumi ni Bytion han rentado espacios ah\u00ed.Como los seguidores que vende, la oficina de Devumi es una ilusi\u00f3n.En la vida real, Devumi tiene su sede en un edificio de oficinas arriba de un restaurante de comida mexicana en West Palm Beach, Florida, y frente a un callej\u00f3n repleto de basureros. Calas vive cerca en un penthouse.Calas, quien tiene 27 a\u00f1os, creci\u00f3 en el sur de Florida. Cuando era adolescente aprendi\u00f3 dise\u00f1o web y construy\u00f3 los sitios de varias compa\u00f1\u00edas locales, de acuerdo con versiones anteriores de su p\u00e1gina web personal que est\u00e1n guardadas en el Internet Archive.Con el tiempo se autoense\u00f1\u00f3 t\u00e9cnicas de optimizaci\u00f3n de b\u00fasquedas: el arte de lograr que una p\u00e1gina web termine m\u00e1s arriba al usar Google u otro motor de b\u00fasqueda. En el colegio comenz\u00f3 a tomar clases en la universidad Palm Beach State, donde consigui\u00f3 un t\u00edtulo t\u00e9cnico en 2012, seg\u00fan una portavoz de la escuela. Pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Calas afirmaba haber construido decenas de empresas web con m\u00e1s de diez millones de clientes como parte de Bytion.\u201cInici\u00e9 esta compa\u00f1\u00eda con mil d\u00f3lares en el banco, sin inversores, y solo con una ardiente pasi\u00f3n por el \u00e9xito\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Calas en el sitio de listados laborales Glassdoor.Buena parte del personal de atenci\u00f3n al cliente de Devumi est\u00e1 basado en Filipinas, lo que quiz\u00e1 le haya ayudado a Calas a reducir costos, pero tambi\u00e9n lo expuso a \u00e9l mismo ser v\u00edctima del robo de su identidad social.Calas acus\u00f3 que Boado us\u00f3 un nombre muy similar, DevumiBoost, y el mismo dise\u00f1o del sitio web, con todo y la direcci\u00f3n en Manhattan. Durante julio pasado, Boado \u2013haci\u00e9ndose pasar por un empleado de Devumi\u2013 le escribi\u00f3 a cientos de clientes de esta empresa para decirles que sus \u00f3rdenes iban a ser procesadas por DevumiBoost. Luego tambi\u00e9n se hizo pasar por los clientes enviando correos a Devumi con diversos alias para pedir cancelar \u00f3rdenes. (Boado no respondi\u00f3 a correos solicit\u00e1ndole respuesta a las acusaciones de Calas).La demanda de Calas tambi\u00e9n revel\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s: parece que Devumi no hace sus propios bots. En cambio, los compra al mayoreo como parte de un mercado global de cuentas falsas en redes sociales.Esparcidos por todo el internet hay diversos sitios web con los que fabricantes an\u00f3nimos de bots se conectan con minoristas como Devumi. Mientras que los clientes individuales llegan a comprar directo de estos sitios \u2013Peakerr, CheapPanel o YTbot, entre otros\u2013 son menos amigables para un usuario directo. Algunas, por ejemplo, no aceptan pagos con tarjeta, solo Bitcoin.Cada sitio vende seguidores, me gusta y compartir al por mayor para diversas redes sociales en diferentes idiomas. Las cuentas que venden llegan a cambiar de manos en varias ocasiones y a ser comercializadas por m\u00e1s de un vendedor.Devumi, seg\u00fan un exempleado, utilizaba bots de diferentes fabricantes seg\u00fan el precio, la calidad y la confiabilidad. En Peakerr, por ejemplo, mil bots en ingl\u00e9s de alta calidad con fotograf\u00edas de perfil cuestan poco m\u00e1s de un d\u00f3lar. Devumi cobra 17 d\u00f3lares por la misma cantidad.Ese margen de ganancia le ha permitido a Calas construir una peque\u00f1a fortuna, de acuerdo con los registros de la empresa. En tan solo unos a\u00f1os, Devumi vendi\u00f3 alrededor de 200 millones de seguidores de Twitter a por lo menos 39.000 clientes, lo que representa un tercio o m\u00e1s de los 6 millones de d\u00f3lares en ventas durante ese periodo.En diciembre, Calas pidi\u00f3 que el Times le diera ejemplos de bots que hab\u00edan copiado informaci\u00f3n de usuarios reales. Despu\u00e9s de recibir los nombres de diez cuentas, Calas, quien hab\u00eda aceptado dar una entrevista, pidi\u00f3 m\u00e1s tiempo para analizarlas y despu\u00e9s dej\u00f3 de responder a los correos.Binns, la portavoz de Twitter, dijo que la empresa no revisa de manera proactiva las cuentas para ver si son suplantaci\u00f3n de otros usuarios. En vez, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, los esfuerzos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda se enfocan en identificar y suspender cuentas que violan las pol\u00edticas de correo basura de Twitter. Binns dijo que en diciembre, por ejemplo, la compa\u00f1\u00eda identific\u00f3 en promedio unas 6,4 millones de cuentas sospechosas por semana.Leslie Miley, ingeniera que trabaj\u00f3 en la unidad de seguridad de la empresa y de sus usuarios hasta finales de 2015, dijo: \u201cTwitter, como red social, fue desarrollada pr\u00e1cticamente sin prever rendici\u00f3n de cuentas\u201d.Algunos cr\u00edticos creen que hay un incentivo de negocios para Twitter en contra de reprimir m\u00e1s agresivamente a los bots. Durante los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, la empresa ha batallado para generar el crecimiento de usuarios que han tenido rivales como Facebook o Snapchat e investigadores externos han puesto en tela de duda los estimados de la compa\u00f1\u00eda sobre cu\u00e1ntos de sus usuarios activos son en realidad bots.Por Richard Harris y Danny DeBelius\u201cTrabajamos con ecosistemas no regulados y cerrados por completo que no reportan estas cosas. Tienen un incentivo perverso para dejar que pase esto\u201d, dijo Essaid, el experto en ciberseguridad. \u201cQuieren controlar esto hasta el punto en el que no sea tan obvio que existe pero que [Twitter] siga sacando dinero de ello\u201d.En enero, despu\u00e9s de unos dos a\u00f1os de promover cientos de cuentas de clientes de Devumi, la Jessica Rychly falsa por fin fue identificada por los algoritmos de seguridad de Twitter y la cuenta fue suspendida.Sin embargo, la verdadera Rychly ya planea salirse para siempre de esa red social.\u201cProbablemente voy a borrar mi cuenta de Twitter\u201d, dijo.Contribuyeron al reportaje Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa y Felipe Villamor.

{"Headline": "Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisruptionsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 I\u2019ve gone gray, and it\u2019s great.In an effort to break my smartphone addiction, I\u2019ve joined a small group of people turning their phone screens to grayscale \u2014 cutting out the colors and going with a range of shades from white to black. First popularized by the tech ethicist Tristan Harris, the goal of sticking to shades of gray is to make the glittering screen a little less stimulating.I\u2019ve been gray for a couple days, and it\u2019s remarkable how well it has eased my twitchy phone checking, suggesting that one way to break phone attachment may be to, essentially, make my phone a little worse. We\u2019re simple animals, excited by bright colors, it turns out.Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google know this, and they have increasingly been turning to the field of applied neuroscience to see how exactly brains respond to color in the apps, what brings pleasure and what keeps the eye. New research shows how important color is to our understanding of priorities and emotion.Mack McKelvey, the chief executive of the marketing firm SalientMG in Washington, D.C., said she\u2019s aware of the tricks phones use to keep you on them longer \u2014 and coming back sooner.\u201cYou don\u2019t buy black-and-white cereal boxes, you buy the really stimulating colored one, and these apps have developed really cool tiles, cool shapes, cool colors, all designed to stimulate you,\u201d Ms. McKelvey said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a vibrant world out there, and my phone shouldn\u2019t be it.\u201dShe decided to make the switch to gray as well. But it was trickier than she expected.One person Facebook and others turn to is Thomas Z. Ramsoy, the chief executive of Neurons, a four-year-old company based in Copenhagen. His business uses brain scans and eye tracking technology to study apps, updates and future technology. The company often measures the electrical activity of the brain while a consumer is interacting with a phone, such as texting and scrolling Facebook.\u201cColor and shape, these are the icebreakers when it comes to grabbing people\u2019s attention, and attention is the new currency,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an interface that grabs people\u2019s attention without disturbing them in the wrong way, without consciously intruding in their space, that\u2019s the fine line.\u201dWhat going grayscale does, Mr. Ramsoy said, is reintroduce choice.Companies use colors to encourage subconscious decisions, Mr. Ramsoy said. (So that, for example, I may want to open email, but I\u2019ll end up on Instagram, having seen its colorful button.) Making the phone gray eliminates that manipulation. Mr. Ramsoy said it reintroduces \u201ccontrolled attention.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to take away the sound as well.\u201dOne way Silicon Valley could help ease phone addiction is by using a more thoughtful color palette, said Bevil Conway, an investigator at the National Eye Institute, who researches color and emotion.\u201cColor\u2019s not a signal for detecting objects, it\u2019s actually something much more fundamental: It\u2019s for telling us what\u2019s likely to be important,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cIf you have lots of color and contrast then you\u2019re under a constant state of attentional recruitment. Your attentional system is constantly going, \u2018Look look look over here.\u2019 \u201dThe same way people think about a color scheme when they\u2019re planning the living room d\u00e9cor, Mr. Conway said, they should think about color when it comes to their phone\u2019s home screen too.\u201cIf you had a color palette, you would end up with a phone that looked pleasant and was not addictively rewarding, that had some intentionality, but of course nobody wants you to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause what they want is for you to look.\u201dSilicon Valley is in a battle for our attention, and often I feel like the last person in charge of my own eyes. After going to grayscale, I\u2019m not a different person all of a sudden, but I feel more in control of my phone, which now looks like a tool rather than a toy. If I unlock it to write an email, I\u2019m a little less likely to forget the goal and tap on Instagram. If I\u2019m waiting in line for coffee, this gray slab is not as delightful a distraction as it once was.The switch made me realize, in a tangible way, that I still have a little choice here.Advertisement"}

Sexual misconduct in the workplace can take a devastating human toll. Moreover, the issue implicates gender equality and gender diversity concerns more broadly, and boards that include a meaningful proportion of female directors should be better positioned to address sexual harassment and gender equality issues.Among the best ways to better address the issue at a company: having more women on corporate boards and in senior management positions.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIf the rally persists, then the four biggest companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index could all soon be flirting with the $1 trillion mark.Bad enough that the embattled industrial giant had to announce that GE Capital would suspend dividends to the group, after a $6.2 billion charge tied to its reinsurance operations.Critics\u2019 cornerPoint 72 is on the verge of managing outside money and operating as a true hedge fund again.

Florida has already applied for a waiver from such drilling. More supply could lower prices, in turn discouraging investments in renewables such as solar and wind.

{"Headline": "Tech Backlash Grows as Investors Press Apple to Act on Children\u2019s Use", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA creator of the iPhone called the device \u201caddictive.\u201dA Twitter founder said the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201dAn early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network\u2019s impact on children\u2019s brains.Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children\u2019s use of iPhones and iPads.Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction.But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives.Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California\u2019s public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business.\u201cWe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,\u201d the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image.Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children\u2019s preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports.\u201cOver the past 10 years, there\u2019s been a bottom-up backlash,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d \u201cYou see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down.\u201d\u201cThese things can be incredibly addictive,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.\u201dA growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune.\u201cThe short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,\u201d he said. \u201cNo civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.\u201dBy going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company\u2019s stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users\u2019 time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products.\u201cApple\u2019s business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,\u201d Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company.For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, \u201cit turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act.\u201dIn a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices \u201clead the industry\u201d and that \u201cwe think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them.\u201d\u201cWe take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\u201dBut some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive.Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about \u201chow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, \u201cin the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.\u201dMr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, \u201cwe had no idea this was going to happen.\u201d But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones.\u201cNow it needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years in the making.\u201dEven Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company\u2019s influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Report on the Las Vegas Gunman Was Released. Here Are Some Takeaways.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Las Vegas police took the unusual step on Friday of releasing key details about the continuing investigation into the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others.Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news conference that while he was confident that Stephen Paddock was the only gunman, there was another person under investigation who is likely to be charged in the next two months. No charges will be filed against Mr. Paddock\u2019s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, Sheriff Lombardo said. He also said there was still no motive known for the attack.Investigators have uncovered extensive details about the internet search history on Mr. Paddock\u2019s computer, including child pornography, guidance on ballistics and information about SWAT team practices. Law enforcement officials believe Mr. Paddock had recently lost a \u201csignificant amount of wealth,\u201d and that may have led him to open fire from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.It was the first time Sheriff Lombardo had spoken publicly about the case in more than two months. He said investigators had reviewed more than 2,000 leads and 21,000 hours of video.\u201cI am going against normal protocols,\u201d Sheriff Lombardo said, adding that he hoped the preliminary report would \u201cquell the zest for information.\u201dThe report offers extensive details about Mr. Paddock\u2019s actions and planning in the time leading up to the attack. Here are some of the key takeaways:\u2022 Mr. Paddock \u201clived a seemingly normal life,\u201d the investigators wrote, based on numerous interviews with relatives and acquaintances. He began traveling internationally \u2014 usually alone \u2014 in 2012, going to Europe, Asia and South America, and he took cruises to the Bahamas, Mexico and Alaska.The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on Friday released its preliminary report into the killing of 58 people by a gunman opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October.\u2022 Mr. Paddock complained often to friends and family members about pain and fatigue. But the doctor who had been his primary care physician since 2009 said that the only major ailment he had was from a slip and fall at a casino in 2013, when he tore a muscle. The doctor told investigators that Mr. Paddock was \u201codd\u201d and showed \u201clittle emotion.\u201d While he believed Mr. Paddock may have had bipolar disorder, Mr. Paddock refused to discuss it or take antidepressants, though he did accept anti-anxiety medication. Mr. Paddock often refused to take medication, he said.\u2022 Over more than three decades \u2014 from 1982 through the fall of 2016 \u2014 Mr. Paddock bought 29 firearms, including handguns, shotguns and one rifle. Such purchases accelerated beginning in October 2016: He bought more than 55 firearms in less than a year, mostly rifles. He also bought more than 100 firearm-related items such as scopes, ammunition and bump stocks in the year before the attack.\u2022 Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock\u2019s demeanor changed during the last year \u2014 he became \u201cdistant\u201d and \u201ctheir relationship was no longer intimate.\u201d He became \u201cgermaphobic\u201d and had strong reactions to smells. During a stay at the Mandalay Bay in early September, Ms. Danley said he had behaved strangely, and constantly looked out the windows of the room and at the concert venue below from different angles.\u2022 Mr. Paddock appeared to begin thinking about a mass shooting last May, searching on Google for \u201csummer concerts 2017\u201d and \u201cbiggest open air concert venues in USA.\u201d In early September he searched for \u201cLas Vegas high rise condos rent\u201d and \u201clife is beautiful expected attendance,\u201d a reference to another large outdoor concert in Las Vegas that month. Two weeks later, he looked for \u201cswat weapons,\u201d \u201cballistics chart 308,\u201d \u201cSWAT Las Vegas,\u201d and \u201cdo police use explosives.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Paddock stayed in a room at the Ogden condominium complex on Sept. 17, during the Life is Beautiful music festival, requesting rooms that overlooked the downtown outdoor venue there. In video surveillance, Mr. Paddock could be seen taking several suitcases from his vehicle to his rooms. He was always alone and investigators so far \u201chave been unable to determine if Paddock intended an attack during this festival or if he used it as a means to plan a future attack,\u201d the report said.\u2022 On Sept. 25, Mr. Paddock checked into room 32-135 at the Mandalay Bay and checked into the room next door four days later, under Ms. Danley\u2019s name.\u2022 On his first night at the hotel, Mr. Paddock had dinner at a sushi restaurant inside the hotel and returned to the front desk with five suitcases. The next day, he took seven more suitcases up to his room with the bellman.\u2022 On Sept. 27, Mr. Paddock spent the entire night gambling, not stopping until 7 the next morning. The next day, he went to Mesquite and purchased a .308 bolt-action rifle, deposited $14,000 into a Wells Fargo account and transferred $50,000 to an account in the Philippines. He stopped at a gun range before going back to the hotel. He gambled through the night again. On Sept. 30, he brought four more suitcases to his room just before 6 a.m. and two additional one at 3:20 p.m.\u2022 On Oct 1., at about 10 p.m., a hotel security guard named Jesus Campos arrived on the 32nd floor to respond to an alarm set off by an open door to another room. He was shot a few minutes later, just after Mr. Paddock opened fire on the crowd below.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Antivirus Software Can Be Turned Into a Tool for Spying", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been a secret, long known to intelligence agencies but rarely to consumers, that security software can be a powerful spy tool.Security software runs closest to the bare metal of a computer, with privileged access to nearly every program, application, web browser, email and file. There\u2019s good reason for this: Security products are intended to evaluate everything that touches your machine in search of anything malicious, or even vaguely suspicious.By downloading security software, consumers also run the risk that an untrustworthy antivirus maker \u2014 or hacker or spy with a foothold in its systems \u2014 could abuse that deep access to track customers\u2019 every digital movement.\u201cIn the battle against malicious code, antivirus products are a staple,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, chief research officer at Digita Security, a security company. \u201cIronically, though, these products share many characteristics with the advanced cyberespionage collection implants they seek to detect.\u201d\u201cI wanted to know if this was a feasible attack mechanism,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into the complex accusations. But from a technical point of view, if an antivirus maker wanted to, was coerced to, or was hacked or somehow subverted, could it create a signature to flag classified documents?\u201dThat question has taken on renewed importance over the last three months in the wake of United States officials\u2019 accusations that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software was used for Russian intelligence gathering, an accusation that Kaspersky has rigorously denied.Last month, Kaspersky Lab sued the Trump administration after a Department of Homeland Security directive banning its software from federal computer networks. Kaspersky claimed in an open letter that \u201cD.H.S. has harmed Kaspersky Lab\u2019s reputation and its commercial operations without any evidence of wrongdoing by the company.\u201dFor years, intelligence agencies suspected that Kaspersky Lab\u2019s security products provided a back door for Russian intelligence. A draft of a top-secret report leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, described a top-secret, N.S.A. effort in 2008 that concluded that Kaspersky\u2019s software collected sensitive information off customers\u2019 machines.The documents showed Kaspersky was not the N.S.A.\u2019s only target. Future targets included nearly two dozen other foreign antivirus makers, including Checkpoint in Israel and Avast in the Czech Republic.At the N.S.A., analysts were barred from using Kaspersky antivirus software because of the risk it would give the Kremlin broad access to their machines and data. But excluding N.S.A. headquarters at Fort Meade, Kaspersky still managed to secure contracts with nearly two dozen American government agencies over the last few years.Last September, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal agencies to cease using Kaspersky products because of the threat that Kaspersky\u2019s products could \u201cprovide access to files.\u201dKaspersky Lab initially denied any knowledge or involvement with the document theft. But the company has since acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on Mr. Pho\u2019s computer and removing it, though the company said it had immediately destroyed the documents once it realized they were classified.Kaspersky continues to deny that it knew about the scanning for classified United States programs or allowed its antivirus products to be used by Russian intelligence. Eugene Kaspersky, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said he would allow the United States government to inspect his company\u2019s source code to allay distrust of its antivirus and cybersecurity products.Mr. Wardle found that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software is incredibly complex. Unlike traditional antivirus software, which uses digital \u201csignatures\u201d to look for malicious code and patterns of activity, Kaspersky\u2019s signatures are easily updated, can be automatically pushed out to certain clients, and contain code that can be tweaked to do things like automatically scanning for and siphoning off classified documents.In short, Mr. Wardle found, \u201cantivirus could be the ultimate cyberespionage spying tool.\u201dMr. Wardle said it was relatively easy to use a vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Windows software to manipulate the Kaspersky software. Because officials routinely classify top secret documents with the marking \u201cTS/SCI,\u201d which stands for \u201cTop Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,\u201d Mr. Wardle added a rule to Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus program to flag any documents that contained the \u201cTS/SCI\u201d marker.He then edited a document on his computer containing text from the Winnie the Pooh children\u2019s book series to include the marking \u201cTS/SCI\u201d and waited to see whether Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus product would catch it.Sure enough, as soon as the Winnie the Pooh text was saved to his machine, Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software flagged and quarantined the document. When he added the same TS/SCI marker to another document containing the text \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\u201d it, too, was flagged and quarantined by Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus program.\u201cNot a whole lot of surprise that this worked,\u201d Mr. Wardle said, \u201cbut still neat to confirm that an antivirus product can be trivially, yet surreptitiously, used to detect classified documents.\u201dThe next question was: What happens to these files once they are flagged? Mr. Wardle stopped short of hacking into Kaspersky\u2019s cloud servers, where suspicious files are routinely uploaded.However, he noted that antivirus customers, including Kaspersky\u2019s, agreed by default to allow security vendors to send anything from their machine back to vendors\u2019 servers for further investigation.There are legitimate reasons for this: By uploading these items to Kaspersky\u2019s cloud, security analysts can evaluate whether they pose a threat, and update their signatures as a result.Kaspersky Lab said Mr. Wardle\u2019s research did not reflect how the company\u2019s software works.\u201cIt is impossible for Kaspersky Lab to deliver a specific signature or update to only one user in a secret, targeted way because all signatures are always openly available to all our users; and updates are digitally signed, further making it impossible to fake an update,\u201d the company said in a statement.The company added that it applied the same security standards and maintained the same levels of access as other security vendors, and reiterated that it was willing to make its source code, threat detection rules and software updates available for audit by independent experts.\u201cAnd no one would ever know,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect cybercrime.\u201dFollow Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @nicoleperlrothAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Amazon and Friends Handle Health Care? There\u2019s Reason for Doubt", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while the three companies bring successful management, technological expertise and substantial capital to the venture, many health industry experts expressed doubts about whether their results would match their ambition.Here are a few reasons that experts suggest we temper expectations.Over the years, faced with rising costs, employers have banded together to try novel approaches to health insurance benefits. Some have pioneered strategies like working directly with health systems or have achieved significant savings compared with competitors. But none have made a major dent in overall health care spending.\u201cThey contribute in the small wins,\u201d said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut those tend to be swamped by growth in health care, which is so high. They\u2019re not silver bullets.\u201dHealth care is very local, and companies have traditionally had a hard time preventing hospitals and doctors from raising prices or delivering mediocre care, because they don\u2019t have enough leverage to force health care providers to do things differently.\u201cThe part that is the most difficult is trying to influence the underlying system,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employer groups. \u201cAny single company, even broad coalitions, have a hard time.\u201dTechnology giants have attempted health care innovation before. Google and Microsoft started health ventures in recent years to a lot of fanfare, with little success.The three companies don\u2019t have much direct experience in providing health insurance or services. Chase has invested in the industry, and Berkshire Hathaway has owned insurance companies, but none have worked extensively in health benefits or in managing doctors, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies.\u201cJust because you know an industry is underperforming and you have a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean you have a successful strategy,\u201d said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, in an email. Ms. Dafny said she was excited to see such serious players take on this problem, but noted there were numerous examples of outsiders trying, and failing, to succeed in the health care system.Most disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That\u2019s the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don\u2019t usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper.Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called \u201clow-value services\u201d \u2014 health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options.But reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good value. Highly compensated employees, like those at Chase or at Amazon headquarters, may be particularly attracted to cutting-edge cancer treatments or the latest prescription drugs, he noted. A health plan that cut out such services might hurt the ability to recruit and retain workers needed to succeed in other parts of the business.\u201cIf there was pure inefficiency, I think it would be a lot easier to make progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that all of this stuff has some small benefit.\u201dThere are some ways that a smart company might seek to wring real inefficiencies out of health care. It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost.The three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services company, based in New York, with highly compensated employees. Berkshire Hathaway is a consortium of companies, spread throughout the country, in a variety of industries. And Amazon is a technology company with a hub of highly paid workers in Seattle, and with lower-wage workers spread in warehouses around the country. Will they all want or need the same sort of health plan?In general, companies with a lot of highly paid workers tend to offer generous benefits. Health insurance is not taxed in the same way as other forms of compensation, so an investment banker may prefer a health plan that covers everything instead of one with a big deductible that she has to pay out of her post-tax salary. A lower-wage worker in an Amazon warehouse, by contrast, may want a skimpier health plan and more wages.But savings on health care would accrue directly to the companies\u2019 bottom lines, allowing them to hire more workers or increase their profits relative to their competitors. That means selling such services to their competitors would need to be profitable enough to make up for giving competitors that business edge.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to transform the economy unless they then share all of those ideas and best practices with their competitors,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist who teaches corporate strategy at the Kellogg School at Northwestern. \u201cThat would not be good for long-term shareholder value for their firms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surveillance and Privacy Debate Reaches Pivotal Moment in Congress", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A yearslong debate over National Security Agency surveillance and protections for Americans\u2019 privacy rights will reach a climactic moment on Thursday as the House of Representatives takes up legislation to extend a program of warrantless spying on internet and phone networks that traces back to the Sept. 11 attacks.There is little doubt that Congress will extend an expiring statute, known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, that permits the government to collect without a warrant from American firms, like Google and AT&T, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad \u2014 even when they are talking to Americans.But it is far from clear whether Congress will impose significant new safeguards for Americans\u2019 privacy. A bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers are trying to impose such changes, while the Trump administration, the intelligence community and House Republican leadership oppose them.Thursday\u2019s vote is seen as the crucial test because more would-be reformers are in the House than in the Senate, which will take up the legislation later. If majority support for imposing new privacy protections on the program does not exist in the House, the Senate is unlikely to add them in.\u201cThe chances are better in the House,\u201d acknowledged Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, at a news conference on Wednesday of House and Senate lawmakers who support surveillance overhaul efforts. \u201cThe privacy movement is stronger in the House than the Senate. Maybe we can learn from you guys.\u201dThe N.S.A. began collecting Americans\u2019 international phone calls and emails without a warrant in October 2001 as part of the Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 Stellarwind program. In 2008, after the program had come to light, Congress legalized a form of it by enacting Section 702 of the FISA law. That law enabled the program to expand to Silicon Valley firms, not just telecoms, and to all foreign intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism.In late 2012, Congress extended the law for five years without changes. But the pending expiration of Section 702 is forcing lawmakers to address its substance for the first time since the 2013 leaks about N.S.A. programs by Edward J. Snowden set off a major debate about 21st-century surveillance technology and privacy rights.Chief among them, the amendment would ban the practice whereby officials at the N.S.A., the F.B.I. and other security agencies, without a warrant, search for and read private messages of Americans that the government incidentally swept up under the 702 program. Instead, except in emergencies, officials would need to obtain a court order to query the repository for an American\u2019s information.The amendment is chiefly sponsored by Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, and Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. It would substitute in the text of another bill, dubbed the USA Rights Act, which would extend Section 702 by only four years.The bipartisan coalition backing overhaul efforts \u2014 which includes some of the most conservative and most liberal members of the House \u2014 say that change is necessary to uphold the meaning and substance of Fourth Amendment privacy rights in light of 21st-century communications technology and surveillance powers.But the F.B.I. and the intelligence community have balked at that proposal, saying it would impede their efforts to protect the country to require warrants to query information the government already possesses. There are also lawmakers of both parties \u2014 backed by House leadership \u2014 who oppose the amendment.Complicating matters, the base bill backed by Mr. Nunes contains a gesture toward a court-order requirement, too. It would apply only under narrow circumstances: if F.B.I. agents have already opened a criminal investigation into the American whose information they are searching for, and if the agents have no national-security rationale.Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the warrant requirement in the base bill would be sufficient to \u201cprevent the database from being used as a general tool to gather evidence and introduce it in court in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism.\u201dBut the base bill would still permit routine queries for Americans\u2019 information without warrants. Its warrant requirement would not apply to national-security-related queries by a range of agencies, including the C.I.A., the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. Nor would it apply to F.B.I. queries when agents are merely pursuing tips about an American but do not yet have enough evidence of wrongdoing to open a criminal investigation.In short, the base bill would give greater privacy protections to criminal suspects than to people the F.B.I. has no solid basis for thinking had committed any wrongdoing.Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, dismissed the base bill\u2019s limited warrant provision on Wednesday as \u201cfake reform\u201d that was really just \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201dSuch collection is technically complex, and the N.S.A. shut it down after repeatedly running into trouble adhering to limits imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But the agency wants to retain the flexibility to turn it back on. The base bill would permit it to do so after briefing the congressional intelligence committees. The amendment would ban the practice.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

How\u2019s your share price doing? If you have a problem with it, let\u2019s have a show of hands. No hands. Thought so.That\u2019s why I took the United States out of that terrible Paris deal. Rex Tillerson, who\u2019s doing a terrific job as secretary of state, he said, \u201cMr. President, you just can\u2019t pull out like that! What about our allies?\u201d O.K., maybe Rex isn\u2019t doing such a terrific job, we\u2019ll see about Rex.Anyway, I know you all have your climate plans and corporate social responsibility B.S., but none of you believes a word of it. The difference between us is that you keep quiet so that you\u2019ll look good at Davos, but I don\u2019t. I say all the stuff you\u2019re too afraid to say. I say the truth, and people love me.I also say that Haiti is a, well, not such a nice place. Let\u2019s have another show of hands if you plan to move your wife and kids to Haiti anytime soon. I didn\u2019t think so. Wonderful, hard-working people, by the way, the Haitians. Many of them work at my properties in Florida as groundskeepers, maids, that kind of stuff. Ask them, they love me too.So what am I doing here? I read the papers \u2014 believe me, I read, I\u2019m, like, the best reader, you know I went to Wharton? \u2014 and I know this is all supposed to be about how you\u2019re all Davos Men and I\u2019m Mr. America First, and it\u2019s, you know, never the twain shall meet.Whatever. We\u2019re businessmen. We think the same way. You want to turn a profit and beat the competition. You don\u2019t want to get crushed. And you\u2019ll do what you need to do and say what you need to say to win.That\u2019s the way the world is, folks. You think China doesn\u2019t know this? You think Russia \u2014 and you know this Russia story, collusion, there was no collusion, none \u2014 doesn\u2019t know? Why do you think they keep winning? China is getting bigger, stronger, while Europe just gets smaller and weaker. Angela Merkel, sorry, but she\u2019s a total joke. Lets in a million Muslims, illegals, terrorists probably, in one year, and the German people don\u2019t like it at all. Remember, a year ago, how it was like, \u201cMerkel is the real leader of the free world\u201d? Now she barely leads her own government.She should have built a wall. Not smart!You have got to be kidding me. Have any of you here had your trade secrets stolen by China? Any of you think the Chinese play fair? You like human rights in China, pollution in China? Do some of you want to live in a world run by Xi? Because, be my guest.But if you don\u2019t, then things have to change. It can\u2019t be, we\u2019ll play by all the rules, like a bunch of little girls, and China gets to cheat, and pretend that that\u2019s O.K. Because, believe me, cheaters always win. Nobody knows this better than me.So that has got to stop. That\u2019s my message to you people. Do you want America first or China first? I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s your choice. But if it\u2019s America first you want, then you\u2019re going to stop playing us for suckers.We aren\u2019t going to pay your bills while you take our jobs. We aren\u2019t going to fight your battles if you aren\u2019t going to buy our products. We aren\u2019t going to let you get rich off of us, if we can\u2019t get richer off of you. We\u2019re stronger than you and we\u2019re going to stay that way. We can leave the surrender stuff to our European friends. Got it?You want America to be nice, we can be very nice, I\u2019m very nice, isn\u2019t that right, Klaus? But, we\u2019re not stupid, believe me.Enjoy your snow day, people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stampede of Tech Giants Gives Rebalancing New Appeal", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou own a balanced portfolio that should perform well in all sorts of market conditions.But do you really?If you think you\u2019re protected from market swings by holding index-based investments, think again.Over all, large growth stocks soared 25.4 percent in 2017. Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: \u201cIf you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you\u2019d want more value,\u201d he added.Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. \u201cThey\u2019re buying back shares,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. \u201cEvery sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly.\u201dSo-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. \u201cYou will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks,\u201d Mr. Brightman said.The market won\u2019t necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. \u201cIt just means over the longer term you would get lower returns,\u201d he said.Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.\u201cIf you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CES 2018: What the Gadget Fest Looks Like in \u2018the Year of A.I.\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn an initial walk-through, this year\u2019s CES electronics trade show was reminiscent of years past. Thousands of tech and gadget enthusiasts flooded the Las Vegas Convention Center for the four-day event, which began on Tuesday, to see the newest electronics that are being introduced on the market.Yet the clear darling of this year\u2019s show was not a gadget but the growing amount of artificial intelligence software helping these products run. The race between Amazon and Google to be the go-to service for integration of consumer products was on full display. In many booths, signs prominently advertised that products worked with Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. The smart home, car and TV all seemed to have been touched by Amazon or Google.\u201cIt\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.Zipping along the convention floor were robots yielding a host of skills. One robot, Loomo, top, doubles as a hoverboard and a companion that can take photos. Another robot, iPal, above, serves as companion to older and younger users. Designed by AvatarMind, the $1,500 humanoid robot can remind elders to take medicine or greet children at the door.Sony\u2019s new robot dog, Aibo, also stopped conventiongoers who took time to rub their hands on its hard-surface head.Google\u2019s presence was easily identifiable with activation centers, games and presenters walking around the convention floor, but Amazon dominated the arena by the sheer volume of products that worked with the Alexa voice assistant, like robovacuums, light dimmers and even mosquito zappers.This year\u2019s event featured more than 4,000 exhibitors, including 800 start-ups, and covered more than 2.6 million square feet.Home appliances like coffee makers, vacuums, ovens and even the cat litter box also received an A.I. upgrade. Samsung\u2019s smart refrigerator, which was on display, allows consumers to control other home devices with their voice and a large touch screen.The Mercedes-Benz User Experience, known as MBUX, one of many vehicle systems showcasing connected car technology, was a crowd favorite. The in-vehicle system includes a touch screen and understands voice commands.On Wednesday, the power went out for a large portion of the convention center for more than an hour. Many attendees mocked the irony of a giant electronics show lacking electricity.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the robots on display at the CES trade show. It is Loomo, which doubles as a hoverboard and a companion that can take photos, not Nimbo, a different robot that works as an intelligent security system that can be programmed to patrol specific routes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roe v. Wade Was About More Than Abortion", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBecause we so often identify Roe with a woman\u2019s right to choose, we forget that the original decision attracted the ire of feminists who believed that the court had focused too little on women\u2019s interests in fertility control. The court held that the right to privacy was broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision, with her doctor, to terminate her pregnancy. The justices also reasoned that the government\u2019s interest in protecting fetal life did not become compelling until the point of viability.But why wield the court\u2019s decision as a weapon for social change? Most scholars agreed that Roe was a poorly reasoned opinion. What was the appeal for grass-roots activists?The answer is that Roe\u2019s definition of privacy seemed different. More than other Supreme Court decisions, it connected privacy to ideas about individual identity and choice. Whatever the flaws of the original decision, many hoped to use it to redefine who was thought to have autonomy and why.Conservatives as well as liberals invoked this newly articulated right to privacy. With the spread of computers, politicians like Barry Goldwater and his son, the former Republican representative Barry Goldwater Jr., pointed to Roe in demanding privacy protections for personal information.Champions of consumers\u2019 rights read the abortion decision as suggesting that patients could choose any course of treatment, including unproven alternative remedies. Those seeking a right to die used it in the fight for autonomy at the end of life.For more than a decade, Roe appealed to different groups exploring the untapped potential of the right to privacy. People on both the right and the left saw possible connections between privacy and individual interests in conscientious objection, self-determination and equal treatment.So how did one decision 45 years ago become synonymous with abortion and nothing else? In part, other privacy fights fizzled when the coalitions backing new rights collapsed. Feminists and libertarians clashed about the line between sexual coercion and sexual privacy. Those who hoped to expand data privacy disagreed about when the government had a good enough reason to collect personal data.Abortion foes and Republican politicians consciously tried to redefine Roe, equating the decision with abortion and judicial activism. Ronald Reagan had to assure social conservatives that he would pick federal judges who opposed abortion, but he also consistently promised to select nominees based on their accomplishments and judicial philosophy. Labeling Roe an activist decision helped Reagan and other Republicans strike this balance.Abortion opponents initially did not take much interest in arguments about judicial activism, seeing them as a distraction from the fight for an amendment that would ban all abortions. But by the 1980s, it was obvious that a fetal rights amendment would not pass soon. Delegitimizing Roe suddenly seemed an important step toward the movement\u2019s new goal of overruling the 1973 decision.On Roe\u2019s 45th anniversary, we should stop to think about where the right to privacy stands today. The picture does not seem very rosy. Since the new year, there have been fresh concerns about data breaches and the misuse of digital information by giants like Facebook and Google. Privacy and conscience have taken center stage as the Supreme Court considers whether a Christian baker can refuse to serve a same-sex couple. It is easy to believe that the right to privacy is ineffective, more likely to shore up a dissatisfying status quo.But part of Roe\u2019s legacy is the many ways conservatives and liberals once reimagined the right to privacy. Social movements hardly felt constrained by what the Supreme Court had written.Some pointed to privacy not just in asking for freedom from the government but also in demanding financial support from the state. Others asked not just to be left alone behind closed doors but also to get respect for relationships in public. People tried to use the right to privacy to transform attitudes about sexuality, death and the collection of digital data.Americans have rethought the right to privacy before. There is no reason we couldn\u2019t do it again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Retail Trade Show, Technology Is the Star", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retail industry is doubling down on digital to keep its unexpectedly strong holiday performance from becoming a fluke.The floor of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual trade show in New York this week was crowded with alert systems primed to recognize heavy-spending customers, so-called smart shelves fitted with real-time inventory trackers and robots for every step of the supply chain.It was a conference about shopping that looked more like an expo for tech, as if the electronics trade show CES had decamped from Las Vegas and moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.At the three-day event \u2014 which drew more than 600 exhibitors and featured sessions with top executives from Walmart, Best Buy, Neiman Marcus and other major companies \u2014 discussions of artificial intelligence, big data and automation filled stages and meeting booths modeled after fitting rooms.E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.Embracing technologies, and quickly, is crucial to survival as consumers grow more demanding, according to a panel of venture capital professionals.\u201cThe consumer expectation of a frictionless shopping experience is here,\u201d said Scott Friend, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures.Digitally native companies are emerging and growing faster. Catching up can be difficult for large legacy chains, which have struggled to project enough cool factor to recruit in-demand employees.\u201cTalent is a major challenge for a lot of these retailers,\u201d said Janie Yu, a partner at Fung Capital. \u201cIf you are a top-notch, A+ data scientist, you probably want to work at Bonobos or Facebook or Google or Jet.\u201dMr. Friend said that companies like Walmart had tried to make cultural shifts to attract innovative employees, or folded them in through acquisitions.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s some magic that start-ups have that big companies don\u2019t,\u201d he said.All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?\u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201dShoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.Consumers are in control, as retailers scramble to tailor products to their liking, design more elaborate shopping experiences to hold their interest and deliver purchases on increasingly short deadlines.Customer behavior is getting harder to pin down. The boundaries between generations are disappearing, as so-called millennial and generation Z shoppers influence the buying habits of baby boomers, panelists said.As companies compile more detailed dossiers on their clientele, stuffed with data collected online and in stores, retailers could someday fine-tune their marketing and scheduling to each consumer, the panelists said.\u201cWe can microsegment as thin as we want in the future,\u201d Ms. Haziot said. \u201cEach individual is a segment in itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Leaked a Photo of Rick Perry Hugging a Coal Executive. Then He Lost His Job.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a photographer for the Department of Energy, Simon Edelman regularly attended meetings with Secretary Rick Perry and snapped pictures for official purposes.Now he is out of a job and seeking whistle-blower protections after leaking photographs of Mr. Perry meeting with a major energy industry donor to President Trump.Late last year, Mr. Edelman said, he shared with journalists photos he shot at the private meeting between Mr. Perry and the campaign contributor Robert E. Murray, the head of one of the country\u2019s largest coal mining companies, Murray Energy.One photo showed the two men embracing; another captured the cover sheet of a confidential \u201caction plan\u201d that Mr. Murray brought to the meeting last March calling for policy and regulatory changes friendly to the coal industry.Democrats and some environmental groups seized on the photos as evidence of the energy industry\u2019s direct line to Mr. Perry, who had been in the job less than a month when the meeting occurred.Mr. Edelman, who has not previously disclosed his identity as the source of the photographs, said in an interview that he wanted to expose the close relationship between the two men. Based on the \u201caction plan\u201d and conversations he overheard, Mr. Edelman said, Mr. Perry had tilted the administration\u2019s energy policy to favor Murray Energy and other coal companies.\u201cIt seemed like that was the right thing to do \u2014 exercising my First Amendment rights to get the information out there,\u201d said Mr. Edelman, who had worked at the agency since 2015 and whose job included photographing events that the agency promoted in news releases, on the web and elsewhere.In the complaint, Mr. Edelman accuses the agency of retaliation and asks for his job back or at least to recover his laptop and other personal belongings. In addition, Mr. Edelman accused a former colleague of encouraging him to delete the photos of Mr. Perry and Mr. Murray, which Mr. Edelman and his lawyer argue are public records.The Energy Department declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding Mr. Edelman\u2019s employment, the status of the photos or the details of his complaint, but a spokeswoman characterized his accusations as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Mr. Edelman supported his complaint with emails and other documents, but some claims were based on his statements alone.\u201cThey are based on his own subjective opinions and personal agenda,\u201d the spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, said in an email. \u201cIndustry and other stakeholders visit the Department of Energy on a daily basis. The secretary welcomes their input and feedback to strengthen the American energy sector. This meeting was no different.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Murray said the coal executive \u201cdoes not have a recollection as to the exact statements allegedly made nearly a year ago.\u201d The spokesman, Gary Broadbent, added that \u201cMr. Murray has frequently said that the Trump administration must advance reliable and low-cost electricity for all Americans and protect coal mining jobs.\u201dThe confidential documents Mr. Murray brought to his meeting with Mr. Perry called for \u201crescinding anti-coal regulations of the Obama administration\u201d and cutting the staff of the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cin at least half,\u201d according to portions visible in Mr. Edelman\u2019s photographs.Robert E. Murray's wish list of environmental rollbacks reads like a playbook for the Trump administration.Mr. Edelman, a Democrat, came to the Energy Department under President Barack Obama two years ago after producing videos at a consulting firm in Chicago and serving as creative director for the electoral campaign of former Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Edelman said, he received greater responsibility, including photographing Mr. Perry\u2019s meetings.In a statement, Mr. Murray\u2019s spokesman said the company had supported Republicans \u201cwho have been staunch defenders of the United States coal industry, and the jobs and family livelihoods that depend on it, and low-cost, reliable, fuel secure electricity for all Americans.\u201dThe meeting started, the complaint said, with Mr. Perry giving Mr. Murray \u201ca deep bear hug.\u201d Once they got down to business, Mr. Murray presented the memo. \u201cThis needs to be done,\u201d the complaint says Mr. Murray insisted.Mr. Perry replied, \u201cI think we can help you with this,\u201d according to the complaint.Rattled by the exchange, Mr. Edelman said he stayed for about 15 minutes to keep listening, until he drew the attention of an agency official. \u201cHow much does a photographer need of us just sitting around?\u201d the complaint quotes the agency official as asking.The photos sat for months without much attention.Without the change, Mr. Perry warned, the plants could shut down, which would threaten the \u201creliability and resiliency of our nation\u2019s grid.\u201dThat phrase rang a bell with Mr. Edelman. The cover page of Mr. Murray\u2019s memo described a plan \u201cto assist in the survival of our country\u2019s coal industry, which is essential to power grid reliability.\u201dMr. Murray has said that the meeting with Mr. Perry was primarily about the need to study the resilience of the power grid, not to ask for specific actions by the energy commission or other arms of the federal government. Mr. Broadbent, his spokesman, said that \u201ca word-for-word comparison\u201d of the proposed rule and Mr. Murray\u2019s action plan \u201creveals that they have only two words in common.\u201dOn Dec. 7, the day after In These Times posted the photographs, and a day before they appeared online at The Washington Post, Mr. Edelman said he was summoned by his boss and told he was being placed on administrative leave with pay.The agency later declined to extend his two-year employment agreement, which ended late last year, effectively dismissing him despite previously agreeing to extend him for two more years, Mr. Edelman said.A security officer for the agency also refused to allow him to pack up certain personal belongings, Mr. Edelman said, including his laptop and camera equipment. The next day, a supervisor instructed Mr. Edelman in an email to provide the agency the administrative rights to the Google Drive folder where he stored the photos, according to a copy of the email reviewed by The Times.Separately, another colleague warned him over the phone that \u201cwe can come to your home and have someone watch you delete it,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. Mr. Edelman did not record the call.In a phone call a few days later, which was recorded, the colleague reiterated that Mr. Edelman needed to transfer ownership of the folder. \u201cI would suggest that doing it sooner rather than later would probably be a good thing for you,\u201d the colleague said, according to the recording, which was heard by The Times.\u201cYou can get access to a computer,\u201d the colleague added, \u201ceven if you need to go to a freaking library to do it.\u201dMr. Edelman said the department had still not returned his laptop. Among the other items he said he left behind because of the hurried exit: a cake from his colleagues celebrating his 35th birthday.By filing his complaint with the inspector general, Mr. Tye said, Mr. Edelman was seeking protections provided to federal whistle-blowers, including prohibition from \u201cadverse employment actions and dismissal.\u201dAfter Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, heard about the incident, his office contacted Mr. Edelman, who also shared the complaint with Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who is a neighbor in Washington. It was Mr. Whitehouse who shared the separate memo by Murray Energy with The Times.\u201cFederal employees should not be fired for doing their jobs,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe Department of Energy must investigate as to why Mr. Edelman was fired.\u201dLisa Friedman and Brad Plumer contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Netflix Is a Monster, and Apple\u2019s HomePod Arrives Soon", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGood morning! Let\u2019s talk tech.People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.The problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.Then, nothing.A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.It\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.That\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.There\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.It\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.M. Says Its Driverless Car Could Be in Fleets by Next Year", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe advent of self-driving cars, the subject of so much fanfare over the last few years from automakers and technology companies, may be just around the corner \u2014 at least according to General Motors.On Friday, G.M. said it had submitted a petition to the United States Department of Transportation seeking permission to begin operating fully autonomous cars \u2014 without steering wheels or pedals \u2014 in a commercial ride-hailing service next year.What\u2019s more, the company said the vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be put into production on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate.Self-driving technology \u201cis only going to have a big impact if we can deploy it at large scale,\u201d G.M.\u2019s chief financial officer, Dan Ammann, said in an interview. \u201cWe intend to launch a commercial ride-share service at commercial scale in 2019. That will begin in one city and scale up in that city and move to other cities after that.\u201dThe cars would most likely be used initially in a ride service created by G.M., rather than in a service run by an established company like Uber or Lyft, Mr. Ammann said.The Cruise AV is a version of the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt. Mr. Ammann said it was reasonable to assume that mass production of the self-driving model would take place at a factory in Orion Township, Mich., that already makes Cruise AV prototypes and the Bolt, though he said there were no firm plans.With its announcement, G.M. appears to have a jump in the race to field self-driving cars. Ford Motor is also developing a car with no steering wheel or pedals, but has said it won\u2019t go into mass production until 2021.The Cruise AV is a four-passenger vehicle with an array of radar, cameras and laser sensors that are clustered on its roof and allow the car to navigate city streets and recognize vehicles, pedestrians, intersections and other obstacles. Since it does not have a steering wheel, it has two passenger seats in front and a center console with a display screen and a few buttons and knobs for audio and climate control.G.M.\u2019s petition calls for producing up to 2,500 Cruise AVs for use in commercial ride fleets.\u201cMass production and government regulation appear to be within General Motors\u2019 grasp,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive data firm. \u201cIf government approval is granted, and G.M. begins providing autonomous taxi service to end users in multiple markets, we\u2019ll officially be living in a world of self-driving cars.\u201dApproval from the Transportation Department is expected to take several months, and then G.M. would need local clearance before it could provide rides in Cruise AVs to the public. Mr. Ammann said it was not clear how the department\u2019s main auto-safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would evaluate G.M.\u2019s petition, and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself.The safety agency said Friday that it would give G.M.\u2019s petition \u201ccareful consideration.\u201dLocal approval will depend on each state\u2019s regulations, Mr. Ammann said. Michigan, for example, already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads. Other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars.Tesla, G.M., Audi and other automakers are also developing driver-assistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions, such as cruising along a divided highway. Those technologies, however, require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems.\u201cUltimately we see a very big business opportunity around this,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.Advertisement"}

Do you hear that?It\u2019s probably going too far to say that the love affair between fashion and technology is over. But it certainly seems to have cooled.Remember when?Maybe we should have expected it. I remember sitting in a Paris hotel room during the women\u2019s wear shows as Jonathan Ive of Apple showed me the first Apple Watch and asking (I was skeptical) what it would do. He told me they didn\u2019t really know; that they would have to see how people used it to understand what it would really become.Presumably that\u2019s what\u2019s going on now.When fashion and tech first started making goo-goo eyes at each other, there was a lot of speculation as to whether two such different worlds could ever really mesh. You could understand the attraction. Often as not they share the same consumer, who is making choices about whether to buy, say, a phone, or a coat. Design matters deeply to both sectors. There was a lot of talk about learning to speak each other\u2019s language.And they probably have, to a certain extent. Smartwatches were the beginning. But if this is going to be a meaningful partnership, that can\u2019t be the end. Especially because no matter how many designers and brands get involved, the end result seems to look pretty much the same. There is only so much you can do, style-wise, within the engineering limits of the wristwatch form. As a result, you get what we have now which is \u2026 yawn.The problem is still that, a few smart sportswear items aside, no one is really sure exactly what role technology should play in the rest of our wardrobe. What do we want our clothes to do, beyond what they already do? Maybe temperature control, often fantasized about. Maybe not.Because here\u2019s the thing: Fashion choices have always communicated \u2014 about identity, values, community \u2014 pretty effectively to the world.

{"Headline": "How to Travel to (and Around) China, From VPNs to T.P.", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerA handful of practical tips to help make sure your next trip to the world\u2019s most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish.China is one of the world\u2019s most exciting and rewarding places to visit, but can be intimidating even to experienced travelers, who might struggle with communication and lack of familiarity with rules and customs. Here\u2019s a handful of practical tips to help make sure your trip to the world\u2019s most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish.Cashless payment in China requires a Chinese bank card, which you can\u2019t get unless you\u2019re a citizen or resident. Don\u2019t count on businesses accepting your foreign credit card, either \u2014 you\u2019ll frequently find yourself out of luck. So load up on cash when you can \u2014 fortunately, I\u2019ve never had trouble finding A.T.M.s in Chinese cities, and withdrawing from Chinese currency with my American debit card has been trouble-free. If you want to play it safe, you can exchange for some at your local bank before you go.While you should always remain alert, China is remarkably safe for foreigners. In total, I\u2019ve spent over a year in China, and have never felt in danger or threatened while walking around, no matter the hour. Chinese traffic, however, can be horrendous, and navigating streets as a pedestrian is always an adventure. Buckle up when in a vehicle, and be extremely careful when crossing the street: Cars do not necessarily yield to pedestrians, and motorcycles and scooters do not seem to yield to anything \u2014 not even red lights.While you won\u2019t be able to buy a SIM card for your phone that includes a Chinese phone number, data plans with 4G speed are available for foreigners. Check at the airport (I bought one in a convenience store), or at the hostel or hotel where you\u2019re staying, and be ready to show your passport.Wi-Fi is everywhere in China, from the pricey malls of Shanghai to modest mom-and-pop restaurants in the smaller cities. The bad news is that you won\u2019t be able to access it some of the time, as it frequently requires you to enter a local phone number to receive a Wi-Fi access code. There are ways to circumvent this. Having a WeChat account will grant access to certain Wi-Fi networks. I also use a Google Voice number to receive internet access codes, which works part of the time. But wait \u2014 isn\u2019t Google blocked in China? That brings us to \u2026The Chinese government does a fairly thorough job censoring websites and traffic from sources it deems potentially unsavory or damaging to the ruling Communist Party. Say goodbye to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, any Google-related services (including Gmail), and even (gasp!) The New York Times.One obvious, but essential, tip: Download and set up your VPN before you leave for China. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll be blocked from downloading any VPNs. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve come to depend on Google Maps considerably during your travels. In China, you would be wise to rid yourself of that notion. Even with a VPN, Google Maps in China is filled with incomplete or sometimes just flat-out incorrect information. For example: There are no fewer than six subway lines currently operating in Chengdu. According to Google Maps, there are just two.You\u2019ll notice plenty of well-maintained public restrooms in China, but they\u2019re not always stocked with toilet paper. You would be wise to carry a small stash with you. This applies to napkins in restaurants as well \u2014 at smaller, more casual places, diners are expected to have their own supply on hand.

By contrast, New York, New England and the Southeast have had relatively mild seasons so far, but cases are rising and should peak in two weeks.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of flu in lots of places,\u201d said Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, director of the C.D.C.\u2019s flu division.Hospitalization and death rates, though climbing, are still lower than was expected, Dr. Jernigan added, even though most of this season\u2019s cases are H3N2, which is typically the most deadly seasonal strain.Although 20 children and teenagers have already died of flu or its consequences, the 2014-2015 season \u2014 the one this season most closely resembles \u2014 killed 148. (This year\u2019s final death toll will not be known until summer, because the deaths from lingering pneumonia may occur as late as June.)The C.D.C. data comes from hospitals and clinics that report how many cases of \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d they treat. Delays can result if clinic statisticians are busy or if state health departments do not pass on the figures quickly.Kinsa, by contrast, is able almost instantly to spot fever spikes in states \u2014 or even in cities and neighborhoods. More than 500,000 households now own its smartphone-connected oral and ear thermometers, Mr. Singh said, and the company gets about 25,000 readings each day.(Of course, the company cannot measure hospitalizations, deaths, or which strains of flu are circulating, or consistently distinguish flu from other febrile illnesses.)Kinsa\u2019s technology was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and gathered data in subsequent flu seasons; the company hopes to soon publish a study by outside experts assessing its accuracy in measuring the seasonal spread.Google tracked internet searches for terms like \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cfever\u201d and so on, but could be misled by, for example, searches triggered by news coverage.Kinsa\u2019s smartphone app uses a bubble game to entice children to take their temperatures. If fever is detected, it asks parents about other symptoms and then offers basic medical advice or urges the user to see a doctor.The makers of cold medications, disinfectants, toothbrushes and even orange juice buy advertising on the app, Mr. Singh said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting His Nation From Puppeteers and Belly Dancers", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileCAIRO \u2014 In a cluttered corner of his labyrinthine law office, amid dog-eared files and half-empty coffee cups, Samir Sabry stood over a computer screen, his face grave as a stone, watching a clip of a potty-mouthed puppet.On screen was Abla Fahita, a popular satirical character based on a wisecracking widow with a salty sense of humor. She was poking fun at the forced intimacy of Egyptians in such a crowded society. \u201cLike two butt cheeks in a pair of underpants,\u201d she quipped.Mr. Sabry\u2019s lip curled.\u201cThey call this funny?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely immoral, and a lot of Egyptians hate it.\u201dHe issued an order, and the following morning, his office dispatched a criminal complaint to a public prosecutor, accusing the puppet\u2019s producers of \u201cpromoting debauchery.\u201d If convicted, they face up to five years in prison.Mr. Sabry, a portly 67-year-old lawyer, is one of the most prolific litigators in a country where the law allows one citizen to press charges against another for vague crimes like immorality and \u201cinsulting\u201d the nation. While it falls to a government prosecutor to decide whether to pursue such cases, and many are dismissed as frivolous, the successes have stifled free speech, hobbled the arts and even swayed national politics.A tireless vigilante who wields the law like a cudgel to enforce his prickly, often paranoid, brand of Egyptian nationalism, Mr. Sabry claims to have filed more than 2,700 such public interest lawsuits in the past 40 years, often firing off several in a day. His legal darts have targeted actors, clerics, politicians and even belly dancers, and may play a decisive role in the next presidential election.Many cases fizzle out. This was his third suit against the puppet show, which he previously sued for a skit on the novel \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d A judge threw out that case.When Mr. Sabry succeeds, however, the consequences can be far-reaching.In November, Mr. Sabry helped get Sherine, a smoldering pop diva, banned from performing in Egypt after she had made a biting joke about the quality of the famously dirty water in the Nile.\u201cEgyptian art is in its worst state ever at the moment,\u201d he thundered. \u201cThey are relying on nudity, swear words, drugs and thuggery, and are showing our Egyptian women as whores. We have to stop them.\u201dBut his chances are further hampered by his conviction last year on charges filed by Mr. Sabry for having made an obscene gesture outside a Cairo courthouse. If Mr. Ali\u2019s appeal, scheduled for March 7, fails, he will automatically be disqualified from the presidential race.Critics say legal crusaders like Mr. Sabry are not only choking the precious little free speech that remains in Egypt, but are hurting one of Egyptians\u2019 proudest attributes \u2014 their ability to laugh at themselves.\u201cWe are the funny Arabs, the ones who take nothing seriously,\u201d said Hafsa Halawa, a legal expert. \u201cAnd now even that is disappearing.\u201dMr. Sabry, for his part, relishes his role as moral enforcer. \u201cPeople fear me,\u201d he said.He works from an eccentrically appointed office in Cairo\u2019s old city crowded with dozens of tiny figurines, including Roman emperors, Abraham Lincoln, London beefeaters, and the Pope, as well as part of his collection of 3,400 toy cars, carefully arranged on a conference table.He stays up late into the night, monitoring a giant television over his desk or prowling the internet on his iPad, looking for anyone he deems to have offended Egypt or Mr. Sisi. For research he turns to his archive: eight rooms filled with towering piles of newspapers and magazines, dating to the 1970s, that provide additional ammunition against his targets.\u201cJust in case I need to find out what they said previously,\u201d he explained on a tour of the dust-filled chambers. \u201cTo expose their flip-flops.\u201dSuch an intense pace of work leaves limited time with his wife, Mr. Sabry admitted, but he was never much of a romantic. \u201cAll this love and hand holding \u2014 enough,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows this is my passion. In any case I buy her gifts \u2014 diamond rings, a necklace and a BMW. It makes for a happy marriage.\u201dHis ardor for Mr. Sisi, though, is virtually boundless. Both men were born in nearby Gamaliyah, among the winding alleys of the old city, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s father was a trader. When Mr. Sisi, then a general, came to power in 2013, Mr. Sabry said, he offered Mr. Sisi advice over drinks at the Heliopolis Club, and later interviewed him for a newspaper.The resulting article, \u201cGeneral Sisi: Between Symbol and Legend,\u201d is one of dozens framed in the hallway detailing Mr. Sabry\u2019s exploits attacking enemies of Mr. Sisi.Mr. Sabry went on to file hundreds of cases against the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Mr. Sisi\u2019s military had ousted from power, and sought, unsuccessfully, to strip 113 Egyptians of their citizenship, including the opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei and Wael Ghonim, a Google worker who played a prominent role in the Arab Spring protests of 2011.Last month another lawyer brought a prosecution that landed a minor pop star named Shyma in jail for two years for a video in which she appeared to fellate a banana.Another lawyer, Nabeeh el-Wahsh, disparaged Mr. Sabry as a blowhard who uses the cases as \u201ca chance to get famous.\u201dMr. Sabry denied the accusations, and insisted that he personally finances his lawsuits with no help from the government.He claims that two-thirds of his prosecutions have resulted in convictions, an estimate that seems high.

{"Headline": "Secrets or Knowledge? Uber-Waymo Trial Tests Silicon Valley Culture", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trial, which is scheduled to start with jury selection on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco, pits Waymo, a spinoff of Google and one of the most successful companies from the dot-com boom, against Uber, the ride-hailing giant and today\u2019s most valuable start-up. At stake is a leading role in the intense competition among tech and auto companies to create autonomous vehicles.The dispute hinges on the actions of a former star engineer at Google who started his own company and then sold it to Uber within a year. Did he steal thousands of Google computer files as he headed out the door and bring those files with him to Uber?The courtroom fight will most likely prompt a philosophical discussion over the entrepreneurial \u2014 some would say outlaw \u2014 spirit that has long made Silicon Valley tick. Should an engineer be free to leave a company and build on the knowledge and skills he gained at the old job? Are the tech industry\u2019s giants too eager to use lawyers to cudgel competition? And are start-ups like Uber too willing to cut corners as they scramble to turn a profit?\u201cFiguring out what\u2019s on one side of the line and what\u2019s on other side is incredibly complicated,\u201d she said.Unlike publicly filed patents, trade secrets are, well, secret. They are defined as valuable information that is not generally known and is protected by the company from getting out, like the recipe for Coca-Cola. But because trade secrets can be hard to define, they raise questions about the line between an employee\u2019s skill or knowledge versus intellectual property belonging to an employer.It was a long and tedious process requiring much experimentation to see what worked and what didn\u2019t. Some of those lessons are still considered valuable and closely guarded secrets at Waymo \u2014 secrets the company says Uber would have to tap into to meet the ambitious financial targets it has set for Mr. Levandowski.It is a position that is fitting with the start-up spirit of Silicon Valley, where engineers move freely from company to company, taking what they know with them. A free flow of ideas and personnel can open the door to claims of theft or copying, but technologists often look down on companies that resort to legal action to kneecap a competitor.When that engineer moves to another company and is assigned that same task, will that person need to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d and go through all the experiments again to make sure they are not using a former employer\u2019s trade secrets? \u201cIs an engineer really supposed to get a frontal lobotomy before they go to the next job? I think the answer has to be no,\u201d Judge Alsup said.Waymo claims \u2014 and Uber does not dispute \u2013 that Mr. Levandowski downloaded 14,000 files before leaving Google and receiving a $120 million bonus from his former employer. At the time, he was already meeting regularly with Uber and Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s then-chief executive, and had not officially founded his own firm, Ottomotto. Mr. Levandowski is not a defendant in the suit.In a deposition in July, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Waymo, was asked about the decision to pay Mr. Levandowski a massive bonus. Mr. Page acknowledged that Mr. Levandowski had played \u201ca significant role\u201d in the history of the project, but was a headache for management by the time he left.When called to testify, Mr. Levandowski is expected to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. He hasn\u2019t cooperated with Uber\u2019s lawyers, and Judge Alsup has referred Mr. Levandowski to the federal prosecutors for possible theft of trade secrets. While it\u2019s not clear whether the Department of Justice is investigating his actions, federal investigators confirmed that it was looking into Uber\u2019s business practices.\u201cLet\u2019s stop pretending we can hold back the development of intelligence when there are clear massive short term economic benefits to those who develop it and instead understand the future and have it treat us like a beloved elder who created it,\u201d reads the passage on the website for \u201cWay of the Future,\u201d the religion founded by Mr. Levandowski.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Companies Have Newfound Freedom \u2026 to Fire", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The announcements came in a steady drumbeat. Around 1,300 job cuts at France\u2019s biggest automaker. At least 2,500 at France\u2019s largest supermarket chain. Over 200 sought at a major clothing retailer. And thousands more are on the way.Just weeks after France\u2019s labor overhaul went into effect, companies are readily taking advantage of new rules that make it easier to hire and fire. But the other changes, those designed to help cushion the blow like retraining programs, haven\u2019t been put into place yet, leaving workers vulnerable to a coming wave of downsizing.Unemployment, persistently stuck at more than 9 percent for nearly a decade, could rise in the coming months. Unions, already dubious of the overhaul, may grow impatient if the government doesn\u2019t follow through on its promises to workers.\u201cRight now it\u2019s flexibility, and no security,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economics professor at the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cCompanies will do everything they can under the new law to maximize flexibility and facilitate the firing of people.\u201dPerceptions of France, long derided as a difficult place to do business for its onerous labor rules, are changing.Growth has recently picked up after being stagnant for nearly five years. And there are signs that the changes, a major piece of the president\u2019s economic program, are drawing the interest of investors.Amazon will open a new distribution center south of Paris this year, creating over 1,000 jobs. Facebook and Google announced Monday they would invest in artificial intelligence development in France. Also Monday, Toyota announced it would invest 300 million euros, or $367 million, to increase capacity at a plant in northern France, creating up to 700 jobs through 2020.\u201cThe complex labor laws have historically been the No. 1 obstacle to the competitiveness and attractiveness of France,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France, a business consulting firm. The changes, together with other business-friendly measures such as a gradual reduction in the corporate tax, have \u201cdrastically changed investor perceptions,\u201d he said.The transition, though, is off to a halting start.Mr. Macron wants to invest more than \u20ac15 million in programs to improve public and private retraining that have had only mixed success in recent years at ushering the jobless back into employment. Lawmakers won\u2019t vote on the measures until the spring, and any improvements are expected to take months, if not years, to bear fruit.That layoffs are being announced before this crucial part is done has fueled suspicion among organized labor. And while new jobs will eventually be created, many unions worry the changes are a ploy to strip away worker protections \u2014 and their own power. In the last several weeks, the country\u2019s most ardent trade organizations have vigorously opposed such plans, with differing results.The new rules tip the balance of power from workers to employers. Businesses have been reluctant to hire because it was difficult to shed workers. Employers have turned en masse to precarious short-term contracts to fill the gaps.Now, companies will be able to negotiate job cuts and restructurings through voluntary departures directly with labor representatives inside the business, rather than under strict industrywide collective bargaining agreements. Multinationals can downsize loss-making French operations more easily, even if the overall business is profitable. Companies will face less risk of legal action over dismissals, and can hire new staff immediately, rather than waiting.Pierre-Olivier Salmon, the head of corporate information at PSA Group, said the carmaker is looking to bring in a new generation of workers with the digital and programming skills needed to develop projects like electric cars and future technology for the automotive industry.Yet most of the positions affected in this round are white-collar posts, such as administrative assistants, communications personnel and those in research and development.That is seen as hardly a positive by some of France\u2019s unions. They are concerned that the outcome at PSA will be replicated by other companies seeking to shed protected workers, and at most bring in a new generation of cheap labor.The new measures may also have the effect of pitting labor groups against one another \u2014 a development that could work in Mr. Macron\u2019s favor.His union hailed last week\u2019s agreement at PSA, saying it was \u201cnot a danger for employees,\u201d but \u201can opportunity for those who want it.\u201dYet there is also little doubt that the restructuring will benefit PSA Group\u2019s bottom line: Incoming young workers won\u2019t be paid nearly as much as those heading out the door.\u201cThe main point is not to reduce costs,\u201d Mr. Salmon of PSA insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s to meet new challenges.\u201dWhatever the case, last week\u2019s announcements of job cuts will likely be followed by others, providing a test for Mr. Macron. He campaigned for the presidency with pledges to make France more dynamic, but not at the cost of unraveling its social welfare model.The challenge is not lost on his rivals.\u201cThis labor law allows big companies to fire more quickly and easily,\u201d Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, wrote on Twitter. Ms. Le Pen, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Macron last year in the presidential runoff, added: \u201cThe human dramas will multiply.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted a statement from Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the General Confederation of Labor. He said, in part, \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of employees with seniority,\u201d not \u201cThis is a means for companies to get rid of low-cost employees with seniority.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time for Apple to Build a Less Addictive iPhone", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt\u2019s not Apple\u2019s fault that you feel enslaved by your phone. But the company that gave the world the modern smartphone has a perfect opportunity this year to create a brave and groundbreaking new take on that device: a phone that encourages you to use it more thoughtfully, more deliberately \u2014 and a lot less.Also, what do we do about it?Government regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who\u2019s left?The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.\u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201dFor one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201dAnother idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).\u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.\u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s working on something grand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford Says It\u2019s a New Era. Wall Street Isn\u2019t Buying It.", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight months after taking over as chief executive of Ford Motor, Jim Hackett is still trying to accomplish one of his most important tasks: convincing Wall Street that he has a compelling plan to reinvigorate the automaker.Mr. Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of the office-furniture supplier Steelcase, has taken several shots at it. In October, he and the new team of top executives he selected appeared before financial analysts in New York to outline a plan to cut costs \u2014 improve Ford\u2019s \u201cfitness,\u201d in Mr. Hackett\u2019s words \u2014 and to accelerate development of trucks, electric cars and self-driving vehicles.He pressed his case further this month before large audiences at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and the Detroit auto show.But so far investors and analysts remain uninspired. The company\u2019s stock is virtually unchanged since late September, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained 13 percent.\u201cFord is basically saying, \u2018We have a lot of inefficiencies, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time to fix,\u2019\u201d said David Whiston, a financial analyst at Morningstar. \u201cI thought a lot of these inefficiencies were taken care of a long time ago. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201dThe latest disappointment arrived on Wednesday, when Ford reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share. That was an improvement over a loss in the comparable period a year ago, but its adjusted earnings were 39 cents a share, about 4 cents less than analysts expected.Profit fell in North America as sales slowed in the United States, and the company lost about $200 million in the rest of the world. Sales in China fell 6 percent.The company forecast a decline in earnings this year, mainly as a result of rising commodity costs and unfavorable exchange rates. Ford also said it would have higher costs related to the introduction of new models \u2014 23 are coming this year globally, compared with 11 in 2017.\u201cWe need to be fitter,\u201d said Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks.Mr. Shanks told reporters that he didn\u2019t think analysts were unconvinced about Ford\u2019s turnaround plan. \u201cWith the exception of Tesla, the market is skeptical about the sector\u2019s ability to be successful in the world that\u2019s ahead of us\u201d he said.In a conference call, analysts pressed Mr. Hackett to talk about initiatives to improve profitability, but he declined to discuss them in detail, except to say they are \u201cup and running.\u201dJust a few years ago, Ford was considered the healthiest of the three Detroit automakers, having escaped the government-engineered bankruptcies that engulfed General Motors and Chrysler. With Alan Mulally as chief executive, Ford slimmed down, focused on its Ford and Lincoln brands, and roared to record profits.After Mr. Mulally retired in 2014 and passed the baton to Mark Fields, however, Ford began to drift as new technologies started reshaping the industry; as new challengers emerged in Tesla, Google and Uber; and as a revived G.M. and a merged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles provided increased competition in the high-margin business of trucks and roomy sport-utility vehicles. Its stock slumped, and Ford directors began wondering if Mr. Fields had the right strategy.Mr. Hackett took three months to dive into Ford\u2019s troubles and found that Ford was spending too much time and money developing new vehicles, and that costs for steel, other materials and components were rising. His prescription called for Ford to refocus investments on growing markets like China and highly profitable vehicles like trucks and S.U.V.s, while cutting back on initiatives in less promising areas like Europe and passenger cars.\u201cWe are intensely focusing on fixing the fundamental health of our company,\u201d Mr. Hackett said on Wednesday.To ensure that Ford will be a player down the road, the company is also ramping up plans to introduce 40 electrified vehicles by 2022 and a driverless car for taxi fleets, ride-hailing services and delivery companies by 2021.At the Detroit show, Ford said it planned to spend $11 billion on electric vehicles by 2022.\u201cIt was very philosophical,\u201d said Mr. Whiston, who was in the audience. \u201cHe might be appealing to a nonautomotive audience, but financial analysts want more.\u201dMore troubling to Wall Street is that Ford\u2019s new strategy is likely to have little immediate impact on its bottom line.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients issued before Ford reported its fourth-quarter results that \u201cthe path ahead in shifting Ford\u2019s strategy will be rather long.\u201dG.M. has been ahead of Ford in adding trucks and S.U.V.s to its lineup. At the Detroit show, Ford unveiled a midsize pickup truck, the Ranger. G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands have had midsize trucks for nearly three years.\u201cThere was a really stark contrast between Ford and G.M. presentations\u201d given to financial analysts at the show, Mr. Whiston said. \u201cG.M. was all about optimism, and Ford talked about fitness and efficiency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Competing With the Giants in Race to Build Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Before the car can drive without a human, one must first get behind the wheel.As the driver at this company accelerates, stops and turns on local streets, sensors on the car record what he sees and track how he responds. Then a team of engineers builds software that can learn how to behave from that data.The software is installed in the car, and it can drive on its own. In the end, the car mimics choices made by the human driver.This is how things work at Aurora Innovation, a start-up founded by three veterans of autonomous vehicle research, including Chris Urmson, who previously led the self-driving car project at Google.The company\u2019s methods are part of a change sweeping across the world of self-driving cars: a kind of so-called machine learning technology that promises a chance for little companies like Aurora to compete with the giants of both the tech and automotive industries. With it, researchers can build and improve autonomous vehicles at a far more rapid pace \u2014 one of the reasons Aurora believes it can close the gap on companies that have been working on self-driving technology for years.On Thursday, the year-old start-up said that it had agreed to supply self-driving technology to the Volkswagen Group and Hyundai, two of the world\u2019s largest car companies. Johann Jungwirth, the chief digital officer at the Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche and six other major automotive brands including the flagship VW brand, said the company has been working with Aurora for several months, with an eye toward developing both autonomous cars and driverless taxi services.These algorithms can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. \u201cIt used to be that a real smart Ph.D. sat in a cube for six months, and they would hand-code a detector\u201d that spotted objects on the road, Mr. Urmson said during a recent interview at Aurora\u2019s offices. \u201cNow, you gather the right kind of data and feed it to an algorithm, and a day later, you have something that works as well as that six months of work from the Ph.D.\u201dThe Google self-driving car project first used the technique to detect pedestrians. Since then, it has applied the same method to many other parts of the car, including systems that predict what will happen on the road and plan a route forward. Now, the industry as a whole is moving in the same direction.But this shift raises questions. It is still unclear how regulators and lawyers \u2014 not to mention the general public \u2014 will view these methods. Because neural networks learn from such large amounts of data, relying on hours or even days of calculations, they operate in ways that their human designers cannot necessarily anticipate or understand. There is no means of determining exactly why a machine reaches a particular decision.\u201cThis is a big transition,\u201d said Noah Goodall, who explores regulatory and legal issues surrounding autonomous cars at the Virginia Transportation Research Council, an arm of the State Department of Transportation. \u201cIf you start using neural networks to control how a car moves and then it crashes, how do you explain why it crashed and why it won\u2019t happen again?\u201dSoon, Mr. Krizhevsky and his collaborators moved to Google, and over the next few years, Google and its internet rivals broke new ground in artificial intelligence, using these concepts to identify objects in photos and to recognize commands spoken into smartphones, translate between languages and respond to internet search queries.Over the holiday break at the end of 2013, another Google researcher, Anelia Angelova, asked for Mr. Krizhevsky\u2019s help on the Google car project. Neither of them officially worked on the project. They were part of a separate A.I. lab called Google Brain. But they saw an opportunity.Rather than trying to define for a computer what a pedestrian looked like, they created an algorithm that could allow a computer to learn what a pedestrian looked like. By analyzing thousands of street photos, their system could begin to identify the visual patterns that define a pedestrian, like the curve of a head or the bend of a leg. The method was so effective that Google began applying the technique to other parts of the project, including prediction and planning.\u201cIt was a big turning point,\u201d said Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of Google\u2019s original self-driving car team and is now chief technology officer at Waymo, the new company that oversees the project. \u201c2013 was pretty magical.\u201dMr. Urmson described this shift in much the same way. He believes the continued progress of these and other machine learning methods will be essential to building cars that can match and even exceed the behavior of human drivers.Mirroring the work at Waymo, Aurora is building algorithms that can recognize objects on the road and anticipate and react to what other vehicles and pedestrians will do next. As Mr. Urmson explained, the software can learn what happens when a driver turns the vehicle in a particular direction at a particular speed on a particular type of road.\u201cFor cars or flying aircraft, there is a lot of concern over neural networks doing crazy things,\u201d said Mykel Kochenderfer, a robotics professor who oversees the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Stanford University.Like Waymo, Toyota and others, Aurora says that its approach is more controlled than it might seem. The company layers cars with backup systems, so that if one system fails, another can offer a safety net. And rather than driving the car using a single neural network that learns all behavior from one vast pool of data \u2014 the method demonstrated by Nvidia \u2014 they break the task into smaller pieces.One system detects traffic lights, for example. Another predicts what will happen next on the road in a particular kind of situation. A third chooses a response. And so on. The company can train and test and retrain each piece.\u201cHow do you get confidence that something works?\u201d asked Drew Bagnell, a machine learning specialist who helped found Aurora after leaving the self-driving car program at Uber. \u201cYou test it.\u201dMr. Goodall, the Virginia Department of Transportation researcher, said car designers must reassure both regulators and the public that these methods are reliable.\u201cThe onus is on them,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a researcher at the Virginia Department of Transportation.

{"Headline": "The Pentagon Papers Team Tells How The Times Defied Censorship", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring Tuesday\u2019s Facebook Live, the Times alumni described the secrecy surrounding their work on the Papers and their frustration with the public\u2019s initial reaction to our publication. Here are some excerpts from their conversation, condensed and edited for clarity.I\u2019ve brought them together so that we can talk about what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with the new Steven Spielberg movie \u201cThe Post,\u201d but more importantly to tell the very dramatic story of how the Pentagon Papers were obtained, developed, produced, edited, curated, published against the threat of tremendous legal liability from the Nixon administration \u2014 a dramatic enough story in itself that would have made, we believe, for a very good movie called \u201cThe Times.\u201dI\u2019m going to ask them to introduce themselves in the order in which they first came into contact with the Pentagon Papers in the late spring of 1971. Allan Siegal?Part of the mission of The Times was to present the history of the Vietnam War as it had been recorded under the orders of then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who wanted to find out, how did we get into this mess?The people who compiled the report had access to all kinds of cables, memos and notes, which betrayed \u2014 when you read them closely \u2014 that one administration after the next had engaged in exactly the kind of double-dealing that critics of the war had always maintained was going on. But here was the Pentagon saying it, in its own voice.Because of that, it was critical, as far as The Times saw it, to reproduce the documents themselves. Not simply interpret them or rely on them for narrative articles, but to actually expose the public to the words of the decision makers. And that meant that we were trading in classified information on a scale that perhaps had never been undertaken before.What kind of pause did that give any of you as you worked with this material?When I was taken to the Hilton Hotel where the team was working on the papers \u2014 not in the headquarters of The Times but in the hotel \u2014 I was told that we had these papers and it was of course against the law to have these papers and it could even be treasonous to have these papers, and if I did not want to work on them, I was free not to work on them.And of course I wanted to work on them, but right off the bat it was clear that imprisonment was a possibility and I\u2019m sure everybody else felt that way too.The Pentagon Papers were split into documents, and into regular text. The regular text, in fact, was based on New York Times articles, no problem. I warned everybody at the beginning that it\u2019s going to be a lot more dangerous to publish the regular text, if you leave the documents out. And that ignited a huge argument within The Times in which the news people finally said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t run the documents, you\u2019re not going to run anything.\u201dFrom a personal point of view, when I read the material to be published and I had a chance to read the documents that had been picked out, I remember reading one particularly from national security adviser and strong proponent of the war McGeorge Bundy that shocked me. And I said this has got to be published, the public has never seen anything like this. Go with the documents.I think perhaps you could draw the distinction between the very careful in essence curation of a classified document against the dumps that we now see with WikiLeaks and other sources that just put the material out there, consequences be damned.The New York Times got Wikileaks\u2019s materials. It curated them. It didn\u2019t publish all of them. There were other papers, The Guardian included, that did the same thing. And then after they had done what they had done, WikiLeaks changed what it was going to deliver to the public and curated itself.I would admit, however, as we look at what\u2019s taken place thereafter, WikiLeaks has been more of a \u201cdump\u201d than it was before. But you have to be careful how you describe that.The only problem that government officials seem to have with classified information is when it doesn\u2019t paint them in the light they\u2019d like to be painted in. Otherwise they trade in it with impunity, it seems.You might be interested in the history of that affidavit. Max had a lawyer assigned to him \u2014 we had five lawyers in the case; I was running the case, and we signed different parts of it \u2014 and he didn\u2019t like the lawyer, who was a perfectly capable, competent lawyer.And Max would say what you just implied in your statement, to this lawyer. And the lawyer would say, \u201cIt can\u2019t be! It can\u2019t be that people really don\u2019t pay attention to the classification stamp!\u201d Argument, back and forth, back and forth. It was very important to turn that lawyer. Because if a lawyer didn\u2019t turn around and reflect our point of view, it was going to come through in what he said.And Max finally threw up his hands. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll write an affidavit.\u201d So he wrote this affidavit, in which he describes how this works in the real world. All the stuff that\u2019s traded back and forth is classified because everything\u2019s classified. \u201cWhen everything\u2019s classified\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m quoting the Supreme Court \u2014 \u201dnothing is classified.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At a Public School in Denver, Refugee Children Find Hope and Frustration", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Steve Bannon, we hear you. Too many white middle-class Americans, victimized by globalization, are struggling. Resources are scarce enough for people who were born right here.Build the Wall! Build the Wall!But maybe Americans are not as flinty a race as we appear to be when we\u2019re chanting at rallies. While President Trump was campaigning on the wall, Helen Thorpe spent a year inside a \u201cnewcomer class\u201d for teenage refugees from Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central America.Her resulting book, \u201cThe Newcomers,\u201d is a delicate and heartbreaking mystery story, as Thorpe slowly uncovers the secret catastrophes in the lives of young immigrants at South High School in Denver. They arrive mute, and they gradually gain the words and confidence to describe the journeys that led to the classroom.Thorpe\u2019s parents emigrated from Ireland in 1965, when Thorpe was a year old, and she has written about young Mexican immigrants in America. A discerning chronicler of cultural misunderstanding, she started the book just as nativist resentment became a political movement.South High School is Denver\u2019s designated school for non-English-speaking students whose educations have been disrupted. Here, teenagers uprooted by war, violence and deprivation meet the most generous of Americans. Nice people from churches, synagogues and Goodwill all appear in their lives, brought together by a generously funded public school system and a dedicated English Language Acquisition teacher, Eddie Williams.A Mexican-American whose own mother hid her roots out of shame and fear, Williams presides over a miniature United Nations of survivors of conflicts across the planet. There\u2019s Hsar Htoo, born in a refugee camp in Thailand to a Karen family from Myanmar. For him, everything in Denver is new: \u201crunning water, appliances, grocery stores, snow.\u201dWilliams worries about Iraqi sisters Jakleen and Mariam, daughters of a Christian father and Muslim mother; their father worked for the Americans, and then disappeared in Baghdad as sectarian violence erupted during the American troop drawdown. With their mother and a third sister, the girls spent six years in a Damascus suburb, missed a year of school because of car bombs and are now barely able to get to school on time.Methusella and Solomon, teenage boys from the Democratic Republic of Congo, were driven out of Goma with their family. The brothers show up at South High School on time every day, \u201calways nicely dressed,\u201d bending over their work with laser focus.Thorpe gets to know some of the parents, like Methusella and Solomon\u2019s father, a dignified man wearing a collared shirt and navy trousers, working as a dishwasher and studying English out of a creased pocket dictionary he bought at Goodwill for a dollar. He speaks four languages including French, and when he sees dents in American houses, he must remind himself they are not caused by bullet holes, like the dents in houses back home.Thorpe went deep, hiring 14 translators to conduct repeated interviews. Jakleen shares a letter she wrote to her father. Thorpe runs her hands over the Arabic letters on the page, and it\u2019s \u201clike reading Braille inversely,\u201d because the girl pressed so hard with her pen. Still, some of their sad secrets stay buried. Hsar Htoo asks Thorpe before she interviews him not to ask him about his father\u2019s death. She also never really unravels how the unaccompanied Salvadoran children, fleeing one of the hemisphere\u2019s most violent nations, survived harrowing cross-border trips and made their way from federal detention facilities to Denver.A year is a long time in teenage years, and frustration mounts. Some of the students are multilingual, and feel smarter than their lack of English allows. The Iraqi girls are so depressed they barely show up for school in the winter, racking up absences. The school encourages them with success stories. Thorpe\u2019s Arabic translator tells the girls that she raised her three children in America, and that they too hated it when they first arrived. Today, one is an engineer, another is a pediatric dentist, and the third is studying medicine.Thorpe makes fascinating linguistic discoveries. At first, the newcomers can\u2019t even communicate with one another. As the weeks pass, they resort to Google Translate, sometimes bypassing English altogether. Watching them translate Swahili to Arabic and Portuguese, Thorpe notices cognates between Arabic and the African languages, remnants of ancient connections between two regions that to many Americans are as unfamiliar as the dark side of the moon.\u201cAs the kids discovered these commonalities, I began to feel as though I were watching something like the living embodiment of a linguistic tree,\u201d Thorpe writes. \u201cThe classroom and the relationships forming inside of it were an almost perfect map of language proximity around the globe.\u201dThorpe has an epiphany of sorts when she learns that the word for \u201cbook\u201d is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d in the African languages and in Arabic. \u201cThat was the moment when I first grasped my own arrogance as an English speaker,\u201d Thorpe writes. \u201cI mean, the arrogance harbored by someone who knew only European languages, which rendered the well-laced interconnectedness of the rest of the world invisible.\u201dBut no matter how nimble and light their hearts might be, the students can\u2019t help noticing the rising resentment aimed their way. \u201cXenophobia was not something that was listed formally as a factor that inhibited learning among E.L.A. students,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut as the weeks slipped by and the cacophony of the presidential election ratcheted up, elevating all kind of sentiments in the voting populace, including a virulent dislike of people from other countries, I came to think of the fear some people in my own country felt toward foreigners as an issue that itself inhibited the newcomers\u2019 learning. They were acutely sensitive and could detect when they were misunderstood.\u201dOr hated.Right after Trump\u2019s election, the long commutes to and from school on Denver\u2019s public transit system become an obstacle course of shame and fear. People call the students \u201cdirty\u201d and tell them to \u201cgo home.\u201d A passenger on a bus tells one girl, \u201cWe are going to kick your ass out of this country.\u201dThe faculty at South High School struggles to help the students grapple with the new social climate, treating it like an emergency akin to a shooting or an outbreak of flu. The principal brings on nine temporary counselors to help, because the number of children seeking counseling \u201creached levels that nobody had ever seen before.\u201d Two students had attempted suicide.Nevertheless, Thorpe\u2019s book is a reminder that in an era of nativism, some Americans are still breaking down walls and nurturing newcomers, the seeds of the great American experiment.Nina Burleigh is the national politics correspondent at Newsweek magazine and the author of five nonfiction books.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel Faces Scrutiny as Questions Swirl Over Chip Security", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Intel faces an even bigger test: two serious security issues with its chips that could have implications for nearly everyone touched by computing. And so far \u2014 in something of a repeat of the 1994 incident \u2014 Intel has failed to quiet critics, putting it in an awkward position this week as its chief executive prepares to take the stage at one of the world\u2019s biggest tech trade shows.\u201cIt is a very big deal, because it\u2019s an area people haven\u2019t looked at before,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \u201cEverybody is going to start now.\u201dIntel was privately informed of the issues by security researchers in June. The company, which has rejected doing a chip recall or other costly remedies, said it has quietly marshaled a coalition of software, hardware and cloud services to develop and deploy programming tweaks that are designed to close most of the security gaps. Intel and its partners said the fixes should be largely in place this week.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten much more mature in our ability to respond,\u201d said Steven L. Smith, an Intel vice president who was closely involved in the Pentium crisis and is now overseeing its handling of the new security issues.Adding to Intel\u2019s image challenges is that Mr. Krzanich sold about $39 million in Intel shares in late November, after the company learned of the chip security problems. A company spokesman said the sale had been unrelated to the security issues and followed a prearranged annual trading plan. Mr. Krzanich, who reduced his holdings by about 50 percent, \u201ccontinues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines,\u201d Intel said.Meltdown and Spectre were identified by a team at Google, with their work augmented by researchers from other organizations. Meltdown affects only Intel chips. Spectre also affects chip designs from companies such Advanced Micro Devices and ARM Holdings, whose technology is used in most smartphones.Intel, largely by virtue of its success, has the most at stake. While the Pentium chip underpinned most PCs running Microsoft operating systems in 1994, Intel processors are now also used in all Apple Macintosh systems and more than 95 percent of the chips used by cloud services and data centers run by corporations. Its technological reach means that both Meltdown and Spectre could affect just about anyone who uses the internet.\u201cWe created a microprocessor monoculture,\u201d said Bryan Cantrill, chief technology officer at Joyent, a cloud service owned by Samsung. \u201cThere are dangers associated with that.\u201dIntel\u2019s situation is complicated by history and semantics. The Pentium problem was caused by a design error. But Meltdown and Spectre attacks exploit a common speed-boosting technique in chips called speculative execution that Intel\u2019s Mr. Smith insisted is working as it should. That approach to chip design emerged before researchers developed new ways to spy on such internal operations, using what they call \u201cside-channel\u201d analysis, Mr. Smith said.As a result, the security issues that were discovered were not flaws or bugs, he said. The features that hackers could exploit are a bit like a door or window in a house, which burglars can exploit but that builders would not consider leaving out.That hasn\u2019t stopped an uproar from security researchers and tech industry executives. One widely distributed barb came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, who posted a testy message last week advising Intel to \u201ctake a long hard look\u201d at its chips \u201cand actually admit that they have issues instead of writing P.R. blurbs that say that everything works as designed.\u201dMajor users of Intel chips \u2014 including Apple and the cloud computing arms of Google and Amazon \u2014 have said they deployed security fixes recommended by Intel and so far they have not reported the sharp performance slowdowns of the sort some experts projected.Many security professionals said they accepted the argument. \u201cThis is not a simple \u2018we found a bug, here\u2019s a patch and we are done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schneier said.Whether Intel\u2019s actions to address Meltdown and Spectre will be enough for the company to sidestep a sizable financial hit is unclear. At least one lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against Intel, and some industry executives expect more litigation to come. At a minimum, Intel engineers working on future microprocessors now face the additional labor of trying to make them less susceptible to the new kinds of attacks.Using the software fixes, \u201cwe already have the security improvement that we are seeking to get,\u201d Mr. Smith said. But making internal changes to the chips could handle those changes more efficiently, he said.Advertisement"}

Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief for The Times, based in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What are some of the most important tech tools you have relied on as our reporter covering parts of South America? Lately we\u2019ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with drones here, and not just for filming.It was no surprise to us, either, that drone technology was something that had never made it to the village we were working in. So the \u201cflying camera\u201d was quite an attraction when we arrived at our destination.What about the tools that you use could be better?Google Maps, for one. I mainly work in the Andes, and most anyone who lives in mountains can tell you that the shortest distance between two points isn\u2019t necessarily the route that you want to take. However, Google doesn\u2019t use local knowledge to calculate directions.Recently at a dinner party in La Paz, Bolivia, a friend told me about heading out of the canyon where the capital dwellers live and up to a concert on the plateau that sits above the city. The route his phone had calculated was on a dirt road that went straight up on a 45-degree angle that people generally walked or went up by mule.It reminded me of the stories that every correspondent had about using Google or Waze when I used to cover Israel and the Palestinian territories. Your phone would regularly take you in and out of each as if there weren\u2019t a conflict going on, through military checkpoints and down roads that often ended in a wall put up 10 years before. Even if impassable, it was always the shortest route, Google assured.A correspondent there warned me before I arrived to bring a Kindle \u2014 books were sometimes easier to download than to buy in Caracas, especially best-sellers or anything in English. You also lived in fear of losing things as basic and easy to get as a power cord. Venezuela is a country where people are having trouble finding tires when they get holes in them on the road, let alone Apple products. It is very unfortunate.It\u2019s not uncommon for Venezuelans to come back with a duffel bag filled with just the basics that aren\u2019t for sale in stores anymore: toilet paper, dish detergent, shampoo, sponges. It would get to the point where you were also adding phone chargers, batteries, USB cables, internet routers and anything else you could imagine that plugged into the wall.How has internet connectivity been in the Andes countries, and how do locals use apps or websites like Facebook or Twitter? How do governments use tech for surveillance in those places?That\u2019s a question everyone would like to know. Venezuelan spying can be surprisingly low-tech at times \u2014 opposition politicians regularly turn on the television to hear embarrassing conversations of their telephone calls being aired to the public. It seems a bit of a throwback to the Soviet Union in some ways, rather than Pegasus and the other recent spyware that governments usually reach for.It\u2019s effective, though. Many conversations just don\u2019t happen over the phone, and we find another place to communicate where there\u2019s encryption, like Telegram.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Netflix. There seem to be 10 times more offerings in Latin America than the United States, including many movies that are blocked back home and that I can only rent on iTunes. I would urge anyone who wants to spend days watching good films not available in America to set his or her VPN to Colombia and have a look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cell Behind Barcelona Attack May Have Had Sights on Eiffel Tower", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the weeks before they carried out an attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona last summer, a cell of jihadists inspired by the Islamic State traveled repeatedly to France, where they bought a camera and recorded footage of the Eiffel Tower.Investigators estimate that the terrorist cell had enough precursor chemicals to make 200 to 250 kilograms, or 440 to 550 pounds, of TATP, according to the study.The Barcelona cell bought most of the ingredients for its homemade bombs on Aug. 1, 2 and 16, the study found. The two vans used in the attacks were rented on Aug. 16 for seven days, suggesting that the group planned to commit the attack that week.In the rubble of the property in Alcanar, investigators recovered a notebook inscribed with the name of Abdelbaki Es Satty, the oldest member of the cell and its presumed ringleader and recruiter. In a sheet inside the notebook, they found a handwritten note in Arabic describing the cell members as \u201csoldiers of the Islamic State in the land of al-Andalus,\u201d the term the militant group uses to refer to the Iberian Peninsula.Within hours of the first attack, and again after the second, Islamic State\u2019s news agency, Amaq, claimed credit, describing the attackers as \u201csoldiers of the Islamic State.\u201d The claim was repeated and amplified in numerous other ISIS media outlets, including their online magazine.Two other members of the Barcelona cell made an unexplained trip to Zurich in December 2016, and approximately a week before the attack, another member of the group, Driss Oukabir, made a nine-day trip to Morocco. When questioned, his relatives said they had found it odd that he did not stop by to see his father.The reasons for the trips remain unclear and they raise the possibility that one or more of the members of the cell traveled to make contact with ISIS operatives, the researchers say. What is known is that, during a trip to Paris, the cell members purchased a video camera and used it to film the Eiffel Tower. The same video, which was recovered in the debris, also shows Mohamed Hichamy, one of the members of the cell, standing in the safe house, holding TATP and saying, \u201cSpaniards, you are going to suffer.\u201dIn addition to the footage of the Eiffel Tower, a cellphone used by a member of the cell included searches on Google Maps for several locations in Spain, including the Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona and the Camp Nou soccer stadium, suggesting that these monuments might also have been targets.Spanish officials told their French counterparts that they had recovered the footage of the Eiffel Tower soon after the Barcelona attack last fall. According to the researchers, the French government determined that the cell may have intended to strike Paris, too, where the city recently decided to install a glass fence around the Eiffel Tower, in an effort to protect the landmark from small-arms and vehicular attacks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa, What Happened to My Car?", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAmazon\u2019s Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant is the Chatty Cathy of the tech world, a digital darling that consumers can\u2019t get enough of. It can tell chicken jokes, order pizza and turn off the kitchen faucet. So it\u2019s not surprising that Alexa has made the leap from the home to the car.But just as Alexa promises added hands-free convenience for drivers, researchers and engineers warn that it also opens new avenues for hacking, tracking and sonic attacks. Depending on how voice-activated assistants are connected, such hacks could range from annoying pranks like opening a car\u2019s windows in the rain to dangerous attacks like remotely unlocking a house\u2019s doors for a robbery.\u201cAs we make everything smarter and more connected,\u201d said Nadir Izrael, chief technology officer of the internet security firm Armis, \u201cwe end up creating a huge attack surface on devices, like cars, that weren\u2019t intended.\u201dCars are a highly lucrative target, said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer at Argus Cyber Security, which the automotive systems supplier Continental recently acquired. \u201cPeople are inside these vehicles moving at high speeds, and cars cost a significant amount of money. So how many Bitcoins would you pay a ransomware hacker?\u201dBut in those cases, voice commands are limited. They can\u2019t remotely start a car or open its windows. Siri can\u2019t even change the radio station.Alexa, on the other hand, is intended \u2014 via specific, preprogrammed commands \u2014 to interact with thousands of connected devices, performing tasks like turning on lights, opening door locks, disabling home security systems or even ordering a year\u2019s supply of toilet paper. And it\u2019s already connecting living rooms to cars.Automakers ranging from BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Nissan to start-ups like Byton have tapped into Alexa\u2019s appeal. Although voice assistants are increasingly becoming intertwined with new models, including those from Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, most current Alexa car skills are strictly one-way, from the home to the car, and use existing automotive smartphone applications.\u201cAlexa piggybacks on our app,\u201d said Denise Barfuss, a senior manager for connected services at Nissan. \u201cSo if it\u2019s 25 degrees outside, you can just tell Alexa to start the car\u201d from inside your house to warm it up, she said.Simple Alexa commands can flash the lights or honk the horn, Ms. Barfuss said, but remote instructions that alter the state of the car \u2014 such as locking the doors and starting the engine \u2014 also require a spoken PIN code.And even though voice bots like Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant can be taught to recognize different voices \u2014 well enough to cater to each family member\u2019s favored Pandora stations, for example \u2014 they do not offer any sort of biometric security, such as voice print analysis. As a result, Alexa\u2019s voice-recognition capabilities are not discerning enough for security purposes, according to Amazon. (A company spokesman noted, however, that Amazon had special teams dedicated to continually reviewing and updating the security of its software.)Without such measures, anyone who eavesdropped on a spoken PIN command could use it to unlock and get into a vehicle, leaving a victim to ask, \u201cAlexa, what happened to my car?\u201dSecurity experts are also concerned about more sophisticated cyberattacks involving voice assistants.\u201cThere are synthetic voice sound clips,\u201d said Gang Wang, assistant professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering. \u201cIt sounds like random noise to us, but to the machine it sounds like a specific command.\u201d So a seemingly innocuous sound, like an explosion in a YouTube video played on a nearby TV or tablet, could contain secret instructions.Other hacks have included ultrasonic commands that are beyond the range of human hearing but understood by voice bots. And even if they do establish biometric security features, Mr. Wang said, regenerative machine learning could use a recording of a person\u2019s voice to synthesize new commands that could fool them.The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company\u2019s Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase.Such convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford\u2019s supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel.Ford\u2019s setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn\u2019t automatically be able to unlock a home\u2019s front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner\u2019s smartphone (which they\u2019d have to steal, too).Adding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly.\u201cWhat gets added with the car is your specific location,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cYou can track where the car goes and at what times.\u201dIf compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user\u2019s purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon\u2019s servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system\u2019s \u2014 and the car\u2019s \u2014 security vulnerabilities.Ultimately, the car will simply understand when it\u2019s being spoken to.\u201cPeople will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,\u201d said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. \u201cSo security is going to have to continue to evolve with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
