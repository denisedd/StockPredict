{"Headline": "Trump, Citing Pakistan as a \u2018Safe Haven\u2019 for Terrorists, Freezes Aid", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would suspend nearly all security aid to Pakistan, an across-the-board freeze that is the most tangible sign yet of Washington\u2019s frustration with the country\u2019s refusal to crack down on terrorist networks operating there.The move underlines how swiftly relations with Pakistan have deteriorated since Mr. Trump took office. But it echoes several previous rifts between the countries over Pakistan\u2019s role as a sanctuary for extremist groups \u2014 a role that has poisoned Islamabad\u2019s relations with Washington since the terrorist attacks of September 2001.Administration officials emphasized that the freeze was temporary and could be lifted if Pakistan changed its behavior. The United States is urging the Pakistani government to cut off contact with militants and reassign intelligence agents with links to extremists, among other measures.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue the status quo has been working, so we are looking at changing it to advance our security objectives,\u201d said Brian H. Hook, the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning.Heather Nauert, the department\u2019s spokeswoman, said the administration was still working out the precise dollar amounts that would be frozen. Though the move was months in the planning, officials said the announcement was rushed by a few days to catch up to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on Monday, which drew a toxic reaction from Pakistan.The move also came after considerable internal debate, officials said. The Pentagon is worried that the Pakistani government could retaliate by denying access to routes in Pakistan that it uses to supply roughly 14,000 American troops deployed in neighboring Afghanistan.After Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, the foreign minister of Pakistan, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, said that there was a need to revisit the nature of its relations with the United States. In an interview with a local news network, he said the United States was acting like neither an ally nor a friend.The suspension includes about $1.1 billion in Coalition Support Funds, which the Pentagon provides to help defray the costs of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan. Under the freeze, the United States also will not deliver military equipment to the country. It had earlier held up $255 million in State Department military financing.Ms. Nauert said some exceptions could be made \u201con a case-by-case basis if determined to be critical to national security interests.\u201d Internal government talking points that were obtained by The New York Times said the suspension was \u201ca freeze, and does not reflect intent to reprogram funds at this time\u201d \u2014 meaning that the money will not be diverted to other uses.\u201cPakistan has the ability to get this money back in the future, but they have to take decisive action,\u201d Ms. Nauert said.The administration said that the freeze did not apply to civilian assistance programs. The United States has provided Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid since 2002, a program that ramped up sharply in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks as the United States viewed Pakistan as a key ally in fighting Islamic militants.Earlier on Thursday, the State Department announced that it had placed Pakistan on a special watch list for what it described as severe violations of religious freedoms. The designation was part of the administration\u2019s annual accounting of violations by countries as required by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.Attacks on religious minorities have increased in Pakistan in recent years, reflecting a growing religious intolerance and driven in part by a proliferation of religious schools funded by Saudi Arabia.\u201cThis is a great opening salvo, but I don\u2019t think it is enough to make Pakistan change its behavior, unless we have a Plan B,\u201d said C. Christine Fair, a professor who specializes in South Asia at the security studies program at Georgetown University.Still, Ms. Fair said the scale of the administration\u2019s action suggested it was serious about forcing a change. White House officials said they would consider further steps, including removing Pakistan from a list of major non-NATO allies of the United States \u2014 a move that would carry enormous symbolic significance for the relationship.Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said the decision \u201cindicates that the administration does have a step-by-step plan to indicate to Pakistan that business as usual is no longer possible.\u201dWhile Mr. Haqqani said that Pakistan might well retaliate by shutting off ground supply routes to Afghanistan, such a move would also carry costs for the Pakistanis, since they supply many of the trucks and other logistics for the supply operation.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said, \u201cWe have had no indication of anything like that.\u201dBut some analysts argued that while publicly complaining about Pakistan\u2019s lack of action against terrorist groups may feel satisfying, such accusations were deeply counterproductive.Richard G. Olson, a former special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Obama administration, noted that the American military effort in Afghanistan was heavily reliant on Pakistan\u2019s consent. Almost every military flight into Afghanistan, including those of attack aircraft, goes through Pakistani airspace. Most supplies travel along Pakistani roads and rails.\u201cOur choices in Afghanistan are already difficult, but if you want to make them even more difficult, continue to taunt the Pakistanis,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cThe Pakistanis could effectively shut down the war.\u201dPakistan closed ground supply routes to Afghanistan in the months after the raid that killed Bin Laden, and those supply lines were rerouted to the northern route. But the northern route is heavily dependent on Russian consent, and with relations between Washington and Moscow deteriorating, such consent is far from assured.Adam Goldman and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington and Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel and Other German Leaders Try, Again, to Form a Government", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat\u2019s the best-case situation, as leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats, their Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union, and their previous partners, the Social Democrats, sit down on Sunday for a new round of talks intended to hammer out the basis of a new government.Yet each side has its doubts, especially the Social Democrats, whose supporters remain unconvinced that a third government with the party that was previously its main rival is in its best interest. Here is a look at some of the issues that could prove to be the most divisive.The huge influx of migrants has emerged as a polarizing issue in Germany and contributed to the drop of 14 percentage points in support overall for the negotiating parties. Many of those voters switched to the far-right Alternative for Germany, which campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform.The Social Democrats support legislation that would allow Germany to admit qualified immigrants to fill thousands of openings in companies and factories. The official in charge of Germany\u2019s national labor agency has said the country will need 300,000 qualified immigrants annually to fill the gaps, because record employment has made it difficult to find enough workers. Conservatives are reluctant to back any new measures that would allow more foreigners to enter the country.The Social Democrats would like to replace the current mix of private and public providers with a universal system financed by taxpayers, similar to Britain\u2019s National Health Service. That would end what they see as effectively a two-class system, but Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives want to preserve the current system.All parties agree, however, on the need to improve care for nearly three million people, mostly older Germans who are dependent on care, either in their own homes or in facilities.Martin Schulz, the leader of the Social Democrats, has called for a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d by 2025, a notion that conservatives have rejected as unrealistic.One sticking point will be a common approach on changes to the eurozone, along the lines proposed by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who is seeking a shared budget and governing structure.Despite reluctance in her party, Ms. Merkel understands the need to maintain a strong Franco-German alliance.The German Constitution gives states jurisdiction over schools and universities within their boundaries, but the Social Democrats want to change that law, eliminating a byzantine financing structure.That, in turn, would let more federal money flow directly to schools, allowing them to hire more teachers and improve their infrastructure. Conservatives want to increase education spending, but within the framework of the current system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Bust a Chinese Mafia in the Country That Invented the Term", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Police officers in Italy swooped down on a Chinese mafia organization on Thursday, arresting 33 people on suspicion of running a criminal enterprise that dominated the transport of Chinese products in Europe, financed with money from prostitution, gambling and drugs.The mass arrests captivated attention in Italy, where the term mafia originated, and provided a glimpse into the extensive economic tentacles of Chinese gangsters in Europe.The police operation broke up \u201ca dangerous organization that had used force to take control of trucking, and was financed by its illegal activities,\u201d Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in a statement.\u201cBeing able to shed light on the mafia character of this group is almost incredible,\u201d Federico Cafiero De Raho, Italy\u2019s chief anti-mafia prosecutor, told journalists at a news conference in Florence. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unusual to be able to identify a complex Chinese mafia organization.\u201dFrancesco Nannucci, the chief of the Prato police department\u2019s investigative unit, called the investigation \u201cone of the most relevant against the Chinese mafia in Italy and in Europe.\u201d\u201cControlling transportation for the thousands of Chinese fast-fashion companies in Prato is an enormous power,\u201d Mr. Nannucci said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt means easy access to Europe. Being a strongman in Prato means being strong in Europe.\u201dThe authorities seized assets worth a few million euros, including 61 bank accounts and eight vehicles used to transport the items.The group\u2019s gangster hierarchy came from the eastern Chinese provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, the police said. The areas are well-known for enterprising criminals.A man identified as the group\u2019s leader, Zhang Naizhong, 57, was arrested early Thursday in a Prato hotel. Nicknamed the \u201cblack man\u201d by affiliates and \u201cboss of all bosses,\u201d reminiscent of the powerful Western mafia leaders, by prosecutors, he usually came to town once a week with his son to attend to his business, the police said.The evening before his arrest, the police said, he had visited businesses in Prato and used eight cars to avoid being followed or identified.In 2010, Mr. Zhang won a power battle among gangs that had shed blood in the streets Prato for years, and culminated with the killing of two young Chinese men with a machete in a restaurant.Mr. Zhang was then said to rule over a vast criminal ring that used threats and violence against Chinese business owners and profits from illegal activities such as prostitution, drug trafficking, extortion and gambling to build a transport company that won a near-monopoly in the movement of items for thousands of Chinese companies.Prato is home to around 4,500 Chinese companies that import textiles or accessories components from China and assemble them for sale at low- and mid-price retailers all over Europe.Since the early arrivals of Chinese migrants in Prato in the 1980s, the community has become one of the biggest in Europe.\u201cBusiness is business,\u201d said Stefano Becucci, a professor of sociology at Florence University and the author of several studies on Chinese mafia groups in Italy. \u201cCriminals go where the money is.\u201dMr. Becucci noted that until the 1990s, the most lucrative business for these rings was illegal immigration, but their interests moved to extortion from Chinese entrepreneurs and commercial activities, or requests of protection money on goods imported from China into Rome\u2019s large retail market.The first arrests for mafia in the Chinese community in Italy date to the early 1990s, Mr. Becucci said.\u201cIt is hard to penetrate these networks, because the Chinese communities are often closed and separate from the context they live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more closed they are, the easier it is for these phenomena to spread and victimize them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a professor of sociology at Florence University. He is Stefano Becucci, not Bocucci.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Court Closes Foundation of Aleksei Navalny, a Kremlin Critic", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Moscow court on Monday ordered the closing of a foundation supporting the activities of Aleksei A. Navalny, the country\u2019s leading opposition politician, moving quickly in a case filed only this month by the Justice Ministry.The court order came before a series of rallies in more than 90 Russian cities and towns, scheduled for Sunday and organized by Mr. Navalny and his supporters.The foundation, the Fifth Season of the Year, has been used by Mr. Navalny to collect donations that finance campaign materials, salaries and offices in 84 regions across Russia, among other weapons in his drive against corruption and the workings of the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin. More than 145,000 Russians have donated $4.9 million to the foundation over the past 13 months, Mr. Navalny says.In response, Mr. Navalny announced that he would turn his candidacy into a campaign for a boycott of the presidential election, and he called on his followers to take part in street protests. That, he added, was what led to the court case against his foundation.\u201cPutin was so scared by our announcement that we transform our campaign for presidency into a campaign for a boycott that he quickly created a special group to check our foundation,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in a video released last week.Mr. Navalny and others have noted that even though Mr. Putin\u2019s re-election is a foregone conclusion, the Kremlin would still like to see a high turnout, as that would cement his legacy as one of Russia\u2019s greatest leaders. In that context, a boycott becomes a very delicate issue for Mr. Putin, Mr. Navalny said.\u201cWe wanted to take part in the election, but they did not let us, so we will campaign against this election,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in the video. \u201cYou cannot consider Putin\u2019s reappointment an election.\u201dThe Justice Ministry said in court that the foundation had listed a wrong official address, that it was illegally spending money on Mr. Navalny\u2019s presidential campaign, and that it had violated a law regulating the use of personal data. The judge, Irina Afanasieva, reached her decision in less than three hours.\u201cWe have 30 days to appeal it,\u201d Leonid Volkov, Mr. Navalny\u2019s campaign manager, wrote on Facebook after the court\u2019s announcement. \u201cUntil then, we continue our work.\u201dMr. Navalny built his career on exposing graft in the higher echelons of the Russian government. Unlike many other Russian opposition politicians, he has openly accused Mr. Putin of involvement in corrupt activities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Adopts New Austerity Measures to Placate Creditors", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek lawmakers on Monday approved new measures demanded by international creditors, including cuts to benefits for large families and restrictions on trade unions, creating the basis for additional bailout funding.Addressing Parliament, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who backed the legislation, said the vote would move Greece a step closer to emerging from its third international bailout, which expires in August.\u201cWe are a breath away from the end of the program and the definitive end to the memorandums,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said, referring to the three loan agreements Greece has signed with foreign creditors since it verged on bankruptcy in 2010.\u201cThis gives hope and courage to millions of our fellow citizens who all these years have made large sacrifices and now finally see light and a way out,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said, referring to years of pension cuts and tax increases.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s political rival, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the New Democracy party, accused the government of \u201clies,\u201d saying the promise for a \u201cclean exit\u201d in August was baseless because foreign supervision of Greece\u2019s financial health would continue.Before the vote, about 20,000 demonstrators gathered in central Athens, the capital, for a mostly peaceful protest demonstration. The exception was a small group of hooded youths who hurled firebombs at police officers. The police responded by firing tear gas.There was no public transportation in the capital as workers walked off the job and unionists threatened to call more strikes in the coming weeks. Some public services, including state hospitals and schools, were disrupted as well, as teachers and doctors participated in brief walkouts in solidarity with unions.The legislation passed with 154 votes in the 300-seat Parliament, overcoming objections by lawmakers reluctant to impose yet more hardship on a nation struggling to return to growth after years of belt-tightening. Support for the legislation also overcame vehement opposition from labor unions, whose members took to the streets of the capital to denounce the government\u2019s \u201csavage austerity.\u201dBesides the 153 lawmakers who backed the legislation, an independent deputy supported the bill and said she would join Mr. Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza Party, strengthening his coalition\u2019s slim majority.Unlike some earlier austerity measures, the latest package does not further cut pensions or raise taxes. But it does reduce benefits to families with more than three children and requires unions to gather more votes from members before they can call strikes.The new measures also are aimed at eliminating what has become a chaotic arena for anti-austerity protests \u2014 property foreclosures at Greek courthouses. Now those proceedings can be conducted online, which avoids the threats and harassment faced by notaries, who had conducted the foreclosures in court.Greece\u2019s international creditors have demanded more austerity in exchange for at least 5 billion euros in bailout funds, possibly as much as 7 billion euros.Eurozone finance ministers are scheduled to meet on Jan. 22 to decide on the disbursement of the money. If satisfied with Greece\u2019s progress, they are also expected to discuss relief for the country\u2019s huge debt burden, which is nearly twice the size of its annual economic output.A deal to lighten Greece\u2019s debt would be a boon for Mr. Tsipras, who has faced scathing criticism for the compromises he has made to creditors since coming to power three years ago on a pledge to reduce austerity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump\u2019s Visit to Pennsylvania, G.O.P. Scrambles to Save a House Seat", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are scrambling to save a heavily conservative House seat in western Pennsylvania, dispatching President Trump to the district on Thursday while preparing a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to stave off another embarrassing special election defeat in a district that was gerrymandered to stay Republican.And Mr. Trump is loath to suffer another electoral humiliation, particularly in a district that he carried by 19 percentage points in 2016.So a constellation of conservative groups are planning an extensive intervention to carry the Republican nominee, Rick Saccone, a state representative and former Air Force officer, across the line in a House seat that has been in the party\u2019s hands for 16 years, but where internal polls from both parties now reveal a single-digit race.Mr. Trump will appear at an industrial equipment sales and repair company to trumpet both Mr. Saccone and the recently passed tax overhaul.Vice President Mike Pence will follow on Feb. 2, according to Republican officials familiar with the planning, attending a similar, policy-oriented event before hosting a fund-raiser for Mr. Saccone. And Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence both may make additional visits, according to party officials.National Republicans worry that Mr. Saccone, 59, is proving to be a lackluster candidate, an assessment that was reinforced when he raised only $200,000 as of the end of the year, nearly half of it in cash transfers from House lawmakers eager to preserve their majority.To prop him up, the House Republican campaign arm hosted a fund-raiser Wednesday evening in Washington with Mr. Saccone; Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee; and each of the Republican winners of special House elections last year.Mr. Saccone will return to Washington next month for a fund-raiser featuring the entire roster of House Republican leaders including Speaker Paul D. Ryan.Further, a group of well-financed outside Republican groups is planning to unleash a biting advertising campaign against Conor Lamb, the Democratic nominee and a Marine Corps veteran. A pair of conservative organizations have already broadcast about $700,000 worth of commercials in the district and the best-funded House \u201csuper PAC,\u201d the Congressional Leadership Fund, is preparing to go on the air next week with a spot blistering Mr. Lamb.\u201cWe will attack Conor Lamb, we will define Conor Lamb, and we will explain why he is a Nancy Pelosi rubber stamp,\u201d vowed Corry Bliss, who runs the Congressional Leadership Fund and had already opened two field offices in the district, referring to the House Democratic leader.But Mr. Lamb, a former prosecutor, may not be so easy to link to Ms. Pelosi.\u201cThey can throw anything they want at him, but he\u2019s already said he\u2019s not voting for Pelosi as speaker,\u201d said Marcel L. Groen, the Pennsylvania Democratic chairman.Mr. Lamb, 33, hails from a prominent Pennsylvania political family \u2014 his grandfather was once the Democratic leader in the State Senate \u2014 and has indicated he wants to run a local race.With the possible exception of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., few high-profile Democrats would help Mr. Lamb by dipping into the district, which includes affluent precincts around Pittsburgh and more working-class enclaves along the West Virginia and Ohio border.To date, the House Democratic campaign arm has kept its distance and is unlikely to pour money into the race, preferring to husband its resources for less Trump-friendly terrain up for grabs in November. But Mr. Lamb still outraised Mr. Saccone in the last quarter of 2017, bringing in more than $550,000.And some members of the Pennsylvania Democratic delegation are making the case for Mr. Lamb. A group of them hosted a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser for him in Washington on Wednesday.\u201cI\u2019m more bullish on our chances than I think the consensus,\u201d said Representative Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhile it would be an upset, we can win it in this environment. The Wisconsin results last night show that.\u201dAlready buffeted by the announcements last week by Representatives Ed Royce and Darrell Issa of their retirements from their highly competitive California districts, Republicans absorbed another body blow on Tuesday when Wisconsin Democrats captured a State Senate seat that Republicans had held for 17 years.In the state\u2019s first special election of 2018, Patty Schachtner, a Democrat and the medical examiner for St. Croix County, beat Representative Adam Jarchow, a Republican member of the State Assembly, by 11 points, flipping a seat in a rural district near the Minnesota border.\u201cEverything is in play now,\u201d Melanie Conklin, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a district that has been a very red district for a long time, and the numbers last night were very blue.\u201dGov. Scott Walker, the state\u2019s Republican chief executive, all but agreed.The defeat was ominous for Republicans chiefly because it came in the sort of exurban and rural stretch of the Midwest where Mr. Trump romped in 2016. Even as he won Wisconsin by less than a point, he carried St. Croix County, the population center of the district, by 17 percentage points.The day after her victory, Ms. Schachtner said she was overwhelmed by the results, barely able to keep track of the phone calls and emails coming in.When she first entered the race only months ago, the local Democratic Party was grateful but not confident that she could beat a Republican in the district.\u201cIt was, \u2018Thank you for stepping up,\u2019 that type of conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said the G.O.P. kind of owns this area, but it\u2019s good to have a name we know.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Delivered $80.2 Billion in Profits to the Treasury in 2017", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s economic stimulus campaign continued to generate large profits in 2017, helping to reduce the federal deficit, but the windfall is showing signs of tapering.The Fed has gradually increased its benchmark interest rate amid an improving economic picture and those higher rates increase what the Fed must pay on deposits that banks keep stashed at the Fed.The Fed also began last year to gradually reduce the portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage bonds it acquired after the 2008 crisis, reducing the amount of revenue the Fed gets from interest payments on those securities. Those holdings are the source of most of the Fed\u2019s revenues.The Fed\u2019s contribution to the government\u2019s coffers still remains well above pre-crisis levels.The Fed made an average annual contribution to the Treasury Department of $23 billion during the five years preceding the crisis. Since 2010, the average contribution has been $86 billion.The Fed\u2019s bond holdings comprise federal debt and securities issued by the government-owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By diving into the marketplace, the Fed created more competition, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates \u2014 and thus reducing the borrowing costs paid by businesses and consumers, as well as the federal government.The interest that the Fed collects on its investments is paid by the federal government, and then returned to the government. But this wash cycle still saves money because those interest payments would otherwise be made to the outside investors who would have purchased the bonds.\u201cIt\u2019s interest that the Treasury didn\u2019t have to pay to the Chinese,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed\u2019s chairman, told Congress back in 2011, when the annual windfalls were still new and surprising.Since the 2008 crisis, the Fed\u2019s earnings have saved the government more than $700 billion.The Fed earns outsized profits on its investment holdings because it does not face financing costs. It buys bonds with money that it creates. But the Fed does have expenses, and they are rising.The largest expense is a byproduct of the bond purchases. The Fed\u2019s buying spree flooded the banking system with reserves \u2014 the Fed bought bonds from the banks, and paid them with reserves.Before the crisis, the Fed raised rates by selling bonds to reduce the availability of reserves, which banks are required to hold in proportion to their holdings of customer deposits. But banks now hold plenty of excess reserves. Rather than reversing its bond purchases completely to drain those reserves, the Fed instead decided to raise rates by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.Last year the Fed spent $25.9 billion on those interest payments, more than double the amount that it spent in 2016 \u2014 and the cost will continue to rise as the Fed continues to raise interest rates.Some members of Congress have said the Fed is rewarding banks unnecessarily, and questions about the payments have become a staple feature of Congressional hearings with Fed leaders.The numbers published Wednesday are preliminary. The final numbers are due later this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fix the F.B.I. Don\u2019t Politicize It.", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, has begun clearing the Augean stables at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which should prompt a broader \u2014 and long overdue \u2014 cleanup of the government\u2019s sloppy intelligence operations.But he and Attorney General Jeff Sessions may face their greatest obstacle in the form of their president. Donald Trump\u2019s impulse to transform every activity of government into a partisan conflict undermines the difficult task of repairing a Justice Department that sorely needs it.That conflict of interest was one of many during the 2016 election that seemed to afflict Main Justice, as the Justice Department headquarters is known (and where I worked in the George W. Bush administration with Mr. Wray, whom I have known since law school). Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton in June 2016, while his wife was under investigation, created another appearance of a conflict of interest. Ms. Lynch\u2019s recusal led to the July news conference where James Comey announced that he would not seek charges against Hillary Clinton.In doing so, Mr. Comey violated longstanding department practice against publicly discussing the targets of investigations, and he seized authority from prosecutors on whether to indict Mrs. Clinton. To compound these errors, Mr. Comey announced he had reopened and then shut down again the investigation just a few weeks before the election.Justice Department alumni of both parties expressed shock at the politicization of law enforcement during the election. \u201cThis whole mess was the Justice Department\u2019s worst episode since Watergate,\u201d Laurence Silberman, a federal appeals court judge, wrote in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI doubt,\u201d he added, \u201cthe bureau will ever completely recover.\u201dBy attacking Mr. McCabe and by continuing to attack the F.B.I., Mr. Trump has clouded an overdue changing of the guard and has provoked resistance to reform efforts. Democrats can now fairly characterize his actions as politically motivated.Another opportunity for departmental reform comes in the debate over whether to release a Republican congressional memo that outlines abuses in electronic surveillance.In the memo, drawn from classified material, the staff of the House Intelligence Committee under Devin Nunes, Republican of California, apparently alleges that the Obama Justice Department sought a warrant for an electronic wiretap based on a dossier financed by the Clinton campaign and produced by Fusion GPS with information surreptitiously provided by Russian intelligence. If descriptions of its contents are true, the memo details a shocking collapse of standards in one of the government\u2019s most important jobs: collecting foreign intelligence to stop terrorist attacks and enemy spies.The president has the constitutional authority to classify and declassify secrets. President Trump could allow the Justice Department to negotiate with the House over release of the Nunes memo, so as to protect intelligence sources and methods. An agreement could also provide the starting point for review and restructuring of the department\u2019s national security division and its management of electronic surveillance.But again, the president seems unable to allow good government to proceed freely. Instead, he has claimed for months that the Obama administration hatched a conspiracy to illegally eavesdrop on him and, according to reports, has decided to approve release of the Nunes memo even before reviewing it. Again, Mr. Trump risks the prospects for departmental reform to score political points against Mr. Obama.These episodes reveal a shortcoming in Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the presidency. He has the constitutional power to push out Mr. McCabe and to release the Nunes memo. Yet doing so is a serious political misuse of that power.Machiavelli, the father of modern thinking about executive power, described ideal princes as quick to execute the law and able to act \u201cat a stroke.\u201d In Federalist 70, Alexander Hamilton extended the insight to argue that the executive should act with \u201cdecision, activity, secrecy and dispatch.\u201d The founders believed that presidents advance the public good when they draw upon their undefined powers to respond to emergencies.Mr. Trump acts at odds with the founders\u2019 vision. Rather than conserving his authority for true crises, he seems intent on creating and prolonging false ones. This may appeal to his base, but he is eroding the presidency\u2019s constitutional power and political authority. He may not find them there when necessity forces him to confront a real challenge, as when surely one comes.John Yoo is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.Advertisement"}

His oppressive conduct is alienating the very sources he should be trying to attract.To revive investor confidence, Prince Mohammed should consider several safeguards. He should replace the family checks and balances he swept away with a due process and rule of law, which applies to royals and commoners alike. The corruption commission he unveiled on the eve of his purge should be a regulator, upholding international standards of corporate governance, not his personal star chamber skewing the rules for his cronies.Investors and neighbors crave predictability, stability and the confidence that comes with a sound regulatory system. All three are what made Dubai. Properly carried out, such a system would please bankers who might welcome the chance to retrieve debts or land from princes that act like robber barons.Prince Mohammed needs institutional heft. He cannot haul the kingdom out of its oil dependency and create a diverse economy alone. His teams of foreign management consultants lack a bureaucracy and a local base. Rather than alienate family elders with decades of experience raising international finance, he should harness their expertise.For now Prince Mohammed is offering more personal liberty and relief from the scowls of the religious police as compensation for the introduction of taxes. But as Abdullah, the previous king, recognized, more taxation \u2014 whether direct or indirect \u2014 will stoke demands for broader representation.Greater accountability should be welcome. It might also ensure that the sums the prince accrued from the purge go into the country\u2019s purse, not his personal account.

He would not say where the woman worked in the government, what her ties were to the recipient of the money or to which country the funds were sent.\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that her employment was in any way related to her activities,\u201d Assistant Commissioner Willing said at a news conference, while reassuring the public that there was no impending security threat as a result of the arrest.The police accused the woman, who was identified as Linda Merhi, 40, of transferring \u201ca little over\u201d 30,000 Australian dollars, or around $24,000, to the Islamic State. Assistant Commissioner Willing said the woman would be charged with five counts of intentionally collecting and making funds available to a terrorist organization. He said the arrest was part of Operation Peqin, a continuing police effort to identify and curb terrorist activity.The case is not the first one of the kind in Australia. A 16-year-old student and her 20-year-old male friend were arrested in 2016 on charges that they helped raise money for the Islamic State, a case that cast a national spotlight on the issue of terrorist financing in the country.

Johnson, to be in charge of a new investigations unit that will look into the operation of city agencies.In an interview, Mr. Torres said that between 10 and 15 professional investigators, possibly including former prosecutors, would be hired and that the committee would use them to conduct its own inquiries.Among the areas of possible investigative interest, according to Mr. Torres: \u201cThe abuse of placards. The use of eminent domain. The disposition of public land. Deed restriction. The disbursement of city subsidies,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of it is on the table.\u201dIn general, oversight hearings conducted by the Council in recent years have been in response to issues raised by the Department of Investigations, the city\u2019s comptroller, the press or outside groups, not the fruits of its own discoveries.\u201cThe message here is that it\u2019s a new day in City Council oversight,\u201d Mr. Torres, 29, said. \u201cNewton\u2019s first law of motion applies to the physics of government. An object will remain at rest unless acted upon by an outside force.\u201dHe said he viewed his new role, which is expected to be formally announced Thursday along with other Council committee assignments for the next four years, as focused on prodding a \u201ccomplacent bureaucracy\u201d to better provide city services and dig \u201cdeep into the operational failures of city government.\u201dThe unit is to be housed in the Council\u2019s oversight and investigations committee, with Mr. Torres as the new committee chairman.

{"Headline": "Vaping Can Be Addictive and May Lure Teenagers to Smoking, Science Panel Concludes", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A national panel of public health experts concluded in a report released on Tuesday that vaping with e-cigarettes that contain nicotine can be addictive and that teenagers who use the devices may be at higher risk of smoking.The new report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is the most comprehensive analysis of existing research on e-cigarettes. The report also cited conclusive proof that the devices are safer than traditional smoking products and may help smokers quit, citing conclusive proof that switching can reduce smokers\u2019 exposure to deadly tar, dangerous chemicals and other carcinogens.But it stopped short of declaring that e-cigarettes are safe, noting there are no long-term scientific studies of the devices\u2019 addictive potential or their effects on the heart, lungs or on reproduction.The panel found evidence among studies it reviewed that vaping may prompt teenagers or young adults to try regular cigarettes, putting them at higher risk for addiction, but that any significant linkage between e-cigarettes and long-term smoking has not been established. It said it was unable to determine whether young people were just trying cigarettes or becoming habitual smokers.\u201cWhen it got down to answering the questions about what the impacts on health are, there is still a lot to be learned,\u201d said David Eaton, of the University of Washington, who led the committee that reviewed existing research and issued the report. \u201cE-cigarettes cannot be simply categorized as either beneficial or harmful.\u201dThe report was commissioned in 2016, after the F.D.A. gained the authority to regulate tobacco products that had previously been outside its jurisdiction, such as e-cigarettes and cigars.Mitch Zeller, head of the agency\u2019s tobacco division, said the committee was assigned to assess the existing science, and to point out gaps in research. The report will aid the agency in its review of applications for lower-risk tobacco products and the potential harm or benefits those pose to individuals and the public.On Wednesday, an F.D.A. advisory panel will review an application from Philip Morris International for iQOS, an electronic device that, unlike e-cigarettes, contains tobacco in a stick that the company says heats it but does not burn it. It releases nicotine vapor, which the company says is less hazardous than smoke. If approved, Philip Morris would be the first company allowed by the government to claim its product is less harmful than cigarettes.Also this week, on Friday, the agency\u2019s new nicotine steering committee will hold a public hearing on over-the-counter therapeutic products, among them gums, patches and lozenges, designed to help smokers quit.Cessation was one area where the committee\u2019s report did give the booming e-cigarette industry some good news. It pointed out the benefits for smokers trying to quit. But people who continue to smoke cigarettes, alternating with e-cigarettes, do not gain the same health benefits, the committee said. That\u2019s especially important given that most adults who vape also still smoke or use other tobacco products. The report also said the evidence was limited on whether e-cigarettes were effective for quitting smoking.While there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes or their components cause cancer, the committee recommended more long-term research. Some e-cigarettes contain chemicals and metals whose long-term effects \u2014 including on pregnancy \u2014 also need further study, the committee said.Smoking rates among adults and teenagers have declined significantly over the last few decades. In 2015, the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has statistics, about 37 million Americans, 15 percent of adults aged 18 and older, smoked cigarettes. The number has declined from nearly 21 percent of every 100 adults in 2005; and 42 percent in 1965.With that decline, the e-cigarette industry has emerged as a potential substitute and Big Tobacco has been among the device developers enjoying new profits from the tobacco alternatives. Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo tobacco analyst, predicted the industry will grow about 15 percent to $5.1 billion in retail sales in the United States, in 2018.The vaping industry, as well as traditional tobacco companies, are gearing up for a lengthy fight with the F.D.A. over the campaign by the agency\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, to slash levels of nicotine in traditional cigarettes to nonaddictive or minimally addictive levels.Dr. Gottlieb is expected to issue an initial proposal, calling for public comment on lower nicotine levels, in the near future.The new report reflects the complexity of the issues surrounding e-cigarettes and the balancing act regulators face over the pros and cons of the alternatives to conventional cigarettes.Adam Leventhal, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, and an author of the report, said his group did an exhaustive literature search, reviewing all studies on youths and e-cigarette use from around the world. Of those, 10 studies were deemed strong enough to address the question. But they did not show that using e-cigarettes caused teens to move on to tobacco, only that the use of e-cigarettes was associated with later smoking of at least one traditional cigarette. The report noted that more than 11 percent of all high school students \u2014 nearly 1.7 million youths \u2014 reported using e-cigarettes within the past month.\u201cThe evidence was substantial that this association was consistent across a number of research methodologies, age ranges, locations, and research groups in and outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said.This conclusion is at odds with the findings of the British Royal College of Physicians, which asserts that e-cigarettes are not a gateway to smoking.\u201cConcerns about e-cigarettes helping to recruit a new generation of tobacco smokers through a gateway effect are, at least to date, unfounded,\u201d the organization notes on its website.More intriguing was the newest report\u2019s finding of moderate evidence that youths who use e-cigarettes before trying tobacco are more likely to become more frequent and intense smokers.The authors of the new report cite conclusive evidence that vaping can be addictive, and that exposure to nicotine from e-cigarettes is highly variable, depends on the characteristics of the device, as well as how it is used. They also cited conclusive proof that in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially toxic substances.In terms of second-hand vapor, the committee said there was conclusive evidence that e-cigarette use increases airborne concentrations of particulate matter and nicotine indoors.The report concluded that much of the current research on e-cigarettes is flawed, either in methodology or because of industry-financed bias. In addition, the levels of nicotine and other chemicals, including metals, vary in e-cigarettes from brand to brand.\u201cAnd for kids who initiate on e-cigarettes, there\u2019s a great chance of intensive use of cigarettes. As the regulator, we\u2019ve got to factor all that in,\u201d Mr. Zeller said.Several major tobacco companies that produce e-cigarettes declined to comment on the report. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company issued a statement saying it was encouraged by the report\u2019s findings, and highlighted the committee\u2019s point that e-cigarettes \u201care likely to be far less harmful than conventional cigarettes.\u201dBut public health advocates who objected to the July delay said this report gave them further concern.\u201cWhat the report demonstrates is that despite the popularity of e-cigarettes, little is known about their overall health effects, and there is wide variability from product to product,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThat makes the case even stronger for F.D.A. regulation.\u201dThe vaping industry was cautiously optimistic about the report. Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit that advocates for vapor products, said the findings were consistent with those reached by the Royal College of Physicians and other institutions in Britain that have issued reports indicating e-cigarettes are less dangerous than traditional smoking and help with cessation.\u201cIn the wake of this report, it is more apparent than ever that true leadership is needed in public health to ensure that adult smokers have access to truthful information about the benefits of switching to smoke-free products,\u201d he said.As for the F.D.A., Dr. Gottlieb said the report would play a critical role.\u201cWe need to put novel products like e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to fully evaluate their risks and maximize their potential benefits,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Jeff Immelt, who took over from Mr. Welch and recently handed the torch to Mr. Flannery, pruned the financial-services arm aggressively after the 2008 financial crisis.G.E. sold or spun off its reinsurance operations between 2004 and 2006 but remained on the hook for certain risks, including long-term care policies. With people living longer and health care costs rising, G.E.\u2019s exposure has climbed sharply. Hence the latest hit to earnings and the company\u2019s plan to bolster its insurance reserves by $15 billion over seven years.The \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d charge, as Mr. Flannery called it on Tuesday, raises the question of whether time bombs lurk elsewhere. GE Capital last year suspended dividends to its parent, which had been projected at some $4 billion over 2017 and 2018. Mr. Flannery said the subsidiary can finance itself, but with the charge boosting its debt-to-equity ratio to 7.1 times from 4.6 times, the risk is now that GE Capital could become a drain on its parent.G.E.\u2019s stock is down more than 40 percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 23 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.

Separating businesses prevents them from endangering each other, which makes a breakup or separate listings for the group\u2019s power, health care and aviation businesses a serious possibility. G.E. took a step in that direction last year by merging its oil and gas division with Baker Hughes. Yet analysts at Cowen reckon G.E.\u2019s parts are worth no more than $15 a share, less than its current stock price, making the financial benefits questionable.

{"Headline": "Democrats Outline Demands as Threat of Shutdown Looms", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate returns on Wednesday with its Republican majority down to one seat and buoyed Democrats issuing a full list of demands \u2014 such as funding children\u2019s health care and protecting young undocumented immigrants \u2014 just weeks before another possible government shutdown.Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate will meet on Wednesday with White House officials to try to come to terms on a deal to raise strict limits on military and domestic spending before Jan. 19, when the current stopgap spending bill expires.If negotiations break down, the government could run out of money \u2014 just as President Trump marks his first year in office.Democratic demands are ambitious, topped by a legislative shield for the young undocumented immigrants whose Obama-era protection from deportation was ended by Mr. Trump. They are also pushing for broader intervention in the opioid epidemic, a boost for veterans\u2019 care, disaster relief to hurricane-stricken areas, and financing for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201cNothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said in an interview on Tuesday.Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, cast protection for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children as a \u201cmoral issue,\u201d saying that resolving the fate of the so-called Dreamers was a prerequisite for enacting any long-term spending plan.And Mr. Trump is looking for a fight. On Tuesday he goaded Democrats on the immigration issue.\u201cDemocrats are doing nothing for DACA \u2014 just interested in politics,\u201d the president wrote, using the acronym for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era initiative that he rescinded. \u201cDACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems, will start \u2018falling in love\u2019 with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS.\u201dDemocrats are under intense pressure from immigration rights activists to pass longstanding legislation, called the Dream Act, which would shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation and create for them a path to citizenship.More than 14,000 young immigrants have lost their protection under the DACA program since Mr. Trump ended it in September, according to Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, the executive director of United We Dream, an advocacy group. At the time, Mr. Trump said he was giving Congress six months to draft legislation codifying the program, setting a March deadline. Republicans say there is no urgency.But immigrants\u2019 rights activists say they cannot wait.Immigrants who have lost their protection \u201ccan be caught when they are going to school, walking around their neighborhood, going to work,\u201d Ms. Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cPeople are living in daily fear that they could be detained and arrested.\u201dSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has promised a vote if a bipartisan group of senators can reach agreement on a measure that would extend protection from deportation while also beefing up border security, a key demand of Republicans.But Democrats fear that a stand-alone immigration measure could die in the House or be vetoed by the president. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said Democrats had more leverage if protections were included in a spending package.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help us to pass the Dream Act and have it be a separate bill that never makes it to the president\u2019s desk or gets vetoed on the president\u2019s desk,\u2019\u2019 he said.The arrival on Wednesday of Doug Jones, the newly elected Democrat of Alabama, leaves Republicans with an exceedingly narrow Senate majority, 51 to 49. The Senate\u2019s major legislative accomplishment of last year, a far-reaching overhaul of the tax code, was muscled through using procedural maneuvers that allowed for a simple majority, party-line victory.But Republicans cannot use such maneuvers on a spending bill, which will require 60 votes for passage. That gives Democrats an advantage, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.\u201cRepublicans know that a government shutdown falls on their back, because they\u2019re in charge of House, Senate and the president, and for the first time they need Democrats to accomplish their goals,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.Wednesday\u2019s meeting is supposed to focus on spending levels, which were fixed in the 2011 legislation that ended another fiscal showdown. It will include Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and his liaison to Congress, Marc Short.Both Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would use the session to insist on \u201cparity,\u201d meaning that military and domestic spending must be increased by the same amount. Republicans are far more focused on building up the military.\u201cThis idea that we\u2019ve got to increase domestic spending dollar for dollar, it has no basis in reality,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a way to try to use the military to blackmail the government to spend more money domestically.\u201d\u201cIf they have the votes within their caucus they can do whatever they want,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, referring to Republicans. \u201cThey have the ability to keep the government open, to put forth their valueless priorities. And so why are they accusing us of holding the Defense Department hostage?\u201dThe 2018 fiscal year began in October, but lawmakers have struggled to inch forward toward a long-term deal to fund the government. The lack of an agreement on raising the spending limits has essentially stalled the process, and a deal to raise those caps has so far proved elusive for Mr. Trump and congressional leaders.In one case last year, a planned White House meeting fell apart after Mr. Trump took to Twitter to attack Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who promptly pulled out of the planned gathering.And in recent weeks, as Republicans raced to pass their sweeping tax overhaul, the atmosphere on Capitol Hill was hardly conducive for a bipartisan deal.Shortly before Christmas, the House and Senate agreed on the stopgap spending bill that is keeping the government open through Jan. 19, punting other fights into the new year.\u201cIt never seems to get any easier, right?\u201d Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, said at the time. \u201cJanuary\u2019s going to be a bear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Yorkers May Face Another Tax Increase, but From Within", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey described a fresh financial catastrophe to accompany the rewrite from Washington \u2014 but this one, they said, would come from within.The issue is something called conformity, or the widespread linkage between state and federal tax codes. Conformity is designed to make filing easier for taxpayers and enforcement easier for revenue agencies, said Robert Zahradnik, who studies state fiscal policy at the Pew Charitable Trusts.Of the 41 states that levy a personal income tax, nearly all of them structure at least parts of their tax codes around the federal one, Mr. Zahradnik said.But conformity \u2014 under normal circumstances an administrative balm \u2014 becomes a headache under the new federal tax plan, which enacts the most sweeping changes to the tax code in decades, Mr. Zahradnik said. Those changes are forcing states to reassess longstanding practices of intertwining their tax codes with Washington\u2019s.Officials say that unless New York changes its tax code, state taxpayers could see their tax burden increase by $1.5 billion \u2014 potentially worsening the pain to New Yorkers already dealing with the curbing of state and local tax deductibility.In particular, New York\u2019s legislators are worried about a stipulation in the state\u2019s tax code that requires any taxpayer who takes the federal standard deduction also to take the state one. New York is one of at least nine states with a similar requirement, said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.That rule could pose a problem under the new federal tax plan, which nearly doubled the federal standard deduction. New York\u2019s standard deduction, meanwhile, has not changed. Officials worry that many New Yorkers would opt to take the newly generous federal standard deduction, but would therefore also be roped into taking New York\u2019s now comparatively stingy one, leaving them on the hook for thousands of dollars more in taxable income. A report from the state\u2019s department of taxation and finance estimated that the requirement alone could generate $44 million in additional revenue for the state.Another state stipulation links some New Yorkers\u2019 eligibility for the standard deduction to their federal personal exemptions \u2014 exemptions that the new federal law has eliminated. That could increase New Yorkers\u2019 state tax liability by more than $800 million, the report said.Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, a Democrat from Westchester County who has introduced similar legislation in her chamber, said continued conformity would create a \u201cwindfall off the backs of taxpayers, inappropriately.\u201dThe move to extricate the state and the federal tax codes has generated unusual consensus among the notoriously divided State Legislature. The Senate bill passed the chamber unanimously. But it has also again laid bare the evergreen political fissions in Albany.While Democratic senators took the floor to cast the bill as yet another rebuttal to an unfair tax plan from conservatives in Washington, Republicans suggested that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had deliberately neglected to propose any decoupling in his budget address, as a stealthy way of raising revenue.The governor\u2019s aides have flatly rejected that accusation. In a statement, Mr. Cuomo said he was continuing to discover new ways the federal tax bill would hurt New Yorkers, and that he would propose legislation to address the effect of the coupled tax system.Other states with coupled tax codes have moved to disentangle as well. Idaho, Michigan and Nebraska have all begun to separate their tax codes from the federal one in some way, Mr. Hicks said.But tax experts said the variation among individual states\u2019 tax codes, and their individual financial situations, makes it impossible to predict if all states will follow suit. Some states that see increased revenue may choose to keep the extra funds, to plug other fiscal holes, said Kirk Stark, a taxation law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. (New York is facing down a $4.4 billion budget shortfall.) Other states might actually see a decrease in revenue, depending on where and how their tax codes conform to the federal one.However states decide to respond, Mr. Zahradnik said, it is clear the federal tax rewrite is forcing them to examine their own policies to an extent not seen in decades.\u201cMajor tax reform hasn\u2019t happened in so long that there hasn\u2019t necessarily been a motivation for states to change their approach,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s only when the federal government does something, then states are forced to react and make some decisions,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is the biggest example of that in some time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saucy App Knows China\u2019s Taste in News. The Censors Are Worried.", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 One of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups got that way by using artificial intelligence to satisfy Chinese internet users\u2019 voracious appetite for news and entertainment. Every day, its smartphone app feeds 120 million people personalized streams of buzzy news stories, videos of dogs frolicking in snow, GIFs of traffic mishaps and listicles such as \u201cThe World\u2019s Ugliest Celebrities.\u201dNow the company is discovering the risks involved, under China\u2019s censorship regime, in giving the people exactly what they want.The makers of the popular news app Jinri Toutiao unveiled moves this week to allay rising concerns from the authorities. Last week, the Beijing bureau of China\u2019s top internet regulator accused Toutiao of \u201cspreading pornographic and vulgar information\u201d and \u201ccausing a negative impact on public opinion online,\u201d and it ordered that updates to several popular sections of the app be halted for 24 hours.In response, the app\u2019s parent company, Beijing Bytedance Technology, took down or temporarily suspended the accounts of more than 1,100 bloggers that it said had been publishing \u201clow-quality content\u201d on the app. It also replaced Toutiao\u2019s \u201cSociety\u201d section with a new section called \u201cNew Era,\u201d which is heavy on state media coverage of government decisions.The episode points to the fine line that Toutiao\u2019s creators must walk.Despite China\u2019s famously strict censorship, online news is a big business there. More than 610 million people in the country gained access to some news on the internet in 2016, according to official statistics.Suan Lin, a 24-year-old private equity analyst in Shanghai, said that she normally has to search high and low online to find articles about the Chinese historical dramas she watches on television. But Toutiao delivers, she said.\u201cOnce you\u2019re on it,\u201d she said, \u201cyou just can\u2019t stop.\u201dIn Toutiao\u2019s case, one of the accounts that were suspended this week had posted a saucy video of a woman in a short skirt. It got 57,000 views. Another suspended account had recently put up a post titled \u201cThe World\u2019s Ugliest Celebrities, Michael Jackson Is Ranked First, You Won\u2019t Want to Eat After Reading This.\u201dAs Toutiao\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed, Bytedance has become a darling of Silicon Valley investors such as Sequoia Capital. The company, which is currently valued at $20 billion, has been in talks with existing backers to raise new financing that would value the company at more than $30 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public.Jinri Toutiao, whose name means \u201ctoday\u2019s headlines\u201d in Chinese and is pronounced JING-er TOE-tee-yow, aggregates content from various sources and looks much like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed. But instead of displaying articles and videos based on what your friends have shared, the app does so based on what you have previously read and watched on the app.If you click on articles about iPhones, then Toutiao will feed you more tech coverage. After you watch a few cooking videos, the app will fetch you more clips of people wrapping dumplings and braising chicken\u2019s feet.This approach has helped Toutiao thrive amid China\u2019s heavily controlled environment for social media. Instead of policing the sharing activity of tens of millions of users, the company needs only to calibrate and adjust its centralized recommendation software.But it also needs to make sure the app\u2019s content does not cross the lines of censors. That is a huge task, particularly given that the overwhelming majority of content on Toutiao is produced by individual bloggers, not professional news organizations or other institutions. Ms. Liu said at last month\u2019s conference in Beijing that 90 percent of the app\u2019s content comes from blogger accounts. Toutiao has around 1.2 million content-producing accounts in total.According to Bytedance, every piece of content is automatically screened to check that it is acceptable before appearing on Toutiao. But once something has attracted more views, the system applies a more sophisticated screening algorithm. Certain material is also examined by humans as a final check.Bytedance also takes more overt steps to stay on the right side of the authorities. Important updates from the government are sometimes pinned to the top of a user\u2019s feed. That can lead to awkward juxtapositions \u2014 between, say, a state media write-up on President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent decisions and a photo slide show on six women who are \u201cso beautiful that rich businessmen immediately became attracted to them,\u201d as the piece\u2019s headline puts it.Despite Toutiao\u2019s popularity, some in China share that view. Yang Sun, a 26-year-old financial analyst in Shanghai, decried the app\u2019s sensationalist headlines.\u201cIt should absolutely be taken offline,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cTotally deserves it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how Bytedance screens content uploaded to its Jinri Toutiao news app. All content gets screened by a basic computer algorithm. It is not the case that content is not screened if it is seen by only a handful of people. The incorrect information came from a comment by Wei-Ying Ma, head of Toutiao\u2019s artificial intelligence lab, who told a Beijing conference last month that, \u201cIf there\u2019s a video that one or two people watch, we don\u2019t care.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Trump Likes Drug Price Negotiations; His Nominee for Health Secretary Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Alex M. Azar II, President Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, said Tuesday that he was wary of proposals for the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, an idea endorsed by Mr. Trump in the 2016 campaign.But Mr. Azar said that in some situations, he was willing to look at proposals to negotiate prices for a limited number of medicines.He made the comments at a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, where he tried to allay the concerns of some Democrats who asserted that he would be biased in favor of pharmaceutical companies because he had worked for a decade as a top executive at Eli Lilly, the company in Indiana that sells drugs for diabetes, erectile dysfunction and schizophrenia, among other conditions.Mr. Azar\u2019s remarks on drug price negotiations were carefully circumscribed and somewhat ambiguous \u2014 an approach that allowed him to get through the hearing largely unscathed.If Medicare negotiates drug prices, he said, patients might have less access to some medicines because the government would probably establish a list of preferred products.\u201cFor the government to negotiate there, we would have to have a single national formulary that restricted access to all seniors for medicines,\u201d Mr. Azar told the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we want to go there in restricting patient access.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Azar said, \u201cit\u2019s worth looking at\u201d proposals to allow price negotiations for drugs in Part B of Medicare. Under this part of the program, patients receive cancer drugs and other medications, often by infusion or injection, in doctor\u2019s offices and hospital outpatient clinics.Mr. Azar, who worked for six years in the administration of President George W. Bush, is expected to win confirmation, with support from Republicans and perhaps a few Democrats, who view him as a pragmatic problem solver rather than an ideologue. He would take charge of a cabinet department that spends more than a trillion dollars a year providing health insurance to more than 130 million Americans.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, asked Mr. Azar whether he would support cuts in Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security to offset increases in the federal budget deficit that would be caused by the recently passed tax legislation.\u201cThe president has stated his opposition to cuts to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security,\u201d Mr. Azar replied. \u201cHe said that in the campaign, and I believe he remains steadfast in his views on that. He\u2019s made that commitment. I will live up to that if I\u2019m confirmed.\u201dBut like many Republicans, Mr. Azar said that cuts in the growth of federal benefit programs were not really cuts if federal spending on the programs continued to increase.Democrats kept returning to the question of drug prices. Mr. Azar said that the expertise he acquired in the pharmaceutical industry would help him rein in drug costs as a federal official.\u201cAcross the board,\u201d he said, \u201cdrug prices are too high. Insulin prices are too high. All drug prices are too high in this country.\u201dDemocrats were generally skeptical, based on Lilly\u2019s record during Mr. Azar\u2019s time at the company.\u201cThe price of Lilly\u2019s bone-growth drug Forteo, used to treat osteoporosis, more than doubled on Mr. Azar\u2019s watch,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee. In the same period, Mr. Wyden said, the company more than doubled prices for other drugs including Humalog, used to treat diabetes, and Strattera, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Mr. Wyden asked Mr. Azar if, as head of Lilly\u2019s operations in the United States, he had ever approved a reduction in the price of a Lilly drug.Mr. Azar avoided a direct answer and blamed \u201cthe system.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that there is any drug price of a branded product that has ever gone down from any company on any drug in the United States because every incentive in this system is toward higher prices,\u201d Mr. Azar said, adding: \u201cNo one company is going to fix that system. That\u2019s why I want to be here working with you.\u201dMr. Azar said he saw no need for the government to negotiate prices for drugs covered by Part D of Medicare, which pays for pills and other products that patients can give themselves and purchase from neighborhood drugstores and mail-order pharmacies.Medicare\u2019s Part D drug benefit is delivered entirely by private companies under contract with the government. These companies and their agents, known as pharmacy benefit managers, negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Mr. Azar said he did not believe the government could get lower prices by negotiating directly with drug companies.A 2003 law prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from interfering in negotiations between drug manufacturers and insurers that provide drug coverage under Part D of Medicare. \u201cYou would not get better pricing by removing\u201d that prohibition, Mr. Azar said.In the 2016 campaign and since taking office, Mr. Trump has said that Medicare could save large sums by negotiating directly with drug companies. But drug companies adamantly oppose that idea, and Mr. Trump has not taken steps to translate that into practice.Asked specifically if Medicare should negotiate drug prices, Mr. Azar said: \u201cIn Part D, we do significant negotiation through pharmacy benefit managers that get the best rates of any commercial payers. We don\u2019t do that in Part B, which is where we have physician-administered drugs. We basically pay sales price plus 6 percent or some other number.\u201dAs an alternative, Mr. Azar said he supported proposals to link the pricing of prescription drugs to an assessment of how well they work for patients. Under such arrangements, known as value-based pricing, insurers would pay more for medicines that were highly effective and less for those that did not work well.Mr. Azar also said he supported an agency created by the Affordable Care Act to test novel ways of delivering and paying for health care. And he said that some of the experiments could require doctors and hospitals to participate. Republicans in Congress have generally opposed mandatory participation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andreas Gursky Is Taking Photos of Things That Do Not Exist", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "The German photographer\u2019s latest work includes images of digitally created scenes and spaces. Are these the works he will be remembered by?Supported byLONDON \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her three predecessors sit in an orderly row; between them, these four figures have led Germany since 1974. Pictured through a window and from behind, they gaze at a huge abstract painting on the wall in front of them.Mr. Gursky set the record for a single photograph at auction in 2011 when one of his supersize images, \u201cRhine II,\u201d sold for $4.3 million. The Hayward exhibition includes this and other famous Gursky views from the 1990s: a sprawling Paris apartment building, a 99-cent store, swarms of traders on stock exchange floors. Striking in their scale and resolution, they show humankind dwarfed by nature, industry, finance and the consumer society.In recent years, Mr. Gursky has set out to test the boundaries of photography by composing works almost entirely in the studio, digitally creating spaces and scenes that never existed. The question is whether these are works that he will be remembered by.In an interview at the Hayward before the opening, Mr. Gursky sat between two of his giant new compositions, both of them inspired by pictures he took with his smartphone. Placid and measured in his words, he wore a navy sweater and a string bracelet not normally seen on the wrist of a 63-year-old man. Speaking in English and occasionally reverting to German, with a translator on hand, he engaged in a wide-ranging conversation about art and success \u2014 and his passion for techno music.Mr. Gursky began by explaining his recent output. \u201cI\u2019m just interested in making images,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, you have to reinvent yourself.\u201d He pointed out that he made no more than eight images a year, and that they took time to produce.Those \u201ccompletely constructed\u201d works of recent years were among Mr. Gursky\u2019s best, Mr. Rugoff said, because he was establishing a dialogue with abstract art and composing pictures the way a painter would.From the very birth of the discipline, Mr. Rugoff said, \u201cpeople were doing darkroom tricks and making things appear in photography that weren\u2019t there.\u201d\u201cThis medium, which we, for official purposes like passports and school IDs, trust to be an accurate picture of the world, has always been something that can be lent to fiction as well as to fact,\u201d he explained. \u201cAndreas is not a journalist doing reportage.\u201dOther specialists expressed a preference for Mr. Gursky\u2019s earlier work.Quentin Bajac, the chief curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 where Mr. Gursky\u2019s retrospective in 2001 gave the photographer a major career boost \u2014 said his signature pieces of the \u201990s came \u201cat a perfect moment,\u201d just as globalization was gathering pace. Mr. Gursky represented the spread of multinationals and the explosion of financial markets, as they were striking \u201cthe right balance between something that is neither critical nor apologetic,\u201d Mr. Bajac said. That \u201cabsence of narrative\u201d mirrored the contemporary mood.Mr. Gursky\u2019s work also embodied the shift from analog to digital, from \u201ctaking images\u201d to \u201cmaking images,\u201d said Mr. Bajac \u2014 initially doing both but now doing more of the latter.A switch to digital photography in the early \u201990s allowed Mr. Gursky to take large-format photographs and to manipulate the images in digital postproduction \u2014 by \u201cpumping up the color sometimes or combining several different images in order to get this really even perspective, where you can see everything and details that aren\u2019t available from just one perspective are suddenly made available to you,\u201d Mr. Rugoff explained.The giant formats found a ready market. Photography had historically been black-and-white and small, and printed in large editions. Mr. Gursky blew it up, made full use of color and set out to \u201cdocument the key themes that dominate our lives today, then produce these works in limited editions of between four and six,\u201d said Francis Outred, the chairman and head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s, one of the Hayward show\u2019s sponsors. He created \u201ca capsule of value\u201d akin to a painting, Mr. Outred said.Mr. Gursky also outpriced his peers by pointing his lens, early on, at major world exchanges such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1990 and the Chicago Board of Trade in 1997. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an Andy Warhol, you want a Marilyn, and if you\u2019re looking for a Gursky, you want a stock exchange,\u201d Mr. Outred said, adding that one London hedge fund had collected four or five of them to decorate its trading floor.At the turn of the millennium, Mr. Gursky started digitally recomposing photographs to give them a look similar to abstract paintings. In his record-setting river view \u201cRhine II\u201d (1999), for instance, the perfectly straight lines of green and gray recall abstract paintings by Barnett Newman or Kenneth Noland. Mr. Gursky edited out a power station that spoiled the composition.Mr. Gursky meanwhile continued to capture images around the theme of labor and capital. \u201cAmazon\u201d (2016) shows one of the online retailer\u2019s Arizona warehouses, stocked with books and boxes, and plastered with motivational slogans that read: \u201cWork hard,\u201d \u201cHave fun\u201d and \u201cMake history.\u201dMr. Gursky said visiting the warehouse was tough because of the working conditions, but insisted that his images were not \u201caccusing\u201d or a \u201cpolitical statement.\u201d\u201cOur world is also seduced by Amazon, because it\u2019s so practical and so quick, and you want something and the next day you have it. This is also the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI show our contemporary world the way it is.\u201dAsked if his fame and fortune caused him discomfort, Mr. Gursky laughed. Money had, of course, changed his life, he said, because he could afford to travel wherever he wanted.He said he planned to use his wealth to set up a public foundation on the premises of his studio in D\u00fcsseldorf, which he would endow and where all of the prints reserved for his private collection would be viewed in the future. Will it open soon?\u201cNo, I\u2019m still a bit too young,\u201d he said with a smile. He had thought about the foundation for a long time, he said, and was happy to have reached a decision: \u201cIt\u2019s strange for a living artist to talk about what\u2019s going on after he has died.\u201dFor now, Mr. Gursky leads the life of a much younger man. He plays sports \u2014 tennis, jogging and cycling \u2014 and has been a fan of techno for the past 20 years, describing it as music for all generations. He is close friends with the D.J. Sven V\u00e4th and other techno performers. \u201cMy son complains that I\u2019m hearing the same music as him,\u201d said Mr. Gursky, referring to the youngest of his two children, who are in their 20s. \u201cMaybe he has a problem with this, but not me!\u201dAfter the Hayward exhibition, Mr. Gursky said he planned to stop teaching at the D\u00fcsseldorf academy, take a two-year sabbatical to travel the world, and spend more time in Ibiza, Spain, where his friends live and where he\u2019ll be able to hear a lot of techno.A painter\u2019s work is usually fairly recognizable, Mr. Kittelmann explained. \u201cIn photography, it\u2019s much, much harder.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising that a photographer found a special handwriting in photography, that there is no misunderstanding,\u201d Mr. Kittelmann added. \u201cA Gursky is a Gursky.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Dakota\u2019s Loss of Division I Women\u2019s Hockey Leaves a Void", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND FORKS, N.D. \u2014 When the University of North Dakota announced last March that it was dropping women\u2019s hockey for budgetary reasons, the move stunned this sprawling state on the northern Great Plains where the sport is a powerful unifying force.The news leaked while players were on ice for an off-season practice at Ralph Engelstad Arena, and while an out-of-state recruit visited the campus. The team\u2019s staff, including the two-time Olympic silver medalists and twins Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson and Monique Lamoureux-Morando, received no warning. The sisters read about it on Twitter after flying to Detroit to play for the American team in the world championships. They were horrified.Ten months later, the hurt remains pronounced and deep.\u201cIt was a program we grew up idolizing,\u201d said Lamoureux-Morando, a volunteer assistant who had hoped to be a full-time coach at the university when her playing days are over. \u201cMy dad played there. My brothers played there.\u201dWithout the Fighting Hawks to look up to, the Lamoureuxes and others fear fewer girls will try ice hockey, endangering more than a decade of gains in the state\u2019s youth and high school programs, and stifling an emerging pipeline of college talent.Youth hockey officials in the state\u2019s three largest cities \u2014 Fargo, Bismarck and Grand Forks \u2014 reported significant growth in their girls\u2019 programs in the last five years. According to USA Hockey, the sport\u2019s national governing body, girls\u2019 participation statewide is up 30 percent since 2012-13. And the number of girls and women of all ages playing has more than doubled since 2002-3, when the University of North Dakota fielded its first women\u2019s team and girls\u2019 high school hockey was sanctioned. U.N.D. was the lone women\u2019s Division I program in the state. North Dakota State, the only other Division I university, fields men\u2019s and women\u2019s club teams.\u201cYou can\u2019t aspire to be what you can\u2019t see,\u201d Brian Idalski, the former North Dakota women\u2019s coach, said. \u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about what that\u2019s going to look like for the region, not having a Division I program.\u201dThough the state is vast in area, North Dakota\u2019s population is small, roughly 758,000 residents. Only 11 girls\u2019 high school hockey teams compete, and many, like Bismarck and Grand Forks, are co-ops, made up of students from two or more schools. (The state has 18 high school boys\u2019 teams.)Yet Margot Miller, an assistant coach for the co-op Grand Forks KnightRiders and a former U.N.D. player, sees the state\u2019s talent level rising.Forward Britta Curl of the three-time defending state champion Bismarck, who is considered the state\u2019s best player, recently committed to Wisconsin, an N.C.A.A. power. She is a member of the United States team at the under-18 world championships this week in Russia.A half-dozen others from the classes of 2018 and 2019, including goaltender Quinn Kuntz of Grand Forks and defender Hannah Dorsey of Fargo, play Tier 1 hockey \u2014 an amateur level considered a step up from high school competition. Idalski recruited them all and said he felt he could have signed at least two.Every summer, the Lamoureux sisters, who play for the United States at the Olympics next month, return to Grand Forks to give individual instruction and skills clinics. They also belong to a local committee dedicated to encouraging more girls to play.\u201cI can\u2019t put into words the impact they\u2019ve had on our city, and our hockey here,\u201d said Kelly Kilgore, who coached the sisters in boys\u2019 bantams and heads the committee.It is hard for Abby Schauer to talk about what happened at U.N.D. Growing up in Grand Forks, she dreamed of wearing the Kelly green and white of the team formerly known as the Fighting Sioux. Her parents had men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey season tickets.\u201cI\u2019ve been going to games for as long as I can remember,\u201d she said.In high school, Schauer seemed on her way. She made all-state as a freshman forward for the KnightRiders, a team drawn from the two Grand Forks high schools. (The nickname combines Grand Forks Central Knights and Red River Roughriders.) Seeking tougher competition to prepare for Division I, Schauer left two years ago to play Tier 1 hockey for the Northern Cyclones, based in New Hampshire. The news of U.N.D.\u2019s decision broke her heart.Recently, while the Schauers packed for a move to another house in Grand Forks, her mother, Sally, discovered Abby\u2019s thick journal from first grade. It contained a crayon drawing Abby made of herself playing hockey, with a haunting caption using creative spelling: \u201cWhen I grow up I will play college hockey and then go pro. I will play for the Sioux and be the goaly. I will lead them to the championship.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s sad,\u201d said Schauer, a junior, who is now playing Tier 1 with the Madison Capitols in Wisconsin. \u201cI left here so I could play college hockey in my hometown. I sacrificed my high school years so I could play here. It was my goal.\u201dU.N.D. dropped women\u2019s hockey, baseball, men\u2019s golf, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming in a two-year wave of athletics budget cuts brought on by a state revenue shortfall. Men\u2019s golf was reinstated with outside financing. Most worrisome for women\u2019s hockey boosters, North Dakota is the third Division I member to shutter its women\u2019s program since 2011; Wayne State and Niagara are the others.But it\u2019s especially troublesome here in a cradle of the game. College hockey players are rock stars in Grand Forks, unable to go to the grocery store without being recognized. Miller, the KnightRiders\u2019 assistant, said girls\u2019 teams had regularly attended U.N.D. women\u2019s games at opulent Ralph Engelstad Arena, known locally as the Ralph. Players were often asked for and gladly signed autographs, and conducted clinics.\u201cFor our youth girls\u2019 team, skating side by side with those girls was exceptional,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have that anymore. You don\u2019t have those positive female role models to look up to. It\u2019s a huge loss in the community.\u201dThe KnightRiders drew about 200 fans for a recent Saturday afternoon game with Jamestown at Eagles Arena, a small municipal rink with a jungle gym next to the trophy case. The night before, more than 2,000 packed into Purpur Arena, named for Fido, to watch the city\u2019s undefeated boys\u2019 hockey teams, Grand Forks Central and Red River, play to a 2-2 tie.Kilgore, the Lamoureux sisters\u2019 bantam coach, wonders if girls can adjust their aspirations to be KnightRiders instead of Fighting Hawks, and whether that will be enough to keep girls\u2019 hockey relevant in a vibrant hockey state.KnightRiders junior defender Payton Kriewald also saw her U.N.D. dreams dashed, and she aches for the girls coming behind her. Kriewald scored a goal in the KnightRiders\u2019 4-2 victory, a game followed by one between the Grand Forks Youth Hockey Association\u2019s under-12 team, the Wild, and East Grand Forks. The Wild dressed 11 players, two fewer than East Grand Forks, a community across the Red River in Minnesota.An earlier version of this article misstated Quinn Kuntz\u2019s college plans.

Together with his wife, Marine van Outryve \u2014 whose Instagram profile describes her as \u201ca fashion model always running half naked\u201d \u2014 Mr. Spleen produces what you could call novelty knitwear, most notably a sweater with the words \u201cI hate models\u201d woven into the front in capital letters.\u201cOf course, no one hates models,\u201d Mr. Spleen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it.\u201dMr. Spleen and Ms. Van Outryve also brought to Pitti Uomo a collection of ball caps, scarves and shawls bearing references to drugs with assorted recreational uses and that invoked a utopian pharmaceutical destination called \u201cKetaminnesota.\u201d You might ask for directions if you\u2019ve never been.Last year, that meant picnic tablecloths and plastic buckets printed with imagery from Mr. Cattelan\u2019s subversively jolly publication \u201cToilet Paper.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to gauge how much of an aesthetic contaminant is a loud wool stadium scarf woven with the name of a museum, but the flip side of the neck warmer ought to make a best seller for the museum shops that have signed on for Mr. Cattelan\u2019s project (MoMA, the Guggenheim and the Whitney among them). Against a background of red and purple, large white capital letters in a Gothic font spell out \u201cmagnificence.\u201dEven events like the modest debut of a men\u2019s wear line created by the people behind 032c, the influential Berlin-based culture and fashion journal, benefit from the unparalleled backdrop of a palace designed by one of Brunelleschi\u2019s pupils in 1444.\u201cThis is our first fashion show and I wanted do to it at Pitti because of this sentimentality I had about the fair,\u201d the 032c founder and publisher Joerg Koch said before the first of three consecutive shows held in a gilded salon of the Palazzo Medici Riccardi.\u201cIt\u2019s very romantic for me because Pitti is where I saw shows like Raf Simons\u2019s first for Jil Sander,\u201d Mr. Koch added, referring to a magical twilight presentation held amid the parterres and umbrella pines ornamenting the gardens of a Renaissance palazzo outside the city limits.During a break between presentations of tough, uniformlike streetwear in the slipcover proportions that have come to dominate men\u2019s wear, Mr. Koch was asked how a serious publisher came to turn his hand to fashion. \u201cI think of 032c as more like a platform than a piece of printed matter,\u201d he said.\u201cPlus, I\u2019ve gotten all the analytics you\u2019d imagine working with Ssense,\u201d he added, referring to the Canadian e-tailer where he also has served as editor in chief since 2015. \u201cWhat is pretty obvious is that while you can\u2019t make money from digital media people, especially millennials, are crazy for clothes.\u201dThere was another reason. \u201cMy wife is a fashion designer,\u201d he said.In one of those flashes of Florentine serendipity, certain guests exiting the 032c show for the following presentation \u2014 an poetic and inspired collaboration between Jun Takahashi, the Undercover designer, and Takahiro Miyashita of the Soloist label \u2014 suddenly found themselves in a corridor opening onto Benozzo Gozzoli\u2019s miraculous \u201cChapel of the Magi,\u201d painted around 1459.\u201cThe faces are supposed to be portraits of Florentines of the time,\u201d Tiziana Cardini, a fashion editor and writer, said of the vividly rendered 15th-century Tuscans populating the fresco. In truth, they hardly look different from the Florentines you see every day on the street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Across Indonesia\u2019s Capital, a Legacy of Soviet-Inspired Design", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJakarta JournalJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 When hard-line Islamists marched on Indonesia\u2019s Parliament to protest what they consider the growing influence of communism, they could hardly have picked a more ironic place to gather \u2014 near the 80,000-seat Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.The stadium, opened in 1962, was built with Soviet-raised money.Jakarta\u2019s National Monument \u2014 where hundreds of thousands of Islamic hard-liners held rallies in 2016, demanding that the capital\u2019s Christian governor be lynched for blasphemy \u2014 was inspired by Soviet architecture.So were the Welcome Monument, a statue surrounded by a large water fountain on Jakarta\u2019s largest roundabout, and the Heroes Statue, of a young peasant being offered food by his mother as he prepares to go to war \u2014 a symbol of Indonesia\u2019s struggle for independence from the Dutch.Sukarno, a former architect who put in place Socialist policies, was attracted to Soviet-style monuments. His vision of the Indonesian capital in the 1950s and 1960s included wide boulevards and huge statues to the greatness of the new nation.\u201cHe had this obsession with \u2018the great city,\u2019 \u201d said Bambang Eryudhawan, an architect based here in Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital. Mr. Bambang noted that Sukarno was inspired by his travels around the world, where he saw nationalistic architecture throughout India, China, Eastern and Western Europe, and the United States.\u201cHe wanted to lift the spirit of the nation,\u201d he said.Jakarta\u2019s Communist-style monuments stand out, especially in a city with a presidential palace that is an example of Dutch colonial architecture, and whose buildings include crumbling Dutch- and Chinese-style structures near high-rise office towers, with an unregulated sprawl of urban slums.The 433-foot National Monument stands in the middle of a 185-acre square in central Jakarta. With socialist-looking reliefs at its base telling the story of Indonesia\u2019s rebellion against Dutch rule, it is perhaps the most prominent example of Communist-influenced design in Southeast Asia.The plaza surrounding it is Merdeka, or Freedom, Square, which is modeled on Red Square in Moscow. To the north lies the presidential palace; government buildings and military barracks lie on the square\u2019s east, west and south ends.To the southeast is the Heroes Statue, which was designed and built in the Soviet Union by the Socialist Realist sculptor Matvey Manizer and his son Ossip. The artists visited Indonesia before creating their work.The piece was shipped to Indonesia and inaugurated in 1963, a time of growing importance for the Indonesian Communist Party, which was banned by the government in 1966 and remains so today.About a mile away, down a wide boulevard, the Welcome Monument features a woman and man giving a welcoming gesture. It evokes the style of the Russian sculptor Vera Mukhina.Further south on the boulevard, close to the Soviet-financed soccer stadium, is the Youth Advancement Monument. Unveiled in 1971 and meant to encourage young people to help build the new nation, it depicts a muscular young man shouting and holding aloft a plate of flames. Expatriates in Jakarta call the 82-foot statue \u201cPizza Man,\u201d joking that the figure appears to be holding a pizza.Also in South Jakarta is the Dirgantara Statue, known as Patung Pancoran after the surrounding district. The piece portrays a traditional Indonesian figure pointing toward the location of the international airport at that time to celebrate Indonesia\u2019s growing aviation sector in the 1960s.Eko Harmanto, an Indonesian businessman and local historian, said the country\u2019s radical Islamic groups did not appreciate the history underlying the capital\u2019s architecture.\u201cAh, they don\u2019t know much,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of monuments, buildings and infrastructure were financed by the Russians, and everyone knows this, or should know it.\u201dAnalysts say the hard-line Islamists\u2019 protests against Communism are really aimed at President Joko Widodo, who has been compelled to deny claims by anonymous social media users that his ancestors were Communist sympathizers and members of the outlawed Indonesian Communist Party.The Islamic Defenders Front, the most vocal Islamic group, has called for the Heroes Statue to be torn down, echoing calls in the United States for Confederate statues to be dismantled.\u201cIt is a trace of the Indonesian Communist Party and a symbol of pride for those who managed to arm peasants to rebel against the state,\u201d said Novel Chaidir Hasan Bamukmin, a senior member of the Islamic group, which is critical of Mr. Joko\u2019s government.The demand has not gained traction. The Socialist-inspired monuments remain a fixture, despite the anti-Communist stances of the Indonesian Armed Forces and the Islamists \u2014 although in September the army raided a Jakarta restaurant that had displayed a flag with a hammer and sickle.\u201cI don\u2019t think the younger generation is going to buy this,\u201d said Mr. Bambang, the local historian.The landmarks celebrate the country\u2019s shared past rather than any particular ideology, he said, noting that Indonesia\u2019s most famous monument is Borobudur, the ninth-century Buddhist temple near the city of Yogyakarta.\u201cIt\u2019s not about Buddhism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our heritage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Sweatcoin, a Hot Fitness App, Keep You Off the Couch?", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent evening with a windchill of 11 degrees, I made myself put down a book I had been enjoying and go out on the streets of New York instead.Accumulate 550 sweatcoins, the app beckoned, and I could snag a Fitbit Flex wearable fitness tracker. So there I was on an Arctic evening, deliberately taking a circuitous route to inflate my step count.Sweatcoin\u2019s popularity began to spike last summer. By early September, it had become the most downloaded health and fitness application in the United States on the iOS and Google Play stores combined, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. It has retained that top ranking nearly every week since.Where Sweatcoin\u2019s approach differs from others, however, is in taking its ideas from behavioral economics, the study of how psychology and emotions influence our decision-making, to motivate people to exercise more. Its rise comes as insurers and corporate wellness programs are likewise furiously trying incentives \u2014 including passing out fitness monitors \u2014 to nudge people to improve their behavior.Sweatcoin\u2019s \u201cfirst premise is that physical movement has economic value,\u201d Anton Derlyatka, a Sweatcoin co-founder, told me.Mr. Derlyatka said the app aims to overcome our human tendency to choose immediate gratification \u2014 like doughnuts or binge-watching videos \u2014 over activities like daily exercise that offer long-term benefits. By giving consumers points that can buy goodies, Sweatcoin hopes to incentivize couch potatoes to become more active.\u201cIt\u2019s a tool, a hack, to help all of us, not just the select few, to remain fit,\u201d said Oleg Fomenko, another Sweatcoin co-founder.Could the app change me, a book nerd who innately favors reading over running? Cautiously optimistic, I downloaded Sweatcoin on an iPhone over the holidays.In theory, the app awards one sweatcoin for every 1,000 outdoor steps. But I quickly learned that users often get credit for fewer steps than they expected.For one thing, Sweatcoin immediately shaves your sweatcoin earnings by 5 percent \u2014 in the fine print, the app calls it a commission \u201cto keep our lights on.\u201dFor another thing, the app counts only the steps it thinks you took outside. Bummer. I would get no credit for Zumba, spinning \u2014 or listening to music playlists and dancing around my kitchen while cooking.To help it distinguish outdoor steps, Sweatcoin collects and analyzes GPS signals and motion data from your phone. To improve accuracy, it instructs users to turn off the app\u2019s battery-saver mode and keep the app running in the background.And Sweatcoin gets bossy about it. The first time I swiped the app off, a notice popped up on my phone: \u201cYou killed me! Do not force quit me if you want to generate sweatcoins.\u201d I complied, and my battery paid the price.Frictionless this app was not.But then I noticed that Sweatcoin seemed to frequently skimp on points, too. On a recent day I went for a walk with my sister in the snowy Massachusetts countryside, the app counted less than half my steps as outdoor activity.\u201c Where are my missing 3000 steps!\u201d Ian Wynne, a sports performance consultant in Britain, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is happening a little too often.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating when you are outside and you are sure that you have taken 1,000 more steps than it claims,\u201d Mr. Wynne said. Nevertheless, he planned to continue using Sweatcoin. He regularly exercised, he said, and liked the idea of getting extra credit for the outdoor activities he was already doing.Mr. Fomenko, the Sweatcoin co-founder, told me that the app\u2019s \u201cdraconian algorithm\u201d is meant to deter cheating techniques like, say, strapping a phone to a pet dog. And that fraud-deterrence system may verify fewer steps than users expect, he said.In practice, according to the app\u2019s help section, that means the Sweatcoin algorithm typically verifies 65 percent of a user\u2019s total steps. It also means that some frequent consumer behaviors \u2014 using a protective smartphone cover, walking while connected to public Wi-Fi, walking slowly with small children \u2014 could reduce your step count.In a follow-up email, Sweatcoin\u2019s co-founders said that they would soon hire a data science team \u201cto help us improve the speed and accuracy of this algorithm.\u201d They also said they were working on a verification algorithm to count indoor activity.The current system seemed preposterous to me. What\u2019s the point of an unpredictable fitness app?Nevertheless, after about two weeks of intermittent use, I had earned 47.52 sweatcoins. I was feeling pretty good \u2014 a Fitbit could soon be mine.Then I learned that the rewards could also be fickle.Sweatcoin generates revenue by marketing other companies\u2019 products to its users. When a user redeems reward points for a product through Sweatcoin, the maker of that product pays Sweatcoin a fee.But the Fitbit and some other fitness devices on offer when I signed up had disappeared from the app before I could earn one. Now the reward choices included a workout app for 30 sweatcoins that didn\u2019t interest me \u2014 or the iPhone X for a whopping 20,000 sweatcoins. I calculated that, if I took 13,000 total steps every day, it would take me more than five years to get that iPhone.I felt like Sweatcoin, by offering rewards that seemed near impossible to obtain, could end up demotivating the very people it was trying to nudge to walk more.As a reporter who regularly covers data privacy, I also couldn\u2019t help being troubled by the possibility that the app could share or sell the trove of location and motion data it collects from users.Sweatcoin\u2019s founders said they would never do such a thing. \u201cLet me make it very, very clear,\u201d Mr. Derlyatka said, \u201cwe never, ever sell anybody\u2019s user data to any outside parties.\u201d If the fitness start-up were ever acquired by another company, however, the app\u2019s privacy policy states that \u201cpersonal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.\u201dBut the biggest downside for me was feeling like Sweatcoin\u2019s behavioral engineering cheapened important experiences. When I used the app, instead of concentrating on the friends I was walking with, I kept checking to see how close I was to being able to redeem my sweatcoins for that Fitbit.No trinket or gift card is worth that distraction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Autism Make Me a Diversity Hire?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI am an academic barely making a living by working as an adjunct for five or six classes a semester. I realize that while the \u201carc of history bends toward justice,\u201d as Barack Obama said, paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr., this doesn\u2019t hold true in individual cases. The movement for greater faculty diversity can mean that I, a white male in the humanities, am less likely to get a full-time job no matter how well I teach or how much I publish. A colleague suggested I use the idea of \u201cneurodiversity\u201d to qualify as a \u201cdiversity hire.\u201d I have several problems with this: First, while I am obsessive about my chosen subject and was probably \u201con the spectrum\u201d as a child and young adult, I don\u2019t believe this diagnosis fits me. Second, this would be a sort of blackface: I would be claiming to be part of a protected class for my own benefit. Finally, I don\u2019t think that a hiring committee would look favorably on someone who came out as on the autism spectrum.A second rationale for affirmative action is to undo the effects of current prejudice. Here again, while a diagnostic label can lead people to treat you badly, some of the atypical behavior of high-functioning people with autism is much more likely to be accepted in the academy than in many other places. This acceptance is eased by the well-entrenched stereotype of the absent-minded professor with weak interpersonal skills \u2014 that is, someone who fails to conform to the norms of appropriateness recognized by neurotypical people.A third reason offered for affirmative action is to make sure that all the major social groups and points of view are represented in the academic community. The idea here is both that we can learn from one another and that we want educated people in all the social groups. This could be a reason for wanting more people with autism. They could be rare enough that we need to oversample them (assuming we aren\u2019t already doing so).So while I\u2019m not finding a strong case for affirmative action for academics on the autism spectrum, I can see a weak one. In the present political climate, though, I doubt that a category of this kind is likely to gain practical support. I don\u2019t know whether you would help your employment prospects by announcing yourself as someone with autism-spectrum disorder (presumably after receiving a formal diagnosis), but under the Americans With Disabilities Act, it would be illegal to discriminate on that basis.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Mr. Noto, 49, was one of the most respected bankers at Goldman Sachs before becoming the chief financial officer of the National Football League and then Twitter.Since arriving at Twitter, Mr. Noto has been perhaps the most trusted deputy to the company\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, and has taken on several additional roles. He has recently been leading the company\u2019s interactions with investors and its marketing as well as its revenue-generating efforts, especially with its moves into live video.With Mr. Dorsey splitting his time between Twitter and Square, the payments company, Mr. Noto is credited with being a calming force as Twitter has faced significant employee turnover and doubts about its ability to make money from its enormous audience.While Twitter\u2019s stock price has fallen steadily over the last three years, in the last few months it has ticked upward. On Tuesday morning, after Mr. Noto\u2019s departure was announced, the company\u2019s shares fell nearly 4 percent before recovering some of the loss.Twitter said on Tuesday that other employees would assume Mr. Noto\u2019s responsibilities w while it looked for a replacement.On Twitter on Tuesday morning, Mr. Dorsey wrote, \u201cI\u2019m really sad to see @anthonynoto leave us, but I\u2019m happy for him and really proud of everything he\u2019s accomplished at Twitter.\u201dAt SoFi, Mr. Noto will be responsible for trying to steady a company that was thrown into turmoil by Mr. Cagney\u2019s departure.After cofounding SoFi in 2011, Mr. Cagney turned it into one of the few breakout stars among the thousands of so-called fintech start-ups trying to disrupt the financial industry.SoFi began by refinancing the loans of elite students, but the company then expanded into personal loans, insurance and wealth management, and was making several moves to turn into more of a full-service bank.Mr. Noto suggested on Tuesday that he planned to pick up where Mr. Cagney had left off.\u201cSoFi has a significant opportunity to build on its leadership position in student and personal loans to revolutionize consumer finance and build a next-generation financial services company,\u201d Mr. Noto said in a news release.Mr. Noto will also need to find replacements for several top executives who left around the same time that Mr. Cagney did, including the company\u2019s chief financial officer and chief technology officer.Since Mr. Cagney\u2019s departure, SoFi has been led by the chairman of its board, Tom Hutton. Mr. Hutton will return to his former role.Mr. Cagney was one of the highest-profile executives in Silicon Valley to be felled by the wave of sexual harassment claims that have swept corporate America over the last year.SoFi employees said the inappropriately sexualized atmosphere of the company ran deep and extended to the company\u2019s satellite offices.Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, and Chad Bray from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Claim Surveillance Power Abuses in Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A fall 2016 application for a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant targeting a former Trump campaign adviser has become the latest front in the partisan struggle over the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election.Republican aides on the House Intelligence Committee have prepared a memorandum that is said to accuse law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant. House Republicans are calling for the declassification and release of the report, while Democrats say that it is full of misinformation and is a political stunt.The rollout of the memorandum was sudden and intense. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee abruptly moved to make the report available to the entire House at a closed-door meeting on Thursday, surprising Democrats who did not know it had been prepared, according to a participant.After a party-line vote to make it available, Republicans began declaring that the report draped the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation in scandal.But Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, denounced the report as \u201ca profoundly misleading set of talking points\u201d that were \u201crife with factual inaccuracies\u201d and created \u201ca distorted view of the F.B.I.\u201d He said the memo\u2019s boosters were carrying water for the White House.Although the application is said to have drawn on a variety of material, the Intelligence Committee memo apparently focuses on one strand: information from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence agent who wrote the dossier of unverified and salacious allegations that suggested that Mr. Trump had been compromised by a Russian intelligence operation.Mr. Steele had been retained to investigate Mr. Trump by Fusion GPS, a research firm that had been hired by a law firm working for Democrats. When Mr. Steele decided to take the information he was gathering to the F.B.I. in August and October 2016, according to people familiar with those conversations, he told the bureau\u2019s agents that he was working for interests opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Fusion GPS, which was under contract with the Democrats at the time, paid around $160,000 for Mr. Steele\u2019s research.It is not clear how much of that context \u2014 if any \u2014 law enforcement officials conveyed to the court.Two people familiar with the warrant application said law enforcement officials described Mr. Steele not as a Democratic-funded investigator, but as a reliable F.B.I. source who had previously provided information about corruption in FIFA, the global governing body for soccer.Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security issues, said that disclosing Mr. Steele\u2019s backers could affect a judge\u2019s assessment of his credibility. But Mr. Vladeck cautioned that without seeing the warrant application, it was impossible to say whether that information was just \u201cbackground noise\u201d or pivotal.\u201cThere is a world of difference between an application that relied solely on this information and an application that relied on this and 22 pieces of independently corroborated information,\u201d he said.A senior Democratic staff member on the House Intelligence Committee said the memo drew on classified documents that have been shown only to Representative Devin Nunes, Mr. Schiff and four staff members. \u201cIt\u2019s like they put out a book review of a book they never read,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, who serves on the committee.Seeded throughout the memo, Democrats said, were characterizations of law enforcement officials as nefariously biased in favor of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Swalwell said he feared it would cause lasting damage to the F.B.I.\u2019s reputation, adding, \u201cIt is clear to me that they are just trying to put a cloud over Mueller,\u201d referring to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.Mr. Nunes has previously advanced alarming claims about the Russia investigation and surveillance in support of Mr. Trump. Last spring, he said he planned to share information with the White House showing that Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had been picked up in surveillance and that Obama administration officials had improperly \u201cunmasked\u201d their identities in intelligence reports.Conservative news media like the Fox News evening shows pounced after reports of the memo\u2019s existence emerged Thursday, with personalities like Sean Hannity declaring that what he had been told about the memo showed that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump-Russia affair should be disbanded.Nicholas Fandos, Adam Goldman and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Bipartisanship is in. And not everyone is happy about it.When President Trump delivers his first State of the Union address on Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET, his most fervent supporters are anxious that he will squander the most high-profile moment of his presidency with a soft speech that bends more to the predilections of the political establishment in Washington and less to the populist army that sent him there to drain the swamp.Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s senior policy adviser, is in charge of writing this year\u2019s address, which could foreshadow the inclusion of the kind of hard-edge, anti-immigrant language that was a hallmark of Mr. Miller\u2019s speeches for Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cThe question is: Will he display a resolve and a commitment to pursue his immigration goals, or will he start channeling Jeb Bush again?\u201d said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates restrictive immigration policies that Mr. Bush opposed as Florida governor and as a candidate in the Republican presidential primary against Mr. Trump.\u201cWhat I would like to see is a speech that is strong in its principles but not obnoxious in its tone,\u201d Mr. Krikorian said. \u201cThat\u2019s something President Reagan always mastered, but Trump hasn\u2019t figured out yet.\u201dThere is reason to think that Mr. Krikorian and other like-minded conservatives are right to be concerned that their preferred version of Mr. Trump will not show up on Tuesday night. State of the Union speeches are always a tug of war among White House factions. And White House officials have strongly signaled that this will not be the kind of immigration stemwinder that Mr. Miller is famous for.Instead, they say, it will be \u201coptimistic,\u201d though officials caution that the ultimate delivery of the speech \u2014 and whether it follows the script that will scroll through the teleprompter \u2014 is up to Mr. Trump.Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker who has advised Mr. Trump, said the president was shifting gears, eager to promote the booming economy and the enactment of his tax plan without combative language that could muddy his message.\u201cThey\u2019re moving a little bit from \u2018Trump the fighter\u2019 to \u2018Trump the winner,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a sense of, \u2018Look, I\u2019m the president of the United States. I don\u2019t need to pick a fight.\u2019\u201dWhile some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers will pine for a darker and more strident tone from the president, White House officials say they are aiming for a more inclusive speech \u2014 in tone if not in substance. In addition to Mr. Miller, the speech has been put together with Vince Haley, another speechwriter, and Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary, who coordinated input from other parts of the government.At the White House and among Republicans on Capitol Hill, there is a keen awareness that Mr. Trump benefits from extraordinarily low expectations of his ability to stay on message and deliver a coherent speech, given his tendency to ramble off script and insert divisive notes, insulting asides and mystifying non sequiturs that almost always overshadow the topic at hand.Given that, officials believe, the president will be judged a success in many quarters as long as he reads faithfully from his script, resisting the urge to respond to perceived slights or settle scores and instead sticking to a positive message that can resonate with a wide swath of Americans.\u201cThe president is looking forward to the midterm elections in November and his own election in 2020,\u201d said Corey Stewart, a Tea Party Trump backer from Virginia who is running for Senate in the state. \u201cHe knows that he\u2019s going to have to get his base out, but also expand it by talking about non-red meat issues.\u201dMr. Stewart, who drew national attention in 2007 as a county official for his crackdown on illegal immigration, said Mr. Trump might use Tuesday\u2019s speech to seem more moderate on the issue as a negotiating tactic.\u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him until there\u2019s an outcome,\u201d Mr. Stewart said of the immigration debate. \u201cHe\u2019s a master negotiator. He plays with Democrats. I\u2019m going to judge him on what he does in the end.\u201dWhatever the rest of the speech is like, much of it is designed to give Mr. Trump a chance to brag by recounting the successes of his first year: the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a rollback of regulations, the passage of a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul and stock market gains. Aides said Mr. Trump did a practice run in the White House Map Room on Monday afternoon.Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an outspoken conservative Republican, said he was willing to accept a more dignified tone from Mr. Trump on Tuesday night as long as the president stuck to the conservative principles that got him elected.\u201cI think it\u2019s real clear,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep focused on what the American people sent us here to do: Drain the swamp, drain this place and remember that we work for the families that sent us. If we do that for the next year, we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201dOfficials said the president plans to formally ask Congress for a bipartisan effort to address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure with a plan of at least $1 trillion financed by the federal government, states and private industry.That message could rally even some of the more conservative members of his party.\u201cI expect him, because it\u2019s his style, to go off the teleprompter a few times,\u201d said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He said a plan for fixing broken bridges and roads would be \u201ca great way to start building a bridge to the other side of the aisle.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, on Monday announced 15 people who will be guests of the president and the first lady at the speech, continuing a State of the Union tradition that dates back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s invitation of a hero who helped save victims of a Washington plane crash a few weeks before.Ms. Sanders declined to provide details on Monday about what Mr. Trump planned to say. But she added coyly, \u201cIt will obviously be must-watch TV.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Wynn and the Economic Inequality Behind #MeToo", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the recent cultural movement during which many powerful men have been publicly accused of sexual harassment, Mr. Wynn is the first who is a C.E.O. of a publicly traded company in an industry that primarily employs hourly wage earners: casino workers, waitresses, housekeepers, and others who punch a clock every workday.Compared with his accusers, Mr. Wynn is extraordinarily powerful. He has 11,000 employees in Las Vegas alone and has solidified his influence with millions of dollars in political contributions. The allegations against him should remind us of the vast economic disparities that make low-paid women especially vulnerable to misconduct by their wealthy bosses.On Friday, The Wall Street Journal provided a detailed report of Mr. Wynn\u2019s purported patterns of sexual misconduct against female employees. Mr. Wynn has denied the allegations. According to the report, he exposed himself in front of women, in an on-site office, who were assigned to provide him spa services. He\u2019s accused of repeatedly pressuring them into unwanted sexual acts.I\u2019ve already heard people suggesting that my city is to blame for Mr. Wynn \u2014 that the Las Vegas Strip\u2019s overtly sexualized culture enables powerful men like him to maintain their patterns of sexual harassment. That may have contributed, but when it comes to women facing workplace abuse, another dynamic does just as much harm: the culture of income inequality.The report of Mr. Wynn\u2019s misconduct reminds me, a casino worker, of every time a manager stepped across the line or a V.I.P. guest\u2019s behavior was excused because of his financial status. Here, low-income workers are made to feel indebted to the rich men like Mr. Wynn who pay their wages. In a city with little economic diversity, good middle-class jobs like those offered by Wynn Resorts are difficult to find.The women coming forward were lower-paid employees at the times of the alleged harassment. They were hospitality workers trained to be welcoming and smiling, and to always strive to say yes. Most of Mr. Wynn\u2019s accusers had behind-the-scenes roles like food and beverage servers, manicurists and receptionists, employees whom executives often view as easily replaceable.It is a similar approach taken by Harvey Weinstein, who preyed on female actors when they had little power \u2014 before their Hollywood debuts or successes. What many powerful sexual harassers seem to know is that when women don\u2019t have the economic agency or career security to speak out, they often will choose not to.There is a reported $7.5 million settlement between Mr. Wynn and his former manicurist, which prohibits her from speaking publicly about her experience. Many working-class and low-income women who never report misconduct are informally making similar deals, on a much smaller scale. Each day at work, they may decide to remain silent about sexual harassment for the sake of their families and their own sense of safety, in exchange for a much-needed paycheck from someone who has astronomical wealth.It is exceptionally brave for any low-income woman who speaks out, but there is a reason Mr. Wynn\u2019s accusers have remained unnamed: They do not have a legion of Twitter followers to mobilize around them, or people of power to affirm them, or forthcoming movies to support them financially. Socioeconomic status plays a significant role in their ability to say, \u201cMe too.\u201dThe majority of our wage work force is women, like those who brought allegations against Mr. Wynn. Women are the most common victims of sexual harassment. Without ensuring that all women have a living wage and the right to unionize \u2014 things that provide the security an employee needs before she even thinks about reporting misconduct \u2014 we will never end the problem.Meanwhile, Mr. Wynn will be fine. That\u2019s no surprise. Our current president offers just one example of the way men above a certain income bracket seem to avoid career-ending consequences for accusations \u2014 or even videotaped admissions \u2014 of sexual misconduct. Mr. Wynn, whose fortune will buy him the best attorneys, is likely to remain comfortably and safely at the top. He may lose some money or no longer be invited onto Fox News, and on Saturday he resigned his position as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. But the wealth he already has means that unlike his accusers, he\u2019ll never have to worry about making enough to get by. It\u2019s that kind of financial security that creates empowerment.When I drive to my workplace on the Las Vegas Strip, I still have to see the names \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201cWynn\u201d crowning the towers that form our skyline. For years to come, many women will still have to see those names printed on their uniforms, their work identification badges and their paychecks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Does Your Landlord Calculate Your Rent?", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.He didn\u2019t want to be a landlord who was constantly raising the rent on his tenants. But despite locking in relatively high rents initially, the market quickly rose around him, and by 2014, he had one tenant paying $1,450 a month when the market rate was closer to $2,000.While the city\u2019s larger, institutional landlords may use algorithms to set rents, informing tenants of increases by letter, for many smaller landlords, the process is not so impersonal. They may rent just a few units, often in the building where they live, relying on the income to make their mortgage payments. Many see their tenants in the hall, know what kind of music they listen to and exchange neighborhood gossip on the stoop. And though most say that they follow general principles and guidelines when determining rents, not all of those are financial, and they are far from uniform.Squaring business interests with one\u2019s personal and political beliefs, of course, can be a messy business. Consider the brouhaha last year when Politico revealed that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a small landlord who has made affordable housing one of his signature issues, had raised the rent on one of the units in a two-family Park Slope house that he and his wife own.While the increase, from $2,400 in 2009 to $2,850 in 2016, broke down to a relatively modest 2 or 3 percent per year, Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this story, had spent the previous two years calling for \u2014 and getting \u2014 zero percent increases for the city\u2019s rent-stabilized units.While the Rent Guidelines Board sets increases for the city\u2019s million or so rent-regulated tenants, increases on market-rate units are entirely at the discretion of landlords, who weigh potential profits against the possibility of losing reliable tenants and the cost of vacancy. As for determining what the market rate is, small landlords say they do various things, from looking through nearby listings to asking neighbors and visiting open houses.Christopher Athineos, who with his parents owns 150 apartments in 9 buildings, a mix of rent-regulated and market-rate units in Bay Ridge, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, said that while \u201cobviously this is our business, you get close to it\u201d \u2014 especially if you get to know your tenants well.His parents bought their first property in 1968 and still live in one of their buildings. Mr. Athineos grew up with some of his current tenants and goes to their children\u2019s baptisms and other events. He even agreed to help the niece of an older tenant scatter the ashes of that tenant when she passed away.\u201cI do cut people a break. I have a couple of senior citizens in Bay Ridge \u2014 one woman, her husband passed away a long time ago, she\u2019s in her 80s, on fixed income. I\u2019m like, \u2018Sign the lease renewal, no increase,\u2019\u201d Mr. Athineos said. \u201cOr I increase her $5, so she doesn\u2019t feel like a charity case.\u201dFor other tenants, he said he usually raises rent by 1 to 3 percent on the second renewal. \u201cNo one likes an increase on their first year,\u201d Mr. Athineos said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made the mistake in the past where I don\u2019t increase them for four years, then all of a sudden, you have to ask them for $75 or $100, and they\u2019re like, \u201c\u2018Oh my god, you\u2019re killing me.\u2019\u201dThe key thing, landlords agree, is to hang onto good tenants \u2014 the ones who pay on time, take care of the apartment and call you when the radiator\u2019s leaking all over the floor, but not, as one landlord said, \u201cbecause the refrigerator makes too much noise.\u201dMinimizing turnover is important, because empty apartments have to get cleaned, repainted and repaired. And there is often at least a one-month gap between tenants, with no rent coming in. Some landlords avoid raising the rent at all when they have a good tenant, preferring to catch up to the market the next time they list the apartment.\u201cI never raise it when they\u2019re there,\u201d said Jude Bernard, who started buying brownstones in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, in the late 1990s. \u201cI was lucky enough to buy my buildings when they were well, well below what they\u2019re worth today. My mortgage is very low. My unwritten rule is: You don\u2019t bother me, I don\u2019t bother you.\u201dOne tenant whom he had been renting to since 2006 \u201cwas like a ghost,\u201d he said approvingly, so he was happy to keep her at the same rent that she paid when she moved into the three-bedroom duplex garden apartment, $2,500 a month. But last summer, the tenant got a new roommate who started calling him all the time about what he said were minor problems or nonissues. So at renewal time, he sent them a letter raising the rent to $4,500.\u201cShe assured me her new roommate would not be calling me anymore, and we negotiated a new rent of $3,500,\u201d Mr. Bernard said. \u201cFrom what I gathered, the new roommate came from a Manhattan doorman building and was accustomed to \u2018Hey, a light in the apartment is out.\u2019 That\u2019s not brownstone living. We don\u2019t do concierge service.\u201dLandlords who share houses with their tenants are often even more willing to go below market rate \u2014 sometimes substantially \u2014 for a friendly tenant.Mary and Larry Heintjes are artists who own a carriage house on the border of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, and rent out a studio apartment across the hall from their two-bedroom. The unit goes for well under market rate.As Ms. Heintjes explained, \u201cWe wanted a certain kind of person, someone who is kind and communicative. We didn\u2019t want to lose that kind of person by charging a rent that would be for someone who is more corporate.\u201dThat view was shaped by their history in the house. The same day that they closed on the property in 1997, Mr. Heintjes\u2019s mother had a stroke. During the renovation, they decided that she should move in with them. She stayed for five years, until she needed round-the-clock care, which is when they turned her room into a studio apartment. With property taxes increasing and their two daughters nearing college age, they needed the extra income, but they wanted a renter who felt like family.Charging considerably below market rate has allowed them to get just that. Previous tenants, a couple who bought a house in Albany, stay with them regularly when they are in the city. But last spring, they needed to find a new tenant after nearly a decade with virtually no rent increases, so they consulted a friend, Craig Meachen, who is also a real estate broker. He helped them calculate a rent that was several hundred dollars higher than they had been charging, getting them closer to market rate.But even in the coziest relationships, money \u2014 and paying the mortgage \u2014 can be a big issue.After Bibi Calderaro, an artist and broker, and her husband, a photographer, bought a townhouse in Bed-Stuy six years ago, they rented out the garden apartment for $1,800 a month. The first few tenants were on yearlong fellowships, and another moved out because she wanted a dog. With every transition, they recalibrated the rent to the rising market.Last year, they listed the apartment for $2,300, or $100 more than the previous tenant had been paying, and got no takers. Then they lowered the price to what the last tenant had been paying, and still it didn\u2019t rent. Grudgingly, they lowered it again, to $2,175, in response to what the market was telling them. But that didn\u2019t make the rent decrease any easier to take.That monthly income is how \u201cI pay my mortgage,\u201d Ms. Calderaro said. \u201cWe\u2019re not only trying to keep up with inflation, but the real estate taxes have gone up. Our economy is much more fragile than larger landlords\u2019.\u201dStill, if there is a common thread among most small landlords in the city, it is that they choose not to chase the highest rent they could get.When Marta Satwin-Ramberg, an architect, and her husband, a graphic designer, bought and renovated a three-unit rowhouse in Ridgewood, Queens, six years ago, they picked a midpoint between the going rate for unrenovated apartments in the area and what seemed like unreasonable asks in several nearby buildings that developers had redone. Last fall, they asked $2,000 for a railroad-style two-bedroom.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be pushing the top boundaries of what I could get, \u201cMs. Satwin-Ramberg said. \u201cI\u2019d rather rent to friends of friends. I feel like the way I set those rents are what would be bearable for me.\u201dAmit Kalra owns three properties in Queens and several more in Nashville, to which he applies very different rental philosophies.He bought his first building, in Woodside, seven years ago, after his father died. His mother took one of the six units, and for a time, his sister lived in another. He lived right around the corner and got to know the tenants well, inviting them to barbecues at his house.When taxes or heating costs go up, he sends them a letter explaining the increase and how it will affect their rent. And for the past three years, he has kept the rent flat for a tenant with a special-needs child.In Nashville, however, he uses a management company and, until new inventory started flooding the market last year, would regularly ask for 6 or 7 percent annual increases. He made his decisions based on recommendations from the management company and his own research on the market there.\u201cI don\u2019t see the Nashville properties every day, so I treat it more like a business,\u201d Mr. Kalra said. \u201cIn Woodside, it\u2019s much more friendly. You can\u2019t help but be emotionally attached. You become conscious of the tenants\u2019 situations and that the biggest check they write every month is to you.\u201dBeing cognizant of those things can certainly make asking for more rent difficult, as Mr. Chukudebelu, the landlord in Bed-Stuy, discovered when he finally approached his $1,450-a-month tenant about an increase. At first, he asked for $100 more a month, which she agreed was reasonable. But the next year, when he tried to raise it another $100, she balked, and they negotiated a two-year lease with $75 and $50 increases, which would eventually bring the rent to $1,675.After that, he said, \u201ccame the moment of truth.\u201d He asked for another $75 increase, wanting to bring the rent to within a few hundred dollars of the $2,000 market rate. \u201cAnd I knew that was a stretch for her,\u201d he said. \u201cThat definitely weighed on me. But then I was like, \u2018Do I take a loss so she doesn\u2019t?\u2019\u201dUltimately, the tenant got a roommate, and they now pay $1,800 a month, which puts the rent close enough to market rate that Mr. Chukudebelu can ask for much smaller increases at future renewals.In hindsight, he realized that his impulse to avoid raising the rent at all on a good tenant was well intentioned but a bit na\u00efve, since it put him so far behind. \u201cI wanted to be compassionate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a little too much of a compassionate viewpoint.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Aim of the Nunes Memo Is the Mueller Investigation", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Tuesday that he wanted Americans to see a secret memo that portrays the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation as scandalous, he also said he cautioned his Republican colleagues not to use it to impugn Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel running the inquiry.But as a matter of political reality, the memo \u2014 written by Republican staffers for Representative Devin Nunes of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman \u2014 has everything to do with defending President Trump from Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.Republicans are pushing the narrative that a cabal of politically biased law enforcement officials set out to sabotage Mr. Trump. And they are portraying a dossier written by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, which laid out unverified claims that Russia had compromised Mr. Trump and was conspiring with him, as the fountainhead of the Russia investigation. That assertion disregards unrelated evidence that Russia sought to influence the election and the pattern of contacts between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.Democrats have pushed back. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, who has seen the underlying classified materials on which the memo is based, has said the memo contains both inaccurate assertions and material omissions to misleadingly impugn law enforcement officials. Other people familiar with it say, for example, that Mr. Steele\u2019s information was only one thread in a tapestry of evidence from various sources that the memo ignored, exaggerating its relative importance.Democrats on the committee produced their own classified memo that they said pointed out and explained inaccuracies in the Republican memo and filled in the missing context. But on Monday, the committee voted along party lines to make the Republican memo public and rejected a request to simultaneously make public the Democrats\u2019 rebuttal.Mr. Ryan then began remarks he said he had prepared, stressing that he respected the F.B.I. and the Justice Department as important institutions for \u201ckeeping the rule of law intact.\u201d But on Monday, Intelligence Committee Republicans signaled a widening attack on both institutions \u2014 informing Democrats that the committee has opened an investigation into them, according to Mr. Schiff \u2014 as they voted to make their memo public.Of particular importance, the Republican memo is said to cite the role of Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general appointed by Mr. Trump last year, in signing off on an application to extend the surveillance of Mr. Page \u2014 meaning he approved the resubmission of Mr. Steele\u2019s information to the court. Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s role could provide critics of the inquiry ammunition to go after him.Under Justice Department regulations, only Mr. Rosenstein can fire Mr. Mueller, and only if he finds that the special counsel has committed misconduct \u2014 something he has repeatedly said he has not seen any sign of. But if Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Rosenstein, he could install a more accommodating replacement willing to say that he or she had spotted a reason to justify removing the special counsel and shutting down the investigation.On Tuesday, when Mr. Ryan maintained there was no connection between the memo and Mr. Mueller\u2019s work, the speaker also portrayed Mr. Nunes\u2019s committee as trying to be transparent as it carried out oversight into whether the executive branch had violated civil liberties using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.But Mr. Nunes\u2019s history in Congress undermines the idea that he is motivated by a good-faith concern that law enforcement officials might have conspired to abuse their surveillance powers and trample on civil liberties.That Mr. Nunes\u2019s actions undermined his credibility does not mean, however, that law enforcement officials made no mistakes in the highly fraught political environment of the day. The Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is finishing an inquiry into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, and he is expected to deliver some harsh findings about senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials in the Obama administration.As part of its examination, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s team uncovered the texts between two F.B.I. officials who also worked on the Russia investigation in its early stages, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, expressing intense animus for Mr. Trump. Mr. Horowitz brought those messages to the attention of Mr. Mueller, who immediately removed Mr. Strzok from his team; Ms. Page had already left by then. The final inspector general report is expected to sharply criticize both.One potential clue to the strategy behind the Republican memo may be lurking in the broadcasts of the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, a close ally of Mr. Trump whose programs often function as a conduit for his messaging.And, though it was not yet public that the memo revealed Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s role in extending the surveillance of Mr. Page, Mr. Hannity himself raised the question: \u201cDid Rosenstein sign off on extension of this FISA warrant?\u201d He also emphasized that \u201cI\u2019m very interested about Rod Rosenstein in all of this\u201d \u2014 and called for him to be fired.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Watches, Swapping a Motor Sport Focus for the High Seas", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJean-Marc Pontrou\u00e9 has mixed feelings about leaving the Swiss watch brand Roger Dubuis, after six years as its chief executive, to take the same role at Officine Panerai, another Richemont-owned watchmaker.\u201cIt\u2019s a funny feeling as on one side I am very excited about this new challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on the other side I am leaving friends so it is a painful exercise.\u201cIt\u2019s like leaving a family and turning over a chapter of my life, as we have shared projects and my business life is a large part of my daily life.\u201dUntil late June Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 is restricted from talking about plans for Panerai, which was founded in 1860 in Florence and, until 1993, primarily supplied instruments and timepieces for the Italian navy.But as he takes his technical experience to the new job \u2014 both brands have been developing new materials for watches, like carbon fiber \u2014 Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said he thought his management skills would actually prove to be most important for the role. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about how I\u2019ve been able, with a small team, to change a brand and grow it to a different scale, at a different speed, and create a different interaction with dealers, customers and so on,\u201d he said.At Dubuis, Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 was behind the effort to shape an unusual focus for the company. \u201cWe are switching from operating in the watchmaking business to operating within the world of motor sport,\u201d he said late last year during an interview at the Bulgari Hotel when he came to see Dubuis\u2019s new boutique at Harrods in London. (At the time, he was in discussions about a move to Panerai but it had not been formalized.)\u201cWhen we were thinking about what could open new doors for our brand,\u201d Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said last fall, \u201cwe thought of motor sport with its different network, thinking process and rhythm, but with the same customers, same price level, in a different industry, so we are not competing and can be open-minded.\u201cI would never launch a car and they would never make a watch,\u201d he added.The partnerships also have produced some unusual customer experiences, the kind of events that many luxury brands today consider crucial to turning buyers into fans with long-term brand affinity. A case in point: the Lamborghini racetrack events that Dubuis has organized in moneyed hot spots from Palm Springs, Calif., to Beijing. \u201cWhen you are at the circuit, it\u2019s all about the sport, experience and fun so the customers become your friends and are not in a business relationship,\u201d Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said.The strategy seems to work; according to the executive, 80 percent of Dubuis\u2019s new clients last year were drawn by the partnerships: \u201cWe are accessing customers who did not think about us before they had the watch on the tray or were buying a complication.\u201dDuring Mr. Pontrou\u00e9\u2019s tenure he also formalized the brand\u2019s made-to-order collection, Rarities, as a dedicated business unit and developed the Velvet line for women.And, Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said, working with creative people like John Galliano and Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, where he was sales manager in the late 1990s, also taught him how to translate intense creativity into business operations, as \u201cyou can\u2019t drive these people.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t work with the same rhythm as the sales or business side, same as Roger,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that brands in the luxury world are forgetting \u2014 the capacity of an organization to integrate creativity, giving it the same rhythm as other departments.\u201dMr. Pontrou\u00e9 then joined Richemont, spending 11 years on product management at Montblanc, narrowing his focus to watches at Roger Dubuis. (He still wears the Roger Dubuis Skeleton double tourbillon watch he received the day he joined the company \u201cso I can explain the concept easily to clients,\u201d he said).And, he said, the Chinese are buying again, as their purchasing habits have adjusted to Beijing\u2019s anti-corruption campaign. (The federation\u2019s November statistics said exports to mainland China were up 39.8 percent year over year, the category\u2019s strongest growth in 30 months.)Little wonder, then, that China has been a priority at Roger Dubuis. \u201cWe are at the beginning of our development,\u201d Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said last fall, \u201cand there is a growing share of young entrepreneurs who have made serious money from high tech and finance to food in the last five to 10 years, and they spend millions.\u201dIran also was on his list; \u201c80 million people live there, it is a fast-growing country and there\u2019s an appetite for luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also find Iranian customers in Paris, Los Angeles and New York, who are not ready yet for big purchases \u2014 but will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Warn of Hits From Tax Cuts. Don\u2019t Be Fooled.", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt will sound like bad news.Over the next few weeks, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, household names including Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson, are likely to warn that their financial results will be severely dented, if not altogether wiped out, by huge tax bills that they have to pay to the Internal Revenue Service.Don\u2019t be fooled.The big one-time losses are a prelude to even bigger profits \u2014 a paradox caused by the tax cuts that recently zoomed through Congress and that largely benefit corporations.A couple of provisions in the tax package are prompting many companies \u2014 those based in the United States as well as some foreign corporations with big American presences \u2014 to pay the taxman while anticipating huge savings for decades to come.Until now, companies generally didn\u2019t have to pay federal income taxes on such earnings, at least not immediately, as long as those profits stayed overseas. But if the companies brought the money back to the United States, they would face a 35 percent tax rate (minus whatever they had already paid tax collectors in other countries).American companies currently attribute about $2.8 trillion to their overseas units. The new law requires them to bring the money back to the United States \u2014 or to \u201crepatriate\u201d it \u2014 but at reduced tax rates as low as 8 percent.The phenomenon is likely to be on display in the next few weeks, as companies report financial results that look surprisingly weak because of the tax law.Why? Because the repatriation provision is part of a package likely to deliver vastly larger long-term savings for the world\u2019s biggest multinationals. Mr. Zion estimates the benefit from the repatriation tax break alone could be worth $500 billion to companies compared with the old law \u2014 more than double what they\u2019re paying upfront.And so profit warnings that normally would leave investors shuddering are instead being taken in stride.Apple might eventually fork over about $33 billion to the I.R.S. when those earnings come back to America, Mr. Zion said. But, in yet another oddity caused by the tax package, the company might actually record a one-time benefit to its profits.That\u2019s because, over the years, Apple has set aside money, at least in accounting terms, to cover the potential taxes it might owe on its offshore earnings. But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.Going forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.Under the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)The new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.It is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.In Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.Credit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.Several companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain. They included the German automakers BMW and Daimler, which both said the law would provide a temporary benefit of more than $1 billion.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A $65 Million \u2018Animal Terminal\u2019 at Kennedy Airport Sits Empty", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe animals are not coming to the Ark at Kennedy International Airport. Not one by one. Not two by two.Instead, just before the new year, John J. Cuticelli Jr., the Ark\u2019s owner, filed a $426 million lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Queens against his landlord, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that oversees the airport and solicited the animal handling center.Mr. Cuticelli says the Ark is incurring \u201cmassive operational losses\u201d and is in imminent danger of shutting down.The suit charges the Port Authority with failing to enforce his lease, which gives the Ark \u201cexclusive rights\u201d to handle the animals coming to the airport from overseas. The lease requires that the Port Authority \u201cmust use reasonable efforts to cause other providers to cease their provision of the exclusive services.\u201dThe project was financed with a combination of conventional loans and tax-free bonds, with Ark responsible for all payments.The heart of the Ark\u2019s business is supposed to be horses coming from Europe, which must be quarantined for at least three days in order to prevent the spread of equine diseases.The Ark\u2019s primary competitor is the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s 40-year-old operation in Newburgh, N.Y., about 90 miles north of Kennedy Airport.Most of the hundreds of birds and more than 3,500 horses that enter the United States at Kennedy every year are still put onto trailers for the 2-\u00bd-hour ride to Newburgh, even though the cargo planes could practically pull alongside the Ark, where the horses could be transferred to a dolly and wheeled into a stall moments after landing.\u201cI watch them go by my door every day,\u201d Mr. Cuticelli said, \u201ctrucked up to Newburgh.\u201d\u201cIt makes no sense to me why the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A. and all the other agencies involved in the creation of this facility are not supporting its use,\u201d Mr. Cuticelli said. \u201cI entered into a technically, legally binding contract with exclusivity. Otherwise, I never would have done it.\u201dThe Port Authority and the Department of Agriculture declined to discuss the lawsuit.Joelle Hayden, a spokeswoman for the U.S.D.A., did say that her agency \u201cdoes not mandate use of any one import quarantine facility, airline or animal handling service. We support the use of all approved entities and services.\u201dAnd a spokesman for the Port Authority said in a statement that the \u201climited exclusivity provision enables the private veterinary clinic to provide the first-class facility and services that J.F.K. requested.\u201dCritics, mostly shipping agents and transporters, said that the privately owned Ark was too expensive and unnecessary, given the existence of the Newburgh operation.But Dr. Scarlette Gotwals, a veterinarian and director of flight operations for Horse America, a shipping agent, said she was mystified as to why Ark has not been embraced by the horse industry.\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d said Ms. Gotwals, the first shipper to bring horses to the Ark in September. \u201cIt\u2019s a world-class facility. It\u2019s an indoor, climate-controlled facility. In Newburgh, you\u2019re using outdoor barns.\u201dShe said the price difference, which amounted to a couple of hundred dollars, was \u201cnot cost prohibitive.\u201dMr. Cuticelli, who described himself as a \u201cbroken down real estate investor,\u201d got involved with the project at the urging of Ken Rotondo, a veterinarian and a former member of the advisory council at Cornell University\u2019s veterinary college.In 2010, the Port Authority solicited companies willing to build a first-class animal facility at Kennedy Airport.\u201cI proposed moving quarantine\u201d to Kennedy, instead of going to Newburgh, Dr. Rotondo recalled.The Port Authority awarded the contract to Dr. Rotondo\u2019s group, he said, \u201cwithout going to bid.\u201d After Dr. Rotondo retired, Mr. Cuticelli took over.Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the former airport facility \u201cfell far below the minimum appropriate standards.\u201d\u201cThe Ark contract was tailored,\u201d he said, \u201cto enable the private contractor to make the necessary investment to build and operate a world-class facility.\u201dAfter three years of negotiations, the Ark signed a 310-page lease in 2014.However, in 2015, the Port Authority signed a 20-year lease with the U.S.D.A. operation in Newburgh, on the grounds of Stewart Airport. Thomas Bosco, then director of aviation for the Port Authority, recommended that the authority\u2019s board approve the lease, saying that the \u201cArk does not provide quarantine services.\u201d It was a puzzling statement given that Ark had signed a lease requiring it to provide that service.Before construction could begin, Ark had to wait for the Port Authority to remove the heart of the airport\u2019s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System, a high-tech system of cameras, radar and sensors.Ark also had to comply with various regulations and requirements imposed by the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A., the Center for Disease Control, state and local health departments and the Department of Homeland Security.The delays and requirements drove the cost of the project from $48 million to $65 million, Mr. Cuticelli said. He obtained private financing, put up $12 million of his own money and New York City provided a $35 million bond.Ark opened in January 2017, although the U.S.D.A did not approve the equine quarantine for imported horses until September. Business was slow.Mr. Cuticelli said he does not know whether he has stumbled into some bureaucratic nightmare with the Port Authority, a turf war between government agencies, or is the object of a boycott by livestock shipping agents and transporters.\u201cThere are two big issues,\u201d said Matt Haug, general manager for IRT Transport, which transports livestock internationally. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t acquainted with them. The other issue is the traffic difficulties at Kennedy Airport. Newburgh is situated near the interstates.\u201d\u201cNobody asked for an import facility,\u201d said a shipper, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to become embroiled in the litigation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this became a $65 million facility. They\u2019ll never recoup their money.\u201dA Port Authority official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, blamed federal officials. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the U.S.D.A. has not been friendly to this facility,\u201d he said.The official said the Port Authority was trying to work out the issues with the U.S.D.A.Ark\u2019s lease does appear to give it exclusivity, which is also generating friction with the horse racing industry.The New York Racing Association, which operates several tracks including Aqueduct and Belmont Park near Kennedy Airport, has built its own U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barns for international horse races, enabling the horse to compete right after it leaves quarantine. The 40 or so racehorses a year that fly into Kennedy from Europe, Japan and elsewhere for races within two weeks of landing represent only a fraction of the total expected volume.In December, Dora J. Delgado, a senior vice president of racing and nominations for the Breeders Cup, sent a letter to the U.S.D.A. expressing its concerns about the Port Authority\u2019s plans to require \u201cinternational equine athletes\u201d to use Ark, rather than the U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barn at Belmont.Alison McGowan, who runs Ternary Performance Horses on Long Island, was importing two show horses from Belgium and Holland in September. She said she told her shipper \u2014 whom she declined to name \u2014 on numerous occasions that she wanted the horses taken to Ark.The day before the horses were to leave Amsterdam, she discovered that the shipper planned to take them to Newburgh.She canceled the flight and hired a new shipper, Ms. Gotwals, who brought the horses to Ark.\u201cFor me as a horse owner,\u201d Ms. McGowan said, \u201cI would never ship horses halfway across the world on a long flight and then put them on a trailer for 2.5 hours to quarantine. The Ark is outstanding. I\u2019d rather have a state-of-the-art facility providing the best care.\u201dMr. Cuticelli said he may not be able to wait much longer.\u201cWhat sense does it make to build a multi-, multmillion-dollar state-of-the-art facility to, among other things, mitigate the risk of hoof-and-mouth disease contamination, and then do what they are doing,\u201d said his lawyer, Stephen B. Meister. \u201cIt\u2019s totally insane.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Shows City Drivers Won\u2019t Face the Brunt of Congestion Fees", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a New York State task force unveiled its report to impose a charge on drivers in Manhattan\u2019s most congested neighborhoods, one main line of attack came from lawmakers and others who say that it penalizes drivers who live far from subway and bus stops and already pay tolls that help finance a public transit system they rarely use.But on Tuesday a transportation research group is planning to release a report that seeks to challenge the weight of that argument. Using census data, the study by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, which promotes a decreased reliance on vehicles, analyzed commuting patterns in every State Senate and Assembly district in the region covered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city\u2019s subway and bus systems.The study showed that not one district has more than single-digit percentages of commuters driving into the zones where they would be charged a fee, and in most places the figure is less than 4 percent.In addition, the report aims to rebut claims that the fees would unfairly burden New Yorkers of lesser means: In terms of income, the report found, New Yorkers who live within the city\u2019s borders and who drive earn more than public transit riders. That is not true in many suburbs, where commuters who ride railroads earn more than the same area\u2019s drivers.The pricing plan proposed by the task force, which was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, is aimed at easing the congestion on Manhattan\u2019s gridlocked streets, while also providing another source of funding for the failing subway system.Drivers who enter a zone that stretches from 60th Street south to the Battery could be charged $11.52 during peak commuting hours, while trucks would have to pay $25.34. Passengers using ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Lyft, which have contributed significantly to the traffic problems, could face a $2 to $5 per-ride surcharge.David I. Weprin, a Democratic assemblyman who represents parts of Queens and has been a vocal critic of congestion pricing, took issue with the report\u2019s findings. In his district, according to the analysis, while nearly 50 percent of commuters drive, only 4.2 percent enter the congestion zone.But the analysis, Mr. Weprin said, may not paint the whole picture: Some of his constituents do not commute every day, but they often tell him they drive to Manhattan regularly for errands, such as doctor\u2019s appointments. And while he did not dispute the report\u2019s findings that drivers have higher median incomes than public transit riders, he pointed out that drivers also have to bear other expenses, like gas and parking.\u201cI look at it as an additional tax on people who drive into Manhattan, often not wealthy people, but middle-class people,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. \u201cIt is unfair to have this additional tax on residents from Queens and Brooklyn in particular, and those who are not accessible to public transport, or who would have a two-hour commute via public transportation.\u201dWhen it comes to serving the disabled, Mr. Weprin said the city\u2019s subway stops are among the least accessible of any major American city. Disabled people who cannot access many subway stations and are compelled to drive, he said, would be unfairly burdened by a congestion fee.Those concerns may be legitimate, but the need for a congestion pricing plan is more pressing, said Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t legislate for the handful of people who may need to drive into Manhattan for a doctor\u2019s appointment, every once in a while, and leave the six million New Yorkers taking the train every day in the lurch.\u2019\u2019To arrive at its conclusions, analysts working for the group used data from the most recently available American Community Survey, which details demographic variables as granular as mode of transportation by race and by income from 2011 to 2015. To decipher whether those New Yorkers commuted into the proposed congestion zone, the group sorted data from the previous five-year census, which recorded where people drive to, and then correlated it to Assembly and Senate district maps. (The commuting data from the 2011 to 2015 survey has not been released.)The districts with the highest number of commuters who drive into the proposed congestion zone, the report found, are in Manhattan, where people take a mix of personal cars and taxis, both of which would be subject to a congestion charge. For example, the highest percentage came from the 73rd Assembly District on the Upper East Side, where 9.2 percent of those entering the congestion zone rode in private vehicles.Despite the report\u2019s conclusions, the fate of any congestion pricing plan, which would have to be approved by the Legislature, will likely depend on addressing the concerns of Mr. Weprin and other lawmakers who represent districts outside Manhattan.After the congestion pricing plan was released, Mr. Weprin convened a news conference in Manhattan where he was flanked by many lawmakers from the other boroughs.\u201cIf there were so few people driving in, I don\u2019t think it would produce anything near the revenue that they\u2019re claiming it\u2019s producing,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, pointing out the high volume of traffic that spills across the M.T.A.-controlled bridges and tunnels each rush hour. \u201cThere are a lot of people moving over them into Manhattan,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are the people coming from?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Davos, the Real Star May Have Been China, Not Trump", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt one end of town, President Michel Temer of Brazil welcomed an unexpected offer from Beijing for Latin American nations to work closely with a Chinese initiative, known as the Belt and Road, intended to spread its economic and diplomatic influence abroad.At the other end of town, a senior Chinese diplomat helped introduce the prime minister of Pakistan at a breakfast meeting. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi used his talk to praise the rapidly expanding Chinese investments in his country, including to build power stations and a large port.\u201cThe China One Belt, One Road is going to be the new W.T.O. \u2014 like it or not,\u201d said Joe Kaeser, chief executive of Siemens, the German industrial giant, referring to the World Trade Organization.Belt and Road takes its name from the idea that Beijing is spreading its influence along the ancient Silk Road that once linked imperial China to the Roman Empire and to the medieval Europe of Marco Polo. But that was not the only push to extend its presence abroad that Beijing was trying to showcase.On Friday, the Chinese government used a policy document issued in Beijing to call for a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d that would link China to Europe and the Atlantic via a shipping route past the melting Arctic ice cap.The plan gradually extended to include the Mideast, Europe and eastern Africa, with Beijing promising hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in highways, rail lines, ports, power stations and other infrastructure, much of it through loans from Chinese state-owned banks.Critics have been skeptical, arguing that projects bankrolled through the initiative will bury the recipients in debt and cause environmental damage. The initiative has also been criticized as an easy line of financing for authoritarian regimes. China says its projects will be environmentally and financially sound, and that it does not seek a say in how other countries are governed.While Davos was underway, China was making other efforts to stretch the geographical ambitions of its Belt and Road initiative even further. At a summit meeting for Latin American and Caribbean foreign ministers in Santiago, Chile, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China called for close cooperation and participation by the region\u2019s countries, although he stopped short of formally including them in the initiative.In Davos, President Temer of Brazil said that he was not concerned about the rising influence in South America of China, which has increased investments in his country and extended enormous loans to Venezuela and Ecuador.Venezuela has already proved unable to repay its creditors, which include Moscow and Beijing. The Russian government has used Venezuela\u2019s overdue debts as a bargaining chip to win the right for Russian warships to visit Venezuelan ports.Mr. Temer said the debts should be seen as a financial issue, not a geopolitical one. \u201cThe major concern they have is to recover the loans they gave Venezuela, they want their payment,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis was actually quite explained in the meetings we have.\u201dHe also said that he was not worried by the strong Chinese interest in acquiring stakes in Brazil\u2019s electrical distribution and other industries. \u201cThe U.S. invests as well in Brazil,\u201d he said.National leaders seemed to vie with one another in Davos in calling for closer cooperation with China. Mr. Abbasi of Pakistan dismissed recent controversy in his country over whether China\u2019s giant construction projects were compromising Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty, its environment or its financial stability.\u201cThere is no major challenge we have not been able to resolve, and the sovereignty issues are very clear,\u201d he said at a breakfast for business executives and the news media. He added that on financial and environmental issues relating to Belt and Road projects, \u201cSo far, I can tell you we are winning on both counts.\u201dChinese officials used Davos as another opportunity to speak out against protectionism, in what analysts have described as an effort to take advantage of global concerns about the Trump administration and its warnings that it would pursue a more aggressive trade policy.However, China has zero tariffs on many raw materials that it has in only limited quantities at home, like iron ore. As a result, its stance has been particularly welcomed by countries like Chile that produce a lot of raw materials but relatively few factory goods.\u201cIn this, we see a very big difference with the United States,\u201d Foreign Minister Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz of Chile said, calling China\u2019s \u201cvision of openness and its rejection of protectionism very welcome.\u201dErnesto Londo\u00f1o contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesswoman\u2019s Fate a Test of China\u2019s Resolve on North Korea", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy age 44, she had built a commercial empire accounting for a fifth of trade between the Communist neighbors. She was appointed to the provincial People\u2019s Congress, granted special privileges to export petroleum products to the North and feted by officials as a \u201cwoman of distinction.\u201dNow, Ms. Ma\u2019s fate has become a test of China\u2019s willingness to support President Trump\u2019s efforts to throttle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions.Fifteen months later, however, it is unclear what has become of Ms. Ma. The government says it has not found evidence to support the American charges that she or her partners aided North Korea\u2019s weapons program. Though she remains under investigation for \u201ceconomic crimes,\u201d it is not clear whether she was ever arrested or where she is now.A review of Ms. Ma\u2019s case \u2014 involving interviews with officials, diplomats and others, as well as searches in corporate registries \u2014 underscored China\u2019s deep ambivalence as it has come under increasing pressure to enforce sanctions against North Korea. While China is on the record opposing the North\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons, it is wary of being seen imposing punishments at the bidding of the United States, especially against its own citizens.North Korea\u2019s agreement on Tuesday to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, and to hold talks and other exchanges with the South, may have been symbolic and perhaps a cynical effort to bide time. Yet it suggested that the rising diplomatic and economic pressure, meant to deny it the financial and material resources needed to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, may have had some effect on the North\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un.China has shown a willingness to support tougher sanctions at the United Nations Security Council over the last year, but it has done so grudgingly. The reasons for that are historical and strategic. North Korea has long counted on China as its only real ally, for example, but some analysts argue that economic factors also play a part.\u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t want to have to be doing this,\u201d said Ken E. Gause, an expert on North Korea with CNA, a research organization in Arlington, Va. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made on that border, and there are a lot of connections between the operators on the border and their patrons back in Beijing.\u201dMs. Ma\u2019s fate remains shrouded in mystery. There have been rumors of political intrigues and of sweeping arrests of customs officials, but few hard facts.China has taken steps to shut down at least some of Ms. Ma\u2019s trading empire, freezing her shares of her main company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., for example, according to a government registry. The shares of three colleagues who were also charged by the United States were frozen for a time but later released, suggesting they no longer face criminal charges.In the government\u2019s first statement on the case in a year, the State Council Information Office responded to questions from The New York Times by saying that Ms. Ma and others face investigation for \u201ceconomic crimes.\u201dHowever, the statement went on to say, referring to Ms. Ma\u2019s main company, investigators \u201chave not yet found evidence that the Dandong Hongxiang company and Ma Xiaohong et al are directly involved in North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile development activities.\u201dThe company\u2019s headquarters here in Dandong, on the border with North Korea, has been shuttered since last spring, when the decorations for the Year of the Rooster that are still hanging on the entrance were put up for good luck.Other subsidiaries linked to Ms. Ma continued to operate until very recently, providing revenue directly to the North Korean government. One is a joint venture with the North Korean government to operate a hotel, the Chilbosan, in Shenyang, the provincial capital 150 miles north of Dandong.China joined the council\u2019s other 14 members in imposing the new sanctions, which would also severely limit shipments of refined petroleum. Chinese officials point to such steps as a demonstration of its commitment to halting North Korea\u2019s weapons program.China has already slashed imports of coal, silver and other commodities from North Korea, according to customs records. While North Korea continued to sell $270 million worth of prohibited goods in the six months that ended in August, according to the latest United Nations report on sanctions, trade along the border has witnessed a significant drop, distressing traders and plunging the region into recession.The once-thriving trade across the border was what fueled Ms. Ma\u2019s rise, and the throttling of it now seems to have contributed to her fall.She was only 24 when North Korea, suffering the effects of famine, began to open its economy, first by allowing the export of scrap metal in 1996. What began as a trickle became a flood, she told Southern Weekly, a prominent Chinese newspaper, as her company bought the scrap to resell in China. \u201cThen, every day we were getting nearly 10,000 tons,\u201d she said.By 2010, Ms. Ma had built a global conglomerate of companies that accounted for a fifth of all imports and exports between the two countries.On the day in 2006 when North Korea carried out its first nuclear test, she said, she happened to be meeting with executives from one of the country\u2019s biggest state companies, who expressed pride in the test. She described North Koreans as educated and worldly despite being so isolated, though her travels also showed her the deprivation many ordinary Koreans face.\u201cNorth Korea has computers; it has Coca-Cola,\u201d she told Southern Weekly, \u201cbut North Korea is still North Korea.\u201dEach new round of sanctions disrupted business but then opened up other avenues. In 2009, under President Barack Obama, the United States imposed sanctions on Korea Kwangson Banking Corp., one of North Korea\u2019s most prominent banks, charging it with financing two companies involved in the country\u2019s missile and arms trade.In the months that followed, according to American prosecutors and independent researchers, Ms. Ma\u2019s company opened or acquired new subsidiaries and shell companies in Hong Kong and other offshore havens. The purpose, they said, was to trade with the bank and other North Korean entities, as well as to launder money and import prohibited materials used in weapons making.Dandong Hongxiang added 28 subsidiaries in the two years after the sanctions on Korea Kwangson, according to a report by C4ADS, a research organization in Washington devoted to security issues, and the Sejong Institute in Seoul.The Public Security Department in Liaoning, where Dandong is, responded by announcing an investigation, but the government said virtually nothing until the State Council Information Office issued its statement last week. Articles that had initially appeared in state media were later censored, suggesting an effort to minimize attention to the case.During recent visits to Dandong, few people would discuss Ms. Ma. Some companies linked to Dandong Hongxiang continue to function, including a transportation subsidiary occupying an office with an expansive view of the Friendship Bridge that crosses the Yalu River into North Korea. A woman who seemed to be in charge brusquely refused to answer questions.In late December, another North Korean restaurant continued to operate, as did a gallery nearby selling paintings by North Korean artists. The businesses are registered in Ms. Ma\u2019s name, though her husband manages them, according to workers there. \u201cHis wife was arrested, but he is fine,\u201d one said.Ms. Ma herself once seemed to foresee the risks of her business. \u201cIf there is any change in the political situation,\u201d she told Southern Weekly, \u201cour business can be smashed to pieces.\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan, Karoline Kan and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unveiling Performance Space New York", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "Performance Space 122 has a new name and renovated digs. Jenny Schlenzka, its director, envisions a \u201cvital center for community.\u201dSupported byWith the updated home comes an updated name: Performance Space New York.Jenny Schlenzka, Performance Space\u2019s artistic and executive director, said the organization had decided \u201cnothing would be too holy to be rethought.\u201d The new name, she added, \u201cis signaling an ambition to be relevant and accessible to all of New York.\u201d\u201cI did not expect to wait more than a year for my own program to start, and that made the job a little more difficult,\u201d she said recently. \u201cOn the other hand, it was a complete luxury \u2014 for example with the rebrand, it gave me the time to talk to many people and really think this through.\u201dThe rebranding process, as the new name indicates, involves an effort to make Performance Space more welcoming to a wider audience. In its grungier former life, which began in 1980 when a group of artists took over an abandoned schoolhouse on First Avenue, the space fostered a certain sense of community, but it didn\u2019t quite scream \u201ccome in.\u201d As Mr. Gantner said in a phone interview: \u201cIt was these giant steel doors that were locked except at quarter of 8, when the show was about to go up and we opened the box office. It was actually a bit intimidating.\u201dMs. Schlenzka, who is from Berlin and moved to New York in 2002, said she hoped to reach people who might be \u201cscared or skeptical\u201d of performance and to attract a more culturally diverse crowd. She envisions a \u201cvital center for community\u201d that\u2019s bustling day and night, with the help of free daytime exhibitions and partnerships with co-tenants. (Performance Space shares the building with several other arts and social service organizations.)\u201cIf our audience could be a representation of the city, that would be a huge success,\u201d she said, noting that downtown dance and theater audiences tend to be predominantly white. But the idea of separate audience-building initiatives doesn\u2019t interest her. \u201cI\u2019ve been in these meetings about \u2018Oh, we need to diversify our audience,\u2019 and it\u2019s always, \u2018Let\u2019s do a side program\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s do a community day.\u2019 But I don\u2019t want a community day. I want the community to be the main program.\u201dMs. Schlenzka plans to organize her programming around themes \u2014 to offer \u201ca way in\u201d for newcomers, she said \u2014 beginning with the East Village. From Feb. 17 to June 30, the East Village Series will examine the history of Performance Space and its neighborhood, reflecting on forces that have shaped them: gentrification, the AIDS epidemic, and punk and club culture. Ms. Schlenzka likened it to \u201cthe way that in psychoanalysis, you have to know your past to free yourself to conquer the future.\u201dNostalgia, she added, is off limits: \u201cWe have this amazing past that in my opinion not enough people know about. But it can drag us down, and that\u2019s a fine line to navigate.\u201d\u201cThe idea of our installation is to create something that mirrors the spaces that are no longer that active,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make sure that every kid in the neighborhood knows about it.\u201dMr. Houston-Jones said that while Performance Space had always been home to hybrid work, Ms. Schlenzka was taking interdisciplinarity to the next level.\u201cI think performance is always foremost in her vision,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she\u2019s eager to let other forms, like skateboarders, come into that vision.\u201dMs. Schlenzka, who is the third director of Performance Space and the first woman to hold the position, said that in her previous job at MoMA PS1 she became aware of her tendency to program mostly straight white men \u2014 70 percent in her first MoMA PS1 season, she calculated. She made an effort to push back against that and highlight artists of different backgrounds.\u201cI don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with being a woman, but I find it so much more interesting to bring these voices forward,\u201d she said.Reconciling her vision with her predecessor\u2019s has not always been easy. When she took the job, Ms. Schlenzka canceled Performance Space\u2019s involvement in five shows that Mr. Gantner had been shepherding, largely for financial reasons, she said in the fall.\u201cShe didn\u2019t offer any kind of conversation around it; she just said, \u2018I made this decision to cancel it,\u2019\u201d said the video artist Brian Rogers, who had been in communication with Mr. Gantner for over a year. Mr. Rogers, who is also director of the Chocolate Factory Theater in Queens, said Ms. Schlenzka paid him a kill fee and tried to find a new home for his work, a search that didn\u2019t pan out.While she found alternate homes for most of the other shows, Ms. Schlenzka said the process caused her \u201csleepless nights.\u201dHer decision to cancel Coil after this year was also pragmatic, she said, allowing her to develop more year-round and daytime programming.As artists get to know the revamped Performance Space, they may find themselves missing its old quirks, but also noticing new ones. Ms. Kravas said that while preparing for \u201cvisions of beauty\u201d in the large theater last week, she spotted a storage room above the stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Years After a Breakthrough at Sundance, Trying to Break Through Again", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year at the festival, which runs through Jan. 28, the program Women at Sundance is acknowledging Ms. Harris on the 25th anniversary of the movie. Ms. Harris has yet to make another feature, though not for lack of trying. In an interview mid-festival, the filmmaker (whose husband is a photographer for The New York Times) discussed how she got her small movie made, the current climate of independent filmmaking and why it has been so difficult to make a follow-up. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.In the end credits of \u201cJust Another Girl on the I.R.T.,\u201d you dubbed it \u201cA Film Hollywood Dared Not Do.\u201d Could you talk about what the filmmaking climate was like when you decided to make this?At the time, it was all about \u201cBoyz N the Hood,\u201d \u201cJuice,\u201d \u201cHangin\u2019 With the Homeboys.\u201d It was all male-centric. Those movies gave me the impetus to write a contemporary film from a black woman\u2019s point of view. But it\u2019s interesting because even now I have a fan base. Young people love the movie and I get tweets about it. They\u2019ve seen it on Amazon or Netflix.What are new fans responding to?They like that she was rocking the natural hair, the Senegalese twist. She was very political and stood up for herself and for injustice. She\u2019s not silent, she\u2019s not just the girlfriend, the mother, the daughter. I wanted her to have a full-fledged life herself.Did you feel like you were breaking ground when you made it?How does it feel to be back at Sundance? I feel like this is the place to be right now because there\u2019s change.Were there movies you had seen that represented your experience before you decided to make your film?I studied film in France and I\u2019m a big international film buff. I love Godard, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, Mizoguchi. These filmmakers often focused on a woman\u2019s story. Also Spike\u2019s film \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d I liked that it was about one woman\u2019s journey. But, it was from a male\u2019s point of view. Still good though.So you\u2019re saying that although Spike Lee\u2019s film stars a woman character, you feel the character is written more like how a man would see her?Yep.How did you get your movie made?I actually submitted my script to some of the mini majors [studio divisions]. One person said, \u201cWe love the script, we think it\u2019s great. But could you make her boyfriend, Tyrone, a drug dealer?\u201d I said no, I wouldn\u2019t change it. So I ended up starting a company and raising money myself through grants.But we ran out of money in post. I sent a script to the writer Terry McMillan. She sent a check to help. Also Michael Moore saw a rough cut of the film and he helped, too.And he said yes.You also asked him about what the mostly male, white Hollywood execs could do to help open doors for more people of color.What\u2019s happening with the film you said you\u2019d give Michael Moore a role in?We\u2019re still trying to get financing. It\u2019s still rare to have a black director, writer and producer making a film with a black lead female character. This one is about a cinema professor. It\u2019s called \u201cI Love Cinema.\u201dHas this been the case ever since \u201cJust Another Girl?\u201dHow do you think more change will happen?Well I think art really reflects our society. And maybe now with more women speaking up and having their voices be heard, we can see a shift. Maybe if we had more black executives, they would see the importance of these stories. I mean, how can you not do a film about Bessie Coleman?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hauling the Internet to an Ex-Soviet Outpost High in the Caucasus Mountains", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "\nSeveral months ago, a team of men ascended the Greater Caucasus Mountains in Georgia. They led horses loaded with electrical wire, solar panels, batteries, toolboxes and drills powerful enough to grind through rock.With jagged ridgelines above and shadowed valleys below, the men were on a quest to bring the internet to one of the world\u2019s most remote places: Tusheti, a rural province on the Russian border.Tusheti\u2019s clean air, crisp blue skies and mountain-studded landscape already attract some tourists, but government officials think there is potential for many more. Access to the internet will make it easier for travelers to book reservations online, but it will also stir e-commerce and local business development, and give a lift to health care and education services in the area.For now, though, Tusheti has little electricity, and maybe more sheep than people.For centuries, Tusheti\u2019s rugged terrain has encouraged a nomadic lifestyle that continues to this day. Shepherds roam the mountainsides with their flocks in the summer, and then move down to more temperate pastures for the rest of the year.Many people who aren\u2019t shepherds do the same. For much of the year, they live in lowland communities near Tusheti that have schools, hospitals and, yes, internet service. Come summer, they return to the rocky slopes.In Shenako, one of several dozen villages in the region, only one couple stays through the winter. As the weeks pass, other people arrive by helicopter, hitching a ride on the Georgian Border Police\u2019s monthly trips to change crews at border outposts.For the workers on the internet mission, time could feel short.Dusk was coming on fast when the crew reached Bochorna, a tiny hamlet whose 7,700-foot elevation makes it the highest continuously inhabited village in Europe, according to the Georgian government. The workers\u2019 chief focus: establishing an internet connection for the lone year-round resident, Irakli Khvedaguridze, a 76-year-old doctor.When winter arrives, the government pays Dr. Khvedaguridze to buy medical supplies; if he runs out of anything, a border police helicopter delivers what he needs.He spends the winter treating the sick in nearby communities, reading medical journals and listening to the radio. When he needs company, he goes into Omalo, one of Tusheti\u2019s larger villages, on his homemade skis.Although he had no computer or smartphone, he was curious about how it all worked.  His first thought: people without cell coverage would now be able to call him in the winter if they were sick or injured.\u201cIt will be easier to get in touch now,\u201d he said.Financed largely through a $40,000 grant from the Internet Society, a global nonprofit, the workers came from local organizations: the Tusheti Development Fund, the Small and Medium Telecommunications Operators\u2019 Association and Freenet, a local internet service provider. They offered materials or services for free, or at little cost. They all felt a connection of some kind to the Tusheti mountains.\u201cI am originally from the mountains,\u201d said Ucha Seturi, a lawyer and engineer who is coordinating the project.  \u201cThe mountain people are a little bit separate from the rest of society. They are not developing. So for me it\u2019s really important to create real points of connection with the rest of society so they can develop.\u201dMany people in nearby communities are quite familiar with the allure of the internet. Temuri Babulaidze, whose father helped start the Tusheti Development Fund, enjoys playing online video games at the family\u2019s home in Kvemo Alvani, a town where many Tushetians live in the winter.In addition to the residents of 26 villages in Tusheti who will now be able to log on to the internet, dozens of hostels and small hotels will benefit from the service.\u201cTourism is a beacon of hope for us,\u201d said Ia Buchaidze, who owns a local bakery, \u201cand the internet is very important for that.\u201dNot everyone is happy with the change.\u201cIt's not good,\u201d said Yochanan Herman, an Israeli traveler who was hiking the mountains, \u201cbecause there are not many places in the world without Internet.\u201dThe long days in the mountains can be hazardous for the entire crew, including the horses. The men watched helplessly one day as a packhorse stumbled and plunged off the trail, rolling down like a barrel and scattering its load as it tumbled.The horse eventually righted itself, but it was bleeding beneath its saddle blanket. It would be O.K., the workers learned. They combed the hillside for its load. Two toolboxes were smashed; among the other casualties was a power inverter. That was a major problem: Without it, the heavy drill wouldn\u2019t work.The masts holding internet antennas were not the only towers visible on the mountainsides. There were also skeletal memorials to the Communist era: pylons that carried electricity across the border from the Soviet Union into Tusheti and the rest of Georgia.The towers remain, but the power lines are gone, pulled down after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.There were other reminders of that era: villages abandoned after, some residents say, the Soviets forced people off the mountains.The internet network is helping stir a turnaround for Tusheti. In the past year, a new, 100-bed hotel was proposed for Omalo. There is talk of a major ski resort and a new roadway.The internet will undoubtedly bring the world closer to Tusheti. The question is whether its rustic otherworldliness will disappear.Nyani Quarmyne is a freelance photographer (represented by Panos Pictures) whose work has focused on environmental issues and social justice.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a boy who enjoys playing online video games in his home in the town of Kvemo Alvani.

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Texts and Dueling Memos Escalate Fight Over Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee chairman on Wednesday that it was \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d for Republicans to push to release a committee memo that draws on classified information to portray the origins of the Russian investigation as scandalous.In a letter to Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the committee, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, stressed that the committee had refused to show the memo to the F.B.I.\u201cWe do not understand why the committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the intelligence community,\u201d Mr. Boyd wrote.The rebuke came as Democrats announced that they had drafted their own classified memo based on the same underlying materials to rebut Mr. Nunes. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called the Republicans\u2019 document extraordinarily misleading.The moves to curb Mr. Nunes by the Democrats as well as by Mr. Boyd, a Trump administration appointee, came during sharply escalating partisan conflict over the Russia investigation. Republicans and conservative commentators have increasingly argued that the investigation derives from a conspiracy by biased law enforcement officials seeking to sabotage President Trump. Democrats, in turn, have accused Republicans of constructing a false narrative in an attempt to undermine the inquiry on behalf of Mr. Trump.The Republican memo, which was written by Mr. Nunes\u2019s staff, is said to claim that the F.B.I. abused its powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to spy on the Trump campaign. Democrats did not know it existed until a committee meeting last week, during which its members voted along party lines to share it with the rest of the House.But people familiar with the underlying application have portrayed the Republican memo as misleading in part because Mr. Steele\u2019s information, which was also compiled into a notorious dossier, was insufficient to meet the standard for a FISA warrant. The application, they said, drew on other intelligence that the Republican memo misleadingly omits \u2014 but revealing that other information to rebut the memo would risk blowing other sources and methods of intelligence-gathering about Russia.The Justice Department is \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing relating to the FISA process,\u201d Mr. Boyd wrote. He also revealed that Mr. Nunes has not personally examined the underlying materials on which his memo is based, but rather had delegated that task to Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. Mr. Boyd also wrote that the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, had personally asked to let the bureau see a copy of the memo, but had been rebuffed.A spokesman for Mr. Nunes, Jack Langer, said: \u201cAgencies that are under investigation by congressional committees don\u2019t typically get access to the committees\u2019 investigative documents about them, and it\u2019s no surprise these agencies don\u2019t want the abuses we\u2019ve found to be made public. Furthermore, there were no limitations placed on disseminating this information, and we will continue to fulfill our oversight responsibilities in accordance with House rules.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Schiff refused to discuss the details of the dispute, but said the Republican memo \u201cis misleading in what it says, and it\u2019s misleading in what it omits.\u201dMr. Schiff portrayed the report as part of a campaign dating to Mr. Nunes\u2019s announcement in the spring that he intended to tell the White House that the Obama administration had improperly \u201cunmasked\u201d the identities of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates in intelligence reports. It later emerged that Mr. Nunes had learned that from Mr. Trump\u2019s aides at the White House, and other Republicans concluded that there had been no improper unmasking.Mr. Schiff said that Democrats would ask the committee on Monday to make their rival memo available to the House on the same terms as the Republican memo, and that if the president declassified the Republican document, he should do the same for the Democratic version. But Mr. Schiff said that he thought the better course was for both memos to remain classified.The texts between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page provided more fuel for the partisan rancor.Other people familiar with the texts agreed that they showed the two officials expressing many negative opinions about Mr. Trump and his team \u2014 like declaring \u201cwhat a disaster\u201d after learning that Jeff Sessions would be the attorney general.But one of those people, a Democratic congressional aide, maintained that Republicans\u2019 insinuations that the texts also showed signs of a conspiracy was based on cherry-picking and portraying as sinister phrases that, in context, were instead tongue-in-cheek banter.For example, the aide said the reference to a \u201csecret society\u201d the day after the election occurred in an exchange between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page in which one noted: \u201cAre you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.\u201dAnother person familiar with that exchange said the team had bought Russia-theme calendars to give out to the agents and analysts investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the election, and in light of the election results, Ms. Page was making a dark joke about the gag gifts.The F.B.I. has also informed Congress that it discovered that the bureau did not preserve text messages between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page between mid-December 2016 and mid-May 2017. It blamed misconfigured software that prevented the automatic retention of such data from many bureau officials who were using Samsung 5 phones provided by the F.B.I.Mr. Trump suggested that the missing texts were worse than Watergate, the scandal that brought down Richard M. Nixon, comparing the months of missing messages to the 18.5 minutes of crucial White House tape that was mysteriously erased after the Watergate break-in.\u201cWhen you look at five months, this is the late, great Rose Mary Woods, right?\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to Nixon\u2019s secretary, who took the blame for inadvertently erasing part of a taped conversation between him and his chief of staff three days after the burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters.\u201cThis is a large-scale version,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat was 18 minutes; this was five months.\u201d\u201cThey say it\u2019s 50,000 texts, and it\u2019s prime time,\u201d he added, referring incorrectly to the number of texts between the two officials that the Justice Department inspector general has reviewed. The number of missing texts is not known. \u201cThat\u2019s disturbing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the F.B.I. official who made reference to a \u201csecret society\u201d the day after the election.

{"Headline": "Liberia\u2019s Next Fight?", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission, which was set up by the Sirleaf administration, has opened 21 investigations, but only a handful of relatively low-level cases have been prosecuted so far. Ms. Sirleaf herself appointed three sons to key government positions; she maintains they were qualified, but the perception of nepotism has stuck.\u201cI don\u2019t think people understand the awesomeness of the destruction of this country \u2014 its institutions, its infrastructure, its law, its morals.\u201dMs. Sirleaf may also have weakened her own hand by governing well. Dictators of years past ruled by fiat or by weighting nothing-for-nothing bargains with a simple, loaded question: \u201cYou have a daughter, right?\u201d Ms. Sirleaf removed brute force from Liberia\u2019s political playbook. Political violence has abated. The rule of law and respect for the legislature\u2019s constitutional role as a counterweight to the executive have been restored. But these changes have also emboldened political competition, complicating other types of reform.No longer fearing reprisals for opposing the president, politicians have newfound influence. Lawmakers have taken to holding legislative items hostage, making material demands when the time comes to pass budgets, allocate money for schools, confirm political appointees or enact laws.Her leverage limited by the tools of democratic governance, Ms. Sirleaf used \u201ccash violence,\u201d in Liberian slang, or the persuasive powers of the purse, to bring political competitors to her side. She gave or withheld government positions and contracts, and used off-the-book inducements.Such structural problems resist easy fixes and the odds rarely favor reformers, but at certain moments \u2014 such as during political transitions \u2014 narrow windows of opportunity open. Mr. Weah is in such a moment, because Liberia, while still fragile, has passed through the period when restoring stability had to be an absolute priority. He can now turn to smaller technical fixes that did not even appear on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s radar.For starters, Mr. Weah could set new expectations for greater accountability by promptly issuing an executive order asking all government ministries and agencies to publish their monthly expenditures. It\u2019s a simple step, but it could have an outsized impact on combating government fraud by opening spending to public scrutiny.Mr. Weah should instruct the finance ministry to allocate funds only to government entities with an approved procurement plan. Government contracts for goods and services \u2014 which, officials have told me, can account for up to 50 percent of the total budget \u2014 offer easy opportunities for graft. Just 41 percent of government entities currently have such plans even though those are required by law. Tying funding to compliance would change this practice is no time.Mr. Weah faces a moment of consequence and a rare opportunity to build on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s successes. She brought Liberia back from the dead. Now it\u2019s his turn to nurture the country\u2019s fledgling institutions by taking on its coercive, corrupt political culture.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for Liberia\u2019s national legislative body. It is the National Assembly, not Parliament.Benjamin Spatz, a scholar at the United States Institute of Peace, served on the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia in 2012\u201315.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. May Back a Vietnam Coal Plant. Russia Is Already Helping.", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONG PHU, Vietnam \u2014 The towering lattice of blue steel girders rising above banana and lemongrass crops near Vietnam\u2019s southern coast stands as public testament to the country\u2019s drive to burn coal.With help from a Kremlin-connected Russian bank, Vietnam is building a coal-fired power plant called Long Phu 1 that will produce an estimated 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, generating enough electricity to power millions of homes.But the project needs something else first: help from the United States government.The plant\u2019s state-controlled owner has applied for assistance with the project from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. If the bank agrees, American taxpayers will shoulder the financial risk behind Vietnam\u2019s purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of turbines and other equipment from General Electric.In addition, it would provide American backing for a project partly funded by a Russian bank that has endured sanctions by the United States government since 2014 because of Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine.Support within the Ex-Im Bank is not clear. In a statement, the bank said it was reviewing the application to determine whether it complied with international rules and the bank\u2019s environmental policy.\u201cOur work on the Long Phu project supports the Vietnamese government\u2019s goal of bringing power to approximately four million Vietnamese people, while also supporting hundreds of U.S. jobs,\u201d said Una Pulizzi, a General Electric spokeswoman.In Vietnam, the project is part of a burst of spending to meet rising electricity needs and support a fast-growing economy.Thai Thuy Hang, for example, opened a restaurant near the construction site several months ago. Now she serves humble fare like rice and chicken feet to hungry construction workers. She said that she planned to recoup her $9,000 investment within a year \u2014 even if the project ran into problems.\u201cNo one likes risk like me,\u201d she said.Developing countries building fossil-fuel projects have found that the number of places they can turn to for help has dwindled.Vietnam sees coal as central to its energy needs. Long Phu 1, which is being built by PetroVietnam, a state energy company, would be the first element of a three-plant complex and burn coal from Australia or Indonesia.Several advocacy groups say that PetroVietnam\u2019s environmental due diligence underestimated the project\u2019s likely carbon footprint. They also say the project is not clean enough to meet new guidelines from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of developed nations that includes the United States and that has tried to curb lending by government-owned export credit agencies to certain types of coal projects.By approving the project, the United States would be \u201cthumbing our nose to all the other countries that have striven so hard to reach this agreement,\u201d said Doug Norlen, the director of economic policy at Friends of the Earth, a nonprofit group that opposes Long Phu 1.\u201cIt\u2019s striking in some ways to me that this is a project the Trump administration might pursue,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Toole, a former Treasury official who helped design American sanctions on Russia.\u201cIf you hold Russia accountable, you don\u2019t do stuff like this with them,\u201d he added.VEB did not respond to an emailed list of questions.Activists who oppose the project also say that by approving it the Ex-Im Bank would risk violating an O.E.C.D. convention designed to prevent export credit agencies from forming a partnership with corrupt foreign officials. On Monday, Dinh La Thang, PetroVietnam\u2019s former chairman, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for economic mismanagement, in an anticorruption push that experts widely regard as more a reflection of political infighting than a desire to eliminate graft in Vietnam, a one-party state.Mat Tromme, a senior research fellow at the Bingham Center for the Rule of Law in London who previously worked on anticorruption projects in Vietnam, said that proving a violation of the O.E.C.D. convention could be difficult because its definition of corruption can be vague.But he said that it was \u201crelatively easy\u201d to see how the case could fall within the convention\u2019s provisions, and that the Ex-Im Bank might feel pressure from export credit agencies in countries like Britain, Canada and Germany that have what he called \u201ctough\u201d positions against bribery and corruption.PetroVietnam officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Ex-Im Bank said it would consider any evidence of mismanagement.Work on the project is already underway. On a recent weekday, welding sparks could be seen inside the skeleton of the plant, which is about the size of an office building.Le Thi Tam, who lives nearby, said that officials had paid her about $2,400 to relinquish her farmland on what is now the project site. Pollution from the plant is a concern, Ms. Tam said, but that is hardly worth complaining about.\u201cIt\u2019s government policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWho can argue with that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Katerra, a Construction Start-Up, Raises $865 Million", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow it has drawn support from one of the biggest and most disruptive backers of start-ups around.Katerra plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $865 million in a new round of financing led by SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, the nearly $100 billion investment vehicle that has shaken up the world of venture capital.In Katerra, the Vision Fund and other investors \u2014 they include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Soros Fund Management \u2014 are backing a start-up that is approaching the $12 trillion construction industry in a new way. The company\u2019s founders include Michael Marks, a former chief executive of the electronics company now known as Flex; Jim Davidson, a founder of Silver Lake, the technology investment firm; and Fritz H. Wolff, the executive chairman of the Wolff Company, the real estate private equity firm.Katerra, which has its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., is essentially a one-stop shop for buildings, from architectural design through the actual construction. It obtains the materials itself and creates components at its factory in Phoenix. It has formed a network of suppliers around the world.The idea, according to Mr. Marks, is to approach construction more like a factory run by Toyota, which is known for efficient mass production, rather than the current method of assembling disparate components in a less organized fashion. The business model has similarities to that of the electronics industry, which Mr. Marks and one of the company\u2019s biggest investors, Foxconn, know well.The idea is to not have every building be a one-off prototype, the company says.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking how poorly things work,\u201d Mr. Marks said of the construction industry in a telephone interview. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of quality processes throughout the system.\u201dBy contrast, Katerra\u2019s approach, he contends, allows clients to save money and erect buildings like offices and multifamily homes more quickly.While Katerra loses money now, Mr. Marks said that the company was on track to become profitable as soon as next year.That different approach had already drawn the interest of prominent investors like Foxconn; DFJ, the venture capital firm; and Louis Bacon, the hedge fund mogul. About four months ago, Katerra began talks on raising a new round of capital, and a number of connections \u2014 including Foxconn\u2019s chief executive, Terry Gou, and Jerry Yang, the Yahoo co-founder \u2014 put the start-up\u2019s leaders in touch with Masayoshi Son of SoftBank.\u201cKaterra is leveraging the latest technologies to radically transform the way people build,\u201d Jeffrey Housenbold, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement.As part of the investment, Mr. Housenbold and Adam Fisher of the Soros fund will join Katerra\u2019s board.While Mr. Marks declined to comment on the valuation that this new round has bestowed upon Katerra, he said that it was a sizable step up from the roughly $1 billion of the previous round.The new money will allow Katerra to build yet more factories \u2014 up to four over the next few years \u2014 and finance more research and development, he added.Further down the line, Mr. Marks said, is an initial public offering.\u201cOver time we expect that we might get offers, but this is intended to stay an independent company,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a public company at some point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was the unsalaried chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1977 to 1985.\u201cHe worked on the political side of the street in other parts of his life,\u201d Mr. Goldmark said, \u201cbut I only saw him in public service \u2014 and he was superb: generous, fair, farseeing and, thank God, with a sense of humor.\u201dIn addition to his government posts, Mr. Sagner was a founder, in 1960, of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which favored self-determination for that country until the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and Fidel Castro\u2019s public embrace of socialism. And he was an investor in The Nation magazine, when Victor Navasky was installed as its editor in 1977.Mr. Sagner was a board member of Business Executives for National Security, a nonpartisan group that seeks to moderate government spending without jeopardizing economic or military security, and an early supporter of J Street, the liberal Washington-based lobbying group formed in 2007 that supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Alan Louis Sagner, a grandson of immigrants from Eastern Europe, was born on Sept. 13, 1920, in Baltimore to Samuel Sagner, a men\u2019s clothing manufacturer, and the former Mary Rappoport.He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Maryland and a master\u2019s from Columbia.

The Jayhawks lost to Texas Tech on Tuesday, 85-73. It\u2019s unusual enough for Kansas to lose any game, but this defeat also came at home, the third such loss for the men\u2019s basketball team this season.Kansas has always been particularly dominant at home. Last season, it lost just one regular-season game at home, to Iowa State in overtime. The previous two seasons, it lost none at all.Texas Tech is one of the many Big 12 teams to regularly report for a thrashing at Allen Fieldhouse. The Red Raiders had been 0-17 at Kansas before Tuesday.Kansas now stands at 11-3, and 1-1 in the Big 12. That might not seem to be a terrible record, but consider that Kansas was expected to be great, as usual, this season. The team, which was the 2008 national champion, has made the round of 16 nine times in Self\u2019s 14 years.Kansas\u2019 preseason Associated Press ranking was No. 4, but it is now No. 10, and should drop some more after this loss.Before the season, Self\u2019s total of conference championships, 13, exceeded his total losses at Allen Fieldhouse, 10. The loss total at the fieldhouse is now 12, and there is a good chance it will grow.Kansas had been 101-3 over the previous 10 seasons against major conference opponents at home, ESPN reported.Kansas is not a bad team; 11-3 against a good schedule is certainly creditable. It ranks in the top 10 in field-goal percentage and the top 20 in 3-point shooting.But its long record of success has led to much higher expectations: home-court dominance, a Big 12 title every year, a deep N.C.A.A. run.Kansas lost its two top scorers, Frank Mason and Josh Jackson. Both were drafted into the N.B.A., and Jackson went No. 4 over all. But elite programs in this era lose top players every year.That means the Jayhawks may have to live and die by the 3. Against Texas in their previous game, they were 17 for 35 and won by 6. On Tuesday, they were 6 for 26.Devonte\u2019 Graham is the team\u2019s top player, and he has taken a step forward this year. But teams dependent on 6-2 seniors don\u2019t tend to be national championship contenders.Besides the embarrassing home losses, the team has some good wins, including an early one against Kentucky. But a game Saturday at T.C.U., ranked 16th, could send the Jayhawks to 1-2 in the Big 12. West Virginia and Oklahoma are also having strong seasons and are ranked in the top 10. Kansas may not get its usual stroll to a Big 12 title.Advertisement"}

But he has, in the past, proposed adding a second Channel Tunnel for road traffic, in addition to the one that opened a generation ago for trains.The idea of a bridge more than 20 miles long may be no more than a trial balloon by Mr. Johnson.

Engineers, business moguls and government officials have talked about Channel bridges and tunnels since the Victorian era.The Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994, cost more than $10 billion to build, and was not heavily used at first, raising questions about whether it was worth the expense. But it now carries more than 10 million passengers and more than 20 million tons of freight annually.Elian Peltier contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.B.I. Condemns Push to Release Secret Republican Memo", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. clashed publicly with President Trump for the first time on Wednesday, condemning a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo that purports to show how the bureau and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Trump wants to see the memo released, telling people close to him that he believes it makes the case that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials acted inappropriately when they sought the highly classified warrant in October 2016 on the campaign adviser, Carter Page.Those changes, Mr. Schiff argued, meant that the committee should halt the review process and vote on the new, altered memo \u2014 a proposition that could potentially take days.Republicans quickly rejected Mr. Schiff\u2019s charge, saying that it was a \u201cstrange attempt to thwart publication of the memo.\u201d\u201cThe committee minority is now complaining about minor edits to the memo, including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the F.B.I. and by the minority themselves,\u201d a statement from Mr. Nunes\u2019s spokesman, Jack Langer, said. \u201cThe vote to release the memo was absolutely procedurally sound, and in accordance with House and committee rules.\u201dIt was not immediately clear whether Mr. Schiff\u2019s claim would have any effect on the outcome.The president\u2019s stance on the memo puts him at odds with much of his national security establishment. The Justice Department has warned repeatedly that the memo, prepared by Republican staff members on the House Intelligence Committee, is misleading and that its release would set a bad precedent for making government secrets public, including sensitive sources of information and methods of intelligence gathering. F.B.I. officials have said privately that the president is prioritizing politics over national security and is putting the bureau\u2019s reputation at risk.A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Nunes, of California, described the F.B.I. objections as \u201cspurious\u201d and accused the two law enforcement agencies of making \u201cmaterial omissions\u201d to Congress and the courts.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counterintelligence investigation during an American political campaign,\u201d Mr. Nunes said in a statement. \u201cOnce the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again.\u201dPeople who have read the three-and-a-half-page memo say it contends that officials from the F.B.I. and the Justice Department were not forthcoming to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge in seeking the warrant. It says the officials relied on information assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, without adequately explaining to the judge that Democrats had financed the research.Under the rule, Mr. Trump has five days from the time of the vote to try to stop the release for national security reasons.Democrats have called the Republican document a dangerous effort to build a narrative to undercut the department\u2019s investigation into whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with Russians and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. They say it uses cherry-picked facts assembled with little or no context and could do lasting damage to faith in federal law enforcement.The F.B.I. statement ran counter to the decidedly low-key approach that Mr. Wray has taken as director, avoiding news media interviews and delivering anodyne speeches to law enforcement groups. He had worked quietly in the hopes of keeping the F.B.I. out of the president\u2019s cross hairs.Stephanie Douglas, a former top F.B.I. executive, said Mr. Wray had to act on his concerns.\u201cHis role as the F.B.I. director is about credibility,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s obligated by his role to speak the truth. I think he did the right thing. That\u2019s his job. If he didn\u2019t say something about a document lacking factual accuracy, he would have to make up for a lot of lost trust.\u201dMr. Wray had strongly objected to the move to release the memo and was allowed to review it only on Sunday, after Mr. Nunes relented. Mr. Wray made a last-ditch effort on Monday, going to the White House with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to try to persuade the White House to stop the release of the memo. They spoke to John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, but were unsuccessful.Mr. Trump could only block the release of the memo, not make it public himself, but with his approval, House Republicans were expected to move quickly to unveil the document.Ultimately, though, Mr. Trump was eager to see the document released. Even as the White House\u2019s review was continuing, Mr. Trump was overheard on Tuesday night as he exited his first State of the Union address assuring a House Republican that he would see to the document\u2019s release.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump told the lawmaker, Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina. \u201cCan you imagine that?\u201dMr. Wray has followed through. He resisted White House pressure to replace staff members, including Mr. McCabe, who were once loyal to Mr. Comey, to avoid appearing as though he was taking orders from the president in a job that is supposed to be politically independent. Mr. Wray did eventually sideline Mr. McCabe, who stepped down abruptly, but only after finding cause to do so.\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow the facts independently,\u201d he said, \u201cno matter where they lead, no matter who likes it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for a Fixer-Upper in Park Slope", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntShortly after they married five years ago, Themis Haralabides and Tracy Chou bought a one-bedroom co-op in Yorkville, on the Upper East Side.Their duplex, with a spiral staircase, occupied the top floors of a small walk-up building. Over time, they transformed the rooftop deck, with its rotting wood, into an aerie, with planters, benches and lighting.After their daughter, Olivia, arrived nearly two years ago, staying in such a small apartment, with so many stairs, became impractical.So they listed the unit, which they had bought for $522,000, for $718,000.They sold their apartment for $755,000 and, a year ago, began renting a two-bedroom in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, while searching for a more permanent place.They hoped to find a real wreck \u2014 something to renovate \u2014 in a good school district in or near Park Slope, where Mr. Haralabides had previously lived. They wanted a property they could make into a two-family, which would give them rental income.\u201cIf we put some money in and fix it, we will have a great house,\u201d he said. He and Ms. Chou had a budget, for everything, of about $2 million.Mr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou, finding little they could afford, decided to partner with their friends, another couple also searching for a Brooklyn home. One prospect was a charming but decrepit \u2014 it lacked running water \u2014 three-family house on Sixth Avenue in Park Slope, an estate sale asking $2.3 million.The idea for both families to purchase something together was short-lived; both wanted the top floor and the garden. \u201cWe were going to flip a coin,\u201d Ms. Chou said. \u201cWe saw obstacles brewing.\u201d Nobody wanted to risk their friendship if the deal soured.Mr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou\u2019s friends ended up buying a condominium in Clinton Hill. The Park Slope house \u2014 too expensive to go it alone \u2014 later sold for $2.2 million.At around the same time, Mr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou saw a small two-family \u2014 just 15 feet wide \u2014 on busy Ninth Street in Park Slope, asking $1.5 million.It faced a 24-hour CVS Pharmacy. In their price range \u201cthey weren\u2019t going to get a beautiful tree-lined block,\u201d Ms. Syrett said.The couple were less bothered by the traffic than with the unappealing view. The house was in terrible condition, which for them was a plus.\u201cThe termites had chewed through the plaster,\u201d Ms. Syrett said. \u201cIt was like lace. They were fearless,\u201d she said of the couple.Mr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou offered the asking price, but were outbid by a buyer offering $1.55 million.Weary of continuing their search, they briefly considered a just-renovated Prospect Heights two-family for $2.3 million, where they could move right in.This idea, too, was short-lived. \u201cWe wanted to take advantage of our skills and our vision,\u201d Mr. Haralabides said. He also worried about the quality of construction in a house redone by somebody else. Besides, \u201cif we bought something like that, I would miss all the fun,\u201d he said.An unappealing listing appeared on Eighth Avenue in Park Slope \u2014 a modest three-family rowhouse for $1.6 million. At one point, the stoop had been removed, and a front extension built, which had been home to a deli.The interior of the house was rundown and the backyard held an aviary.\u201cIt was really ugly,\u201d Ms. Chou said. \u201cWe knew our competition might be low because of how bad it was.\u201d They soon learned that a developer was interested, but the sellers preferred a family and were glad to disclose that the developer had bid $70,000 over the asking price.\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s not game this \u2014 $70,000 doesn\u2019t make a difference,\u2019\u201d Ms. Chou said. \u201cThemis was hyperventilating.\u201d The price \u2014 considering the work needed \u2014 was already uncomfortably high. They increased their bid to $1.67 million, matching the other offer.They bought the house last spring, using all of their savings and borrowing from their retirement funds, and set to work. \u201cDemolition is an understatement,\u201d Mr. Haralabides said. \u201dWe left brick and some of the joists.\u201dThey chose two small bathrooms over one large one, and added noise insulation between rooms, ceilings and floors. \u201cIt costs very little, but developers don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to fix once you move in.\u201dThe house, which includes a rental unit on the ground floor, is now nearly completed. The family arrived in late December and immediately installed baby gates for Olivia, who is eager to explore the stairs.\u201cIt\u2019s very rewarding to go through all this effort,\u201d Mr. Haralabides said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Wynn disputed that assertion.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIn a surprise decision, the United States International Trade Commission struck down a Commerce Department recommendation to place steep duties on imported Canadian jets.From the NYT\u2019s Ana Swanson:\u201cThe case was brought by Boeing, which accused the Canadian jet maker Bombardier of subsidizing its products and selling them at unfairly low prices in the United States in violation of American trade rules.\u201d\u201dThe Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries aircraft. But the trade commission, a quasi-judicial body of trade experts, disagreed.As is its usual practice, the commission did not explain the factors behind its decision.Critics cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFor the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency, to unanimously reject the arguments of America\u2019s largest exporter and the Trump administration is a stunning rebuke. It suggests that President Donald Trump may find it as hard to back up some of his tough trade talk as trying to dismantle Obamacare and build a wall on the Mexican border.\u201cFor Boeing, the verdict will redouble the pressure it faces to strike a deal with Embraer, whose E-jet family competes head-on with Bombardier.\u201dPresident Trump used his speech to set out his economic record, while seeking to reconcile his \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionist stance with a call for free trade and foreign investment.Mr. Trump took credit for the strong American economy, which he said had followed \u201cyears of stagnation.\u201d He also pointed to rising stock prices, improving consumer and business confidence, and job growth. Growth in gross domestic product since he took office, however, is similar to that of 2014 and 2015.Addressing the World Economic Forum, the Alpine conclave of business and political elites that American presidents have usually shunned, Mr. Trump said he would \u201calways put America first, just as the leaders of other countries should put their countries first.\u201d\u201cBut America first does not mean America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the United States grows, so does the world.\u201dMr. Trump \u2014 never invited when he was a businessman \u2014 also delivered the message that the United States was open for business, appealing for international investment.But he hit one of his favorite themes: that the global free trade regime has often treated the United States unjustly.\u201cWe cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal, because in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.\u201dMr. Trump specifically mentioned theft of intellectual property and central government direction of economies. In the past, he has linked those practices with China, but on Friday he did not do so.\u2014Richard Perez-PenaCritics\u2019 cornerRob Cox and Una Galani of Breakingviews:\u201cWhat was new in Trump\u2019s Davos appearance aside from the style was the framing of his administration\u2019s approach to trade and the like.

The United States \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual-property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "India Clings to Cash, Even as Tech Firms Push Digital Money", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALIGARH, India \u2014 Signs and banners for Paytm, India\u2019s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh\u2019s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads.\u201cPeople recharge in cash,\u201d Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother\u2019s phone.The scene in Mr. Singh\u2019s shop underscores a persistent reality of India\u2019s economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms.\u201cCash is convenient,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google\u2019s products for emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous. You can use it everywhere.\u201dOne reason for tech companies\u2019 optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month.Leading India\u2019s budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India\u2019s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians\u2019 financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.\u201cOur truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,\u201d he said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm\u2019s plans.The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.Mr. Singh\u2019s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm\u2019s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.\u201cWe really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,\u201d said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.Still, the country\u2019s cash economy has endured.Only one-third of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.\u201cPeople feel scared to use these apps,\u201d Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce \u2014 and collect more taxes.Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.\u201cWe have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,\u201d said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. \u201cThat\u2019s our daily job.\u201dThe job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm\u2019s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. \u201cPeople like to spend money on more than just needs,\u201d he said.Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm\u2019s progress because it\u2019s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company\u2019s chief executive, grew up nearby.On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.The problem? Paytm\u2019s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.\u201cThe only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a culturally different country being built.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed research from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Airborne Opulence to the Upper Upper Upper Class", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "featureFor a private-jet broker, success is all about knowing who\u2019s who in the world\u2019s 0.0001 percent.Supported byThe plane\u2019s opulence \u2014 its seats embroidered with what the reality-TV star claimed was the Trump family crest \u2014 and its billionaire pedigree recalled a venerable tradition of elite mobility, whereby warrior-aristocrats would commission costly ships not just for splendid seafaring and maritime conflict but for exchange among themselves, as gifts befitting their shared station. These practices endured for millenniums, from Pharaonic barges and Chinese imperial dragon boats to medieval Viking galleys (as, in the 10th century, when King Harald Fairhair of Norway presented to King Aethelstan of the West Saxons and the Mercians a purple-sailed vessel with a bow of gold) and British royal yachts, which Queen Victoria lent liberally to friends like the Empress of Austria.The early custodians of the American experiment, with egalitarian ideals and no real use for fancy boats, moved from here to there with relative humility. In 1787, when Thomas Jefferson set out from Paris for a three-month, 1,200-mile visit to American interests in Mediterranean seaports, he took no servants and paid personally to refresh the carriage horses. It was only with the arrival of the train that Americans developed a taste for class-differentiated transit. Perhaps the first private celebrity rail car was built by P.T. Barnum as a touring parlor for the \u201cSwedish nightingale,\u201d Jenny Lind, and soon these were de rigueur among robber barons like Leland Stanford, George Gould and Charles Schwab. William H. Vanderbilt, during the decade-long tenure he enjoyed as the richest man in America, ordered what The Chicago Daily Tribune identified in 1882 as \u201cthe most expensive private vehicle in the world.\u201d The Vanderbilt featured a \u201cgrand saloon\u201d with lavish exterior panels of train depots and suspension bridges rendered in oil, but its owner emphasized not the trappings but the performance: \u201cMr. Vanderbilt has inherited his father\u2019s fondness for fast traveling, and, in a lesser degree, the old Commodore\u2019s partiality for what is known in railroad-parlance as \u2018going special\u2019 \u2014 which is traveling with a special engine, on special time and without regard to the trains and traffic of the road.\u201dYet even after these industrial and financial titans had begun to avail themselves of such perquisites, our heads of state maintained lingering reservations about priority treatment. In late 1863, the government appropriated funds to outfit President Lincoln with a custom rail coach. Later accounts would inflate the car\u2019s extravagance, but according to the assistant master car builder in Alexandria, Va., \u201cAnyone who knew the habits of Mr. Lincoln would scout the idea of his designing an armored car of such luxurious appointments for his own use in going to the front.\u201d The Great Emancipator rode in it but once, when the somber whistle-stop tour of the \u201cLincoln Special\u201d returned his earthly remains to Springfield. It was not until 1942, after aides persuaded President Roosevelt that safety concerns necessitated a special-purpose vehicle, that American commanders in chief took their passage in executive style, in a V.I.P.-retrofitted version of the Pullman Company\u2019s Ferdinand Magellan. In January 1943, the train delivered Roosevelt under cover of night to Miami. He was taken in three legs across the Atlantic on a Boeing 314, the Dixie Clipper, to meet Churchill and De Gaulle in Casablanca. It was the first time a sitting U.S. president had flown.Varsano, who says he has sold or helped to sell almost 300 aircraft over the course of his career, is a large, fit, exceptionally good looking and effortlessly agreeable self-made man of 61. He has an imposing head crowned with slicked-back pewter hair, piercing eyes of an Aegean blue, an imperial nose and the resplendent smile of a beloved crooner on a Caesars Palace pension. He wears suits made by the Ghanaian-British Savile Row designer Ozwald Boateng over worn Italian loafers, and carries a weathered gray Louis Vuitton briefcase with a heavy metal clasp. His business card is milled from galvanized metal. By his estimate, the total value of sales he has brokered exceeds $4 billion.Although Varsano shares the migratory patterns of his clients, and it is not unusual for him to fly from London to New York or Dubai for lunch, he thinks his most effective work is done in a stationary environment. His groundbreaking storefront concept rested on a simple premise, which might be called, in contrast to the \u201cfoot traffic\u201d that animates most retail, Bentley traffic. The scene: A jaded \u201cprincipal,\u201d as the industry refers to owners or potential owners, seated languidly in the rear of a Mulsanne, catches the apparition of a full-scale airplane fuselage glowing in a plate-glass window, removes his Cartier sunglasses and petitions his driver to loop back around. On arrival, these principals are typically received at a back door, asked for a business card and then stalled by reception just long enough \u2014 usually no more than 90 seconds \u2014 for Varsano to locate the V.I.P. in his proprietary worldwide database of owners, then press a button that splashes the store\u2019s enormous display wall with an image of the visitor\u2019s current plane.There aren\u2019t many places on Earth with a large enough community of transient billionaires to support such immoderately high-end retail, but central London is one of them. After much thought about his new location, Varsano decided that the best chance of catching his customers on their brief earthbound dalliances was from a space on Park Lane, which runs along Hyde Park\u2019s eastern perimeter. Varsano declined to divulge the rent, but comparable real estate listings suggest a price of about three-quarters of a million dollars a year. The store\u2019s interior has been furnished as a gallery of sumptuous surfaces: panels of midnight blue velvet offset with enormous beveled mirrors; columns and floors in a storm-cloud-patterned marble; rectilinear sconces of a translucent black-veined marble; timbering of dark lacquered walnut and mahogany; side tables set with purple succulents in glimmering copper spheres and moon-white orchids. To the rear is a clubroom, supervised by a large photograph of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin on an aircraft\u2019s staircase \u2014 Varsano sold Sinatra a Learjet in the early 1980s, though his honor obligated him to tell me it wasn\u2019t the one in the picture \u2014 and Varsano\u2019s personal office, swathed in gray crocodile skin, where he sits, behind an armored door, at a desk once owned by Margaret Thatcher.\u201cGood usage of a private aircraft is about 400 hours a year,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did the math, and my calculation is that even 200 hours of use of a corporate jet adds 33 days to an executive\u2019s year. Now, you bring two or three other execs with him \u2014 do the math, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a free C.E.O.! When the automobile companies came to appear in front of Congress and they got such a hard time for arriving on their corporate jets, they shouldn\u2019t have been so wimpish! They should have said, \u2018Yeah, we came in on a private jet, we have a million employees and we\u2019ve got to fly back tonight at midnight to be in the office at 7 a.m. to save this company.\u2019\u2009\u201dHe picked up an infrared mouse and asked one of the two friends \u2014 a luminously preserved businessman who asked not to be named \u2014 to begin by telling him how much he\u2019d be willing to spend, in theory, on a replacement of his seven-year-old plane.\u201cLet\u2019s say 60 million,\u201d the businessman said. Varsano entered a price setting on the enormous screen\u2019s left sidebar. This number, it should be noted, represented only the price of the aircraft itself. For the larger planes, buyers often spend the same amount of money on personal customization as they do on the initial purchase.\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest trip you do regularly?\u201d\u201cLondon to Los Angeles.\u201d Varsano set the range to 4,700 nautical miles.\u201cHow old a plane would you feel comfortable with?\u201d\u201cNew.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say two years,\u201d Varsano proposed. The businessman looked away from the screen and at Varsano. \u201cO.K., one year.\u201d Varsano clicked the corresponding setting.\u201cHow many passengers?\u201d\u201cFourteen.\u201dVarsano finalized the search, and the screen tiled itself into brochure-quality images of aircraft exteriors. \u201cThere are 13 suitable planes potentially on the market for you.\u201d By \u201con the market,\u201d he meant planes that were either actually advertised somewhere or were technically off-market but, as with anything, available at the right price. Varsano scanned over the images. \u201cShould we include an A.C.J. or a B.B.J., or not one of those big ones?\u201d About 20 years ago, in an attempt to capture a share of what was then an increasingly profitable private market, Boeing and Airbus developed imprints of their companies \u2014 Boeing Business Jets, or B.B.J., and Airbus Corporate Jets, or A.C.J. \u2014 that sell commercial airliners with V.I.P. configurations. These \u201cbizliners\u201d are much larger than a typical private jet, with space for multiple bedrooms and showers or thrones, and use more gas; they can cost from $90 million to $500 million, and as much as $13,000 an hour to run. Individuals, Varsano told me in Geneva, often avoid them because of what the industry calls \u201cramp presence\u201d: The size and bulbousness of a B.B.J. or an A.C.J. invite class resentment, and, worse, might remind onlookers of the easyJet they flew in on. A Gulfstream is regarded as a more prudent and tasteful choice. The G650, Gulfstream\u2019s flagship product, is currently the skyfaring object of greatest desire, and it is no exaggeration to call the $70 million aircraft the world\u2019s single greatest status commodity. Desire for them is so ardent in part because of their physical elegance \u2014 they have a phocine aspect, with a silkily sloping underbelly and large, widely spaced elliptical portholes, with an interior like a conch shell \u2014 and in part because they cut a more discreet profile.\u201cThen we\u2019ll compare three possibilities: a bizliner, a Gulfstream G650 and a Global 6000\u201d \u2014 the last of these a roughly comparable model from the Canadian firm Bombardier. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the ranges,\u201d Varsano proposed, and the screen lit up with a world map, centered on London and overlaid with \u201cmaximum range perimeters\u201d in red, blue and yellow, scrolling across the continents in chromatic sine waves. The ranges swept down from Los Angeles almost to S\u00e3o Paulo before coming back up to the east, to comfortably include Dubai, and then ultimately sweeping in a band between Beijing and Tokyo. The businessman nodded.\u201cNow let\u2019s look at the differences in cross-section.\u201d Three overlapping fuselage outlines appeared on the screen, again in red, blue and yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s a 100 percent scale,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cGet up and stand there.\u201d The businessman measured himself against the images and did not find the dimensions wanting.\u201cO.K., sell me the B.B.J.,\u201d the businessman said, in a failed attempt to seem idly flirtatious.Varsano clicked again. \u201cHere\u2019s the market data, all the B.B.J.s for sale around the world according to our database.\u201d The video wall exhibited a branded, proprietary table with the relevant real-time statistics \u2014 date of manufacture, delivery date, passenger allowance, range, expected price \u2014 for around 20 planes. The top line featured an aircraft that had only a thousand hours on it, which represented either about two and a half years of private use or perhaps a month and a half of commercial deployment. It was located in an Asian country for more than $70 million and had been on the market for almost a year. Varsano scrolled through images, drawn from his firm\u2019s database, of the actual interiors of the available planes, while subtly discouraging the businessman from his instinct to purchase one brand-new. This was in part because delivery of new planes can take a very long time and in part because there is no rational reason for anyone to purchase a new plane, and on some level the idea violates Varsano\u2019s respect for his product\u2019s engineering and durability.\u201cSo, Steve,\u201d the businessman asked, with the merest hint of vulnerability, \u201cwhat would you buy?\u201d\u201cWhat about the Gulfstream?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019d get to L.A. an hour faster, but you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy with the kids and the nannies and the animals.\u201d The businessman, who had both grown children and still-nannied children, said nothing.\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d Varsano continued, \u201cyou have to fly on one of these yourself \u2014 and that means chartering one and taking the whole family to L.A., not just taking an empty one to Milan alone. You won\u2019t have the real experience that way.\u201d\u201cWell, I love the idea of a B.B.J., but I don\u2019t like the noise, the cabin volume.\u201d He paused again. The pretense that this was simply a fun half-drunken near-midnight exercise had been openly abandoned. \u201cThis is coming up. I have to do it sooner rather than later.\u201dVarsano wears special French cuffs with round cutouts to display a saucer-size watch; he glanced down and saw that it was nearly midnight. He stood up and asked us to take our places on the dimly moonlit sidewalk outside. We watched as he ceremonially lifted the shades for the first time, revealing the pristine fuselage bathed in pools of aquamarine and royal blue. Tufts of cumulus, floodlit from below, had been painted on the ceiling above the plane. After just a few moments, Varsano closed the shades again, and the incandescent celestial blue disappeared once more into the reflected red and white flashes of terrestrial traffic.More than one person told me that Varsano probably knew more billionaires personally than anyone alive. He admitted he had never quite gotten used to his current circumstances. Though he had been dealing jets on and off for almost 30 years, for a long time, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really part of this world. I just worked in it.\u201d Varsano was born in Manhattan but raised on the far side of the George Washington Bridge, in the working-class suburbs near Teterboro Airport. Teterboro now hosts the largest share of American private-jet traffic, but back then it was just another local airstrip. He was brought up by a single mother \u2014 his father left his family when Varsano was 5 \u2014 who always worked at least two jobs, as a waitress and in beauty salons, where Varsano swept the floor. When he was 14, a friend\u2019s older brother took him up in a four-seater Cessna. He would work for a month as a dishwasher to be able to afford an hour of flying lessons and got his pilot\u2019s license when he was 17. He went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a prestigious flight academy in Daytona Beach that he calls \u201cthe Harvard of the sky.\u201d It was his first exposure to extreme international wealth, especially the variety that accrued to despots and their associates. \u201cIt was full of kids like the son of Idi Amin, who drove Ferraris around Daytona and would then go back to the military in their country. It was a real who\u2019s who.\u201dHe first worked as an intern at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater airport, then moved to Washington in 1978 for an entry-level job as an aviation lobbyist. The association had a plane he could fly whenever he liked, as long as he paid for gas, but he was making only $13,000 a year. It was the age of disco, and his roommate ran the Apple Tree, \u201cthe hottest club in D.C. It was the place to go, a special elite place.\u201d He worked as a doorman to make gas money for the plane. One day a guy came into the Apple Tree with a Learjet on his tie pin. \u201cThese were the days people used to wear tie pins,\u201d Varsano explained to me. \u201cWhen people used to wear ties.\u201d Varsano went up to him and discovered he worked for a jet brokerage. \u201cI said, Screw this, I want a job there.\u201d The man got him an interview.\u201cI put on the best polyester suit I could find, and I go in there, and everybody\u2019s sitting around in T-shirts and jeans. They told me they never meet their customers. They do it all on the phone. I say, \u2018How do you sell a $5 million plane on the phone?\u2019 But that was just the way the business was done.\u201d They allowed him to work on a commission-only basis. At night he put in shifts as a waiter in McLean, Va., and by day he tried to sell planes. \u201cAt 4 p.m. I\u2019m talking to a guy about a $4 million Learjet, and at 6 p.m. I\u2019m getting yelled at to refill some guy\u2019s coffee. It was a humbling experience, and it kept me grounded. Seven or eight months later, I sold a Westwind II to one of the richest guys in Venezuela.\u201d (He claims that as they neared Miami during the delivery, the Venezuelan\u2019s associates pulled a gun and tried to kidnap him to Caracas, but he managed to escape.)After Varsano sold a plane to the corporate raider Nelson Peltz in the mid-\u201980s, he went to work for him in the world of private equity, where he developed a halfhearted fondness for the Gekko manner. Varsano coordinated Peltz\u2019s purchase and overhaul of High Winds, DeWitt Wallace\u2019s estate in Bedford, N.Y.; Peltz infuriated the local community by flying his helicopter to Manhattan almost daily. (A representative for Peltz disputed Varsano\u2019s account of their relationship but declined to provide specifics.) When Varsano and a subsequent boss acquired some fast-food companies in the early 2000s, he found himself in charge of the developing-market expansion of the Long John Silver\u2019s brand. Each time he visited the offices of Russian oligarchs or Middle Eastern royals, he found they invariably displayed a model of their private planes. They loved the opportunity to talk about them with someone as knowledgeable as Varsano, and he realized that he had stumbled into an enormous opportunity. Fifteen years ago, 85 percent of the private planes in the world were in the United States, but he could see that was changing. The deals he does today bear out this shift. He outlined one example: \u201cRussian owner, Panamanian shell company, Swiss-registered airplane, selling to a Chinese corporation, with the inspection in Switzerland, lawyers in Germany and the U.K. and the escrow agent in the U.S.\u201dVarsano knows his relevant client base down to nearly the last person, and his aim is to maintain up-to-date records on every single one of the six or seven thousand jets that are large enough for the Jet Business to follow. Roughly a quarter of its business is with first-time buyers, but those leads tend to be so dicey that Varsano\u2019s staff dedicates most of its time and energy to plane-owning people and organizations. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a fast-food restaurant,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cit\u2019s easier to get the guy who comes in three times a month to come in four times a month than it is to get a new customer. So we try to check in with all the current owners at least every quarter.\u201dA research staff works on a trading floor behind convexities of smoked glass, at cockpit-like desks of kid-glove Bentley leather with three screens apiece. They begin with an industry-standard subscription database, but its information \u2014 serial number, registration information, sales history, whatever is known of the ownership and any publicly listed current prices \u2014 is almost always incomplete or unreliable, as the most sensitive data is concealed underneath layers of shell companies incorporated in places like Delaware, Panama or the British Virgin Islands. Beyond ferreting out the basic question of ownership, Varsano\u2019s researchers try to gather as much market information as they can. They\u2019ll see that a given plane is going out of warranty in a year or two, or is about to hit the end of a corporate depreciation schedule, or is due for the sort of routine but expensive engine check that regulators require, or they\u2019ll know a new model is due from the factory soon, and they\u2019ll ask if the owner has given any thought to a sale. Varsano is known to represent serious buyers, so if they call and say they\u2019ve got a customer in the market for a G650 or a Falcon 900LX, his researchers are confident they\u2019ll get legitimate (if exaggerated) bid-ask spreads.After a long afternoon with one of his researchers, I mentioned to Varsano that his constant emphasis on the utility of jets was at times hard to square with the tenor of a market that seems to rely so much on appurtenance and churn. Airplanes are so rigorously regulated in their maintenance that there\u2019s practically no difference, outside cockpit avionics and maintenance fees, between a 20-year-old Gulfstream GV and a freshly delivered G650 except that new-plane smell and about $50 million.Varsano had a prepared answer \u2014 about range and cabin pressure and what it\u2019s worth to a chief executive of a $10 billion company to land at his or her destination refreshed and ready to go \u2014 but on some level he\u2019s well aware that his business relies on covetousness and increasingly customized definitions of need. One of the peculiarities of inequality, as psychologists and social scientists have somewhat belatedly come to understand, is that it has a kind of fractal nature. The relationship of the middle class to the rich is replicated in the relationship between the merely rich and the extremely wealthy. Varsano\u2019s target class is so small that these dynamics, here between the extremely wealthy and the unimaginably so, are crystallized on the level of the individual. The owner of a $25 million plane feels morally judicious \u2014 even humble \u2014 insofar as he doesn\u2019t own a $70 million plane, while at the same time he admires that of his neighbor and hopes for an upgrade. The three or four hundred owners of the $70 million plane come to see it in short order not as a luxury but as a business and lifestyle requirement, and are in turn frustrated that the wireless signal isn\u2019t strong enough and that there just aren\u2019t enough landing slots in Hong Kong or hangar spaces for parking in Mumbai.One summer day, my phone rang from an unknown number, and Robbins\u2019s deep but sweetly croaking voice boomed on the line. A few years ago Robbins mentioned to his friend Steve Wynn that it was time for him to buy a plane, and Wynn told him that he was crazy to talk to anyone but Varsano \u2014 that he would never even think of buying a plane from anybody but Varsano. Varsano helped Robbins buy a Bombardier Global Express previously owned by Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival cruises and the owner of the Miami Heat, who had recently decided to upgrade to a Gulfstream G650. Varsano literally had to walk across hot coals to close the deal. Robbins loved the plane. It felt like his second home \u2014 or, to be more precise, his seventh.Robbins told me he was flying to Vancouver that afternoon and said that I was welcome to fly with him in about 10 days\u2019 time from Vancouver to Las Vegas, with a stopover in Spokane to drop off his wife. His schedule, he explained, probably wouldn\u2019t coalesce until a few days before he set off \u2014 \u201cPart of the value of having a private jet,\u201d he explained in a subsequent voice memo, \u201cis that you don\u2019t have to make decisions until the last minute\u201d \u2014 and he ultimately decided on a Friday that he\u2019d be leaving for Vegas the following Tuesday morning. My overbooked flight to Seattle arrived late, but fortunately my overbooked connecting flight to Vancouver was also late. One of Robbins\u2019s assistants texted me the night before to ask if I had any dietary restrictions and to say that the plane was set to depart at 11:30 the next morning, so I should be at the Shell Aerocentre at Abbotsford, some 40 miles east of Vancouver, no later than 11:20.When I arrived at the private terminal, I was supposed to look for a tail number that included, as many registrations do, the owner\u2019s initials. That task was made considerably easier by the fact that the plane \u2014 the size of a building and bone-white against the wildfire-smoked sky \u2014 was emblazoned with a modestly stylized \u201cTR\u201d monogram. It was also the only aircraft there, just sitting on the apron slightly askance, the way you might hurriedly park at midnight in an otherwise empty lot. The underbelly of the aircraft was painted a soft navy, with curved racing stripes of silver and gold. Robbins showed up with his wife and her parents, proceeded through a gate in the chain-link fence and strolled slowly to the plane\u2019s stairs. The pink-necktied captain came to relieve me of my bag, stuck a green Post-it on it upon which someone had scrawled \u201cVegas\u201d and asked if it would be acceptable to place it in the rear cargo bay. He did that himself. Two maintenance men loaded the rest of the luggage from the tarmac into the hold, saving the garment bags and the golf clubs for last.With five minutes before takeoff, the captain came to usher me to the plane, where I was met by Robbins\u2019s aeronautic major-domo, Ariane, a tall, well-seasoned flight attendant in a gray business-suit uniform. The interior smelled faintly of eucalyptus. She took me to Robbins, who was sitting in what Varsano had told me was the V.I.P. chair, on the starboard side facing forward toward the galley and the pilots. After briefly introducing me to his wife, Robbins suggested we retire to the rear of the aircraft to introduce ourselves.At 6-foot-7, Robbins could not begin to stand fully upright in any non-bizliner plane, but the Global came close, and he had to reduce himself by only a head to make his way past the couch and the sideboard to the rear of the cabin. About a minute with Robbins is enough to convince anyone that his size is actually a practical matter of spatio-energetic prerequisite: Any smaller vessel would simply disintegrate at the slightest vent of his life force. This energy is indivisible into units of small talk, and if Robbins ever allows for a moment of conversational entropy \u2014 by looking away from your eyes for a split second \u2014 it\u2019s only out of politeness, to afford you the opportunity to regather your own wan, windblown vitality. He wore all black, a black exercise V-neck over black shorts, with a black baseball cap and black-and-red Nikes, in what could only have been a genuine if futile attempt to dim the charge of his fluorescence.Both the couch in the main cabin and the conference-room area in the rear had been opened out into their bed configurations, with fleecy comforters and pillowcases monogrammed with the plane\u2019s registration number. The beds and corridor were littered with multicolored balloons and confetti and conical party hats, and above the entrance to the rear of the cabin was affixed a sign that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The family had celebrated the birthdays that weekend of both his wife and one of his assistants, Mary, whom he called his \u201cright arm,\u201d though as an adult human of regular size she seemed relatively petite in comparison to his actual right arm. While Robbins had been with his wife\u2019s family, Ariane had found the most well-stocked party store in northern Vancouver and had decorated the plane as a surprise. This effort had not gone unnoticed. \u201cYou went to north Vancouver to find a party store? You\u2019re so incredibly dedicated.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cShe makes it feel like home.\u201d\u201cAriane,\u201d Robbins continued, \u201cis like family for us. She treats this place like it\u2019s a home \u2014 and it is a home away from home. You\u2019ve got all your stuff on it, all your family on it.\u201d He\u2019d been chartering planes since he was 31 or 32, and he was now 57. He had been an owner for only three years, but the difference had come to seem like one of the great disjunctures of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a different quality of life, for sure. I can go from the West Coast to China nonstop, East Coast to Australia with one stop. I have a resort in Fiji, and obviously going there before was a difficult situation, but now it\u2019s easy. You can do everything on your own terms, on your own timeline, which is wonderful.\u201d The beds were out and made because the beds were always out and made in case somebody decided to sleep.Ariane came back and offered us a selection of newspapers and some scones. \u201cThe captain says the flight to Spokane will be 37 minutes and should be pretty smooth.\u201d He told me about his admiration of Varsano, then moved on to talk of Crispr, the Human Genome Project and machine learning, and Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 always stopping to make sure that I was there with him, that I was interested, that if I had something to contribute I should feel welcome, that we were \u201ctossing the ball back and forth\u201d \u2014 and how he wanted to make sure that there was enough investment in new biotechnologies that the rejuvenatory stem-cell therapy for which he\u2019d paid a Panamanian clinic many tens of thousands of dollars would soon be cheap enough that everybody could benefit. He pointed at me as an example of someone who could benefit. Then he abruptly stood up and said that he wanted to spend a little time up front with his wife, but that we could resume such an interesting conversation on the leg to Vegas.As he moved to the front, he invited me to help myself to the breakfast buffet \u2014 hash browns, scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, a vast array of fruit \u2014 that Ariane had set up on the sideboard. I looked at the panel behind the chair that Robbins vacated and saw that we had only 17 more minutes to arrival. I hadn\u2019t even noticed we\u2019d taken off. We stopped in Spokane, dropped off his wife, went through private Customs and Border Protection and resumed our way to Vegas. Robbins invited me to the front and asked if I\u2019d made sure my family would have a secure financial future.It was only the soft bing-bong chime that indicated our initial descent over the rumpled and barren landscape of southern Nevada that even remotely recalled the experience of commercial flight. Otherwise, the experience felt nothing at all like being on an airliner. In fact, it didn\u2019t quite feel like flying at all. It was more like sitting in a comfortable leather armchair in a pleasingly cool and well-appointed room that at some point incidentally rose above the clouds and stayed there for a little while. Many of the people I spoke to in Geneva talked about private aviation as a variety of peak experience \u2014 and such an inarticulable experience was, after all, why Varsano told me that I could never understand private aviation without an experiential component \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was if anything the opposite of a peak experience, distinguished not by anything explicitly euphoric or divine but by its total coruscating absence of everything that makes contemporary commercial air travel a pricking trial of alienation and diminishment.Shortly after 8, Varsano pressed some buttons in an app on his phone to raise the shades, and the showroom\u2019s gray-and-blue interior flooded with rare London sun, mottled with umber from a hurricane bound for Ireland. Varsano\u2019s visitors tended in the past to show up whenever and however they felt like it, so Varsano was anxious that initial business would be slow. The storefront\u2019s start-up costs had been extremely high. He occasionally mentioned to people that for the capital he sank into the store, he could have his own plane.His first appointment came via text from a member of a minor, impoverished branch of the aristocracy of a Southern European country, a useful person for whom Varsano had some pity. Some websites identified him as a count, and his Instagram account featured grainy, oversaturated selfies with Ivanka Trump and Silvio Berlusconi. The count was with an American friend and wanted to broker an introduction; if the meeting resulted in the sale, Varsano would kick him a finder\u2019s fee. He was a member of an entire echelon that had been surprised to find that what they possessed was no longer real wealth, and they weren\u2019t sure how to accommodate an economy that had changed so rapidly beneath their ancient lineages. \u201cThese people,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cthey don\u2019t even know how to make a living \u2014 all they know is they know people, they have incredible family connections, and that\u2019s how they survive. He\u2019s a professional introducer.\u201dOver the next three days of renewed operation, Varsano had at least three serious visitors a day, and nobody stayed for less than an hour. They were all men, though he did plan to bring a female billionaire friend to see it after a late dinner nearby. There was one guy who\u2019d run a large private-equity firm and then went on to oversee the national fleet of a Persian Gulf country, which was interested in selling at least two G650s in the next year; he had come in an entourage of four and said, almost apologetically, that he\u2019d been hearing such impressive things about Varsano\u2019s store for so long, and that he regretted his visit was so belated. There was another guy from a Central European management company who\u2019d recently gotten a good deal on a very large commercial airliner in a V.I.P. configuration; he wanted Varsano to go in on a deal to gut-renovate the interior over the course of a year and then put it back on the market at a substantial markup. Varsano said the aircraft was likely to sell to a head of state, probably in Africa. Or, Varsano clarified, it would sell to the rich friend of a head of state, and then when they took the test run somehow the head of state would happen to be aboard for the ride. That was usually how it worked.At the end of a long day, he came and sat next to me on the trading floor. Almost all of his employees had gone home for the evening, and the room glowed its serene empyreal blue and white against the rush-hour traffic outside. \u201cPeople think that all of this is just for the rich guys, but it\u2019s really for corporate middle management to run their businesses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat accounts for 70 percent of all flights.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time he had mentioned the statistic in defense of plane ownership. It\u2019s the other 30 percent, though, that make his business possible.The only unkind thing I ever heard Varsano say about \u201cthe rich guys\u201d had to do with the propensity, especially marked among the younger buyers, to back out of a deal that 10 people had spent months putting together just because they decided at the very last minute that they liked the cut of some other plane\u2019s jib. It was clear, though, that like many professionals who rely for their livelihood on capricious billionaire patronage, he felt some ambivalent mixture of scorn and admiration in equal measure. When populists fail to seethe at a tax bill favorable to the owners of jets, it\u2019s not simply because they should like to think that when at last they own their own jets they\u2019ll enjoy the same privileges; it\u2019s also because each side wants to protect its own billionaires and the crumbs they provide. After all, the seven billion of us are increasingly living on the largess of the 7,000 of them. Varsano was constantly being put into situations where despite his near-unparalleled expertise in aviation he was treated as an elevated TaskRabbit, called in on contract to kick the tires and hang the Picasso. These were constant blows to his hard-won professional esteem.Still, he had great faith in the resources of the extremely wealthy. \u201cThere are 230,000\u201d \u2014 he said \u201cthousand\u201d with an astonished emphasis \u2014 \u201cpeople in the world with a net worth, excluding their primary residence, of $30 million or more. In the luxury industry you call them ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. When you ask the bank to finance an aircraft, their rule of thumb is that your net worth has to be at least five times greater than the price of the plane. That means even if you\u2019re at the bottom of that list, there are at least 230,000 people who might buy a $6 million airplane \u2014 though maybe they\u2019d stop at $4 million, because then you need a million bucks a year to fly it.\u201d No matter how hard his work or positive his outlook, Varsano knew he didn\u2019t stand a chance of paying the rent on his storefront selling $4 million planes. There\u2019s a strong downward pressure on commissions, which regardless of the purchase price of the aircraft usually top out at $1 million \u2014 a take of 1.4 percent on a $70 million plane. That world is just so vanishingly small, and there\u2019s so much information on the market, and the principals are so powerful, that somewhere there\u2019s invariably a small-time broker with a desk and a cellphone ready to elbow in for a fee that Varsano would consider an insult to his professional acumen. \u201cThere\u2019s always some guy out there willing to do a deal for $25,000,\u201d he complained.And yet Varsano persisted in the belief that his new showroom \u2014 and the increased regard that Trump had brought to private aviation \u2014 might put him closer to the means of his clients. We sat in his decision-making boardroom at twilight, watching the people and the cars hurry by. Every once in a while, a pedestrian stopped in astonishment to take a picture, or a car would all of a sudden slow and swerve into the bus lane so whoever was inside could gawk.\u201cI\u2019ll buy one some day,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cYou know, you work in a shoe shop, you should have nice shoes.\u201d He looked down at his own shoes, expensive but heavily scuffed with signs of extended wear.\u201cDo I need one?\u201d He glanced out the window and then once more considered his shoes. \u201cI should have one. I\u2019ll get one.\u201dVarsano was born into a generation that understood the airplane for its totemic significance as a technological miracle within mortal reach. The memories of his youth he holds dearest are those that involve getting a rickety aircraft the size of a minibus lost in storm clouds over the Bahamas, the compass slipping slowly, and even now that both airplanes and the economy have been so thoroughly transformed, there was nothing he didn\u2019t know about these machines, and almost nothing he didn\u2019t love. But the brief minute in which they passed through his hands between an oligarch and an executive was the closest he was likely to come to calling one his own, at least in the class he sold \u2014 the class that mattered. The sarcophagal fuselage in his window was not, in the end, just an unusually elaborate showpiece. It might only be a diorama, but it\u2019s the plane he can afford, a mock-up designed to his own last wish.Photographs for Jet Set: Gulfstream G650: Adrian Pingstone. Bombardier Global: Alamy.

{"Headline": "Detroit Auto Show May Be Celebrating an Era About to End", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Automakers have reason to celebrate as they gather this week at the Detroit auto show to unveil the new range of brawny trucks, high-tech cars and rugged sport-utility vehicles that will arrive in showrooms in the months ahead.Spurred by low gasoline prices, Americans are snapping up trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which generate fat profits for manufacturers. The American economy remains strong, with unemployment low and interest rates modest.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very good year in 2018,\u201d said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, the nation\u2019s largest auto retailer.But a closer look suggests that the industry may be headed for choppier waters than the hoopla in Detroit would indicate. While sales are healthy, consumers are actually buying fewer new vehicles. Purchases by individual customers at dealerships \u2014 known as retail sales and considered the most accurate reflection of demand \u2014 declined slightly in both 2016 and 2017. Some automakers are offsetting lower consumer purchasing by selling more cars to fleets like rental-car companies.More worrisome is that the drops in retail sales have come even as manufacturers have resorted to heftier discounts, which eat into their profits. Sales incentives are now equal to more than 11 percent of the average vehicle\u2019s sticker price. As recently as 2014, that figure was below 8 percent.There are other troubling signs, too. Interest rates have started rising, which increases the cost of financing or leasing a new car. Younger buyers are showing less interest in owning cars than older generations. And the supply of low-mileage used cars is growing, giving shoppers attractive and lower-cost alternatives to new cars. Close to four million leased vehicles will be turned in and offered for sale as used models this year, up from 3.6 million in 2017.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds out there,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, global head of the automotive and industrial practice at Alix Partners, a consulting firm.The auto industry has a long history of going from boom to bust \u2014 periods of rising sales and buoyant profits followed by inevitable sales slumps that leave idle plants and mounting losses. The last bust coincided with the 2008 financial crisis and nearly ruined Detroit. General Motors and Chrysler had to be saved by federally engineered bankruptcy proceedings.Now analysts are wondering if harder times are arriving again.Alix is forecasting a moderate drop in sales this year, followed by steeper declines in 2019 and 2020. In both of those years, Alix believes sales will fall short of 16 million cars and trucks.The industry runs into trouble when automakers get stuck producing more vehicles than customers are willing to buy, said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at Oliver Wyman, another consulting firm.He added that one part of the industry was already in considerable distress \u2014 the car business. With Americans flocking to roomy vehicles like S.U.V.s, sales of family sedans and compacts have plunged in the last few years. Family cars like the Toyota Camry used to make up 25 percent of all new-vehicle sales. Now they account for just 15 percent.As a result, some manufacturers are seeing a split in their operations. While running truck factories almost around the clock, they have been idling workers, cutting shifts or slowing assembly lines at their car plants. Ford, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all cut output at car plants by 10 percent to 22 percent last year, according to data compiled by Automotive News. G.M. cut production by about 33 percent at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant, which makes the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze compact. In Oshawa, Ontario, G.M.\u2019s large-sedan factory lowered production by almost half.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a car plant close in the next few years,\u201d if auto sales fall below 16 million vehicles a year as forecast, Mr. Harbour said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to have to bite the bullet.\u201dDan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, declined to give an outlook for the company\u2019s car plants for 2018. \u201cOur overall approach is to match production to demand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see where demand is and act accordingly.\u201dThe last permanent shutdown of an auto plant in the United States occurred in 2016 when Mitsubishi Motors shuttered a factory in Normal. Ill. Before that, Ford closed a truck plant in St. Paul, Minn., in 2011.Trouble could mount if any automakers resort to further incentives to gain market share and avoid production cuts, a strategy G.M., Ford and Chrysler employed in the 2000s. All ended up reporting huge losses.In the past week, executives from Honda, Subaru and other companies have acknowledged they aim to gain market share even though the market is likely to shrink.\u201cThe two things to watch are crazy incentives and overproduction,\u201d Mr. Jackson, the AutoNation chief executive. \u201cThey\u2019re ruinous.\u201dOne factor that could mitigate any difficulties in car manufacturing is the outsized profits that companies are earning on trucks, which now make up two-thirds of all new vehicles sold. \u201cThe high mix of trucks is going to keep profits at near-record levels, and that\u2019s going to help them get through this downturn on the car side,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.He also noted that G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler streamlined their operations over the past 10 years and were now better able to withstand shocks to their operations.At the Detroit auto show, which opens to the media and industry visitors on Monday, the new models being presented reflect the industry\u2019s focus on trucks. Three of the most anticipated new models are pickups: the Chevrolet Silverado, the Ram 1500 from Fiat Chrysler, and the Ford Ranger. Other vehicles to be unveiled include the Mercedes-Benz G-Class S.U.V., the Honda Insight hybrid, the Toyota Avalon and the Acura RDX.This year\u2019s event has less buzz than in recent years, perhaps because of the industry\u2019s uncertain outlook. Several auto brands, including Audi, Cadillac, Chrysler and Lincoln, are not presenting any new vehicles, and Porsche, Jaguar and Land Rover aren\u2019t even attending the show.An earlier version of this article misstated the corporate title of Dan Ammann of General Motors. He is the president, no longer the chief financial officer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way Forward for New York-New Jersey Commuters", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorInstead of working with the region to fix the problem, in late December the Trump administration backpedaled on one of the big projects planned to address it, a new set of tunnels under the Hudson River. In response, officials and transportation agencies should consider going it alone and not waiting for federal funding.Here\u2019s the background: The tunnels leading into Penn Station were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy and are believed to have only 10 to 15 years of useful life left. The Hudson Tunnel Project, the first phase of a larger plan called Gateway, would build two rail tunnels under the Hudson River and allow the reconstruction of the existing rail tunnels while maintaining service. It is co-sponsored by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. In the second phase of the Gateway plan, additional platforms would be built south of Penn Station near 31st Street, expanding the station\u2019s capacity and easing congestion.Given the long lead time needed for a project of this magnitude, the railroads fear that, with no replacement, service could be severely disrupted in an emergency, damaging the entire Northeast Corridor economy.There\u2019s talk that this might just be a ploy to get New York and New Jersey senators to back the yet-to-be-revealed Trump infrastructure plan, and perhaps there are negotiations to be pursued. But where does this leave the region? The clock is ticking on the useful life of the tunnels, and the second phase of the Gateway plan \u2014 in which long-suffering New Jersey Transit commuters would get double the number of trains and direct service to Manhattan on more lines \u2014 recedes into the future.The city depends on those commuters to keep its economy growing. New York State gets a big slice of nonresident income tax revenue from them. And for northern New Jersey\u2019s economy, jobs in Manhattan are, by far, the largest \u201cindustry.\u201dTo solve the twin problems of the existing Hudson River tunnels and Penn Station capacity, the region can\u2019t permit its agenda to be set by Amtrak, which is focused on the needs of the entire Northeast Corridor, not the commuter services operated by New Jersey Transit. As Ms. Williams notes, nine out of 10 Hudson River rail passengers are commuters. Commuters should be the priority.Decision makers should also reconsider an earlier project called Access to the Region\u2019s Core, that was canceled by Chris Christie when he was governor of New Jersey. There is a strong argument that it is a better solution because it provides both two new tunnels under the Hudson and a station extension under West 34th Street rather than 31st Street, giving New Jersey commuters a shorter connection to major West Side subway lines. While some changes will be necessary because of the passage of time, building the ARC project, rather than the Hudson Tunnel project, could get New Jersey Transit its needed capacity increase while putting its passengers in the right location.The federal funding environment is not hopeless. Should future elections change the political balance in Congress, the two states\u2019 Democratic senators may have more ability to deliver reimbursement for the states\u2019 and city\u2019s investment. The first priority, however, should be to get a project moving in the limited time we have.Eric Kober is a senior research scholar at the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University and a former director of housing, economic and infrastructure planning at the New York City Department of City Planning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Fight Climate Change, New York City Takes On Oil Companies", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeeking to position himself as a national leader against climate change, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday announced a two-pronged attack against the fossil-fuel industry, including a vow that city pension funds would divest about $5 billion from companies involved in the fossil fuel business.The mayor also announced a lawsuit against five major oil companies, seeking to collect billions of dollars in damages to pay for city efforts to cope with the effects of climate change.\u201cThis city is standing up and saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to take our own actions to protect our own people,\u2019\u201d the mayor said, wearing a green necktie and sitting in front of large green sign that said \u201cNYC: Leading the Fight Against Climate Change.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not waiting.\u201dBut in fact the city will have to wait, potentially for many years.The mayor acknowledged that the lawsuit, which he compared to successful lawsuits against large tobacco companies, could take years to reach a resolution.The city lawsuit says that the oil companies \u2014 BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell \u2014 were aware for years that burning fossil fuels caused climate change but hid the conclusions of their own scientists. It says that the city has spent billions of dollars and will spend billions more to deal with the consequences of climate change, such as the effects of Sandy, and it seeks to hold the companies responsible for those costs.\u201cReducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,\u201d Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement. \u201cLawsuits of this kind \u2014 filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life \u2014 simply do not do that.\u201dA spokesman for Chevron responded in similar terms, saying the lawsuit would \u201cdo nothing to address the serious issue of climate change.\u201dEric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, had a different view, calling the lawsuit a \u201cclassic example of impact litigation that\u2019s designed to upend the existing order.\u201d He said that lawsuits targeting the tobacco industry were once considered long shots but ended up being successful.The city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who sat next to Mr. de Blasio at the news conference, tempered his enthusiasm on the pension divestments, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re setting a formal goal to divest from fossil fuels.\u201d He added that any decision would be complex, take time and must be viewed through a \u201clens of sound fiscal stewardship.\u201d He said the goal was to complete the divestment within five years.Trustees for the city\u2019s five pension funds would need to approve any divestment, weighing its effect on the funds\u2019 performance. A resolution submitted on Wednesday to the boards of the five funds called for them to \u201cinitiate a process for determining a prudent divestment\u201d strategy in keeping with the fiduciary duty to responsibly manage the funds. It called for the boards to hire a consultant to study the issue and its impact on risk and return.Mr. de Blasio said that a majority of the trustees on two of the funds \u2014 one for teachers and another for many employees not including police officers or firefighters \u2014 were ready to support divestment.The divestment announcement comes less than a month after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo promised to cease the state\u2019s investments in entities \u201cwith significant fossil-fuel activities,\u201d and created an advisory committee to \u201cdevelop a decarbonization road map.\u201dThe news conference Wednesday was held at a Lower Manhattan community center that Mr. de Blasio said had been flooded during Hurricane Sandy. It was attended by activists wearing buttons calling for divestment, who applauded frequently as Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Stringer and other officials spoke.Mr. de Blasio is also opposed to creating a congestion pricing scheme that would charge vehicles entering parts of Manhattan, in order to reduce driving and finance public transit. Advocates say such a scheme would also help fight climate change, but Mr. de Blasio says that it would be unfair to poorer drivers and drivers from outside Manhattan.An earlier version of this article misstated how much money New York City had previously divested from fossil fuel companies and private prisons. It was $60 million, not $100 million. The article also misstated the last time that legislation to combat climate change was introduced by city government. A bill relating to energy efficiency in buildings was proposed in the City Council, the administration\u2019s September 2017 energy efficiency proposal was not the last legislation introduced.John Schwartz and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.More misconduct newsAndrew\u2019s take:\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them.

A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.The bigger pictureAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown? Here\u2019s the take of Dan Leal, a pornographer who bought followers:\u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dCoincheck has until Feb. 13 to explain the cause of the incident and how it will stop it happening again.\u201cThe problem now is that innovation is not viewed as an unalloyed way to improve the human condition.

{"Headline": "Remaking a \u2018Developer Special\u2019 in Brooklyn", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Location11 PhotosWhen Mike Farah was a research analyst at Merrill Lynch in 2007, he had the good fortune of working for a managing director who moved to Denver and left behind a handsome red brick townhouse on the edge of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.\u201cHe offered to have us live in his brownstone for a while and gave us a sweetheart deal,\u201d said Mr. Farah, now 36, who moved in with his soon-to-be wife, Laura, also 36. \u201cThat\u2019s when we really got to know the neighborhood. And we loved it.\u201dIn the years that followed, as Mr. Farah got into hedge funds and Ms. Farah pursued a career in finance and recruiting, they rented in the West Village of Manhattan before deciding that Carroll Gardens was the neighborhood where they wanted to put down roots.They returned to Brooklyn in 2013, moved into a rental with their first child, Monroe, now 5, and about a year later began looking for a townhouse to buy as they were expecting their second child, Lewis, who is now 2.\u201cWe were pretty picky about location,\u201d Mr. Farah said. \u201cWe wanted to be in the core of the neighborhood, even though so much of the inventory is on the periphery.\u201dAnd they weren\u2019t keen on the idea of renovating. \u201cAt first, I was completely opposed to any project,\u201d said Ms. Farah, who is now a stay-at-home mother. \u201cI wanted something that was move-in ready.\u201dKnowing that his clients didn\u2019t want a multiyear project, Mr. Tang cautioned them about buying a house cut up into multiple apartments or anything too rundown. It took nearly a year, but the Farahs\u2019 agent eventually showed them what appeared to be the ideal compromise: a relatively soulless four-story townhouse built in 2012.With a nod from Mr. Tang, the couple bought it for $4.2 million in January 2016, even though there were aspects they didn\u2019t like. For one, despite offering about 4,000 square feet of space, the house had only a dinky ground-floor living room, with all three floors above occupied entirely by bedrooms and bathrooms.\u201cMy other issue was that I got used to seeing these prewar, beautifully detailed homes,\u201d Mr. Farah said. \u201cThis place was very sterile.

He had not been protesting at all, his father insists, and was arrested by mistake.More than 500 people have been arrested in Tehran alone since the demonstrations began on Dec. 28. Local news organizations say that more than 1,000 have been detained nationwide, and even that is probably a conservative estimate. The average age of those arrested is under 25, the deputy interior minister, Hossein Zolfaghari, told the semiofficial website Jamaran.Based on reports from family members and friends outside Evin Prison on Sunday, as well as official sources, dozens of people have been released, but hundreds more remain in prison.\u201cPeople feel belittled and hopeless,\u201d the letter said.More than 100 people were gathered outside Evin Prison on Sunday: family members and friends of the detained, the women shielding themselves from the snow with umbrellas; a well-known political activist, Mohammad Nourizad; and a group of dervishes who had set up a makeshift camp under one of the prison\u2019s watchtowers, singing an old song from their native province, Lorestan.\u201cOh mother, mother, it is time for fighting, it is time to make friends with the rifle,\u201d a man with an imposing mustache sang, with others repeating the lines after him.They gathered around a campfire, having brought an ample supply of wood and tents in which to sleep.

It has played an important role in Iran\u2019s contemporary history, housing political and criminal prisoners since 1972. Some of the cells were designed for solitary confinement, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security control their own sections of the building.Iran\u2019s supreme leader called for an investigation of that case, and several officers were given jail sentences. Not all have served those sentences, however, the local news media has reported.Ali, a plump man wearing a brown beret who would not give his surname for fear of retribution by the authorities, was waiting in the snow outside Evin Prison for the release of his friend Hossein, who was arrested on Dec. 29.Hossein had been at the demonstrations because \u201che was angry, like many people,\u201d Ali said. Hossein soon realized a man had grabbed the cellphone of a woman who had been filming the protesters.\u201cHossein chased him, but he turned out to be a plainclothes police officer,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI\u2019m bringing the deed of his house so he can post for bail.\u201dThe entrance of Evin Prison is near a busy highway, and metal sheets have been placed on overpasses to prevent people from looking down.

She writes about infidelity and Catholicism, about married women who long to transgress and often do. Her first book was hot to the touch for its divine, earthly and intellectual acuities. Reading it, you felt echoes of Flannery O\u2019Connor and Graham Greene. You also felt: This writer, born in San Diego and now living in Georgia, is constructing a new skyscraper on the literary horizon.Quatro is here now with \u201cFire Sermon,\u201d her second book and first novel. It\u2019s a disappointment. At best it\u2019s a holding pattern. Once again the protagonist is a married woman in a sexually dead marriage. She questions her faith; she works out; she falls into an affair with a man in another city.\u201cFire Sermon\u201d is, in other words, one of Quatro\u2019s short stories extended to novel length. Yet somehow this saga lacks a novel\u2019s amplitude. The narrator, Maggie, is a writer. Even she seems aware that this thin if fervid book brings little that\u2019s fresh to the theme of illicit sexual desire.At one point Maggie says, \u201cI imagine writing all this down and giving the manuscript to my agent.\u201d She imagines her bored agent replying, \u201cThis has been done to death.\u201d And: \u201cI won\u2019t be able to sell this.\u201dMaggie and her lover, James, are close to insufferable. He\u2019s a formalist poet who has the words \u201csight\u201d and \u201cvision\u201d tattooed on alternate wrists. His poems, written in \u201chyper-regular iambic meter,\u201d investigate \u201cthe apocalyptic suffering created by a market economy.\u201dShe\u2019s a woman who grew up lovely and happy and sheltered. As an adult this happiness is given a booster shot: She inherits a million dollars from a rich uncle. She became a writer after abandoning an academic career, including an unwritten dissertation on \u201cpostcolonial reinterpretations of the Genesis story.\u201d Her husband is an agnostic. She is starved for religious talk.Maggie and James are both 45; their children have all left for college. The adulterous couple share a peanut allergy and a fondness for the Christian mystics and \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d They have ecstatic, guilt-ridden sex in a far-flung hotel room. As James Dickey told us in one of his poems: \u201cguilt is magical.\u201dFor these lovers, foreplay includes dialogue like, \u201cDo you read much apophatic literature?\u201d Maggie conflates sexual and religious desire, sometimes to memorable effect. More often, these meditations set off the pretentiousness alarm that rests, like a smoke detector, at the top of one\u2019s mind. You may finally have to cover the thing with plastic wrap and a rubber band.During sex with James, she reports how \u201cat the deepest point of penetration the room fell away and the sky tore open and we were swept up into electric galaxies.\u201d This sounds less like one of Erica Jong\u2019s zipless romps than technical plans still on Elon Musk\u2019s drafting table.\u201cBalanced on this precipice we could blow open eternity,\u201d Maggie thinks as she and James consider having sex. Their lives will \u201cexplode outward in a single, effortless, life-changing orgasm.\u201d Indeed there are so many sexual and pre-sexual explosions that reading this book is like learning about one of the terrible disasters that result when a blaze starts in a fireworks store.The tortured intensity of Maggie\u2019s longing does remind the reader of what\u2019s lost when sex is unhitched from religion. Young lovers now \u201chook up,\u201d a healthy phrase, if as wan as a piece of Dover sole. How many will know the illicit black-mass pleasures suggested by a word like fornication?And what of Thomas, Maggie\u2019s husband? He\u2019s a good father, we are told, and handsome. He reminds an acquaintance of Maggie\u2019s of the actor Patrick Dempsey. But this McDreamy is in finance and, as Maggie writes to James in an email, \u201cI find the language of business inaccessible.\u201dThomas is frustrated by the couple\u2019s bed-death, but you understand why he turns Maggie off. He is terrible at taking hints. Early in the novel he hopes to rekindle passion by giving Maggie a flesh-colored vibrator that\u2019s \u201crealistic-looking, veined and arched, a switch at its base.\u201d She despises it.Before long he\u2019s shyly back with a \u201ctiny pink pebble vibrator\u201d that\u2019s \u201cshaped like a kidney bean.\u201d She resents this one, too. Finally, incredibly, he returns with a long sleek silver dildo in a drawstring bag. \u201cTell me that isn\u2019t what I think,\u201d she says.Maggie can\u2019t believe it. Neither can the reader. We start to wonder if Thomas will next burst into the house on a giant inflatable penis like the one Mick Jagger rode onstage during the Rolling Stones\u2019 1975 tour.Quatro made compression work for her in the stories collected in \u201cI Want to Show You More.\u201d In her first novel, more is less. Her themes expand but don\u2019t noticeably take on grain or deepen.Maggie is among those people who carry their faith not like a shawl worn around the shoulders but like something heavy that must be carried with a piece of twine. It cuts the fingers; it must frequently be set down.There\u2019s real humanity in this novel, and there are insights about love and longing. Quatro is a gifted writer. But \u201cFire Sermon\u201d ultimately reminds the reader of Emma Bovary\u2019s observation that there is \u201cin adultery all the banality of marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most States Don\u2019t Require Specific Financial Literacy Classes", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserMost states take a scattershot approach to teaching personal finance concepts to high school students, a newly released financial literacy report card finds, with just a handful of exceptions.While there has been debate over whether mandating personal finance education is an effective way to make young people more savvy about money, the report cites studies suggesting that instruction is helpful if teachers receive \u201crobust\u201d training and use a well-designed curriculum. John Pelletier, the report\u2019s author and director of the center, in Burlington, Vt., argues that personal finance is a \u201ccritical subject\u201d for high school students preparing to enter college or the work force.The report card gave Bs to 19 states that require students to receive personal finance instruction to graduate from high school, but may devote less time to it than A states. For instance, some B states \u2014 including New Jersey \u2014 let districts decide whether to cover the topic in a stand-alone course or include it within another course, which may dilute the intensity of the instruction. The 12 states that earned Cs and the four with Ds included some personal finance topics in state standards, but left the decision on how much to teach up to local districts. The report flunked the remaining 10 states and Washington, D.C., saying they have \u201cfew requirements or none at all\u201d for personal financial education in high school.\u201cWhat the grading shows is that we have a long way to go before we are a financially literate nation,\u201d the report found. Mr. Pelletier cautioned that even within states with poor grades, individual schools or districts may offer strong personal finance instruction.Utah was the only state to get an A-plus. The state requires students to take a state-administered test at the end of the course, and recently mandated that the class cover the cost of college and student loans.\u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t be better,\u201d said Travis Cook, a financial literacy specialist with the Utah State Board of Education, noting that student debt nationally is mushrooming.The report card, an update of an assessment done in 2015, is based on the premise that all high school students should, at a minimum, be required to take a course that includes personal finance topics, even if the topics are just a \u201cmodest\u201d part of the overall course.\u201cWe find that if a rigorous financial education program is carefully implemented,\u201d the report concluded, \u201cit can improve the credit scores and lower the probability of delinquency for young adults.\u201dLauren Willis, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has argued for stronger consumer financial protections, said she saw more promise in \u201cconsumer self-defense classes,\u201d which focus on \u201cspotting and avoiding scams, spotting manipulative advertising, and the like.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about financial literacy education:What if my child\u2019s school doesn\u2019t offer personal finance instruction?Laura Levine, chief executive of the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, an advocate for financial education for young people, encourages parents to talk to their child\u2019s teachers and principals and to school board members about offering the subject. \u201cWe as parents have voices,\u201d she said.What should a high school financial literacy class cover?For instance, the council recommends that schools cover earning income, buying goods and services, saving, using credit, investing and looking at insurance. In high school, the \u201csaving\u201d topic should include how much a student would need to save to buy a car, and explore how inflation affects the purchasing power of savings.Shouldn\u2019t children learn about money at home?Parents may be hesitant because they have made poor decisions themselves in the past, Ms. Levine said. Still, she said, parents should try to talk about spending and budgeting \u2014 starting, perhaps, by explaining why the family made a certain budget decision. Or, she suggested, parents could research, together with their children, information about setting savings goals. The coalition offers tips and online tools on its website.\u201cWe encourage parents to talk to their kids about money,\u201d Ms. Levine said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Suspends Top Lobbyist Amid Inquiry Into Diesel Tests on Monkeys", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen suspended its chief lobbyist on Tuesday amid a growing furor over experiments on monkeys that were meant to promote the virtues of diesel-powered vehicles, but now threaten to further undermine the German car industry and to increase political instability in Berlin.Germany has often balked at efforts to tighten regulations on auto emissions and to improve enforcement, and the latest uproar has put Ms. Merkel on the defensive as she struggles to form a coalition government after winning a narrow plurality in elections late last year.Adding to the political fallout, the European Commission declared on Tuesday that Germany and eight other countries had not done enough to combat dismal air quality. The commission said it planned to pursue legal action against the nine countries at the European Union\u2019s highest court for their chronic failure to enforce air quality standardsMs. Merkel, through her spokesman, was among the political leaders and auto industry executives who in recent days condemned the experiments at a lab in Albuquerque, in which monkeys were exposed to diesel exhaust. The project was financed by German carmakers, who wanted to show that diesel cars were less of a threat to human health than groups such as the World Health Organization have claimed.A separate project financed by the carmakers subjected human volunteers in Germany to doses of nitrogen dioxide, one of diesel\u2019s most noxious byproducts.Environmental groups and other critics of Volkswagen said the suspension of Mr. Steg, whose formal title at Volkswagen is head of external relations and sustainability, made him a sacrificial lamb meant to insulate the company\u2019s top managers from consequences.These critics drew parallels with the Volkswagen emissions scandal, in which the company initially said that a small number of rogue engineers were responsible for installing software intended to dupe regulators. German prosecutors have since identified dozens of suspects.\u201cThey are again playing the game where the subordinates were the culprits,\u201d said Christian Strenger, a former member of a commission that wrote Germany\u2019s rules on corporate governance. Mr. Strenger is among the people suing Volkswagen for violating its legal obligations to shareholders.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Karmenu Vella, the European commissioner responsible for environmental matters, met with ministers from the nine offending countries in Brussels on Tuesday and said afterward that they had failed to present credible plans for reducing pollution.The experiments that preceded Mr. Steg\u2019s suspension were conducted at a laboratory in Albuquerque for the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials, E.U.G.T.Although ostensibly independent, the organization was financed entirely by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. (Bosch, a major German auto parts supplier, had been a member but dropped out in 2013.) In recent days, the three carmakers have repudiated the work of the group, which folded last year.Yet all three were represented on the organization\u2019s five-person board of directors, and all three contributed money to the group. The research on monkeys had a budget of more than $700,000, and was just one of the organization\u2019s numerous projects.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Nonetheless, images of humans being exposed to gas in airtight chambers raised uncomfortable associations with Germany\u2019s Nazi past.After breathing diluted exhaust for four hours, the monkeys were examined for signs of lung inflammation or other ill effects. The research did not kill the monkeys, but it was unclear what happened to them after the experiments were completed.Results of the research had not been published by the time the E.U.G.T. disbanded last year.Matthias M\u00fcller, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday that the company is conducting a thorough investigation of the research \u201cand will draw all the necessary consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cutting Carbon Emissions While Earning Cash", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBonds may seem an unlikely instrument for saving the world. But managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds who invest in so-called green bonds say the securities can help address climate change and other environmental woes.\u201cThe more green bonds that are issued, the more green projects that are being funded,\u201d said Christopher J. Wigley, senior fixed-income portfolio manager with the Mirova Global Green Bond Fund. \u201cGreen bonds are reducing emissions\u201d of greenhouse gases, he said.Green bonds finance environmental projects like wind and solar power, mass transit and upgrades in energy efficiency. They can be issued by corporations, governments, international organizations like the World Bank and universities. Apple and Starbucks have gone green with some of their bond issues in the last several years.While the term green bonds is often used, there is no universally accepted definition of what such a bond is. Ms. Palm said she seeks two features, besides the promise of an environmental investment: \u201can independent audit to demonstrate that the proceeds were used as expected and a report back on the financial and environmental returns.\u201d She said she wants quantitative data about gains like greenhouse gas emissions offset or energy usage avoided.In 2017, about $150 billion in green bonds were issued, about double the volume of 2016, according the Climate Bonds Initiative, a London nonprofit group. Still, the market remains minuscule, compared with, say, the roughly $1.5 trillion in United States corporate debt issued annually.Among its recent top holdings were bonds of both the French government and Southern Power, a wholesale electricity generator that is a subsidiary of the Southern Company in Atlanta.Southern Power generates much of its electricity using natural gas, and its parent company operates nuclear power plants. Its bonds are barred from some funds that apply environmental screens to their holdings, including Ms. Palm\u2019s Parnassus Fixed Income Fund.\u201cWe exclude any company that generates significant revenue from nuclear,\u201d she said.Mr. Wigley said Southern Power is shifting toward renewable energy and wind power in particular with its green bonds helping that transition.\u201cWe see the climate transition as a critical phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that don\u2019t adapt could become default risks. So we see those that issue green bonds as better financial risks and want to support that.\u201dThe Calvert fund began in 2013. Its manager, Vishal O. Khanduja, said he buys bonds that are labeled green and unlabeled ones with clear environmental aims. Calvert, which factors environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decisions, has a team of analysts who investigate the green bona fides of bonds, he said. All the Calvert bond funds \u2014 there are 10 \u2014 must clear environmental thresholds, but the green fund \u201cfocuses even more on the environmental pillar,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat my investors want is for us to use our expertise to get as close as possible to an end project with an environmental benefit,\u201d Mr. Liberatore said.A claim often made by proponents of green bonds is that investing in them addresses climate change and other environmental problems more directly than buying green stocks does. Bond proceeds, this argument goes, finance specific projects with the potential for measurable gains. With an equity investment, in contrast, you just own shares in a company with a reputation for environmental stewardship. The company\u2019s management still has discretion over its investments.Jon F. Hale, director of sustainability research for Morningstar, said he regarded that argument as credible. \u201cWhen you think about impact, dollar for dollar, you probably are having a bigger impact\u201d with a green bond fund than an environmentally minded stock fund, he said.\u201cThere are estimates out there of the trillions of dollars in investments needed in renewables and energy efficiency over the next 30 years, and that\u2019s what these kinds of bonds are financing,\u201d he said.Mr. Hale cautioned, however, that investors shouldn\u2019t abandon prudence for the sake of environmental purity. They should still stick to such investing tenets as keeping costs low, diversifying and allocating their money based on their goals and tolerance for risk.\u201cAs an investor, you should be allocated across asset classes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can activate your desire for sustainability with your bond investments, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I should have kept more.And this one:My husband has invested in Bitcoin, and my son has invested in Etherium! I am debating about switching my 401(k) to Bitcoin.So may I humbly suggest that asking if we should all buy Bitcoin is the wrong question, and that we should ask a different one instead. The question we should be asking ourselves is this: Does buying Bitcoin fit into my investment plan?That is a much more important question and one that we can all answer much more easily. It places the attention on the process of investing correctly and not on the outcome of events that we have no control over.In order to answer the investing plan question, it might help to clarify a few things.Investing is different from speculating or gambling. Investing is a means to an end, and that end is our collective financial goals. Beating the stock market, buying what\u2019s hot, outperforming a brother-in-law \u2014 those are not financial goals. Financial goals are things like having money to send kids to college, buying a house, taking a trip or retiring someday. This is why we invest.Investors do not put all their eggs in one basket. That\u2019s something speculators do. Our financial goals are important, and the consequences of failure are high. So we spread our risk out by diversifying across lots of different types of investments, like stocks and bonds and real estate, both in the countries where we live and far away. We choose each one carefully based on how it interacts with the others in our portfolio.So this isn\u2019t really about Bitcoin at all. Just like it wasn\u2019t about real estate in 2007, or internet stocks in 1999. This is about investing versus something else we typically call gambling or speculating. It\u2019s not about where Bitcoin is going, or what we might have missed out on over the last year. All of that is out of our control.What is in our control is the process of identifying goals, building a portfolio that matches those goals and then maintaining it for a very long time (even when it\u2019s scary, or hard) so we can achieve those goals.So no, I cannot tell you if you should be buying Bitcoin. But I can urge you to ask a very different question.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medical Research? Congress Cheers. Medical Care? Congress Brawls.", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 They cannot agree on subsidies for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act or even how to extend funding for the broadly popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 two issues requiring urgent attention as Congress returns to work.But a more exotic corner of the medical world has drawn rapturous agreement among Republicans and Democrats: the development of new treatments and cures through taxpayer-funded biomedical research.For the third straight year, lawmakers are planning to increase the budget of the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. In the process, they have summarily rejected cuts proposed by President Trump.The push for additional funding reflects a fascination among legislators with advances in fields like molecular biology, genetics and regenerative medicine, even as they wage bitter battles over just how large a role the government should play in financing health care and providing coverage.At a recent hearing, Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Tim Scott of South Carolina, both Republicans, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, a Democrat, pressed scientists to explain exactly how gene editing technology could lead to new treatments for sickle cell anemia, H.I.V., cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases.Ms. Hassan wanted to know the relative merits of different techniques for editing DNA and RNA \u2014 what she called \u201cthis incredible cutting-edge technology.\u201dWhy is medical research so much less contentious than fundamental issues like health insurance coverage?Anthony J. Mazzaschi, a lobbyist at the national organization representing schools of public health, said that \u201cthe charisma of the cure, the hope and promise of curing disease, seems to excite members of Congress,\u201d including some in their 70s and 80s who are \u201cfacing the prospect of disease and disability head-on.\u201dAnd that prospect is bipartisan. \u201cDisease doesn\u2019t impact just Republicans or Democrats,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. \u201cIt impacts everybody.\u201dWhile the search for new treatments and cures is advancing at breakneck speed, ideas about how to help patients pay for them lag far behind. And Republicans who sometimes laud the N.I.H. as the National Institutes of Hope also support dismantling the Affordable Care Act, which could limit access to the new treatments.\u201cIf we are spending billions to incentivize the development of new drugs, I think we also have to ensure that patients can afford those drugs,\u201d said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cIt is almost cruel to find a cure and then have it priced so high that a patient can\u2019t afford it.\u201dThe challenges facing patients and policymakers were illustrated this past week when a Philadelphia company said it would charge $850,000 for a new gene therapy to treat a rare inherited form of blindness. (The company, Spark Therapeutics, said it would pay rebates to certain insurers if the medicine, given in a one-time injection, did not work as promised.)Members of Congress have friends, relatives and constituents who suffer from cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases, but lawmakers may have less interaction with people who are uninsured and unable to afford doctor visits or prescription drugs.\u201cSadly,\u201d said R. Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, \u201cthe cynic in me says it\u2019s because of the prevalence of selfishness. We all want to know there\u2019s something out there that will cure us if we need it, but many of us are quite reluctant to pay for somebody else to get cured when they need it.\u201dSherri J. Bale, a geneticist who worked at the N.I.H. for 16 years before founding GeneDx, a genetic testing company in Gaithersburg, Md., said: \u201cGene therapy has fabulous promise. We will soon be able to treat and even cure people with genetic diseases where we previously had nothing at all to offer them. But where are they supposed to get the money to pay for these treatments \u2014 thousands of dollars a month?\u201d\u201cWhat good is the research if all you do is treat people in a clinical trial and publish a few papers?\u201d Ms. Bale asked. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that patients will be left in the lurch.\u201dNine-year-old Max Schill of Williamstown, N.J., who has a rare genetic condition known as Noonan syndrome, which causes heart defects and growth delays, was the public face of patients who could benefit from that legislation.\u201cMax bravely visited nearly every senator\u2019s office with handmade drawings asking for support,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey.But while a few children with rare diseases can sometimes elicit an outpouring of concern, millions of Americans continue to lack health insurance.A month after President Barack Obama signed the medical cures bill in December 2016, surrounded by members of both parties, Republicans in Congress ramped up their campaign to demolish the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a law that Mr. McConnell once described as \u201cthe single worst piece of legislation that has been passed in the last half-century.\u201dRepublicans in Congress and the Trump administration appear uncertain whether they want to repeal what remains of the Affordable Care Act or stabilize insurance marketplaces created by the law. They cannot agree among themselves, much less with Democrats, over the future direction of federal health policy.But the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the president\u2019s proposal was a recipe for \u201cjunk health insurance\u201d that would strip consumers of vital protections provided by the Affordable Care Act.Bipartisan Senate efforts to stabilize insurance markets face long odds in the House.But their bill met fierce resistance from conservative House Republicans, who said it would prop up the health law and bail out insurers.By contrast, the appeal of biomedical research often appears to transcend politics. In a decision applauded by scientists, Mr. Trump decided to retain the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins, who led the government\u2019s 15-year effort to map the human genome and inspires lawmakers with his infectious enthusiasm for medical research.When Dr. Collins and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, appeared at House and Senate hearings to assess progress under the Cures Act, one theme ran through questions from members of both parties: What more can we do to help you?The N.I.H. has an annual budget of roughly $34 billion, and over 80 percent of it goes out in grants to more than 300,000 scientists at universities, medical schools and other research institutions that can lobby local members of Congress.Dr. Matthew H. Porteus, a pediatrician and stem cell biologist at Stanford University who testified at the Senate hearing on gene editing, said he was impressed with the level of congressional interest and surprised at the lack of partisanship.\u201cThe senators\u2019 questions were spoken as if they were experts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know what party each senator belonged to, you\u2019d have no idea, based on the questions they asked.\u201dAt the same time, Dr. Porteus said, \u201cit\u2019s really disappointing\u201d that Congress has been unable to find money for a long-term extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201cIf you can\u2019t provide the best possible care for people today, and CHIP is an essential part of that for millions of children,\u201d Dr. Porteus said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be in a poor position to provide advanced care to people in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201dThe analysts add:\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.\u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201dG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow.

{"Headline": "Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Survives, but G.M. and Tesla Aren\u2019t Cheering", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSo it\u2019s no wonder that hardly anyone expected renewable energy subsidies to survive Republican tax reform. In the legislation the House of Representatives passed in November, Republicans drastically curtailed solar and wind power subsidies and put a stake in the heart of the tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles \u2014 all while preserving billions in subsidies for fossil fuels.Yet in the final tax bill Mr. Trump signed in December, there they are: the full panoply of tax incentives for renewable energy, as well as the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, called it a \u201csurprise move\u201d that suggests there may be deeper but little-recognized congressional support for electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them.Given that Tesla and General Motors are by far the top producers of electric vehicles, you\u2019d expect their executives to be thrilled. G.M. has made a huge commitment to an electric vehicle future, and has pledged to have 20 new models on sale by 2023. It lobbied to preserve the incentives.But Tesla has been conspicuously silent on the law. And G.M.\u2019s response has been qualified. A company spokesman, Patrick E. Morrissey, said G.M. supports continuing the electric vehicle credit \u201cas an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles,\u201d but added, \u201cWe believe additional reform to the E.V. tax credit would help grow the market for of electric vehicles even more.\u201dThat\u2019s because as now structured, the tax credit puts Tesla and G.M. at a competitive disadvantage, especially compared with foreign rivals who are just starting to ramp up electric vehicle sales in the United States. The tax credit begins to phase out after a company sells 200,000 electric vehicles \u2014 a threshold both Tesla and G.M. are expected to reach this year.Meanwhile, buyers of electric BMWs, Volkswagens and Volvos will continue to get the full $7,500 credit. All of those manufacturers have announced aggressive sales plans for electric vehicles in the United States but so far have sold relatively few of themThe 200,000 limit on the tax credit was added in 2009 when Congress extended incentives for plug-in vehicles passed during the George W. Bush administration, as a way to move the nation toward energy independence. Tesla and G.M., far ahead of their rivals in investing in and promoting electric vehicles, have benefited from the tax credit in the intervening years, but will lose it soon, just as the market is becoming more competitive \u2014 in effect, penalizing them for being ahead of the curve.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has been railing against the way the credit is structured, saying the perception that Tesla benefits from federal tax handouts \u201cdrives me crazy.\u201d\u201cWhat matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market,\u201d Mr. Musk said during an earnings conference call last year. \u201cAnd in fact the incentives give us a relative disadvantage,\u201d since, at Tesla\u2019s current sales rate, Tesla customers will soon see their tax credit disappear.He noted that \u201cTesla\u2019s competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away.\u201d (A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment further.)Mr. Jonas, in a note to Morgan Stanley clients, agreed that the provision would help foreign rivals, but may not have much impact on Tesla. Tesla\u2019s high-end S and X models sell on average for close to $100,000, and the average price for its mass-market 3 model is expected to be about $50,000.So the $7,500 credit \u201cas a percentage of the purchase price is relatively lower for Tesla than for the makers of other E.V.s in the market,\u201d such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf, Mr. Jonas said. (The Bolt costs $37,500, and prices for the Leaf start at just under $31,000.)He said the credit was \u201cmore important for other players who are much further away from the 200,000 United States sales mark.\u201dIn theory, the problem shouldn\u2019t be difficult for Congress to fix. One approach would be to lift the 200,000 vehicle cap and continue the credit indefinitely, a move that would most likely be welcomed by makers and consumers of electric vehicles and has the support of green energy lobbying groups. But the price tag for the government could become prohibitive if electric car sales surge.Or Congress could phase out the incentives beginning at a target date that would apply to all manufacturers, or after total industry sales hit a level that suggests a move to electric vehicles is sustainable. Depending on the time or level of sales chosen, that could address concerns about the impact of the tax credit on the deficit.Tesla and G.M. have not proposed a specific fix.Many countries have far more robust subsidies for electric cars than the United States, including most of Europe. Norway has by far the highest percentage of electric car ownership in the world (about one-third of the vehicles sold there last year were electric or hybrid), along with the most lavish subsidies, which include sharply reduced sales taxes as well as free parking and use of uncongested bus lanes. The country has set a goal of zero auto emissions by 2025.How the renewable energy subsidies managed to survive to be part of the tax law remains a subject of debate, but nearly every explanation points in part to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a staunch supporter of renewable energy, especially wind. Iowa is a leader in wind power, which generates 36 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. The wind power industry employs 9,000 people in the state, according to the Iowa Wind Energy Association. (Senator Grassley did not respond to requests for comment.)With funding for the government scheduled to expire on Jan. 19, and with such a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have an incentive to find some common ground, which might include revising the electric vehicle credit.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to quite a few people interested in green energy provisions, and my sense is that you could find quite a bit of bipartisan support in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Zerbe said. He noted that Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, is a passionate supporter of renewable energy and electric vehicles.Everyone I spoke to this week agreed something needed to be done. Imposing an arbitrary 200,000 cap on the tax credit is \u201ca terrible way to approach tax policy,\u201d Mr. Zerbe said. \u201cCongress shouldn\u2019t be picking winners and losers among companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Wynn, Casino Mogul, Accused of Decades of Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStephen Wynn\u2019s perch at the top of the casino industry was badly shaken on Friday following the disclosure of allegations that he engaged in a long pattern of sexual misconduct with employees of his casinos.Some of the women told The Journal that they had tried to avoid having to give Mr. Wynn massages by hiding in bathrooms, or entering fake appointments in record logs to make it look as if some of their colleagues were busy. The newspaper relied on court records and interviews with dozens of people who worked at his casinos.Mr. Wynn, chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts, denied the allegations in a statement, saying, \u201cThe idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.\u201d\u201cWe find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cand a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits.\u201dThe fallout from the story mounted during the day. Investors fled shares of Wynn Resorts, Mr. Wynn\u2019s casino company, driving the stock price down 10 percent.Gambling officials in Massachusetts, where Mr. Wynn\u2019s company plans to open a $2.4 billion casino resort near Boston next year, said they had opened a review into the \u201ctroubling allegations\u201d of Mr. Wynn\u2019s behavior \u201cto determine the appropriate next steps.\u201dThe Wynn Resorts board met on Friday to form a committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations, saying in a statement that it is \u201cdeeply committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all of the company\u2019s employees and to operating with the highest ethical standards.\u201dThe allegations could also have political impact as well. Mr. Wynn was named chairman of the Republican National Committee\u2019s finance committee shortly after the election of President Trump in November 2016. Mr. Trump has described Mr. Wynn as a friend.Mr. Wynn and his companies have donated more than $5.2 million over the years to a mix of Republican and Democratic candidates and committees.A spokesman for the R.N.C. did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Wynn would remain as the party\u2019s finance chairman.Michael Weaver, a spokesman for Mr. Wynn\u2019s company, declined to comment when asked whether Mr. Wynn intended to step down from his R.N.C. post, and also declined to specify the last time Mr. Wynn had spoken to Mr. Trump. \u201cIn the past, Mr. Wynn has not disclosed publicly when he speaks to the president,\u201d Mr. Weaver wrote in an email.The allegations against Mr. Wynn are similar to the long history of sexual assault and misconduct documented by The New York Times in October against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. The report on Mr. Weinstein set off a wave of news reports about allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against powerful men in Hollywood, the news media, politics, the arts, restaurants and other industries.The onslaught of news reports about sexually aggressive men has been fueled, in part, by women coming forward to share their stories of sexual harassment under the banner of #MeToo.Mr. Wynn, who turns 76 on Saturday, is one of the most powerful figures in the casino industry. Like Mr. Trump, he is known for splashing his name on his casinos and resorts, and his signature is the company\u2019s logo.His ornate casinos, which included the Bellagio, the Mirage, Treasure Island and Wynn, helped change the image of the Las Vegas Strip into one encapsulating glamour, fancy restaurants and exotic attractions like the lion-taming duo of Siegfried & Roy at the Mirage. The Bellagio, a huge hotel and casino on the strip, features an array of dancing water fountains that routinely fascinate tourists. Mr. Wynn eventually sold the Bellagio, along with the Mirage and Treasure Island.\u201cThe thing about Steve Wynn is this: He is the biggest name in the history of Nevada business,\u201d said Jon Ralston, the editor of The Nevada Independent, who has reported on the state\u2019s gaming industry for decades.\u201cPeople throw around the word \u2018visionary\u2019 all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy really was a visionary.\u201dThe allegations against Mr. Wynn are notable because he is one of the most prominent executives of a large public company to be hit with multiple claims of sexual misconduct. The claims could tarnish his company\u2019s brand because his name is so closely identified with it. And given that casinos are a state-regulated industry, the allegations could have an impact on the company\u2019s management of the casino resorts it operates and other projects under construction.His planned casino near Boston came under scrutiny on Friday when the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said, \u201cThe suitability and integrity of our gaming licensees is of the utmost importance, and ensuring that suitability is an active and ongoing process.\u201dDemocrats sought to capitalize on the revelations.They pointed out that Mr. Wynn and the R.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, hosted a fund-raiser at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., just last week to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his inauguration. Democrats noted that in the wake of The Times\u2019s expos\u00e9 on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct, Republicans had blasted Democrats for accepting donations from the Hollywood producer.Mr. Wynn\u2019s selection as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chairman under Mr. Trump last year struck some in G.O.P. finance circles as odd. Mr. Wynn had initially supported Mr. Trump\u2019s rival, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for the party\u2019s nomination.A registered Democrat for decades, Mr. Wynn had long dabbled in politics, but had focused mostly on Nevada. He was seen as a business-minded centrist who cultivated politicians from both parties who could help his business interests.Mr. Wynn pivoted sharply to the right in response to President Barack Obama\u2019s pushes to pass an economic stimulus bill and overhaul the nation\u2019s health care system.Mr. Wynn and the company, in statements, both sought to cast blame for the allegations on Mr. Wynn\u2019s former wife, Elaine Wynn, saying she has been making allegations of sexual misconduct in court proceedings to further her financial interests in litigation against the casino mogul.An allegation of misconduct by Mr. Wynn first appeared in a court filing by Ms. Wynn in state court in Nevada. In that filing, Ms. Wynn said she had learned that her former husband made a multimillion-dollar payment in 2005 \u201cafter being threatened with allegations of serious misconduct\u201d against a Wynn employee on a company property.The Journal story said the 2005 settlement involved a payment of $7.5 million to a manicurist who worked at one of his Las Vegas resorts. The newspaper said Mr. Wynn pressured the woman to take off her clothes and to have sex with him, even though she did not want to.Mark E. Ferrario, one of Ms. Wynn\u2019s lawyers, did not respond to requests for comment.In an earlier statement, Wynn Resorts said: \u201cIt is clear that Mr. Wynn\u2019s ex-wife has sought to use a negative public relations campaign to achieve what she has been unable to do in the courtroom: tarnish the reputation of Mr. Wynn in an attempt to pressure a revised divorce settlement from him.\u201dAs for Wynn Resorts, the company is continuing to build and grow in Las Vegas.Sydney Ember contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Carmakers Criticized for Emissions Research on Monkeys", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Three major German carmakers that financed the researchers who used monkeys to test the health effects of diesel exhaust struggled to contain harsh criticism from animal rights activists and a wave of negative media coverage after details of the tests emerged.The research was intended to show that modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions linked to a range of lung ailments and blamed for tens of thousands of premature deaths. Instead, it has shed unwelcome light on the methods that the carmakers had used to influence political debate.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group that claims 6.5 million supporters, wrote a letter to Volkswagen protesting what it said was the cruel mistreatment of the cynomolgus macaque monkeys used in the tests.\u201cThere is nothing fair about condemning these complex, sensitive animals to suffer physical suffering and psychological torment in laboratories where they are caged and deprived of fresh air, sunshine, freedom of movement, the companionship of others, and just about everything else that makes any life worth living,\u201d Harald Ullmann, a PETA vice president, wrote in a letter dated Friday to Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen.The monkey experiments also provided another example of how Volkswagen used software to conceal emissions of nitrogen oxides that were far above limits allowed by law. The Beetle provided by Volkswagen for the tests had been fitted with software that caused it to produce far less pollution in the lab than the car would have produced on the road. In other words, the results were deliberately manipulated.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The experiments were commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T. The organization received all of its funding from Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. It contracted the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque to carry out the tests.The research group commissioned numerous studies on topics related to diesel, such as studies shedding doubt on whether restricting diesel vehicles in urban areas led to better air quality. The organization shut down last year amid controversy over its work, before the results of the Albuquerque study could be published.The carmakers said the research group was independent and overseen by reputable scientists. But the studies it commissioned invariably supported the industry\u2019s pro-diesel agenda. Diesel is particularly important to luxury carmakers like BMW, Daimler\u2019s Mercedes unit and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi division. It would be much harder to sell big cars in Europe without the fuel economy provided by diesel.Carmakers expressed contrition about the experiments.\u201cThe scientific methods used to conduct the study were wrong,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement. \u201cAnimal testing is completely inconsistent with our corporate standards. We apologize for the inappropriate behavior that occurred and for the poor judgment of individuals who were involved.\u201dDaimler distanced itself from the study and the E.U.G.T. \u201cWe will clarify how the L.R.R.I. study came about and have launched an investigation,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Albuquerque lab. \u201cDaimler does neither tolerate nor support unethical treatment of animals. The animal experiments in the study are superfluous and repulsive.\u201dBMW said in a statement on Sunday that it \u201cdoes not carry out any animal experiments,\u201d adding, \u201cThe BMW Group did not participate in the mentioned study and distances itself from this study.\u201dNews of the monkey experiments intensified criticism of how the auto industry has used its political clout to preserve tax breaks that make diesel fuel cheaper than gasoline in Europe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Officials, After Rejecting Obama Medicare Model, Adopt One Like It", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a notable back flip, the Trump administration has decided that maybe the Obama administration was right in its efforts to change the way doctors and hospitals are paid under Medicare.In the new program, as described by Trump appointees, Medicare will make a single \u201cbundled payment\u201d for nearly all the services provided in a 90-day period to certain Medicare patients who are admitted to a hospital or have certain outpatient medical procedures.Health care providers can receive a bonus if they hold Medicare spending for these patients below a target set by the government, and they may have to repay the government if Medicare spending for them exceeds the target.Medicare has traditionally paid a separate fee for each service. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new bundled payments were \u201can important step in the move away from fee-for-service and toward paying for value.\u201dThe Obama administration tried to accelerate that shift by testing new methods of payment under the supervision of an office created by the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration was at first skeptical. The new agency, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, \u201chas gotten off track,\u201d Mr. Price said last year.Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said the new initiative was \u201cvery encouraging.\u201d\u201cThe current administration would like to reverse everything associated with the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration,\u201d Dr. Fisher said. \u201cBut this week\u2019s announcement shows that there is a bipartisan consensus on the need to change the way we deliver and pay for health care.\u201dThe goal of the new project is to save money for the government while improving care for Medicare patients. The lump sum payments encourage health care providers to work together and coordinate care.Medicare will make bundled payments for 32 types or \u201cepisodes\u201d of care. These include hip and knee replacement operations, heart bypass surgery and procedures to open clogged coronary arteries, as well as treatments for heart attacks, stroke, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The lump sum payment will cover the services of doctors and hospitals, clinical laboratories, nursing homes, home health agencies and hospices, as well as reimbursement for some medical equipment like wheelchairs and certain drugs given to patients in doctors\u2019 offices.Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama, praised the new initiative as \u201ca very good model.\u201d In similar programs started in the Obama administration, \u201cquality over all seems to be going up, and costs down,\u201d said Dr. Conway, who is now the president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina.As a member of the House, Mr. Price denounced bundled payment initiatives. In September 2016, he and 178 other House Republicans sent a letter telling the Obama administration that it had no legal authority to require doctors and hospitals to participate.\u201cIf, to test a hypothesis around changing our health care system, it needs to be mandatory as opposed to voluntary, to get adequate data, then so be it,\u201d Mr. Azar said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.In unveiling the pilot project, the Trump administration said doctors and hospitals must not restrict patients\u2019 access to \u201cmedically necessary care\u201d as a way to reduce Medicare spending.The Trump administration said Medicare beneficiaries could not opt out if they were receiving services in an episode of care covered by the new bundled payment program. But, it said, patients are free to choose other health care providers who do not participate in the demonstration project.Jonathan W. Pearce, a health care consultant who closely follows Medicare policy, said the bundled payment initiatives tested in the past few years had been \u201cpositive for just about everyone,\u201d especially the patients. They provide doctors with much more information about what happens to patients who leave the hospital, he said, and using this information, \u201cdoctors and hospitals have redesigned care in ways that significantly benefit the patient.\u201dFor example, Mr. Pearce said, after knee replacement surgery, patients receive more physical therapy, and \u201cthe use of nursing homes has dropped like a stone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX\u2019s Big Rocket, the Falcon Heavy, Finally Reaches the Launchpad", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn July 16, 1969, a towering Saturn 5 rocket sat on Pad 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At 9:32 a.m., the five enormous F-1 engines of its first stage ignited, expelling orange flame, dark smoke and 7.5 million pounds of thrust to lift the three astronauts of Apollo 11 into space. Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon four days later.Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn\u2019t blow up on ascent.In response to the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d, Mr. Musk replied on Twitter:Some space advocates think Falcon Heavy could offer a quicker, cheaper path for NASA to send astronauts back to the moon. For SpaceX in the near term, the mega-rocket could help the company compete in new markets like the launching of large spy satellites for the United States government.SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, in February.If successful, \u201cit continues SpaceX\u2019s very impressive run of achieving launch milestones that have been viewed as very difficult,\u201d said Carissa Christensen, chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm that follows the space industry.But first, the Falcon Heavy has to get off the ground.That has been a long time coming, much longer than Mr. Musk originally promised.For 14 of the launches, SpaceX landed the boosters, to be reused for future flights.That approach allowed SpaceX to design a heavy-lift rocket largely by rearranging the same pieces.\u201cBecause of the commonality between Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy we\u2019re able to spread the overhead across both vehicles,\u201d Mr. Musk said at a news conference in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s able to use the same tooling, be made in the same line, and I think therefore significantly improves the probability of being able to hold to our cost numbers on Falcon Heavy.\u201dThe modular design also cut the development costs of the rocket.\u201cIt is essentially the first time the nation has gotten a super heavy lift vehicle at essentially zero cost to the taxpayer,\u201d said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado\u2019s engineering school who previously worked as a senior manager of communications and corporate projects at SpaceX.In 2011, Mr. Musk said he expected that the Heavy would have its first flight in 2013. Now he admits that putting together the Falcon Heavy proved more daunting than he initially thought.\u201cWe were pretty na\u00efve about that,\u201d Mr. Musk said in July at a conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cAt first, it sounds really easy. Just stick two first stages on as strap-on boosters. How hard can that be? But then everything changes. All the loads change. Aerodynamics totally change. You\u2019ve tripled the vibration and acoustics.\u201dThe central core was redesigned and reinforced to handle the stresses, one of the key reasons that the Heavy is more than four years behind schedule. While the two side boosters are reused from earlier Falcon 9 launches, the core is all new, as is the second stage.Another tricky aspect is the large number of rocket engines. A Falcon 9 booster has nine of SpaceX\u2019s Merlin engines, each putting out 190,000 pounds of thrust. The Heavy triples that to 27 engines and a total of more than 5 million pounds of thrust.All of the parts of the Heavy finally arrived in Florida late last year. Since then, SpaceX has been modifying the launchpad to handle the larger rocket. In the coming days, the company is expected to conduct a critical test that would light all 27 engines at once with the rocket anchored to the pad.Some wonder how much business exists for a rocket as big as the Heavy. \u201cI\u2019ve always scratched my head, why would you do this?\u201d said Jim Cantrell, who was part of the founding team of SpaceX in 2002 but left soon afterward. He is now chief executive of Vector, which is building rockets much smaller than SpaceX\u2019.\u201cThere\u2019s pretty good financial and technical reasons for going smaller,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said.Some suggest that NASA could take advantage of the Falcon Heavy as a cheaper alternative to the Space Launch System it is developing to launch robotic probes and astronauts out into the solar system. Although the NASA rocket would be larger and more powerful than the Heavy \u2014 in fact it would rival the Saturn 5 \u2014 it is also much more expensive and would fly only once every few years at a cost likely to exceed $1 billion a launch.The Trump administration has declared that sending astronauts back to the moon is a priority and has advocated a greater role in the space program for private companies. Its budget proposal for 2019, which will be released next month, should include more details of what it plans to do.Charles Miller, a former NASA official who served in the Trump administration\u2019s transition team, thinks the agency should consider turning to cheaper, commercial alternatives like the Falcon Heavy.\u201cIt\u2019s the core around which I would build a near-term return-to-the-moon strategy,\u201d Mr. Miller said.For the first flight of the Heavy, Mr. Musk has tamped down expectations. There is \u201ca real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit,\u201d Mr. Musk said in his July remarks. \u201cI hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage. I would consider even that a win, to be honest.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Elon Musk said the Falcon Heavy rocket would first launch. It was 2013, not 2014.Advertisement"}

By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.That client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports.\u201cThe borrowing entity pledged 628 million Steinhoff shares as collateral on the loan, according to a company statement at the time. After the share price collapse, however, that collateral has little value relative to the debt.\u201dHow often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong?That odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary.This obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below].The S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.\u2019s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case.Defendants argued the judges are not mere employees but \u201cofficers\u201d so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status.The S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution.The key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out.-- Peter J.

One side opens to a covered wraparound deck with a brick barbecue and an outdoor dining area; the other side opens to a garden with fruit trees. \u201cAll of the rooms in the house have access to the outside,\u201d Ms. Sofio said.Off the dining room is a closed kitchen, with stainless-steel appliances and a large marble island. The walls and cabinets are Brazilian Ipe wood, painted white.On the other side of the living room is an office-and-television room with another wood-burning fireplace and pocket doors. The lower level has two en-suite bedrooms.An en-suite master bedroom is upstairs, with a marble and tile bath that has a separate soaking tub and shower stall. There is a seating area near the balcony, which, Ms. Laich said, looks out onto the pond.Throughout the house are concrete and wood floors, high ceilings, large windows and glass doors.La Barra is in the Maldonado Department (with a population of around 165,000), which encompasses Punta del Este. Once primarily a fishing village, it has become increasingly popular during the summer season, from December to February, offering restaurants, clubs, shops and art galleries, as well as surfing and other water sports, to beach-seeking tourists.MARKET OVERVIEWUruguay\u2019s housing market peaked around 2010, Ms. Sofio said, and then softened over the next few years, in large part because of economic and political tumult in neighboring Argentina and Brazil.There are signs, however, that the market is now on an upswing.\u201cBusiness has been growing for the last year and a half, since Argentina\u2019s political climate has improved,\u201d Ms. Laich said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing a lot of Europeans coming to South America, which they see as safe.\u201dMs. Sofio said that sales volume in the Punta del Este area is up around 15 percent over last year, though prices have been largely flat. She described the current market conditions as more favorable to buyers, with more inventory available. For now, she said, \u201cYou still can get some bargains.\u201dLuxury properties on or near the beach typically start at just under $2 million, she said, and can go as high as $20 million, while more modest homes are available farther from the beach, starting at around $200,000 for a small two-bedroom house.WHO BUYS IN URUGUAYThe country\u2019s luxury market is dominated by foreign buyers, particularly from Argentina and Brazil, agents said. There is also strong demand for vacation or retirement homes from buyers in the United States, as well as Europe, particularly Germany, Belgium, Britain, Italy and Spain.\u201cThe most beautiful thing Uruguay has to offer is the countryside,\u201d Ms. Laich said. \u201cIt has these non-ending views.\u201dMs. Laich said that many young American buyers are looking for rural properties in Uruguay that can be farmed.BUYING BASICSFinancing, however, can be difficult to obtain, he said, and is typically offered at terms that are far less attractive than those in the United States.Mr. Federico Fischer also noted that there is no multiple listing service in Uruguay. Homeowners, he said, will often list their properties for sale with more than one brokerage firm \u2014 as is the case with this house.All buyers must retain a lawyer who oversees due diligence of the property and provides notary services.The buying process begins with a reservation agreement, or formal acceptance of a purchase offer, at which time a 10 percent deposit is held in escrow and a closing date set, usually in 30 to 45 days, Mr. Federico Fischer said.It is not necessary for buyers to appear at the closing, he said. Power of attorney can be granted to the lawyer, and all the necessary documents signed remotely. Many real estate transactions are done in American dollars, he added.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; Uruguayan peso (28 pesos = $1)TAXES AND FEESBuyers can expect to pay around 8 percent of the purchase price in closing costs, Mr. Fischer said. Of that amount, he said, 3 percent goes toward legal costs and 2 percent to the government for fees like property registration and transfer tax. The buyer also pays half of the sales commission, typically around 6 percent.The annual taxes on this property are around $4,500, Ms. Sofio said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusIn a competition to woo students, public universities are increasingly offering lavish amenities that have nothing to do with education.Tuition and fee hikes at public universities don\u2019t come out of nowhere. Each has to be approved by a school\u2019s governing board, whose trustees are typically appointed by the governor. Ensuring affordable, quality education is an essential part of trustees\u2019 responsibility, but unfortunately often not part of their practice.Trustees of public universities are stewards of a public trust that rests nobly on the notion that an enlightened citizenry is vital to a democratic society. They have a fiduciary duty to represent the citizens and taxpayers who support public institutions of higher education, as well as the students who attend them. But even though the best interests of students and taxpayers revolve around college access, affordability and graduation outcomes, too often presidents and boards are more focused on the rankings, reputation and popularity of the institution itself.In my career as the president of two state universities and a consultant to nearly 50 higher-education institutions, I\u2019ve observed dozens of college presidents skillfully co-opt their governing boards into approving costly projects that make schools look more attractive. (Of course, every college president has to increase costs sometimes. But the goal is to make sure it is necessary, while keeping expenses as low as possible for students.)Trustees, who typically meet four to eight times each year, are entertained as if they are visiting heads of state, flattered for their service and financial contributions to the institution. College presidents sweeten requests for new buildings and research centers, as well as additional student affairs programming, with cleverly branded words like \u201cpromise\u201d and \u201cexcellence.\u201d What board would want to withhold promise and excellence from its beloved student body?College presidents also tranquilize trustees into agreement with impossibly large volumes of reading material. Trustees get binders full of documentation about institutional successes that are padded with expensive plans for increasing growth and reputation. Most come away impressed by their president\u2019s expertise and vision and assured that \u2014 thanks to their efforts \u2014 the university is on the right track.The unfortunate truth is that while most college presidents care deeply about their institution\u2019s success, an important part of their job is to shake free more resources. They seldom initiate serious campaigns to contain costs.This means it falls on trustees to be better prepared to help challenge costly proposals that don\u2019t add educational value. When it comes to state schools, the states themselves should educate trustees to understand their responsibilities to the citizenry and students. Training on big-picture issues and higher-education trends, such as the financial trade-off between instruction and research, the costs of intercollegiate athletics, and the expansion of amenities, would help trustees develop courage to ask college presidents probing questions that look beyond institutional narratives and cherry-picked rhetoric.Our nation\u2019s governors must also play a role. As they appoint public university trustees, they can and should mandate training to make university boards responsible to taxpayers and students. I don\u2019t mean to imply that trustees should devote themselves to ritual opposition to presidents, who usually possess an unmatched understanding of the institutions they lead.But presidents are not infallible.James V. Koch, a member of the board of Partners for College Affordability and Public Trust, served as president of the University of Montana and Old Dominion University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Confirms Trump Nominee Alex Azar as Health Secretary", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate confirmed Alex M. Azar II on Wednesday to be secretary of health and human services, clearing the way for President Trump\u2019s second health secretary to begin controlling more than a trillion dollars a year in spending on medical insurance coverage for about one-third of all Americans.The vote was 55 to 43.Mr. Azar, an ophthalmologist\u2019s son and former drug company executive who served in the administration of George W. Bush, faces two huge challenges.In addition, Mr. Azar must decide how to administer the Affordable Care Act, a task for which he will be personally and legally responsible, at a time when Mr. Trump and many Republicans in Congress want to undermine and eventually kill the law.On many issues, Mr. Azar will face a choice: whether to try to stabilize insurance markets and repair the health law or to \u201clet Obamacare fail,\u201d as Mr. Trump threatened to do last summer. His choices could have significant consequences for consumers and for Republicans on the ballot this fall.At hearings before two Senate committees to review his qualifications, Mr. Azar presented himself as a problem-solving pragmatist rather than an ideologue. At no time did he deviate much from the policies set by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has failed millions of Americans who have lost the plans they liked and the doctors they liked,\u201d Mr. Azar declared.Mr. Azar, 50, graduated from Yale Law School and was a law clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court.Democrats dismissed the idea that Mr. Azar might be a moderating influence in the administration.Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said Wednesday: \u201cI\u2019m alarmed that Mr. Azar believes a woman\u2019s employer should be able to decide, based on ideology, whether or not her birth control should be covered. I\u2019m alarmed by his extreme and out-of-touch views on Roe v. Wade,\u201d the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, explained why he had decided to oppose Mr. Azar: \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s determination to destroy the Affordable Care Act through executive action has destabilized our health care system and threatened coverage for millions. I fear Alex Azar could make things even worse.\u201dBut Republicans were broadly supportive. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has been in the Senate for 41 years, told Mr. Azar, \u201cYou\u2019re one of the best public servants that I\u2019ve seen in the whole time that I\u2019ve been here.\u201dSenator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, was frustrated. \u201cMr. Azar says he agrees that prices are too high, but he does not seem ready or willing to do much about it,\u201d she said.From 2012 to early 2017, Mr. Azar was the president of Lilly USA, a unit of Eli Lilly and Company, the global drug maker based in Indiana. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Mr. Azar told the panel that \u201che had never \u2014 not even one time \u2014 signed off on a decrease in the price of a medicine.\u201d\u201cOn Mr. Azar\u2019s watch,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, \u201cthe price of Forteo, a Lilly drug used to treat osteoporosis, more than doubled,\u201d as did the prices for Humalog, used to treat diabetes, and Strattera, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Six Democratic senators and one independent joined 48 Republicans in voting for Mr. Azar. Opposing him were 41 Democrats, one Republican and one independent.The Democrats who voted for Mr. Azar were Senators Thomas R. Carper and Chris Coons, both of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote no. The independent senators split, with Angus King of Maine supporting Mr. Azar and Bernie Sanders of Vermont opposing him.Mr. Hatch said Mr. Azar\u2019s experience as a drug company executive, far from creating a conflict of interest, was an asset. And he said he hoped Mr. Azar would undo many of the policies put in place because of \u201cpoor decisions made throughout the eight years of the Obama administration.\u201dRepublicans tried unsuccessfully last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid authorized by the Affordable Care Act. But the Trump administration is determined to make major changes in the program.Mr. Azar told Congress that states should be allowed to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries. \u201cOne of the best ways to improve the long-term health of low-income Americans is to empower them with skills and employment, for those who are able to work,\u201d Mr. Azar said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics Shouldn\u2019t Be Like Open Mic Night", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsMore candidates, more activism, more enthusiasm: What\u2019s not to like? The civic-spiritedness of many citizens who are engaging in electoral politics for the first time is impressive.Analysts and reformers obsess over who sends money into politics. Far more important, however, is who sends candidates. If reasonable candidates are lacking, then voters cannot make reasonable choices. For most of the country\u2019s history, recruiting and vetting candidates was the job of political professionals: elected officials, party grandees and core constituencies such as unions and business organizations.Even after candidate selection moved from smoke-filled rooms to primary elections, careerists held influence by means of what became known as the invisible primary, in which candidates contended for the support of party bigwigs and donors.The invisible primary still happens, and it still matters, but there are many ways to circumvent it. Political aspirants have gained independent access to publicity (Donald Trump\u2019s tweeting), money (Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s small-donor base) and campaign talent (a sprawling industry of consultants).Outside groups learned that they, too, could bypass party gatekeepers. On the right, the Tea Party and other insurgent conservative groups discovered they could pull incumbent Republican members of Congress to the right by threatening them with primary challenges. Business groups and establishment Republicans fought back by recruiting and backing primary candidates of their own.Although winning public office will never be easy, the proliferation of candidate pipelines is already making it easier for aspirants to run \u2014 and for groups to grow their own politicians. As a political consultant told us: \u201cAccess has been both demystified and democratized. People who used to think there\u2019s no use running, because they would never win or it\u2019s too big an unknown, are much less cowed by those factors.\u201d Another consultant made the point more piquantly: \u201cIt\u2019s become like a clown car. Everyone thinks they\u2019re qualified and everyone jumps in.\u201dProgressive activists we spoke with said they seek not just to influence policy but also to broaden the very concept of political viability. Though the goal is laudable, inexperience can compound the chaos that is already giving government a bad name. Even a handful of political renegades can have a crippling effect on a legislative body, which is one reason Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was desperate to keep Roy Moore of Alabama out of the Senate.To be effective at their jobs, politicians need know-how, connections and I.O.U.s, which take years to accumulate. President Trump lacked all of those assets, so it is no surprise he has had trouble governing. In Congress and state legislatures, frustrated leaders find themselves saddled with anyone and everyone who prevails in low-turnout primaries, no matter how nutty or disruptive.If governing ability and candidate quality matter, and if special interests and purist ideologues are not to become the leading suppliers of our politicians, it is essential that parties and professionals maintain a prominent role in recruiting and screening candidates \u2014 alongside, not instead of, voters. By virtue of their insider status, they have a long-term interest in having parties govern responsibly.Alas, reformers have been pushing to marginalize professionals still further. In the Democratic Party, so-called superdelegates \u2014 elected officials and party leaders empowered to vote as they wish at the presidential convention \u2014 will not and almost certainly cannot reject a popular victor, but they do encourage candidates to seek the advice and support of people they will be working with if elected. Reducing their role, as progressives have successfully campaigned to do through the Unity Reform Commission (created by the Democratic National Committee to examine the party\u2019s nominating process), may appeal to the public\u2019s populist instincts, but it is shortsighted for those who care about effective government.Maintaining a competent, responsive political class requires vetting candidates through both popular and professional filters. Neither works well without the other. Both parties stand to benefit from recruiting more broadly, and, up to a point, amateurism can refresh politics.But when the country finds itself taking seriously the possibility of a presidential contest between Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey, the cult of amateurism needs rethinking.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Soccer Tournament Breaks Through the Boycott of Qatar", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 The blockade of Qatar led by its largest neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has closed borders, complicated business and affected countless other facets of life in the Gulf since it was imposed last June.Its has also affected the region\u2019s most popular sport, soccer. Supply lines sustaining construction projects for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have been interrupted, and a regional championship tournament that was scheduled to take place in Qatar in December was moved to Kuwait because Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain had refused to participate in the original location.But in the last few days, soccer appears to have found a way around the wall.On Saturday, the Asian Football Confederation, which oversees soccer in the region, declared that when teams from Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. meet Qatari clubs in the A.F.C. Champions League, the games would take place home and away in those countries as planned instead of at neutral sites. Since the blockade includes a blanket ban on travel to and from Qatar by land, sea or air, the A.F.C. effectively ordered Saudi and Emirati clubs already scheduled to face Qatari opponents to ignore it in order to remain in the competition.\u201cIt is interesting that soccer is the only thing that appears to be breaching the diplomatic and economic boycott,\u201d said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a specialist in soccer and politics in the Middle East. \u201cIn an environment in which the nations are having nothing to do with each other, this is the first way through.\u201dThe tournament went off without major incidents: Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. were placed in a different group from Qatar\u2019s, and their national teams never met on the field. But with no resolution to the diplomatic crisis, concern quickly shifted to this year\u2019s Champions League, a tournament featuring 32 of Asia\u2019s top clubs from various countries, set to begin its group stage in February.The problem was that the tournament is split into eight groups of four teams, and with four clubs from Qatar, four from the Emirates and two from Saudi Arabia in the field, a collision of at least two of them seemed inevitable. (Iran, which has sided with Qatar in the political dispute, also has teams in the tournament and has its own diplomatic impasse with Saudi Arabia.) In the end, half of the eight groups contain at least one team from Qatar and one from Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. (or both).\u201cThe regulations are clear, and matches must be played in home-and-away format, especially in club competitions,\u201d said Dato\u2019 Windsor John, the A.F.C.\u2019s general secretary. \u201cNow we need to think from an operational point of view. We need to sit down with them and see what is needed. In terms of venues, kickoff times and all the rest, there is a lot to do.\u201dBoth the Saudi and U.A.E. federations expressed surprise at the decision but quickly indicated their participating clubs would not withdraw. The first tests arrive Feb. 12, when the group stage begins.Dorsey said that he saw compliance as a practical recognition by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. of the popularity of soccer in their countries, and an acknowledgment of the risks of denying fans access to prestigious games.\u201cI don\u2019t think it shows that there is a change in attitude so much as the need for domestic maneuvering,\u201d he said.The A.F.C. has yet to comment on the prospect of neutral venues when Iranian and Saudi clubs meet. Those two countries cut diplomatic ties in January 2016, and a year later that dispute led to a Champions League semifinal between Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Iran\u2019s Persepolis being held in U.A.E. and Oman. Instead of games attracting as many as 150,000 fans combined in Riyadh and Tehran, only 14,000 people actually attended the two neutral-site matches.\u201cTaking the matches to a third country is a temporary solution, or should be,\u201d said Steve Kim, a former head of club competitions at the A.F.C. \u201cThe games need to be played home and away. But in Asia, that can be difficult.\u201dAll this sporting drama and tension is playing out against the backdrop of the 2022 World Cup, to be hosted by Qatar. The tournament is central to the country\u2019s efforts to become an influential player on the global stage, and disrupting it \u2014 or forcing its cancellation \u2014 could be seen as a coup for its rivals.The recent decision by the Champions League, then, is encouraging, according to Dorsey. \u201cIf the Gulf crisis is to last into 2022, then this breach of the blockade means that an even more significant breach would occur at the World Cup,\u201d he said.For John and the A.F.C., the issue was much simpler.\u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about that,\u201d he said of the World Cup. \u201cWe have obligations to fans, media and sponsors, and we are focused on making sure that our fixtures are completed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Spooked at Specter of Central Banks Halting Bond-Buying Spree", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly a decade, central banks around the world have been the biggest buyers of bonds, sending interest rates plummeting and stock markets soaring.Now, investors are starting to worry about what would happen if the richest nations start to scale back on a buying binge that most of them began to stimulate economies hurt by the global financial crisis.\u201cYour largest investor might be stepping back, that\u2019s what spooked people,\u201d said John Briggs, a bond strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThe market is very vulnerable to any change in supply and demand.\u201dThat vulnerability has been on display in recent weeks, with many investors selling out of their bond positions, pushing the yield \u2014 which rises as bond prices fall \u2014 on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bill up to a high of 2.59 percent on Wednesday from 2.3 late last year.Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed in early trading, and the dollar weakened at the prospect of lessened demand tied to a selling of United States bonds by a large holder like China. The rising yields led Bill Gross of Janus Henderson, whose renown as a bond investor came to define the multidecade bull market for fixed-income securities, to pronounce the start of a bear market for bonds, although he said on Wednesday that he did not foresee drastic losses.Officials at the agency that manages China foreign reserves on Thursday issued a statement that media reports about suspending purchases of Treasuries \u201cmay quote the wrong source of information, or may be fake information.\u201dAnalysts do not believe that the country, which under President Xi Jinping has taken pride in its standing as an elite member of the club of wealthy nations, would rashly unload the securities it has amassed over the years.Not only would such a step hurt China by decreasing the value of its bond holdings, it would wreak havoc in a global economy that the country is now fully integrated into through deep trade and financial links.To some experts, a move by China to pull back on its bond-buying could simply be seen as responsible-reserve management by one of the world\u2019s richest central banks. \u201cThe boring explanation here is that China just has enough Treasuries in its portfolio,\u201d said Brad Setser, an expert in global capital flows at the Council on Foreign Relations.But there is another interpretation that gets at the simmering tensions between the United States and China over North Korea and trade. \u201cIt is possible too that China wants to signal to its people that it will not keep financing the U.S. when the U.S. is not treating China with respect,\u201d Mr. Setser said.For now, investors appear to have accepted the benign view. Major stock indexes in the United States were down only slightly on Wednesday, and the VIX index, which measures investor expectations of a sharp market move in the future, remained just over 10, a very low level.Nevertheless, the mere thought that China might choose to unload some of its Treasuries fed broader concerns about how the markets react as central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe normalize policies adopted to prop up faltering economies.All told, the three central banks are sitting on $14 trillion in securities they have bought since 2009: a $4.4 trillion mix of Treasuries and mortgage securities held by the Federal Reserve; the European Central Bank\u2019s $5 trillion in corporate and government bonds; and $4.5 trillion worth of bonds and exchange traded funds accumulated by the Bank of Japan.Moreover, the view that the United States government, in the wake of the tax cut package, will have to issue more securities to finance a larger budget deficit is giving bond investors pause.\u201cThe U.S. is about to issue a whole lot more debt in an environment where the demand for that debt is about to go down,\u201d said Daniel W.

It advocates ceaselessly for the notion that every problem \u2014 from climate change to joblessness to terrorism to cybersecurity \u2014 requires international cooperation and multilateral solutions.\u201cIf you take away Trump\u2019s Twitter ridiculousness, it\u2019s actually been a pretty good year for the business community,\u201d said Raymond Nolte, a managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that manages more than $10.7 billion in assets. \u201cHe\u2019s basically accomplished major reform.\u201dThough many economists assert that the American economic expansion, now into its ninth year, owes much to federal spending unleashed by the Obama administration, the story within the finance community is that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory proclivities combined with his $1.5 trillion tax cuts will greatly juice growth.The business elite are not crazy about Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange of nuclear threats with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. They are worried about the American president\u2019s threats to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement while undermining support for the World Trade Organization, the linchpin of the global, rules-based mode of international commerce.But they like what Mr. Trump has meant for the raging American stock market and, more broadly, enhanced forecasts of global economic growth.\u201cA lot of it is perception,\u201d Mr. Nolte said. \u201cIt\u2019s had psychological impact with the business community, persuading companies to invest and hire.\u201dFar from an exclusively American view, business leaders from around the world appear to bring this sort of thinking to bear as they prepare for Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance in Davos, where he is expected to speak on Friday.\u201cHis visit will get a lukewarm reception because of his America First policies,\u201d said Ralph Hamers, chief executive officer of ING Group, the Netherlands-based global bank. \u201cBut for a lot of companies, his policies have been very supportive. That\u2019s why you see the markets doing well.\u201dThe official agenda of Davos is full of earnest discussions of inequality, human rights, gender equality and the rise of automation as a threat to jobs. In these sorts of venues, Mr. Trump is a man whose words and deeds evoke great consternation.But the ballroom of every surrounding hotel is full of parties paid for by investment houses and global consulting companies. Aged Bordeaux and single malt whiskey flow freely while clients are entertained. In these quarters, Mr. Trump is a subject discussed with care, yet with palpable appreciation.Many business leaders decline to discuss Mr. Trump on the record, cognizant that his very name is deeply intertwined with debates over acceptable public behavior. None of these are subjects that companies are eager to link to their brands.\u201cYou\u2019re going to see very bifurcated points of view,\u201d said Jeff Schumacher, founder and chief executive officer of BCG Digital Ventures, a venture capital investment arm of Boston Consulting Group, the global consulting company. \u201cBusiness leaders are excited about some of the things that have been pro-business, but on climate change and geopolitical things, they are not so happy.\u201dMr. Schumacher prefers to accentuate the positive.\u201cThe tax law will be very advantageous to us, and I think you\u2019ll see it spawn a lot of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s playing right into the strength of what we do.\u201d\u201cAs global leader, the United States has lost a lot of recognition, purely because of the current leadership,\u201d said Joel Motsweng Baepi, director of governance, regulatory and corporate affairs in the South African office of Old Mutual, the global insurance company. \u201cHis is just dumb bigotry. Unfortunately, it\u2019s dumb bigotry you cannot ignore because it comes from the White House.\u201dMark Malloch-Brown, a former United Nations official who now chairs the Business and Sustainable Development Commission in Britain, suggested that the reaction to Mr. Trump in Davos would be both muted and concerned.\u201cThe delegates themselves are likely to be polite to a fault and enthusiastic about the U.S. stock market performance, but will have difficulty concealing their anxiety about an erratic protection of American power in the world and his own psychological stability,\u201d Mr. Malloch-Brown said.But people who measure value with money have different views.But ask her about markets and investment, and Ms. Marcegaglia has kind words for Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot businessmen think his tax reform is fine \u2014 the idea that through lowering the tax rate you can attract investment is something that makes sense,\u201d she said.Longtime attendees of the World Economic Forum are prone to discuss \u2014 and sometimes lampoon \u2014 the values of so-called Davos Man (and Woman), the quintessential attendee who is at once deeply disturbed by the plight of Syrian refugees, at pains to address climate change and perpetually able to extract new fortune from every situation.For that crowd, Mr. Trump effectively forces a choice. In action and words, he is anathema to the foundational ideals of the forum. He is also making rich people richer, and many of them are here.\u201cThey are now licking their lips,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist. \u201cDavos Man has been able to overlook Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 rhetoric, his anti-climate-change action, his protectionism, nativism, racism, bigotry, narcissism, misogyny, for the lucre that seems to be the true motivating force behind Davos Man.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the consulting firm for which BCG Digital Ventures is the venture capital investment arm.

{"Headline": "Hurricane-Torn Puerto Rico Says It Can\u2019t Pay Any of Its Debts for 5 Years", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria has made Puerto Rico\u2019s already dire financial situation even worse: The island\u2019s leaders acknowledged late Wednesday that they will not be able to pay down any portion of their more than $70 billion debt for the next five years because of the damage.Just before the hurricane, Puerto Rico had made plans to pay creditors a total of $3.6 billion through 2022. That was a fraction of the amount due, had the island, a United States territory, not gone into default.After years of propping up a struggling economy with unsustainable borrowing, Puerto Rico\u2019s financial reckoning was inevitable. The hurricane\u2019s long-lasting impact, a new plan shows, will only make matters worse and extend the suffering of the island\u2019s workers and businesses.\u201cWe already had a recession in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said. He added that the hurricane\u2019s \u201csocial impact was significant, because of the exodus and population decrease we\u2019ve had in Puerto Rico, and expect to have in the future.\u201d The government projects its population will shrink by 19.4 percent over the next five years, with a total exodus of over 600,000 people.In the new fiscal plan, the government relies heavily on federal money both to repair damage and rekindle the economy, which the plan estimates contracted by 11.2 percent, nearly triple what the government estimated last year. It calls for receiving $35.3 billion in public assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the island hopes to receive \u201csignificantly more\u201d in assistance, having requested $94.4 billion in disaster aid from Congress.Whether Congress will agree to the disaster aid request remains in question. Hurricane relief was kept separate from a stopgap spending bill last month, and lawmakers, embroiled in a political fight over immigration policy, have yet to decide when they might take up the aid bill.Assured Guaranty, a company that has insured some of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, said in a statement Thursday that the plan was \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d for failing to identify real economic reforms, and \u201cwould insure that Puerto Rico would be distracted by years of costly litigation.\u201d It warned that Puerto Rico\u2019s actions could shake confidence in the entire public finance system of the United States, making it more expensive for all states and cities to raise money for infrastructure and essential services.The federal government has questioned whether Puerto Rico is as cash-poor as it says. On Jan. 9, the Treasury Department and FEMA notified Puerto Rico it could not begin drawing on its share of a $4.9 billion disaster-relief loan approved by Congress, because the territory still has about $1.7 billion in cash available to spend on its own \u2014 as well as another $6.9 billion in cash \u201con deposit in over 800 accounts across all Commonwealth governmental entities.\u201dLast Friday, the oversight board asked Puerto Rican officials about the $6.9 billion, which was discovered in December. About $4.3 billion was said to be tied up in funding for other government agencies, even as utilities struggle to make ends meet.The board has been at odds with Puerto Rican leaders over how to restore fiscal balance after years of the island spending more than it had and borrowing to make up the difference. The board, for example, has insisted on reducing public employee pensions by 10 percent, on average, as a way to spread the economic suffering evenly among Puerto Ricans. Mr. Rossell\u00f3 maintained on Wednesday that the pensioners are too \u201cvulnerable\u201d a population.\u201cThe Oversight Board views implementing structural reforms and investing in critical infrastructure as key to restoring economic growth and increasing confidence in residents and businesses,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cOur focus in certifying the revised plans will be to ensure they reflect Puerto Rico\u2019s post-hurricane realities and provide a realistic basis\u201d for recovery and sustainability.On Monday, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 announced his intention to privatize the power authority. The governor said that privatizing it would make electricity cheaper and more reliable and attract more business to the island. He also suggested that the proceeds from selling Prepa to private investors could be used to pay the pensions of retired public workers.Now Prepa is so short on cash that it shut down two power plants on Tuesday night to save fuel. The government said people who had already gotten their power back would not be affected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For David Beckham and M.L.S., a Miami Marriage at Last", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 After four years of frustration and dead ends, David Beckham\u2019s efforts to establish a Major League Soccer team here finally bore fruit on Monday with the league\u2019s announcement that it had granted his ownership group an expansion franchise.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for 20 years, since the Fusion, and we\u2019re very excited,\u201d said Juan Carlos Aviles, 32, a youth soccer coach, referring to the Miami Fusion, the previous M.L.S. team based here. That club was folded in 2001 after years of poor attendance, the same year that the Tampa Bay Mutiny, another M.L.S. franchise, folded.This time, the league is promising to put its full weight behind the Beckham team. M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber has endured years of skeptical questions about the bid\u2019s many ups and downs, but on Monday he beamed as he told the crowd that he intended to help make the league\u2019s newest team \u201cone of the great clubs of the world.\u201dWhat neither he nor Beckham could provide were any concrete details about the team itself: a name, colors or even when it would begin play. \u201cAll that will be rolled out in the coming months,\u201d said Tadd Schwartz, a spokesman for the new club.Beckham and his group were clearly relieved that this day had come.\u201cThis is something that has been a dream for many, many years,\u201d said Beckham, a former captain of England\u2019s national team who also played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Paris St.-Germain and in M.L.S. with the Los Angeles Galaxy.\u201cThere were times we said, \u2018This dream is not going to happen \u2014 there\u2019s too many bumps in the road,\u2019\u201d Beckham added. \u201cBut we never gave up.\u201dMonday\u2019s announcement was made almost exactly four years after M.L.S. heralded Beckham\u2019s intention to exercise his ownership option. The pledge Beckham received from Garber back then was contingent on Beckham\u2019s group finalizing a stadium plan \u2014 a point M.L.S. officials have made publicly and privately for years. Last fall, after reports of wavering confidence in the shifting ownership group and mounting frustration at the league office in New York, the deal appeared all but dead.But after a dinner in New York two months ago, a newly configured ownership group came into play, determined to press on. The new members included the billionaire founder of the Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, and the brothers Jorge and Jos\u00e9 R. Mas, members of one of Miami\u2019s most well-known Cuban exile families and the owners of Mastec, an engineering and construction company based nearby in Coral Gables. The other members of the group are Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, and the entertainment mogul Simon Fuller, a longtime associate of Beckham\u2019s.\u201cThe stars have aligned,\u201d Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez, the Miami-Dade County mayor, said in a telephone interview on Monday. \u201cThere were a lot of false starts, a lot of obstacles to overcome. David persisted and persisted, and when a door closed, there was always another one.\u201dBeckham\u2019s first plan was to build a stadium in the county-owned PortMiami, but the cruise industry, heavily invested in the harbor, put up roadblocks to the deal. Later proposals included a waterfront site in downtown Miami and another in the Little Havana neighborhood, next to Marlins Park, but both ran into their own crippling hurdles.Although the deal is all but sealed for the Overtown location, at least one legal challenge remains. It concerns part of the proposed site, a 2.8-acre lot owned by the county and used as a storage depot. In a lawsuit filed last summer, Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy Miami landowner, challenged the county\u2019s approval of the $9 million sale since it had not allowed for competitive bids. County officials argued that Florida law permits such no-bid transactions involving public land if they result in wider economic benefits. In October, a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge dismissed the lawsuit, but Matheson has appealed.In addition, some residents of Overtown, traditionally one of the city\u2019s poorest and most underdeveloped neighborhoods, have objected to the proposed stadium on the grounds that there is no official provision for job creation in the immediate area.But most businesses seem to welcome the prospect of a stadium in their midst. \u201cTalk about stimulating the neighborhood,\u201d said Luis Garc\u00eda, whose family has run a seafood restaurant on the Miami River, three blocks south of the proposed soccer venue, since 1966. \u201cI\u2019ve got to believe that local restaurants and bar owners are going to benefit. Consider the demographics: We have the melting pot of Latin America. How come we haven\u2019t had a major soccer team here?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Add Momentum to G.O.P. Push to Loosen Banking Rules", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most significant attempt to loosen rules imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis is underway in Congress as the Senate looks to pass legislation within the next month that would roll back restrictions on swaths of the finance industry.Buoyed by their success in rewriting the tax code, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have now set their sights on helping the financial industry, which has been engaged in a quiet but concerted push to relax many post-crisis rules and regulatory obligations, particularly for thousands of small- and medium-sized banks.The bill would allow hundreds of smaller banks to avoid certain elements of federal oversight, including stress tests, which measure a bank\u2019s ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. Under current law, banks with assets of $50 billion or more are considered \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d and therefore governed by stricter rules. The bill would raise that threshold to institutions with assets of $250 billion or more, leaving fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to the stricter oversight.Banks with assets of $50 billion to $100 billion would be immediately freed from those requirements. Financial institutions with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets, such as BB&T and American Express, would no longer be subject to tougher rules after 18 months, although the Federal Reserve would retain the authority to periodically conduct stress tests on those firms.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Kentucky Republican, is expected to bring the bill to the Senate floor within the next month.Hurdles remain. The House has already passed its own far more sweeping deregulatory effort. And progressive Democrats who warn that the legislation would return Wall Street to its more reckless past are mobilizing in hopes of derailing the legislation \u2014 even if that means attacking fellow Democrats who support it.\u201cThis bill increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout, and I will continue to challenge supporters of this bill \u2014 from both parties \u2014 to explain why they stand on the side of big banks instead of working families,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat.Still, lobbyists, lawmakers and administration officials say this is the make or break year for overhauling Dodd-Frank.Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said the legislation would correct what banks view as regulatory overreach borne of a hasty legislative effort to shore up a cratering financial system after the 2008 crisis. \u201cWhat I do think is significant here is that you have a recognition that\u2019s been building for several years that parts of the policy response were misguided, ill-conceived and missed the mark,\u201d Mr. Nichols said.Some industry lobbyists have pointed out that rules ushered in after the financial crisis have in some ways been beneficial for the big banks, acting as a barrier to entry for any bank without the resources to handle the additional compliance costs.The bill that is working its way through the Senate was brokered primarily by Senator Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the banking committee, and moderate Democrats such as Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. Eleven Senate Democrats are co-sponsoring the bill, making its passage in the Senate likely.Backers argue that the bill would offer much-needed relief to small banks and credit unions in parts of America that have been struggling under regulations that had primarily been aimed at the biggest banks.\u201cA lot of what was Too Big To Fail under Dodd-Frank became \u2018too small to succeed\u2019 because of the onerous regulatory burdens,\u201d Ms. Heitkamp said.Under the bill, firms with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempt from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making risky bets with federally-guaranteed deposits. Mortgage rules for small lenders would also be eased.Some critics of the bill say it goes too far. They argue that many of the institutions that received bailout money during the downturn would get less oversight.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to increase stress on the financial system,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit organization calls for tougher regulation of Wall Street. \u201cIt\u2019s going to increase the risk to individual banks and when significant numbers of individual banks go bust, that increases the stress on the system.\u201dMany House Republicans could find it difficult to back a bill that leaves the bureau unscathed, but weakening it has almost no chance in the Senate.The Trump administration has signaled its support of the Senate bill, with Gary D. Cohn, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, telling Bloomberg News earlier this month that the Senate bill would \u201cchange the regulatory environment for the vast, vast majority of banks in the United States.\u201dIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we\u2019ll have something on that.\u201dMr. Trump has been hiring regulators who have expressed reservations about \u2014 or been critical of \u2014 some of the post-crisis rules. In November, Mr. Trump tapped Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Mulvaney once characterized the bureau as a \u201csick, sad\u201d joke.Mr. Mulvaney has been hiring like-minded staff members to ensure that the consumer bureau\u2019s new leadership will not be prone to what he considers regulatory overreach. Mr. Mulvaney has also frozen the bureau\u2019s data collection system, a move that has slowed its ability to conduct examinations.. The appointment last year of Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision is also expected to benefit those seeking looser oversight: Mr. Quarles has suggested that some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008 should be relaxed.\u201cI think the bigger changes to Dodd-Frank in 2018 will come from changes at the regulators from the new regulatory team and not from new legislation, even if it is enacted,\u201d said Aaron Klein, policy director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at The Brookings Institution.Despite the bipartisan support for legislative action, it will not happen without a fight, especially when Wall Street is generating record profits and after companies just received large tax cuts. Moderate Democrats who sign on to a bill to help community banks can expect to hear from the party\u2019s progressive wing that they have defanged Dodd-Frank.The dissension among Democrats was evident as the banking committee considered the bill last year. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Ms. Warren were especially vocal in their opposition to a bill that they viewed as a dangerous giveaway.\u201cThis major move to deregulate the big banks is a major move to undermining Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cEspecially in these Red States where economic populism is the key to Democrats winning re-election in 2018, the folks in the most competitive elections should realize that doing the bidding of the banks is not especially helpful to them.\u201dMs. Warren is expected to mobilize her network of progressive activists to oppose the changes to Dodd-Frank. She is even prepared to make her Democratic colleagues cast difficult votes during the amendment process to drive home the point that banks that received bailout money should not be deregulated.For Democrats who are crossing Ms. Warren on the issue, the hope is that the fallout will be minimal.\u201cWere going to agree to disagree,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who sits on the banking committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to split open the kind of unity you\u2019ve seen in the Democratic Party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Studied Accounting. Now He Hunts the Taliban.", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar \u2014 When Navy Lt. William Conway is piecing together clues about a new Taliban or Islamic State terrorist cell in Afghanistan, he often falls back on skills he learned hauling crooks, swindlers and embezzlers into court in Chicago.Lieutenant Conway is not your typical military intelligence analyst. A former state prosecutor in Chicago, he comes armed for his sleuthing duties with a law degree from Georgetown University and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Not to mention an undergraduate degree in accounting from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.All of which made Lieutenant Conway the right person at the right time, despite his relatively junior rank. He arrived at this air command center in August on Navy reservist duty to lead an Afghanistan intelligence team just as the Trump administration was ramping up its air and ground campaigns there.\u201cWorking complicated embezzlement cases, it took a lot of time trying to trace individual transactions, how crimes had occurred or how a person was able to steal so much,\u201d Lieutenant Conway said in an interview. \u201cI use the same skills here, getting little nuggets of intelligence all the time \u2014 some important, some not \u2014 then weaving them together into a narrative.\u201dUnder Lieutenant Conway, what was a one-person unit has grown to six analysts \u2014 including personnel from the United States Army and Air Force and the British Royal Air Force \u2014 who track Taliban and Islamic State threats for the air war commanders here, and alert other analysts about potential militant targets.\u201cMy team\u2019s job is to stay on top of all the intelligence trends and threats in Afghanistan,\u201d said Lieutenant Conway, 39, whose analysts recently started working 12-hour shifts round-the-clock to keep pace with the quickening events.For instance, Lieutenant Conway said there has been an increase in deadly attacks on Kabul by the Islamic State \u2014 at least eight since October. \u201cShould ISIS-K take additional territory, this is likely to be a trend that will continue,\u201d he said, using another name for the ISIS branch in Afghanistan.Gauging the effect of the airstrikes on the Taliban and Islamic State is also a high priority for his team. Watching and eavesdropping on the scurrying around by drug-lab operators whose depots were not hit in the first wave of strikes offered keen insights for planners drawing up the next set of strikes, helping them map out local Taliban networks.\u201cThe Taliban is trying to find other ways to make money,\u201d Lieutenant Conway said. \u201cWe have to stay one step ahead of that. Narcotics is still No. 1. But we\u2019re also looking for other sources of their revenues, such as extorting the local population.\u201dThe weekly intelligence updates from Lieutenant Conway and his team provide senior officers and planners here \u201cwith the detail and context needed to successfully plan and assess air operations in a very complex fight,\u201d Maj. Gen. David S. Nahom, the deputy United States air commander for the Middle East and Southwest Asia, said in an email.Lieutenant Conway\u2019s path to his job here was a circuitous one. He grew up listening to war stories from his grandfather, a Naval Academy and Korean War veteran. When he considered joining the Navy after college, however, military rules at the time disqualified him because of surgery he had as a teenager to repair a hole in his heart.After law school and a brief stop at a technology company, Lieutenant Conway landed at the office of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney in Chicago, initially slogging through misdemeanors and traffic court.When a department reorganization offered a job in the public corruption office, Lieutenant Conway, with his accounting background, became the lead prosecutor in several complicated embezzlement cases. One conviction involved a suburban welfare department official who skimmed $125,000 in welfare funds. Another focused on a township treasurer who overpaid himself $135,000 over three years.About this time, Lieutenant Conway learned that military rules had changed and that he could join the Navy Reserve with a medical waiver, which he did in May 2012. He had also been taking night classes at the University of Chicago to earn his M.B.A., believing a career in business might be more to his liking. In July 2013, he joined J.P. Morgan in Chicago as an investment banker dealing with large manufacturers like Ford and General Motors.Lieutenant Conway spent a couple of monthlong reservist assignments in Britain, but his first extended overseas deployment brought him to Qatar, a tiny Persian Gulf nation, over the summer for a seven-month tour.He will wrap up his assignment here at the end of March, and return to Chicago to teach real-estate finance at DePaul University, marry his fianc\u00e9e (a fellow lawyer) and root for his beloved Chicago Cubs. Until then, he is focused on Afghanistan.\u201cWhen you look at the Taliban, it\u2019s not like fighting a country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a group of networks that fit together \u2014 sometimes strong, sometimes weak \u2014 that drives the fight. It forces us to be nimble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rams Bank on Playoff Football to Win Over Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The reboot of the once-and-again Los Angeles Rams will get a huge lift on Saturday, when they host the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs.Dave Stanley will be there, just as he was in 1986, the last time the Southern California version of this team hosted a home playoff game. \u201cI\u2019m so ready for this,\u201d said Stanley, 57, a lifelong Angeleno who is part of a group of die-hard Rams fans who wear hollowed-out watermelons on their heads when they sit in a section at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum known as the Melon Patch.Melon-heads like Stanley experienced two decades of N.F.L. diaspora while their beloved Rams played in St. Louis from 1995-2015. The Rams returned to the Los Angeles region in 2016, then pulled off a stunning turnaround this season, winning 11 games, compared with four in 2016, a feat nearly matched by the newly rechristened Los Angeles Chargers, who relocated up the 405 from San Diego this season and almost made the playoffs.The teams\u2019 resurgences came at a critical time. Less than 10 miles from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rams are building a $2.6 billion stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood that the Chargers will also call home. The stadium is now a vast construction site a few miles south of Los Angeles International Airport. The teams will soon begin asking their fans to spend thousands of dollars on personal seat licenses, the unpopular permits that are required before they can spend thousands of dollars more on season tickets.With licenses for the best seats potentially costing more than $100,000, Stanley and thousands of other loyalists are nervous they won\u2019t be able to afford a seat in the new stadium. There are financial limits to his love for the Rams, fanatical as it may be.\u201cIf they say, 10, 15 grand for a seat license, it\u2019ll be DirecTV, here I come,\u201d said Stanley, who works at hardwood specialty products company.The success of those sales campaigns will amount to a referendum not just on the Rams\u2019 and Chargers\u2019 popularity, but on the wisdom of the N.F.L.\u2019s decision to let two teams move to Los Angeles. If the stadium is perceived as a pricey and exclusive luxury, the league\u2019s goal of reintegrating itself into the country\u2019s second largest market could sputter further.Attendance at Rams games fell 24 percent this year, as the novelty factor of their maiden 2016 season wore off. The number of households watching Rams games dipped six percent this season. The Chargers struggled to fill the 30,000-seat StubHub Center, a soccer stadium where Chargers fans were often outnumbered by fans of the visiting team.\u201cEveryone knows we\u2019re the new kids of the block,\u201d said Dean Spanos, the Chargers owner. \u201cWe knew coming up here there wasn\u2019t going to be a red carpet rolled out for us. We have to earn our way in.\u201dStill, on the field, things couldn\u2019t have gone much better the past few months. After the Rams\u2019 dismal first season back in Los Angeles, the precocious rookie head coach Sean McVay secured the Rams\u2019 first division title since 2003. Powered by quarterback Jared Goff and Todd Gurley II, an M.V.P.-caliber running back, the Rams became the first team in the Super Bowl era to have the highest scoring offense a year after having the lowest.The Chargers lost their first four games, then won nine of their last 12, fueled by the league\u2019s best passing game. If the team hadn\u2019t lost three games by a field goal or less, it might have squeezed into the playoffs.However the teams perform, N.F.L. officials say they are confident the city will embrace the league, even though the Rams and Raiders abandoned the region after the 1994 season. Many owners believe the market, with about 15 million residents, can support two teams. They say the N.F.L.\u2019s flash and speed is a natural fit in the entertainment capital of the world.Kevin Demoff, the chief operating officer of the Rams, echoed this view and shrugged off the early hiccups. He blamed the decline of the team\u2019s television audience on competition. Certain games took place at the same time as Chargers games, or had to fight for eyeballs with the national game of the week. And while attendance fell, he said, the team is attracting a more devoted following, not just casual fans eager to say they attended a game.\u201cAs you drive around the city, you see Rams car flags, and you know you\u2019ve made it when you see car flags,\u201d Demoff said. He described reviving and building a new fan base as a long-term process. \u201cLike building the stadium, this is going to take years.\u201dWinning helps. According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of N.F.L. gear, sales of Rams merchandise jumped 50 percent this season, the largest increase after the Eagles and Jaguars.Demoff insisted the new stadium, which won\u2019t open until 2020, will help define the team in Los Angeles, and befit a league that has grown into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. Its scale and scope suggest as much. The 300-acre city-within-a-city will be 3.5 times larger than Disneyland Park in Anaheim.During the 14 months since ground was broken on the site of the old Hollywood Park Racetrack, crews have moved more than six million cubic yards of dirt, enough to fill 600,000 dump trucks. More than 12,000 tons of steel have been erected, helping give shape to much of the lower bowl of the venue. Many of the columns that will support the roof that will cover the 70,000-seat stadium are now in place.The building is designed to create the buzz needed to attract attention in a city that craves it. The stadium will include 275 luxury suites and 16,000 club seats, and an oval two-sided video screen that will hang from the roof. The teams are banking on these and other attractions to create a must-see venue.\u201cPeople in this market want to go to see people and to be seen,\u201d said Amy Trask, who grew up in Los Angeles and worked for the Raiders for 29 years, including several years when they played here. \u201cIf the Rams and Chargers can make their ticket a sexy ticket, it will insulate them in the down years.\u201dThough the Rams and Chargers will share the stadium, and have their own locker rooms, the teams are, in many ways, not equals, Trask and others said. When they moved back from St. Louis, the Rams were greeted by fans like Stanley, who followed them during some of the 46 years they played in Southern California.The team also had the advantage of announcing their move first. Rams\u2019 owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, is financing the stadium. The Chargers, who will be Kroenke\u2019s tenant, arrived a year later, after they failed to persuade lawmakers in San Diego to help them build a new stadium there. The team has shallow roots in Los Angeles, having played here just one year as part of the old A.F.L.Spanos was encouraged by the team\u2019s strong finish, which helped lift merchandise sales and the team\u2019s following on social media.But many loyalists from San Diego have not followed the team north. One San Diego resident was so angry at the Chargers that he raised $22,000 online to help pay for a billboard near the StubHub Center to criticize the N.F.L. and team for abandoning San Diego. The fan, Joseph MacRae, has also rented planes that flew banners over the stadium on game day, something he plans to do again on Saturday before the Rams-Falcons game.\u201cThe message I\u2019m trying to get across is that the N.F.L. really messed this up,\u201d MacRae said. \u201cPeople in San Diego are never going to root for a team in Los Angeles. No fan deserves to lose their team.\u201dFor now, though, the focus is on the Rams. Though the team\u2019s offense was understandably lauded, the team\u2019s defense improved measurably under the new defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, one of the great defensive minds of his generation. Phillips, who most recently created the Denver Broncos\u2019 buzz-saw defense that won the 2016 Super Bowl, is 70 years old, nearly four decades older than his 31-year-old boss McVay, who is known as an offensive whiz.Under Phillips, defensive tackle Aaron Donald has become a force of nature. Donald led the N.F.L. in forced fumbles, was tied for fourth in quarterback hits, and led all defensive tackles with 11 sacks.On offense, Gurley led the league with 2,093 yards from scrimmage and scored 19 total touchdowns. Goff also had a talented group of receivers to throw to, including rookie Cooper Kupp, but also Robert Woods and Sammy Watkins. The Rams had the best kick returner in Pharoh Cooper, the best punter in Johnny Hekker, and the best kicker, Greg Zuerlein, until he injured his back.And with one of the youngest rosters in the league, the Rams have the potential to succeed for years to come, something they will desperately need to win over a city with little appetite for the mediocre that is still getting to know the team.\u201cThe opening of the new stadium will be a panacea for a while, and people will be focused on ribbon cutting and flyovers,\u201d said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at USC. \u201cBut you better have the right high-octane product that captivates market. Around here, if you\u2019re not in, you\u2019re out.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of the Rams\u2019 kick returner. He is Pharoh Cooper, not Pharaoh.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Private Equity Isn\u2019t Cheering the Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet ScenePresident Trump has made conflicting statements about whether the first comprehensive overhaul of our nation\u2019s tax policies in 31 years generally helps his wealthy friends or hurts them.In a speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Nov. 29 \u2014 before the tax bill had been finalized \u2014 Mr. Trump said about the proposed changes: \u201cI have some very wealthy friends. Not so happy with me, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d But then at Mar-a-Lago, on Dec. 24 \u2014 two days after he signed the tax bill into law \u2014 he told his rich friends at his Palm Beach resort: \u201cYou all just got a lot richer.\u201dBut for at least one group of Mr. Trump\u2019s rich friends \u2014 private equity moguls \u2014 the new tax law has thrown some unexpected curve balls into their business models. The overhaul could force private equity firms to change the way they do deals for the first time since the industry got revved up in the 1980s. The changes are by no means a death knell for private equity. Far from it. But they could seriously disrupt the way potential buyout targets are valued and how quickly private equity magnates can reap their rewards. And there is no question that some of the \u201cleverage\u201d will come out of leveraged buyouts.What is especially surprising about the changes is that they happened at all considering the many pictures of private equity executives cozying up to Mr. Trump in the past year or so. Indeed on Dec. 7 \u2014 just hours after the Senate had passed its version of the tax bill \u2014 Mr. Trump held a $100,000-a-plate fund-raiser at the 740 Park Avenue home of Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the nation\u2019s largest private equity firm.Private equity has thrived for 30 years largely because the tax code allowed interest expense on debt to be deducted from pretax income. In other words, the amount of taxable income a business had in any given year could be reduced by the amount of interest expense the company paid to its creditors. That is why private equity deals used to be known as leveraged buyouts \u2014 the tax code favored the use of debt, and lots of it, over equity by making the interest paid on the debt tax deductible. So if buyout moguls wanted to maximize the return to equity holders, the tax code gave them a huge incentive to use as much debt as possible.The new law changes that calculus. Whereas there used to be no limit on the amount of interest that could be deducted, from now on, a company can only deduct interest expense equal to 30 percent of its Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. (In 2022, the limit on tax deductibility of interest tightens further to 30 percent of Ebit, after depreciation and amortization are deducted.) According to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, the first phase of the limit will raise $171 billion over 10 years, while the limit that begins in 2022 is estimated to raise $307 billion over the next 10 years. (It\u2019s worth noting that the real estate industry somehow got itself exempted from these changes.)All things being equal, the change in interest deductibility could affect how much buyout practitioners are willing to pay for companies. The cost of capital will now be higher, which in turn will affect the value of the company or business for sale.What\u2019s more, with the corporate tax rate lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent, the present value of the tax savings provided by the interest deduction will be less, too.There are other changes as well that will affect the buyout business. Whereas in previous years, private equity partnerships could get lower long-term capital gains tax treatment after owning a company for only one year, the new tax law requires that buyout firms hold their companies for three years before getting the lower capital gains tax treatment. That shouldn\u2019t be too onerous. It\u2019s fair to say that most buyout firms do end up owning their companies for at least three years. (It could hurt hedge funds, though, which generally prefer shorter holding periods.)The good news for buyout moguls is that Congress left alone their cherished loophole on carried interest, the percentage of an investment\u2019s gains that a private equity partner takes as compensation. The provision allows that income to be taxed at the lower capital gains rates rather than at ordinary income rates. It\u2019s that tax that favors capital over labor and that allows, say, Warren Buffett to pay a lower tax rate than his executive assistant does. The only change to the \u201ccarried interest treatment\u201d for buyout firms under the new tax law is that companies have to be owned for three years instead of one.The private equity industry, especially the bigger firms that like to use lots of leverage to goose their equity returns, cannot be happy about these changes to the tax code. Some analysts have taken note. \u201cThis change to the tax code will take a bite out of the bottom line of heavily leveraged Main Street companies owned by private equity firms and will reduce the incentives of these firms to overload the companies in their portfolios with debt,\u201d observed Eileen Appelbaum, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cThis is a curious development considering the lobbying effort to defeat this provision and the large number of PE big shots in positions of influence in the Trump administration.\u201dBut the industry\u2019s lobbying arm is doing its best to put a good spin on the unexpected changes. In a statement, Mike Sommers, the president and chief executive of the American Investment Council, wrote me that it \u201ccommends Congress for its pro-growth, comprehensive tax law. Tax reform is challenging, and this new law requires some trade-offs from all sectors of the business community, including private equity. While we advocated against changes to the tax treatment of carried interest capital gains, we feel the three-year holding period will continue to support long-term investment. The new limitations to interest deductibility will impact all industries that need debt to help finance growth, but we are encouraged that the provision remains a part of the tax code.\u201dThere will be unintended consequences of the new tax, that\u2019s for sure; only time will tell how severe they will be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sad Trajectory of Orrin Hatch", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhen Orrin Hatch\u2019s career in the United States Senate ends on Jan. 3, 2019, it will have spanned an audacious 42 years, or seven full terms. Assuming he completes his final term, Mr. Hatch will become the sixth-longest-serving senator ever.His service truly has been epochal. Unfortunately, the epoch has not been a happy one. Mr. Hatch\u2019s career reflects the sad trajectory of our times, from a Congress where legislators had differences but actually tried to legislate, to one in which legislators \u2014 especially Republicans, terrified of facing a well-financed primary from the right \u2014 do nothing of the sort.Mr. Hatch was elected in 1976 in one of the most improbable Senate victories, still, in recent American history. He was a Mormon, but a Pittsburgher; he had moved to Salt Lake City only in 1969 (though he had earlier done his undergraduate work at Brigham Young University, in Provo). He had no political experience and few political contacts when, the day before the deadline, this complete unknown filed his papers of candidacy for the mighty United States Senate.The incumbent was \u2014 and how strange does this sound today? \u2014 a Utah Democrat. Frank Moss had won the seat freakishly in 1958, when the Republicans split and ran two candidates. But he\u2019d gotten himself re-elected twice and was a key leader on consumer issues. In 1976, Utah was still a centrist enough state that Moss had reason to think he\u2019d win a fourth term.Today, a senator sent to Washington on those credentials would be expected to want to burn the place down. But Mr. Hatch did what senators did in those days: He governed. Across party lines. His most famous association, of course, was with Edward M. Kennedy. They worked together on biomedical research, child care, AIDS and civil rights for the disabled.Enough of that Orrin Hatch survived into 2009, when he spoke movingly at Kennedy\u2019s funeral. His personal love for his dear friend and the Kennedy family showed through palpably. But times were changing. In 2010, the Tea Party wave swept the Republican Party. One who drowned in it was Mr. Hatch\u2019s Utah colleague, the Republican Senator Robert Bennett, defeated by the Tea Party-backed Mike Lee in a primary fight that shook other establishment conservatives to their core.\u201cLet\u2019s start with CHIP,\u201d Mr. Brown replied, referring to the children\u2019s health program.\u201cWe\u2019re not starting with CHIP.\u201dIt\u2019s not that Mr. Hatch is a bad man. He\u2019s surely a decent man, trapped in an indecent dynamic. And now, the smart bet is that he will be replaced by another decent man, Mitt Romney. Mr. Romney once called President Trump \u201ca phony, a fraud.\u201d The arc of Mr. Hatch\u2019s career suggests that Mr. Romney will use different nouns two years hence, if not much sooner.Michael Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast and editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Names Newark and New York City as \u2018HQ2\u2019 Finalists", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York metropolitan area picked up a one-two punch Thursday in the battle among North American cities hoping to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, when both Newark and New York City landed on the retail giant\u2019s shortlist.More than 238 applications poured in to Amazon from cities and regions vying to become its \u201cHQ2.\u201d Amazon has narrowed the list to 20, with most finalists far from the tech-saturated hubs on the West Coast. Along with Newark and New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Denver and Nashville all made the cut.\u201cNew York gets two bites of the apple,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, of the Anderson Economic Group, which advises cities on economic development and had handicapped the Amazon sweepstakes.Before Amazon released its list of finalists, some analysts had dismissed the chances of either New York City or Newark. New York City was considered too expensive, and Newark was seen as hampered by its reputation as a hardscrabble urban center.But Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the city\u2019s most prominent residents, seemed intent Thursday on trying to capitalize on that image by appealing to Amazon\u2019s potential to be a game-changer for the state\u2019s largest city.\u201cWe have sites ready downtown, or on the waterfront. We have universities and fiber,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cAmazon could have a transformative effect on one of America\u2019s oldest cities. This is an opportunity for Amazon to change the narrative about the company and where it\u2019s headed.\u201dNew York City is already home to a large Amazon distribution center in Staten Island and offices for more than 2,000 finance, sales and marketing workers in Manhattan. New Jersey has three Amazon distribution centers, including one 12 miles from Newark.If Amazon finds housing and the cost of doing business too high in New York City, it could turn to Newark, which sits atop the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard and is in the midst of a resurgence. Office and apartment rents are substantially lower and Amazon already has a subsidiary there, Audible.Either way, Amazon could tap into a tech work force of nearly 300,000 people, far more than Chicago (138,813) or Los Angeles (166,234), two cities that also made Amazon\u2019s shortlist. The impact of 50,000 new jobs would be felt throughout the metro area.\u201cNewark, New York City and Chicago all have very strong workforces,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNewark has the advantage on cost of doing business, which is very important to Amazon.\u201dMr. Anderson had put New York at the top of his list when he rated the competition last fall. Nearly three-quarters of his top 20 picks landed on Amazon\u2019s shortlist.But the eventual winner is by no means a foregone conclusion.The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area presents a triple threat, with three areas \u2014 Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, Md., and the capital itself \u2014 making the list. Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon, has a home in Washington and owns the local newspaper, The Washington Post.Still, there are 100,000 more tech workers in the New York region than in Washington and its suburbs.\u201cThis is what Amazon said they wanted in a candidate,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNo incentives, silly sales pitches or talk of how cool their sports teams are.\u201dBut at this stage of the contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, the subsidy packages that competing cities offer Amazon may influence the decision.\u201cAmazon, like most big companies, is dollars-and-cents oriented,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cHere\u2019s where incentive packages may tip the scales.\u201dThe state of New Jersey, which is backing Newark\u2019s bid, has offered the biggest plum of all: $5 billion in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies. Newark officials have also discussed a supplementary subsidy package that could be worth as much as $2 billion.\u201cIn the last decade, Newark has experienced unparalleled growth, paving the way for many new companies to call our city home. A Newark HQ2 would mean tens of thousands of local jobs, a boost to our regional economy and small businesses, and an opportunity for Amazon to take a tremendous stake in the continued transformation of our great city,\u201d Mr. Booker said.Critics contend that the Garden State is being overly generous with tax dollars.\u201cWe remain wary of the steep price tag for taxpayers that state and local lawmakers have already put on this project,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cIt has ensured that the returns will be minimized if Amazon were to ultimately choose the state.\u201dOn the same day New York City submitted its bid to Amazon, Mr. de Blasio criticized the company for its destructive impact on local shop owners. But at this point, neither that criticism nor the lack of an enhanced subsidy package has hurt New York\u2019s chances.\u201cWe\u2019re not changing our approach,\u201d said Alicia Glen, New York City\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development. \u201cWe offered four very viable options in different neighborhoods. If you want to hire 50,000 incredibly smart people, there\u2019s no better place. And a city that has art, culture, food and urban walkability are a huge priority for this generation of workers.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, a business group that has strongly supported the city\u2019s bid for Amazon, said New York\u2019s chances are good.\u201cAmazon is notoriously cheap and our costs our high,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership\u2019s president. \u201cBut in every other way, New York is a winner. It has the markets they want to reach, the talent and a strong history as a global retail capital. The question is, \u2018Does Bezos sees the value of mixing with the global industries and market leaders that are based in New York?\u2019 \u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: With New Family Leave Law, Savoring the Early Days", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this defrosting Wednesday.As they are for many working moms, Diana Limongi Gabriele\u2019s mornings are a scramble.At her apartment in Astoria, Queens, yesterday, she made breakfast for her family, prepared her 6-year-old for school and then got herself ready for work. At one point, she held her infant daughter to her chest to breast-feed with one hand and checked her phone for updates on a work meeting with the other.\u201cI have to hand her off soon,\u201d said Ms. Limongi Gabriele, 35, pausing to smile at her daughter. \u201cThere are things that I would love to do with her just to bond, a lot of stuff during the week that I can\u2019t do if I\u2019m at work.\u201dThe law offers eight weeks off, paid at 50 percent of the worker\u2019s average weekly wage, with a cap of $652.96 per week. It will phase in over four years, until 2021, when New Yorkers will be allowed to take 12 weeks of paid leave at nearly 70 percent of their average wage. Employers do not pay for the benefit \u2014 instead, it\u2019s financed through a 0.126 percent payroll contribution from all New Yorkers.Ms. Limongi Gabriele is familiar with what unpaid leave feels like.When her daughter, Sofia, was born in March of last year, she and her husband dipped into their savings and charged necessities like groceries to a credit card so she could stretch her time off work to almost four months.\u201cI\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to spend time with my baby,\u201d Ms. Limongi Gabriele said, but the financial instability \u201ckind of had me freaked out.\u201dUnder the new law, parents can take the paid leave any time before their child turns 1, giving Ms. Limongi Gabriele five more weeks with Sofia.\u201cI\u2019m glad that as a society we\u2019re realizing that it\u2019s not only benefiting parents that are having children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes toward helping build a solid foundation for our children, who are going to be contributing members of society someday.\u201dStill, the current law is not perfect, Ms. Limongi Gabriele said.It would be hard for some single parents in New York City to make ends meet, she said, \u201cand what we really need is a national law that covers more people.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s meaningful and a move in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cFour out of 50 states with paid family leave? Baby steps, I guess.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re thawing out.Wind gusts this afternoon could make it feel a bit colder, but stay strong. Tomorrow could jump into the 50s.Electric buses are hitting the streets this week.The vehicles are equipped with Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, and are quieter than traditional gas buses.They\u2019ll be running on the B32 route between Brooklyn and Queens and on the M42 and M50 routes in Midtown Manhattan.If successful, the M.T.A. said it would order 60 more electric buses and expand the program throughout the city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fusion GPS Founder Hauled From the Shadows for the Russia Election Investigation", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From the start, he was a central casting misfire \u2014 the dark artist slicing through the capital by electric scooter, a cloak-and-dagger digger better known to former colleagues for scratching his bare belly in plain office view.Mr. Simpson\u2019s life has not been boring for some time now. It has, perhaps inevitably, become news.As investigators circle President Trump\u2019s administration over ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Simpson, a 53-year-old Wall Street Journal veteran-turned-master of high-dollar research, has arrived at the biggest story of either of his careers, lurching to the center of the Russia-tinged scandal that clouds the presidency.For months, Mr. Simpson\u2019s name has ricocheted across the halls of Congress and the airwaves of Fox News, becoming shorthand in conservative circles for purported investigatory overreach and counterconspiracies against the White House. Questions about his research have become central to Republican attempts to discredit not just Fusion but the very existence of inquiries into Mr. Trump, including the efforts of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Simpson himself has been hauled before three congressional committees for some 20 hours of questions and answers, placing him among the most significant players in the Trump-Russia affair, if math is the metric.\u201cUncooperative,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said of Mr. Simpson\u2019s turn before the Judiciary Committee, which he leads.\u201cVery cooperative,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Simpson also appeared.Mr. Simpson can be both of these things \u2014 according to interviews with dozens of friends, colleagues and investigative targets \u2014 and a few more: brash, obsessive, occasionally paranoid, perhaps with cause.The name of the firm, founded in 2010, was intended to represent a \u201cfusion\u201d of journalism and business intelligence. The \u201cGPS\u201d hinted aspirationally at a global reach.In practice, Fusion\u2019s task has often translated, roughly, to finding unsavory things about unsavory people, at the behest of not-especially-savory clients. The firm often represents corporations, hedge funds or law firms, providing a sort of public-records forensics that resembles journalism. It leans on its understanding of the news media, and its contacts among reporters, to elevate its clients and squeeze their adversaries.In election years, political opposition research can consume more of Mr. Simpson\u2019s time, with bipartisan demand.The pay is good. And the targets are rich.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out the puzzle,\u201d said Stuart Karle, a friend and the former general counsel for The Journal. \u201cThat animates him. It always has.\u201dMore notable to some lawmakers is Mr. Simpson\u2019s connection to two figures with deep bonds to Russian power, who have long fought for a pet Kremlin cause: Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a lawyer known as a formidable Moscow insider.The two have worked to turn back the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 American law detested by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, that punishes Russian human rights violators. And together with Mr. Simpson, the trio worked on behalf of a Russian-owned company accused by the United States government of laundering some of the funds stolen in a fraud uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, after whom the act was named.\u201cHe\u2019s a professional smear campaigner and liar for money,\u201d Mr. Browder said of Mr. Simpson. \u201cThe credibility of anything that he does is in question.\u201dMr. Simpson was in court with Ms. Veselnitskaya hours before the Trump Tower meeting and saw her again shortly after it, his lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, confirmed. But these contacts were related to Mr. Simpson\u2019s work on the case for BakerHostetler, Mr. Levy said, and Fusion only learned about the Trump Tower meeting in news reports last year.\u201cWe collect facts,\u201d Fusion said in a statement, describing itself as a research company. \u201cOccasionally, the facts turn out to be helpful to people we deplore, like Vladimir Putin, or undermine people for whom we have considerable sympathy, like William Browder.\u201dFor his efforts, Mr. Simpson has been presented with a defamation lawsuit and a congressional subpoena demanding bank records, which the firm is fighting in court, saying it could jeopardize a confidential client list in an industry where privacy is paramount. A legal defense fund has been formed, one of Fusion\u2019s lawyers, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., said, adding that the firm\u2019s legal costs had by now outstripped all compensation for investigations into Mr. Trump and his links to Russia during the campaign.But the work has not stopped. Fusion continues to look into ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, according to several people briefed on the research. Mr. Simpson\u2019s specific areas of focus, and information about any current benefactors, are closely guarded.\u201cGlenn\u2019s a relentlessly digging sort of guy,\u201d said Tim Burger, a friend and former colleague. \u201cIf there is a document out there about anything, he will find it.\u201dThe marriage made enough sense on paper: the former spy and the former scribe, feeling their way through second acts of lives spent investigating furtive actors who preferred to be left alone.Mr. Steele, now in his 50s, had worked undercover in Moscow in the 1990s, later serving as the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6.Like Mr. Simpson, he had changed careers in 2009, opening his own commercial intelligence firm.Like Mr. Simpson, according to people who know them, he came to hold a dark view of Mr. Putin.Mr. Simpson connected with Mr. Steele, whom he had met in 2009, when they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance who knew of their shared interest in investigating Russian corruption. They quickly got to work.As a former spy inside Russia, Mr. Steele was ill positioned to travel there himself. He hired native speakers to call informants inside the country and communicated discreetly with his own connections.The research also described a series of contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.In time, Mr. Steele shared some of his information with the F.B.I.\u201cHe felt he was witnessing a national security crime in progress,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who declined to be interviewed for this article but addressed some questions via email. \u201cI did not object, and did not ask for permission from our clients. Chris was the national security professional, so I deferred to him.\u201dBy then, Mr. Simpson\u2019s period of relative anonymity had come and gone, replaced by a spotlight that has exacerbated the kind of distrust endemic to his line of work.His name was back in the paper the next day. It had been awhile since that happened against his will.Mr. Simpson was a high school senior, not yet 18.It was nearly graduation for Conestoga High School\u2019s Class of 1982, and Mr. Simpson capped the first day of spring at his family\u2019s home in a Philadelphia suburb with a Saturday night party, stocked with alcohol. After an evening of hard drinking, a friend staggered outside and into the road. He was struck by a car and killed.At once, a reckoning gripped the region. Mr. Simpson\u2019s mother, Jane, was charged with allowing her son to hold the party. A front-page article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, centered on Mr. Simpson\u2019s gathering, detailed the rise of binge drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a release,\u201d Mr. Simpson was quoted telling the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to forget.\u201dThe most serious charges against Mrs. Simpson were dismissed. But the episode was an early signpost of an often tumultuous life for her son, vacillating from swashbuckling fact-finding to bursts of trauma and back again.In his early 20s, as a student at George Washington University, Mr. Simpson broke his neck in a car crash. In his late 30s, he turned back spinal cancer.\u201cHe had a very strong sort of ethical backbone,\u201d said Jim Glassman, the former editor in chief of Roll Call, a publication dedicated to covering Congress and Mr. Simpson\u2019s professional home before he joined The Journal. \u201cHe was a terrific reporter, kind of a prodigy.\u201dBefore long, the book industry beckoned. Mr. Simpson\u2019s \u201cDirty Little Secrets,\u201d written with Larry J. Sabato, focused on political corruption.One section tackled the burgeoning field of opposition research: \u201cThere is relatively easy money to be made,\u201d it read. \u201cThe scrupulous and unscrupulous alike are attracted to offer their wares.\u201dBy the time he reached The Journal in 1995, Mr. Simpson had assumed an eclectic place among the capital\u2019s constellation of influencers \u2014 a hard-charging reporter with a deep Rolodex, a weakness for Bob Dylan and an unquenchable thirst for revelry, mischievous or otherwise. The weekend of his Arkansas wedding to Mary Jacoby, who was also at Roll Call, included skeet shooting, chicken fried steak and a write-up previewing the festivities in The Washington Post.His home in Washington\u2019s Friendship Heights became a rollicking hub for journalists blowing off steam, with sporadic appearances from political power brokers. His Journal desk became a gathering place for half-eaten sandwiches and burps he would not bother stifling.After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. Simpson turned his attention abroad, eventually relocating to Brussels, pursuing stories on the financial sources of terrorism. He was sued repeatedly in foreign courts. The Journal suffered losses in legal fees, if not credibility, on his account.\u201cGlenn Simpson changed 800 years of English libel law,\u201d Mr. Karle, the paper\u2019s former general counsel, said of one case. \u201cIt was the first significant decision from the House of Lords that found that a journalist had behaved well.\u201dBy the late 2000s, the ground at The Journal, and across journalism, had begun to shift. Rupert Murdoch assumed control of the newspaper. The industry, generally, allowed less latitude for the kinds of costly, long-term investigations that were Mr. Simpson\u2019s trade.In 2009, Mr. Simpson announced he was leaving the profession to start SNS Global, a research company that predated Fusion, with a Journal peer, Susan Schmidt. On his last day, former reporters there recalled, Mr. Simpson brought his dog, a dachshund-beagle mix named Irving, to join him in the office, loudly encouraging him to defecate near some editors. (It is not clear if Irving obliged.)But before he was gone, Mr. Simpson had wandered down rabbit holes that would prove instructive.The name has not helped.\u201cFUSION GPS SCANDAL,\u201d read a recent headline from Sean Hannity on Fox News, stretching across the top of a studio monitor. From this screen, he connected a series of rectangles with short white lines to allege a Fusion-powered megaconspiracy against Mr. Trump.Yet Fusion\u2019s typical mandate, even defenders acknowledge, is not dripping with nobility.Few Washington industries traffic in sainthood. Many are mercenary in nature. And Fusion seems to be of a piece, hustling for its cut from an office in Dupont Circle.Amid skepticism over the dossier, Fusion has trumpeted Mr. Steele\u2019s strong standing in the intelligence community, noting that the former spy is trained to screen out disinformation.Still, at a firm that casts itself as a collector of facts, the dossier is not the equivalent of a finished news article, in journalism parlance. It is more a compilation of prepublication notes, requiring further vetting.But Mr. Simpson has bristled at the idea that the dossier is some kind of liberal fever dream. Its broad conclusions \u2014 once outlandish themselves \u2014 have already proved prescient, the firm has argued. Sometimes the conspiracy is true.\u201cMore than a year has gone by since these memos were produced,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cI have not become aware of any disinformation.\u201dDavid Enrich contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Can Woody Allen Work in Hollywood Again?", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHollywood says it\u2019s done with Harvey Weinstein, James Toback, Kevin Spacey and other figures ousted for misconduct through the #MeToo movement. But what about Woody Allen?His film distributor, Amazon, the presenters of his musical \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d and colleagues are now grappling with renewed scrutiny of allegations that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 when she was a child. Mr. Allen has steadfastly denied the claims and was not charged. But at a moment when women\u2019s voices and stories have been amplified as never before, Ms. Farrow\u2019s account carries more force \u2014 as even defenders of Mr. Allen are starting to acknowledge.\u201cI do feel that it\u2019s an escalation,\u201d Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen\u2019s sister and longtime producer, said in an interview, calling #MeToo a tool that has been used for \u201culterior motives.\u201d Ms. Farrow told The Times that she was using the movement as it was intended, to shine a light on \u201cthe truth\u201d about sexual abuse.Onscreen, another casualty could be \u201cA Rainy Day in New York,\u201d Mr. Allen\u2019s soon-to-be-completed next movie, which was financed and due to be distributed by Amazon. The company has not made any decisions about the film\u2019s future, but Amazon is having serious conversations about ending its relationship with Mr. Allen, which could leave the movie without distribution, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Amazon has contractual obligations to Mr. Allen and the film, one of these people noted.Cherry Jones, the Tony- and Emmy-winning actress who also appears in \u201cRainy Day,\u201d had a different response when asked how she felt about Mr. Allen and whether she would work with him again. \u201cThere are those who are comfortable in their certainty. I am not. I don\u2019t know the truth,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cWhen we condemn by instinct our democracy is on a slippery slope.\u201dAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment on \u201cRainy Day\u201d beyond a terse statement: \u201cWe have not announced a release date for this film.\u201d Ms. Aronson said Mr. Allen was still editing the movie and did not expect it to be released before next winter.At any point, the film\u2019s marketing may suffer if stars like Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Hall don\u2019t promote it \u2014 typically a vital part of the publicity for Mr. Allen\u2019s actor-driven films. For Amazon, part of the calculation is likely about the bottom line: whether the company would be harmed financially, or reputationally, by continuing to be associated with Mr. Allen.Ms. Aronson argued that Ms. Farrow and her supporters had \u201ccapitalized\u201d on the #MeToo movement to intensify attention on what the Allen camp views as discredited accusations against him. In a statement, Mr. Allen said that Ms. Farrow was \u201ccynically\u201d aligning herself with Time\u2019s Up.Ms. Farrow, in an email to The Times, replied: \u201cIf Woody Allen and his surrogates\u2019 response to this is that I\u2019m capitalizing on a moment in which it is in vogue to carefully look at the facts, rather than rely on thin defenses from powerful men without question \u2014 a moment in which the truth is in fashion \u2014 I\u2019d say they\u2019re right.\u201dA top Hollywood strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her professional relationships said that she would advise her clients not to work with Mr. Allen. She said a role in an Allen film would be too hard to justify \u2014 a career choice over a possible moral stand.Others pointed to the trajectory of artists like Roman Polanski as an example of the entertainment industry\u2019s longstanding moral leniency. In the decades since Mr. Polanski fled the United States to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, he has enjoyed a flourishing career in Europe, where audiences have been conditioned to separate the art from the artist. He continued casting top Hollywood stars and won an Oscar in 2003 for directing \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d (Mr. Allen has long had devoted fans, and more box office fortune, in Europe. \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d which has taken in $9 million overseas thus far, is due to open in France this week.)Mr. Allen is continuing on the creative path he has followed for decades: always writing \u2014 in addition to a screenplay, Ms. Aronson said he may be working on short stories or possibly a book \u2014 and playing clarinet at his regular Monday-night gig at the Carlyle on the Upper East Side. \u201cHis life hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said.But his artistic vision may be out of step with the times. His last four films have flopped at the North American box office, taking in a cumulative $26.9 million \u2014 roughly half of which goes to theater owners \u2014 while carrying a collective $85 million in estimated production costs, not including marketing.Before Amazon\u2019s largess, Mr. Allen, like most indie filmmakers, financed his movies by preselling distribution rights. Even as his box office results faltered, he was able to attract continued interest from distributors by casting major stars. And he was able to cast major stars (and often persuade them to work for reduced salaries) because of his reputation as a film legend and because awards sometimes followed. But pull out one element \u2014 the stars \u2014 and the model could collapse.Despite signs of wavering support in Hollywood, Ms. Aronson was still defiantly confident that Mr. Allen could make any movie he wants. Financing is already in place for the script he\u2019s working on now, she said, outside the Amazon deal. And as for casting, actors are a renewable resource. \u201cI have no doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cthat he\u2019ll be able to find new talent.\u201dThough prolific, at 82, Mr. Allen may be nearing his closing chapter as a filmmaker. Some industry observers suggested that if he continued working quietly, the controversy would blow over, as it has before \u2014 because, until #MeToo, Hollywood always had a short memory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Kabul Hotel Attack, Security Plan Queried as Death Toll Rises", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ministry said that 14 foreigners were among the dead, including citizens of Ukraine and Venezuela. The two bodies found at the hotel on Monday, more than 24 hours after the attack and after the clearance operation was declared over, were described as badly burned.Many Afghans still feared that the government was hiding the actual casualty toll, as family members arrived at the hotel gates to seek news of loved ones after searching in Kabul hospitals. The hotel remained off limits to the news media and visitors.\u201cThe two bodies found today were foreign nationals, but we don\u2019t know about who they are and which country they belong to,\u201d said Najib Danish, an Interior Ministry spokesman. Officials said that all six of the attackers had been killed.Eklil Hakimi, the Afghan minister of finance, whose ministry looks after the Intercontinental Hotel, said the shift from the Afghan police to the private security company had happened at the request of the hotel management and with the approval of the country\u2019s National Security Council.However, President Ashraf Ghani has ordered an investigation into the attack and questions related to the private security company, a senior official said.\u201cFighting suicide bombers who have accepted death to kill requires experience,\u201d said Gen. Sayed Mohammed Roshandil, the commander of the Afghan police\u2019s special forces unit that responded to the attack. \u201cWhen we saw the private company guards, they did not seem prepared for that. They were in a bad place morale-wise, although they had managed to escape to safety. They were panicking.\u201d\u201cThe guards left their weapons and started fleeing,\u201d General Roshandil said. \u201cThe three from outside entered without much trouble.\u201d He said that the three attackers inside the hotel had apparently been staying there for an extended period, learning the layout and bringing in weapons and other equipment, little by little.\u201cThey knew their way room to room, they knew floor to floor, they knew the emergency exits,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery route we would try, they would position themselves there already.\u201dGeneral Roshandil said his unit had prevented an even greater loss of life in the 200-room hotel that was full of guests.\u201cBecause our men arrived, the terrorists couldn\u2019t kill more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were playing like foxes with us, but we used our experience and tactical precision to follow them and to save lives.\u201d\u201cThose who ordered or carried out this serious violation of the laws of war are responsible for war crimes,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, the organization\u2019s senior researcher for Afghanistan.Several witnesses said that the attackers had especially singled out foreigners at the hotel, and that the first responders they saw were American forces, but those claims could not be immediately verified. Afghan special forces units are advised by American and NATO members of the military coalition in Afghanistan who go on operations with them, and use gear similar to that of coalition members, which would be hard to distinguish in the dark.One of the guests who survived the attack said the private security company\u2019s guards at the hotel\u2019s three checkpoints had barely checked his bags when he checked in at the hotel or when he went in and out.\u201cIn the first checkpoint, we were body-searched by the guards but they didn\u2019t check our luggage,\u201d said the guest, Zmarai Hamdard, who works for the Afghan Information Technology Ministry and was visiting for a conference from Herat Province. \u201cOnly at the third checkpoint they checked our luggage \u2014 not by the scanner, but with their eyes and hands. When I went out and came back, the security guards said, \u2018The scanners don\u2019t work anymore.\u2019 It was 7 p.m.\u201dAn Afghan journalist, Abdul Haq Omeri, was visiting friends in a fourth-floor suite when they heard screams \u2014 \u201cSuicide attackers, suicide attackers\u201d \u2014 and cries for help. They locked their door and stacked chairs against it.Mr. Omeri said that when the attackers pounded on their door, he and his friends remained quiet. The attackers then set the room on fire with a firebomb.Mr. Omeri was rescued nearly 12 hours after the attack began, but all three of his friends were among the dead. One jumped from a balcony to his death, and two others remained in the room, where they were probably killed by the fire or smoke.\u201cI went from one balcony to the next,\u201d Mr. Omeri said. \u201cI did not jump down. I joined other people, and reached the balcony of a room that had been already attacked and its occupant killed. We switched off our phones and stayed quiet.\u201dFor much of the night, Mr. Omeri said, he heard people screaming for help.\u201cAt one point, a woman screamed for help on the third floor,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then we heard gunfire and the woman stopped.\u201dFatima Faizi and Fahim Abed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was still trying to stimulate faster economic growth as one of the longest expansions in American history neared the end of its ninth year.The Fed said after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee that it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, a relatively low level that the Fed said would help support continued job growth and stronger inflation.The announcement brought down the curtain on Janet L. Yellen\u2019s four-year tenure as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. She will step down on Saturday at the end of her term. The Fed said that her successor, Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, would take the oath of office on Monday morning.The Fed said the economy is growing at a \u201csolid rate\u201d and the labor market continues to improve.The assessment \u201cis about as strong a characterization of the domestic economy as the committee has had during the current recovery,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. He said it was a \u201cstrong signal\u201d that the Fed is planning to raise its benchmark rate in March.A measure derived from asset prices, which tend to rise with the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, implied about a 78 percent chance of a March rate increase on Wednesday, according to CME Group, up from about 71 percent before the Fed released its statement.The unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent in December, and Fed officials do not expect it to fall much further. Instead, as growth continues, they expect inflation to begin rising more quickly.But Fed officials are still committed to moving slowly. Growth, while steady, remains weak by historical standards, and although unemployment is quite low, wage growth remains sluggish, too.\u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation,\u201d the Fed said in the postmeeting statement.The announcement made little impression on financial markets because it left the Fed\u2019s plans unchanged. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 0.05 percent on the day to close at 2,823.21. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which has climbed over the last few months on market expectations of stronger growth and inflation, closed at 2.7 percent, down 0.02 points on the day.Much of the economic strengthening happened under Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership, a period during which the Fed extended the economic stimulus campaign it began after the 2008 financial crisis. While critics warned that the Fed had exhausted its ability to improve economic conditions, and would instead unleash inflation, Ms. Yellen convinced her fellow Fed officials that the economy had room to grow, and events proved her right.Mr. Powell, a Republican with a background in investment banking, consistently voted in favor of Ms. Yellen\u2019s policies as a member of the Fed\u2019s board, and said during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the gradual unwinding of the stimulus campaign.The next meeting of the policymaking committee is scheduled for March 20 and 21. If the Fed raises rates, it would be the sixth consecutive quarterly tightening of monetary policy.\u201cFor a while now, the Fed has been very predictable in the face of a pretty benign environment,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.The risk, he said, is that the $1.5 trillion tax cut that began to take effect this month will produce faster growth and inflation, forcing the Fed to consider increasing rates more quickly.Most Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed would raise rates at least three times in 2018. Some analysts predict a fourth increase, citing a strengthening economic outlook.There are countervailing pressures. Inflation remains low despite the Fed\u2019s repeated predictions that faster inflation is around the corner. The Fed\u2019s statement suggested that officials are gaining confidence in that prediction, saying they expect inflation to gain strength this year.\u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.The value of financial assets, on the other hand, continues to soar as investors have shaken off the rate increases, keeping borrowing costs low and creating pressure for the Fed to move more quickly.\u201cThere are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble and we have a bond market bubble,\u201d Mr. Greenspan said. But he did not predict an imminent correction. \u201cAt the end of the day, the bond market bubble will eventually be the critical issue, but for the short term, it\u2019s not too bad,\u201d he said.So far, Fed officials have played down the importance of both factors, insisting that they are focused on raising rates slowly as the labor market tightens.Ms. Swonk noted that the Fed had demonstrated little ability to constrain financial markets without causing broader economic damage.Mr. Powell, she said, \u201cwill be reluctant to voice publicly the concerns that he and his colleagues have about the froth in financial markets.\u201dShe added, \u201cPrevious attempts by the Fed to jawbone financial markets into place have failed.\u201dMr. Powell may make his public debut as the Fed\u2019s chairman in mid-February, when the House and Senate hold hearings on monetary policy twice a year. The dates have not been announced, but the testimony will offer Mr. Powell a first chance to calibrate expectations for his tenure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poland Reshuffles Government, Hoping to Ease Tensions With E.U.", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Two months after coming into office, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland announced a sweeping reshuffle of the government on Tuesday, a move seen as an effort to punish political rivals while improving the governing party\u2019s image abroad as it engages in a bruising battle with other European nations.Mr. Morawiecki announced the dismissal of a third of his cabinet, including the foreign minister, the defense minister and several others with tense relationships with European leaders. He was then set to fly to Brussels, where he was scheduled to have a working dinner with the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker.In laying out the changes at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Morawiecki also reiterated Poland\u2019s stance against Muslim immigrants. The country, he said, needed to be \u201csafe at its external borders as well as inside the country.\u201d\u201cPoland is a beautiful yacht sailing across the increasingly unknown seas and oceans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whether it docks safely in the port depends not just on strong cloths, but also our crew.\u201dHe added that the new government was seeking \u201cto reconcile the European dimension with our Polish, local dimension.\u201dSince coming to power two years ago, the right-wing Law and Justice Party has increased its control over the media, sought to curb public gatherings and curtailed the independence of the Civil Service and the prosecutor\u2019s office.Critics say the changes to the judicial system effectively give the party control over the courts. The Polish government says they are needed reforms meant to correct a sclerotic system plagued by corruption and links to to the days when this country was still under the yoke of Moscow.In fact, any concrete action against the country seems unlikely, as it would require unanimity from all the European Union\u2019s other member states, and Hungary has vowed to stand behind Poland.Last week, the two nations made a show of solidarity, with Mr. Morawiecki traveling to Budapest to stand with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban.He said he believed that the immigration policies of Western Europe had been a failure and that the election of right-wing, populist parties in Central Europe was evidence that their ideas had the support of the people.\u201cI want to make it clear that Central Europe, now that it has stood on its own feet, is successful and plays a stabilizing role in Europe, and thus we want to have suitable weight in debates over the future of Europe,\u201d Mr. Orban said.Mr. Morawiecki echoed those comments, saying, \u201cSimilarly-minded nations like ourselves together can influence Europe\u2019s future in a very positive way.\u201dEuropean leaders have not set a date to approve the commission\u2019s Article 7 declaration, and some diplomats are holding out hope that the rupture can be repaired.Others have suggested that the best way to influence Poland\u2019s behavior is through economic pressure. Negotiations over the bloc\u2019s next multiyear budget are to begin soon, and billions of dollars are at stake for both Poland and Hungary.The government reshuffle in Poland was a recognition of a public image problem, but the real power remained in the hands of the party\u2019s undisputed leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.He signaled the leadership reshuffle in December and signed off on all the moves, including the ascension of Mr. Morawiecki, 49, the former finance minister.A former banker who has conducted extensive business abroad and is fluent in several languages, Mr. Morawiecki is known as a smooth operator and is thought to be someone whom other European leaders can deal with.The most significant move was the dismissal of the foreign affairs minister, Witold Waszczykowski, who was known for his harsh criticism of the European Union. He was replaced by Jacek Czaputowicz, formerly his deputy in charge of legal and treaty affairs.The appointment of Mr. Czaputowicz, a former professor at the University of Warsaw and the head of the Section of European Research Methodology, suggests that Poland might be planning to take a more conciliatory approach toward Brussels.The reshuffle is an attempt to reconcile with European Union officials after months of tensions, said Kazimierz Kik, a political scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences. The effort, he added, began in December with Mr. Morawiecki\u2019s appointment as prime minister.\u201cHe is a pragmatist and financier who is on a similar frequency as the European Commission and the European elites,\u201d Mr. Kik said by telephone on Tuesday. \u201cThe government reconstruction is a gesture of good will.\u201dStill, he added, the perceived flexibility of the new Polish officials toward the European Union does not mean that the government will back down on the widely criticized judicial overhauls. \u201cThose reforms are done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no going back.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Jerry Brown, the Face of California\u2019s Old Order, the Ranch Is Calling", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "Gov. Jerry Brown, 79, says his time in public life is almost over: \u201cI think it\u2019s getting close to the end.\u201dSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 When Jerry Brown became the 34th governor of California in 1975, he was a young and impetuous bachelor who slept on a box spring and took pleasure in defying political convention. He was the vanguard of the left, the face and spirit of a new generation of a state that \u2014 politically and culturally \u2014 was proudly distinct from the rest of the nation. He has been such a fixture ever since that it seems impossible to imagine California without him.Now, as Mr. Brown enters the final 12 months of his second tour as governor, and as he prepares to deliver his final State of the State speech here on Thursday, he has become the face of the old order \u2014 admired for his long stewardship, but also seen as a roadblock for some younger Democrats who have impatiently awaited change.This is a decidedly more liberal class of Democrats, on issues ranging from single-payer health care to the impeachment of President Trump, and many of them have long said the time has come for Mr. Brown\u2019s generation to step aside.\u201cHe is a middle-of-the-road sort of guy and if I\u2019m being perfectly honest, he is not completely in touch with the way the majority of folks in California feel,\u201d said Kimberly Ellis, a Democratic leader from the Bay Area who lost a fight last year to lead the state Democratic Party. \u201cIn many ways, with respect to single-payer and other issues, he and others play the safe role \u2014 the conservative role.\u201dNow, with a spirited race to succeed him underway, the talk has turned to Mr. Brown\u2019s next chapter and the resilience of the imprint he has left on a state with which he has been identified for so long.After more than 45 years, Mr. Brown, 79, is entering what he says are his final months in public life. He has been governor (twice), attorney general, mayor of Oakland, secretary of state, state Democratic Party chairman, and a candidate for president (three times). Mr. Brown is barred by term limits from running yet again.\u201cI think it\u2019s getting close to the end,\u201d Mr. Brown said, as his dog, Colusa, slept in the next chair. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be O.K. with that.\u201dAnd though he is by most measures exiting on a high note, he has yet to deliver on some of his biggest agenda items, including high-speed rail and repairing the state\u2019s water systems. He also predicted in the interview that California would soon enter a recession, an unusual assertion by a sitting governor.There will, no doubt, be some Democrats who will be glad to see Mr. Brown move on; while he is celebrated in some quarters as a centering force for California and the state Democratic Party, Mr. Brown is a moderate in a state that is moving left. His departure clears the way for candidates waiting in the wings who have not shied away from expressing their eagerness for new faces to take it in that direction.Senator Kamala Harris, 53, who replaced Senator Barbara Boxer, 77, when she retired, has emerged nationally as what Mr. Brown once was \u2014 a potential presidential candidate representing the nation\u2019s most populous state and embodying the hopes of its liberal wing.\u201cThere has been a generation of really incredible leaders that have come out of California and proven themselves to be national and global leaders,\u201d Ms. Harris said.Mr. Brown said he was ready for his exit, but demurred when asked if he was confident he was leaving California in good hands. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a loaded question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if I say I am not confident? That\u2019s one damn headline. So I have to say I\u2019m confident.\u201dStill, the state under Mr. Brown is prosperous: Its economy is booming and Mr. Brown\u2019s latest budget projects a $6.1 billion surplus in the next fiscal year, compared with the more than $26 billion deficit he faced when he proposed his first budget. Since the election of President Trump, California has emerged as a rare bright spot for the Democratic Party, a workshop for the party\u2019s ideas on the environment, immigration, housing and criminal justice.California has been spared the partisan battling that has afflicted Congress and statehouses in many parts of the country. That reflects both the overwhelmingly Democratic control of government, but also Mr. Brown\u2019s knowledge of how Sacramento works. He is the son of a legendary governor, Pat Brown, who served from 1959 to 1967.\u201cGive him credit: he inherited a $26 billion deficit, and when he leaves office he\u2019ll have an $11 or $12 billion rainy day fund,\u201d said Gray Davis, a former governor and also a Democrat. \u201cHe took a state that everyone was cracking jokes about to one where analysts are truly impressed with the financial progress that has been made.\u201dThat said, the future of Mr. Brown\u2019s two most ambitious initiatives \u2014 building a high-speed train line from San Francisco to Los Angeles and repairing the state\u2019s water network \u2014 is far from assured. As several critics noted, Mr. Brown has not extended his considerable political clout to take on some of the tougher challenges California faces \u2014 among them, a volatile tax system that, because of its reliance on high-earner taxes, has fueled repeated booms and busts, and a public pension system facing ruinous shortfalls. California continues to be saddled with one of the most severe affordable housing and homelessness crises in the nation.Mr. Brown predicted California would fall into a recession within the next two or three years. He and other Democrats are worried about the toll the Republican tax overhaul could take on the state\u2019s economy and housing market. And it is hardly clear that the Democrats fighting to succeed him will champion the kind of fiscal restraint that was a hallmark of Mr. Brown\u2019s tenure.Pete Wilson, a former Republican governor who defeated Mr. Brown in a race for the United States Senate in 1982, said Mr. Brown had held the line on spending \u201cto a degree.\u201d But he said spending and taxes had still risen and he faulted Mr. Brown for failing to take on public employee pensions.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a number of people say that Jerry\u2019s the most conservative Democrat in Sacramento,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cThat may be, but that\u2019s not setting the bar too high. Jerry has cultivated an image of himself as a skinflint, which has caused most conservatives to smart and laugh.\u201dAsked if there was anything that he regretted not accomplishing, Mr. Brown responded: \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of things \u2014 I\u2019ve done a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything. You don\u2019t create perfection.\u201dIn the course of a 70-minute interview at the mansion, Mr. Brown was relaxed, discursive, self-reflective and at times quarrelsome as he spoke about his past and his future. (\u201cYou\u2019re asking me predictions \u2014 let me get my crystal ball here,\u201d he said when asked if the congressional tax law would hurt California. He went on to expound at length about why it would, in his view, do exactly that.)Mr. Brown said national Democrats needed to recruit new and stronger leaders to steer the party back into control.\u201cThe Republicans have been more effective,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were able to stigmatize the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration in an incredible way. Republicans are very effective propagandists.\u201dMr. Brown argued that the Republicans were ripe for attack.\u201cWe have a lot of needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the population is aging. We know the cost of Medicaid and Medicare are going up. You are increasing the social divisions in America which will make America less governable and therefore less secure.\u201dIn his remaining months, Mr. Brown said he would be turning his attention to finishing up his California business.\u201cI think he realizes that he is running out of time,\u201d said Mr. Davis, who was Mr. Brown\u2019s chief of staff when Mr. Brown held the office in the 1970s. \u201cIf he wants to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, he has to accomplish big things. But certainly, high-speed rail, fixing the state\u2019s water system and righting the state finances are three big things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s challenging because no great infrastructure is ever built without federal help,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cCertainly I would hope we get help in the post-Trump era. We can keep going. But at some point we need the help of the federal government.\u201dGiven that strategy, the project\u2019s future may rest with the next governor. There are two Democrats leading the field to succeed Mr. Brown: Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor. Mr. Villaraigosa supports the project; Mr. Newsom, after initially supporting it, has expressed reservations about its cost and financing.Mr. Brown predicted his successor would face demands for \u201cvirtually limitless spending\u201d from lawmakers that would be almost impossible to meet. \u201cThey will have a very short honeymoon of spending,\u201d he said.California has been a touchstone for the Brown family since the governor\u2019s great-grandfather arrived on a wagon train more than 150 years ago. There are no members of the Brown dynasty waiting to step in, to run for office or to pick up Mr. Brown\u2019s role as the state\u2019s ambassador, advocate and historian.Mr. Brown seems at peace with that.\u201cI will do some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am not going to commit myself to a torrid travel schedule. Not when I have the ranch calling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Pete Wilson defeated Jerry Brown in a race for the United States Senate. It was in 1982, not 1992.Advertisement"}

Until November, he and his family had carved out a modest life in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens, where he and his wife worked as physical therapists while their twin daughters completed college. They are a close-knit family who paid taxes, kept up their house and stayed out of trouble.And now they are being deported.\u201cIt breaks my heart that families all over the country are dealing with this,\u201d said Jillian Hopman, the family\u2019s lawyer. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the past week with what we thought was going to be reform with DACA, I don\u2019t think Trump knows what he wants. It\u2019s only a political thing to appease his base. But I find it just disgusting and unnecessarily cruel that they\u2019re not looking at any of these people as individuals.\u201dEven though he and his wife had checked in regularly with immigration authorities over the years, Mr. Villacis had braced for the worst. The president\u2019s nationalist remarks \u2014 and his base\u2019s enthusiastic approval of his tough talk \u2014 led him to put his affairs in order. He installed a stair lift for his mother, who lives on the second floor and gets around with difficulty, and showed his daughters how to control the heat, take care of the mortgage and look after the house.His daughters, Liany and Maria, now have to care for their grandmother and help her with medical appointments and treatment. And while his mother \u2014 an American citizen \u2014 had applied for him to be granted residency, her request won\u2019t be considered for almost five years.His wife hasn\u2019t really accepted what has happened and still holds out hope that their appeal will be heard soon or that some politician will intercede.

Now she is worried that Liany, who works in finance, and Maria, who just graduated with a marketing degree and is job-hunting, will have to put their lives on hold to assume more responsibilities. That is, if they don\u2019t end up having to leave, too.\u201cI don\u2019t want to close this chapter of my life here in this manner,\u201d Ms. Guerrero said. \u201cBeing forced to leave is so sad and painful. The pain, the uncertainty and the depression of all that is happening is so big. There are days I think I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dShe has been particularly upset about how her husband, who was prevented from saying goodbye to the family, was shackled and detained at the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey before being deported with gang members, drug dealers and other criminals. At night, their screams kept him awake. During the day, he stayed indoors and even refused to go out into the yard for some fresh air.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see the sky and know I had to return and be shut in,\u201d he explained.He is resigned that he and his wife will have to start their careers in physical therapy over in Colombia or Ecuador. But as painful as the past few months have been, Mr. Villacis has found comfort in how he handled it.\u201cAfter all this, you learn to be a better human being,\u201d he said. \u201cYou understand people better. You see immigrants and working people. What has happened to me has helped to make me humbler, simpler and to understand people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Law May Send Factories and Jobs Abroad, Critics Say", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania, President Trump used the same promise to sell the tax bill: It would bring jobs streaming back to struggling cities and towns.The bill that Mr. Trump signed, however, could actually make it attractive for companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil.Under the new law, income made by American companies\u2019 overseas subsidiaries will face United States taxes that are half the rate applied to their domestic income, 10.5 percent compared with the new top corporate rate of 21 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of an America-last tax policy,\u201d said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who studies tax policy. \u201cWe are basically saying that if you earn in the U.S., you pay X, and if you earn abroad, you pay X divided by two.\u201dWhat could be more dangerous for American workers, economists said, is that the bill ends up creating a tax break for manufacturers with foreign operations. Under the new rules, beyond the lower rate, companies will not have to pay United States taxes on the money they earn from plants or equipment located abroad, if those earnings amount to 10 percent or less of the total investment.The Republican vision for the tax plan was to make the United States a more competitive place to do business. Supporters contend that the new rules do not encourage companies to locate overseas. Rather, they say, slashing the corporate rate will make it more attractive to set up shop at home, since many other advanced economies now have higher taxes.And manufacturers do not simply follow their accountants\u2019 advice. They consider taxes, but they also look at an array of other factors, including the local talent pool and transportation network, when deciding where to build a new plant.Before the tax overhaul, companies had to pay the standard corporate tax on the money they earned abroad, with a top rate of 35 percent, but only when they brought that income back into the United States.Many corporations responded by keeping their profits abroad indefinitely. A record $2.6 trillion was in offshore accounts as of 2015, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional panel. Republicans argued that the system deprived the American economy of investments that could have financed new ventures and hiring at home.It also meant that many multinationals effectively paid no American tax on their overseas earnings. The new bill, supporters point out, will prevent that from happening on such a large scale in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s a vast improvement from what was on the books,\u201d said Ray Beeman, a tax lawyer at Ernst & Young who worked on a tax reform proposal that was a precursor to the current law when he was counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee, under Republican leadership, from 2011 to 2014.To prevent an exodus of businesses from the United States, the law establishes a minimum tax rate of 10.5 percent every year.Companies will get credit for up to 80 percent of the taxes they pay to foreign governments. But if the total still comes to less than 10.5 percent of the income they earn abroad, they have to make up the difference with a check to the American government.So while companies will now have to pay some tax in most cases, wherever they operate, they will pay much less on what they make abroad than at home.\u201cHaving such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,\u201d said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. \u201cIt creates terrible incentives.\u201dMr. Shay said the new rule could make a big difference for small and medium-size companies, which make up a vast majority of American businesses. When those companies used to ask him whether to open offices abroad, he advised against it if they needed to bring their cash home.Such companies, Mr. Shay said, now have no reason to resist the temptation to shift some of their operations abroad, since they would end up paying half the rate they would pay in the United States.Some companies may not want to leave the comforts of home for a cut in their tax bill. Plants are expensive \u2014 they can cost more than $1 billion to buy and to outfit with the necessary industrial machinery. Manufacturers also gravitate toward stable, affordable locales where they can reach their customers easily and hire skilled workers.\u201cYou may prefer to stay in the U.S., with the protections of our legal system, our infrastructure and our labor force,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, an expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.On the other hand, for the biggest makers of cars and machines \u2014 the kinds of companies that Mr. Trump promised to lure back to the United States \u2014 a few percentage points in tax savings can be valuable.\u201cThere are lots of great retail markets out there,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThe new rules might yet encourage jobs and factories to be shipped offshore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Voracious Starfish Is Destroying the Great Barrier Reef", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBYRON BAY, Australia \u2014 The Great Barrier Reef is literally being eaten alive.Deadly starfish are feasting on parts of the world\u2019s largest reef system, which is already threatened by rising ocean temperatures, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said on Friday.Crown-of-thorns starfish, a native species whose numbers occasionally grow so out of control they endanger the reef, have been detected on 37 sections of the southerly Swain Reef, more than 60 miles offshore, according to the park authority.\u201cWhenever coral in any location in the Great Barrier Reef is threatened or stressed, it is of concern,\u201d said Fred Nucifora, a spokesman for the authority.The reef is one of the planet\u2019s largest living structures \u2014 big enough to be seen from space \u2014 and is home to thousands of species, including sharks, turtles and whales. Australia relies on it for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue.Normally, the starfish contribute to the reef\u2019s diversity by eating faster-growing coral species, which allow for slower-growing species to thrive. But at outbreak levels, the starfish are able to eat coral \u2014 a polyp that builds the limestone reefs on which they communally live \u2014 faster than the coral can reproduce.To eat the hard coral, the starfish has an extrudable stomach that wraps around the coral and ingests it. A starfish can eat its body diameter in coral every night.Since the inception of a control program in 2012, the marine park authority has culled more than 600,000 starfish from the northern and central reef areas, Mr. Nucifora said.The cause of the outbreak is unknown. One hypothesis is that currents are bringing nutrient-rich water from the deep sea up into the shelf, which correlates with starfish larvae growth.Mr. Nucifora said that two control vessels with divers travel to the reef 250 days a year to cull the crown-of-thorns population.\u201cActive control of the starfish is the most feasible and scalable action that we can take at this point in time,\u201d he said.Last year, the Australian government committed 14.4 million Australian dollars, or $11.2 million, to finance a third control vessel for the marine park authority.Since the control program began in 2012, Mr. Nucifora said, the government has committed 34.4 million Australian dollars to the problem through 2020.Coral reefs are constantly undergoing change, and they follow a cycle of death and renewal, said Hugh Sweatman, a scientist from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences.\u201cThe critical question,\u201d Mr. Sweatman said, \u201cis how long will they get to recover?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Investors Keep Losing Billions Online. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The company\u2019s name appeared in ads for the local marathon. Its logo was emblazoned on the jerseys of two professional soccer teams in Spain. Its founder had been lauded by the government\u2019s official television channel.To investors, it seemed like a safe bet. For years, it was. Then some of them tried to take their money out.Now as much as $5 billion is missing, the head of the company is in jail and in one city, angry investors took to the streets.Online investing in China isn\u2019t for the vulnerable or the na\u00efve \u2014 but frequently, that\u2019s exactly who it draws. The flameout last week of the popular online investment portal Qianbao is the latest in a string of collapses that has devastated small investors and prompted Beijing to take steps to tamp down on potential unrest.The pitches frequently appeal to aspiring small investors like Walter Xu, a recent university graduate who was drawn to Qianbao by promises of sky-high returns. Qianbao looked like a real business: Its portal sold cellphones and appliances \u2014 with discounts for members \u2014 as well as big returns for those who gave it money. In exchange for depositing money, watching ads and writing reviews, it offered returns of as much as 50 percent. In all, Mr. Xu invested $32,000 of his savings in Qianbao.On Dec. 26, when Qianbao\u2019s founder turned himself over to authorities, Mr. Xu turned to fellow investors on WeChat, China\u2019s popular social messaging platform, to commiserate. \u201cI talked until 3 in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201dNow, he said, he must put the episode behind him. \u201cI need to work and start over,\u201d he said.Some investors who lost their savings in Qianbao protested last week in the city of Nanjing, where the online investment platform had been based. Police acted swiftly, detaining the organizers of the demonstration and giving others warnings, according to a notice by the Nanjing police. Government censors appeared to have taken down some discussions about Qianbao on social media and removed some news articles about it.China has been rife with investment frauds in the decades since its economic reopening led to a boom. But online versions have the potential to reach more people in a country with more than 700 million internet users, many of whom now conduct most of their financial transactions on smartphones.Investors in online products are often drawn by promises of high rates of return and the idea that the investments are safer than China\u2019s stock market, which has long had a reputation for casino-like uncertainty. But they are often unsophisticated investors who are unaware of the risks, experts warn.\u201cIf you are earning 10 or 11 percent on an investment product, you should know that you are taking on a high amount of risk,\u201d said Michael Pettis, professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University and a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that investors understand that they are taking on this risk,\u201d he added.In some instances Qianbao promised investors returns as high as 80 percent. Such promises are easy to come by in China.Conglomerates and fly-by-night companies alike have turned to new online platforms to raise money if they can\u2019t get credit from banks. Often the pitches are long on promises but short on accountability.In a country where everything is tightly managed by the government, many investors believe that the government will take steps to make sure investors get their money if something goes wrong.\u201cThe big difference between China and U.S. consumer finance is the Chinese have implicit faith that someone in government will step in if any products or companies default,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research.Qianbao \u2014 whose name translates to money treasure \u2014 possessed a veneer of credibility. Local officials attended its events. It sponsored the Nanjing Marathon and two Spanish soccer teams, Real Sociedad and Rayo Vallecano. Qianbao\u2019s founder, Zhang Xiaolei, was even profiled by China Central Television, the government\u2019s official broadcaster, the ultimate sign of success.Over its six years, Qianbao collected money from as many as 200 million users who deposited their money into the website, raising $5 billion in deposits, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. In order to earn interest on their deposits, investors were told they had to participate in promotional activities like watching ads, posting information about various products on social media and filling out questionnaires. The website also provided a platform for retailers for their products, which members could buy.Then its founder turned himself in, with state-run media saying he took the step after the company drew attention from officials. Mr. Zhang and his company are now being investigated by the authorities in Nanjing.\u201cI have taken in money from new investors to pay old investors,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in a handwritten statement published by the Nanjing police.\u201cI cannot pay back the principal and interest and I am very sorry about the loss to investors,\u201d he added. An email to the company\u2019s public relations officials seeking comment bounced back unanswered.More recently, when Mr. Zhang was interviewed by a local television network, he said he had spent three years preparing for the day that he would turn himself in. \u201cI need to take legal responsibility,\u201d he said.Kimi Wang, who watched the protests in Nanjing from a nearby government building, said he had deposited about $79,000 into Qianbao. All of it, he said, was gone.Many investors in Qianbao were told that the more money they put in, the higher the returns would be. Mr. Wang borrowed from an online cash lender and friends in order to add to his investment. It was the equivalent of seven or eight years of income for Mr. Wang, who does odd jobs like drive for the ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing.The damage, he said, is widespread. \u201cEvery Nanjing local has a relative or friend that used Qianbao,\u201d he said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Purge of Kevin Spacey Gives \u2018All the Money in the World\u2019 a Pay Problem", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The kidnapping drama \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d has become a new flash point in the debate over gender equality in Hollywood.\u201cWe cannot let one person\u2019s behavior affect the good work of all of these other people,\u201d Mr. Scott said at the time.But the movie, about the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and his grandfather\u2019s refusal to pay a $17 million ransom, now finds itself embroiled in a new scandal. And it involves the reshoots made necessary by the attempt to release the movie with a clear conscience.The film\u2019s female star, Michelle Williams, was paid a per diem of $80, a bit above the union minimum, for 10 days of added work. Her male counterpart, Mark Wahlberg, received the same per diem \u2014 plus $1.5 million.Adding to the anger, Mr. Scott had previously said that the actors did the reshoots \u201cfor nothing\u201d \u2014 meaning union minimums \u2014 and Ms. Williams and Mr. Wahlberg are both represented by the William Morris Endeavor agency.Most contracts with actors include a certain number of reshoot days as a routine stipulation. If additional filming is needed, actors will make themselves available \u2014 as their schedule allows \u2014 to clean up scenes. But Ms. Williams and Mr. Wahlberg, both of whom had agreed to appear in \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d for less than their standard fee, took different approaches to the reshoots, according to the people briefed on the matter.Because of the circumstances, Ms. Williams quickly agreed to return. The people briefed on the matter said that she did so believing that other participants had made the same decision. She ultimately worked over Thanksgiving, racing to London on an overnight flight after arranging for her 12-year-old daughter, Matilda, to spend the holiday without her.\u201cThey could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted,\u201d she said of the production team at the time. \u201cBecause I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort.\u201dAlthough several actors with small parts, including Timothy Hutton, had agreed to return for reshoots for minimum pay, Mr. Wahlberg was not one of them, according to the people briefed on the negotiations. He asked his primary agent, Doug Lucterhand, to push for more money. (Ms. Williams is represented at William Morris Endeavor by Brent Morley.) Mr. Wahlberg was already not thrilled to have worked for roughly 80 percent less than his standard fee, the people said, especially since overseas distributors were using his box office track record to promote the film.Because Ms. Williams had already committed to return, Mr. Wahlberg had leverage over the production team: He was the only major missing piece, and the clock was ticking. The finished film was set to be released in theaters on Dec. 25.Imperative ultimately agreed to a $1.5 million payment.Spokesmen for Imperative, William Morris Endeavor and Sony Pictures, which distributed \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d declined to comment for this article. Publicists for Ms. Williams, Mr. Wahlberg and Mr. Scott either declined to comment or did not respond to queries.Individual client contracts are not always discussed between agents who work at the same agency. It is possible that those representing Ms. Williams did not know about the deal that Mr. Wahlberg was able to secure. When inequitable pay has become an issue in Hollywood in the past \u2014 as with Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams for \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d and Taraji P. Henson for \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d \u2014 agents have defended themselves by pointing out that it is in their best interest to negotiate the biggest paychecks possible for their clients, regardless of gender. Agents generally work for a 10 percent cut of the payments they secure.But many advocates and actresses are likely to find those explanations inadequate. Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, a nonprofit that pushes for gender equality in entertainment, said Ms. Williams was the latest example of the shortchanging of women in a male-dominated industry.\u201cThis continuous undervaluing of women has led to an industry where women have fewer jobs, less power and less potential than the men,\u201d Ms. Silverstein said. \u201cIf Hollywood is to achieve the systemic change brought about by the revelations of the last several months, one thing it must address is the economic disparity between men and women.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Michelle Williams\u2019s compensation for the reshoots of \u201cAll the Money in the World.\u201d She received a per diem of $80, not 80 pounds.

{"Headline": "Making Medicaid a Tool for Moral Education May Let Some Die", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneApparently the plan to Make America Great Again will let some Americans die.They will have to pay for it, too \u2014 a premium starting at $1 per month for families living on up to one-quarter of the federal poverty line, or about $400 a month for a family of three (such families exist, apparently) and rising to $15 for those who manage to stay above the poverty threshold.But the fact remains that the plan is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.4 billion over five years. Roughly half of the 350,000 able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries in Kentucky currently do not meet the work requirements, by the government\u2019s estimates, and could lose their benefits. Five years from now, the Bevin administration calculates, the change will have culled some 100,000 people from the rolls.Mr. Bevin might care to glance south over the border. In 2005, Tennessee removed 170,000 people \u2014 almost one in 10 Medicaid beneficiaries in the state, mainly working-age adults without children \u2014 from its Medicaid program to save money. They didn\u2019t do well.Delayed care can kill. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women. One of eight American women will get it. Detecting it early is critical. Specifically, the five-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer is 98.5 percent when detected early, but only 25 percent when detected at a distant stage. Waiting for 60 days or longer to get treatment raises the risk of dying of breast cancer over five years by 85 percent.\u201cWe are ready to show America how this can and will be done,\u201d Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. And yet Kentucky\u2019s approach to Medicaid draws from a well-worn playbook, one from which both Republicans and Democrats have drawn to trim the social safety net over the years.Kentucky was an eager participant in the last big so-called entitlement reform, visited upon the nation\u2019s poor just over two decades ago. Under that 1996 program directed at welfare benefits, the entitlement to federal assistance was replaced by a hodgepodge of programs managed by the states and financed by a fixed dollop of federal cash. Work requirements became the norm. And people got less help.The problem with the latest twist in Republicans\u2019 effort to pare the social safety net is that removing the poor\u2019s health insurance may not just make their life more difficult.It might kill them.Work by Katherine Baicker, now at the University of Chicago, with Benjamin Sommers and Arnold Epstein at Harvard found that Medicaid expansions in the past significantly reduced mortality. Their research, they concluded, \u201csuggests that 176 additional adults would need to be covered by Medicaid in order to prevent one death per year.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take a leap of imagination to figure out what might happen if 100,000 people were to lose their coverage.These would be mostly lower-income Americans. Maybe they would be people from Kentucky \u2014 the state with the most cancer deaths and the most preventable hospitalizations, 45th out of 50 in the incidence of diabetes and 47th in terms of heart disease.Would their deaths cause America to be greater?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Modern Airport in Salt Lake City From One Well Past Its Prime", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 More than three years after construction was started to rebuild Salt Lake City International Airport and scrape away a collection of obsolete terminals, the contours of one of the nation\u2019s largest air travel infrastructure projects are taking shape.And the extensive renovation could help reduce public embarrassment about the condition of aging airports in the United States that cannot keep up with demand. In 2014, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. compared New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport to \u201csome third-world country.\u201dThe $3.6 billion airport reconstruction project here is so big that it looks like a city emerging from the high plains along Utah\u2019s Wasatch Mountains.Concrete pillars for the new 908,000-square-foot, $365 million main terminal and for a $158.4 million, 1.7 million-square-foot parking deck are in place. The steel outlines of the first half of the $671.6 million, 827,000-square-foot South Concourse are also set. Nearly 1,000 construction workers and a battalion of vehicles and equipment are deployed on the 300-acre construction site.A second concourse of 477,00 square feet will be constructed at a cost of $545.5 million to the north between the runways. One existing 990-foot tunnel, and a second, new one of the same length, will link the two concourses at a cost of nearly $140 million. The airport is spending more than $90 million to construct 14 miles of new roadway. A station for the light-rail line connecting the airport to downtown Salt Lake City will be moved closer to the new terminal.When the facilities are finished in 2023, they will provide this fast-growing metropolitan area, home to 80 percent of Utah\u2019s three million residents, with improved efficiency at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, serving nine airlines with 329 daily flights. Traffic has climbed to more than 23 million travelers annually in an airport designed to serve fewer than half that number.To ease congestion, Delta Air Lines, which serves 70 percent of the airport\u2019s passengers, agreed to help finance the reconstruction.\u201cPlanning for this project goes back to the early 2000s master plan, when we were thinking about how to make the existing airport layout work,\u201d said Bill Wyatt, the airport\u2019s executive director. \u201cDelta sat down and also tried to think how they could make that work operationally. They concluded they couldn\u2019t make it work operationally. Everybody began to focus on this new concept, which we\u2019re building.\u201dDelta, which earned $39.6 billon in total revenue in 2016, uses the hub principally as a link between coastal and mountain cities. Delta\u2019s investment in the airport is a share of the $1.2 billion the airline is spending annually over the next decade to expand and modernize air transport facilities around the country, according to company figures. The money would be spent on airport projects in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City and Seattle, Morgan Durrant, a company spokesman, said in an email message.Mike Williams, the program director for the airport\u2019s Terminal Redevelopment Program, said the nationwide airport reconstruction effort started in 2008, as the country was in the grip of the Great Recession. Three years after a downturn in the American airline industry pitched Delta into bankruptcy in 2005, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport started to build its $1.4 billion, 1.2 million-square-foot Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal.The Atlanta terminal opened in 2012 just as fuel prices moderated, the national economy recovered and Americans began filling airline seats and overcrowding the country\u2019s old airports.In the same period, Los Angeles International Airport began a $14 billion project to upgrade runways and safety facilities, improve escalators and elevators and renovate four terminals. The project included a $2.1 billion remodeling and expansion of the international terminal and the addition of a $1.6 billion, 750,000-square-foot midfield terminal.Expansion is needed. In 2016, 823 million passengers boarded airliners in the United States, 25 million more than in the previous year. Airport and airline executives, mindful of criticism about old facilities and responsive to the growing demand, have escalated construction projects into a nationwide building boom, with New York-area airports leading the way.LaGuardia is spending $8 billion to replace four terminals with one, build a new parking structure, connect the airport more efficiently to public transit and gain more space for taxiways. Newark Liberty International Airport just broke ground on a $2.4 billion project, much of the money to be spent replacing 44-year-old Terminal A with a one-million-square-foot facility and a 3,000-space parking deck. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced a $10 billion project this year to renovate and expand passenger terminals and improve ground transportation at Kennedy International Airport.Other big airport construction projects include an investment of nearly $800 million at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to build a 450,000-square-foot international terminal to replace one that dates to the 1970s. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport broke ground almost two years ago on a $807 million, 760,000-square-foot terminal. And Orlando International Airport is in the midst of a $1.1 billion renovation and expansion of its North Terminal, as well as improvements to other facilities.Rebuilding the Salt Lake City airport has attracted broad support from residents, not only because it is financed almost entirely without taxpayer funds but also because the new terminals will enhance one of the most conveniently situated major airports in the country. From almost anywhere in the city or its outskirts, the airport is less than a half-hour car or train ride away.Two features of design and construction distinguish the reconstruction: its linear layout, and the lack of disruption to the airport\u2019s operation.When the project is finished, the airport will consist of an airy central terminal flanked by the two wings of its 3,700-foot-long South Concourse. In front of that will be the 3,400-foot-long North Concourse.The unbent concourses, designed by the architecture and engineering firm HOK, are characteristic of airport reconstruction projects to accommodate big planes. The three old terminals, dating to the 1960s, are connected by an outdoor sidewalk and were upgraded sporadically through the decades with clusters of gates served by fans of tightly spaced jet bridges.The project can occur without disruption because the 7,800-acre airport has enough room to build all the new facilities, including the first wing of the South Concourse. When gates in the new concourses are ready to serve passengers, the airport will close and demolish the old terminals, then build the rest of the South Concourse.\u201cIt\u2019s a very flexible and efficient design,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cIf we need more space after the initial phase of construction, you can add capacity as far as the eye can see, virtually without any disruption at all.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Salt Lake City International Airport. It serves nine airlines; it is not a hub for nine airlines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor Forces Delay of Cuomo\u2019s Plan to Renovate 33 Subway Stations", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs New York City\u2019s subway system unraveled last year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo introduced a plan to renovate 33 stations and add amenities like better lighting, countdown clocks and even USB ports.The improvements, Mr. Cuomo argued, were needed to make the antiquated and often foreboding system more hospitable, even as the agency worked on the nuts-and-bolts problems that plague the subway, including signals and tracks.Mayor Bill de Blasio, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s longtime foil, questioned the $1 billion station improvement plan. In essence, the argument that the mayor and other city officials made boiled down to whether spending so much on bells and whistles was justifiable at a time when the system\u2019s infrastructure was failing.On Wednesday, the mayor scored a rare win. The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, delayed a vote on the governor\u2019s plan after members appointed by Mr. de Blasio objected.The board\u2019s decision ratcheted up the feud between the governor and the mayor and raised concerns among riders that the desperately needed turnaround of the crumbling system was at the mercy of two politicians who seemed to devote so much energy to their verbal war.\u201cThere is nothing in it for the riders until these two leaders come to a deal,\u201d said Gene Russianoff, the chief spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group. \u201cI\u2019d rather take a day off from watching these two guys swinging at each other. It\u2019s so predictable.\u201dThe vitriol played out in boardrooms and on unusual dueling conference calls, where reporters were invited to listen as proxies for each man attacked the opposition. The conversation spiraled beyond USB ports to a much larger, festering tension: the governor\u2019s demand that the city contribute half of the cost the $836 million Subway Action Plan, the blueprint unveiled last summer to address major issues and quickly improve the system\u2019s reliability. Mr. Cuomo included the city\u2019s share in his proposed budget.First up, the mayor\u2019s side. On the line at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday were Polly Trottenberg, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, and Dean Fuleihan, the first deputy mayor, with legal backup from Zach Carter, the city\u2019s corporation counsel. They criticized crucial elements of the governor\u2019s subway overhaul, framing it as a wild overreach by the state\u2019s chief executive.\u201cWe object to the premise,\u201d Mr. Fuleihan said on the call, referring to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s demand for payment from the city. About 70 percent of the $16 billion of the M.T.A. operating budget already comes from New York City payroll and other taxes, he said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t New York City contribute? We contribute!\u201dBy 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team \u2014 Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., and Pat Foye, the agency\u2019s president \u2014 claiming they were caught off-guard by the first call, organized their own conference call and were on the line playing defense.It is \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cfalse,\u201d Mr. Lhota said for the city to claim the governor\u2019s plans were unilateral. The city, Mr. Lhota pointed out, has final veto power over the transit portion of the M.T.A.\u2019s capital plan. \u201cThey have the ultimate leverage,\u201d he said, \u201cthe ability to say no.\u201dAt a news conference on Tuesday in the Bronx, Mr. de Blasio weighed in on the latest skirmish. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make the point that we don\u2019t like the direction the M.T.A. is taking, and we\u2019re going to be speaking up about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe countdown clocks and the Wi-Fi and painting, having lights on bridges \u2014 all that stuff doesn\u2019t matter compared to your subway actually arriving where it\u2019s supposed to arrive on time.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office declined to comment on the interactions between the two men.The bad blood between the governor and the mayor has included disputes over prekindergarten financing to a renegade deer apprehended in a Harlem building complex. But their protracted battle over the subway seems to have eclipsed all the others, even as riders complain that they have yet to see the kind of improvements Mr. Cuomo promised after he declared state of emergency on the subway last year.And the schism over the station overhauls is but a piece of the mayor\u2019s differing vision on the subway. The governor\u2019s proposal to allow special tax districts on developments near the subway as a way to help pay for the system is too broad in scope, according to the mayor\u2019s aides, and was done without consulting the city. During an appearance on a morning talk show on Wednesday, the mayor touted his plan to tax the richest New Yorkers, a so-called \u201cMillionaires Tax,\u201d to fund the subway, as more fair that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s notion to pay for it through congestion pricing, charging drivers a fee to enter Manhattan\u2019s business districts.On Wednesday, the full M.T.A. board met at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and both camps came prepared. Late the night before, Mr. Lhota sent out an open letter. \u201cThe city claims no financial responsibility for the subway system that it owns and polices and is the lifeblood of the city\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s answer is simple \u2014 and he should just say it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to fund the subways and help riders. So be it.\u201dMs. Trottenberg came to the board meeting equipped with a handout: a list of subway stations the city said needed improvements compared with the governor\u2019s 33 selected stations \u2014 only three overlapped. (Her demand for an explanation about how the governor chose the stations slated for improvement were partially answered by Mr. Lhota, who said the stations were selected in part on the ease with which the improvements could be made to figure out best practices.)By midmorning, it seemed Mr. DeBlasio had won the round: the board put off voting on the station improvements until February, following more study.Ultimately, the true victor may have been neither the governor or the mayor. Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, had watched the skirmishes unfold during his first full week on the job. He expressed bafflement at how in the dark many board members were about not just station selection, but about things like how the M.T.A. tabulated electrical delays, a topic that came up after an article in The Daily News appeared to show the authority massaging numbers to put the blame more squarely on Con Ed, which supplies electricity to the subway.When it came to the wrestling match over the subway stations, Mr. Byford appeared to come down on neither side. In the end, he had urged that the decision be put off, according to officials, because the plan needed more transparency.An earlier version of this article, using information from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, misstated one of the uses of New York City payroll and other taxes. That money accounts for about 70 percent of the $16 billion of the M.T.A. operating budget, not of the state\u2019s transit capital plan.J. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And I open them. I forward the good ones \u2014 with stunning pictures of new kitchens and bathrooms with soaking tubs \u2014 to my husband.I mark the date for the open houses and then I go.On a miserable Sunday in late November, rather than curl up with a cup of hot cocoa, I dodged puddles to get to an open house for a four-bedroom colonial in my neighborhood.I had noticed the house for years, with a handsome bay window and lush landscaping. I just had to see what was inside. Before you write this off as time wasted, let me tell you, dear reader, the visit was worth every moment spent out in the icy rain.The living room, with recessed lighting and a coat of fresh paint, was dreamy, with a navy carpet and cream-colored sofa. Can I tell you about the kitchen? The listing described it as a chef\u2019s kitchen. I\u2019m no chef, but the soapstone countertops, wine fridge and that very fancy stovetop convinced me to consider becoming one. I sent my husband over next. He came home soggy, but swooning. Two fireplaces! Who has two fireplaces? We could. That\u2019s who.Apparently, we\u2019re easy to spot. We usually fall into one of three categories.The Snooper: You live in the neighborhood or building and arrive without a coat or in your running clothes. You\u2019re there to size up the competition.The Confirmation Seeker: You recently bought a place and want to make sure you haven\u2019t made a terrible mistake.And finally, the Aspirational Buyer: You\u2019re looking to see what a glossier version of your life might look like. Rather than ask about the carrying costs, you ask about that fabulous table lamp.\u201cIt was absolutely that sense of life as a \u2018Choose Your Own Adventure\u2019 book,\u201d said Ms. Leibowitz, who was also pregnant at the time, which, she said, fed her angst. \u201cCertain paths were shut off and I wanted to look at them one more time.\u201dWhat if there was a better apartment out there than the one they had just bought? Or, better still, what if there wasn\u2019t?She saw one architecturally baffling apartment, a modern space that had a glass bridge cutting across a peaked living room ceiling. Inexplicably, the see-through walkway connected a lofted bedroom to a lofted dressing room on the opposite side of the apartment. \u201cSo that one made me feel better,\u201d she said.Eventually, her daughter was born and the open house urge went away.As for me, I don\u2019t visit just any open house. I\u2019m not interested in homes that are out of my league or do not fit my needs \u2014 that $4.6 million two-bedroom condo overlooking the High Line? It\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely, but visiting it would just remind me that if I wanted that life, I should have gone into finance. Besides, where would I put the kids?I also don\u2019t want to see the homes with gold paisley wallpaper in the bathrooms. All that wallpaper makes me anxious \u2014 who\u2019s going to take it all down?No, I want to walk into a home where I can imagine a life about one paygrade above my own. No wiggly door handles and no chipping paint in the door frames. An extra room or two would be nice. I want to see a property that has been staged to look like my home \u2014 if I were to sink all my savings into it. In other words, my life, only better.By Ms. Rubin\u2019s reasoning, my better life isn\u2019t one house away. Instead, I\u2019m already living it. With a can of paint and a screwdriver, I could make my current life sparkle. \u201cGet everything ready as if you were going to sell it and then just stay there,\u201d she said.But where\u2019s the fun in that? Anyone who has ever put a property on the market knows that getting it ready for sale is a huge undertaking.I\u2019d rather spend an hour admiring the hard work someone else did, and then go back to my cluttered home, make that cup of hot cocoa and savor the fantasy.Advertisement"}

He feared the injury would prevent him from competing. But he healed enough to break his Olympic record in a qualifying throw.In the finals, however, his best throw \u2014 225 feet \u2014 placed him 11th, well behind the winner, Egil Danielsen of Norway, who set a world record of just over 281 feet.That was the end of Young\u2019s javelin career. He told The Bee in 1996 that he had made a pile of his shoes, sweatsuits and javelins, poured kerosene over them and set them afire.\u201cIt was time to get on with my life,\u201d he said.Cyrus Young Jr. was born in Modesto, about 90 miles east of San Francisco, on July 23, 1928. His father was a farmer who played baseball for the minor-league Modesto Reds, and his mother, the former Thelma Gartin, was a homemaker.Young Cy wanted to play baseball, but asthma restricted his athletic activities. At Modesto Junior College, however, a coach suggested that he learn how to throw the javelin.After practicing at home for a few days on his father\u2019s farmland, he auditioned for the coach, Fred Earle.\u201cI threw it 150 feet standing still,\u201d Young told The Bee. \u201cCoach Earle said I was on the team.\u201dHe transferred after two years to U.C.L.A., competed against Finnish javelin throwers during an Amateur Athletic Union tour of Scandinavia in 1949 (receiving some tutoring from Jarvinen) and made the United States Olympic team that competed in Helsinki three years later.Before the Olympics began, Young\u2019s coach at U.C.L.A., Elvin Drake, who was known as Ducky, said Young might break the American and world javelin records.\u201cCy is a hard worker, and with his natural physique has improved steadily the past four years,\u201d Drake told The Los Angeles Times shortly before the start of the 1952 Olympics. \u201cHis ability to concentrate has made him a consistent thrower, which is a mighty important asset in competing with the other throwers.\u201dAfter the Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Young became a full-time farmer and rancher. Besides his daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren. His wife, the former Elizabeth Anderson, died in 2009.\u201cMy German competitors had tremendous support through the year,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, adding, \u201cEverything I had came out of pocket.\u201dPukstys recalled that he was coaching youngsters when he met Young at a track meet in Modesto in 2003.\u201cHe looked familiar \u2014 I thought at first it was Jack Palance \u2014 and I said, \u2018Do I know you?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I\u2019m Cy Young.\u2019 And I knew his history and I told the kids, `I\u2019d like to introduce you to the 1952 Olympic champion.\u2019 He was awe-struck that I knew who he was.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 68.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Diane Duston.In 1985, Mr. Parry broke news of the involvement of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a deputy director of the National Security Council, in a covert operation to support the contras with proceeds from clandestine arms sales to Iran. Congress had banned such support. The weapons had been sold to Iran to speed the release of American hostages in Lebanon.In 2015, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard awarded Mr. Parry the I. F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence. Last year, he received the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, named for a 20th-century war correspondent and presented by a trust set up in her name.Mr. Parry complained that some articles on the Iran-contra scandal, including those he wrote for The A.P. with a colleague, Brian Barger, had been watered down or even withheld because his bosses had been meeting with Colonel North to negotiate the release of Terry Anderson, an A.P. reporter who was being held hostage during Lebanon\u2019s civil war. A.P. executives denied the accusations.Mr. Parry left The A.P. for Newsweek in 1987 and later worked on documentaries for the PBS series \u201cFrontline.\u201d In one, broadcast in 1991, he investigated whether Reagan, as a presidential candidate, had sabotaged the release of American hostages in Iran in 1980 to keep President Jimmy Carter, his Democratic rival, from benefiting politically from their release. The hostages were freed on the day of Mr. Reagan\u2019s inauguration.\u201cThose looking for a smoking gun are coming to the wrong place if they hope \u2018Frontline\u2019 will provide it,\u201d The Boston Globe wrote in a review of the documentary. \u201c \u2018Frontline\u2019 does, however, provide so much circumstantial evidence that you can suspect only the worst after watching it.\u201dA congressional investigation discounted Mr. Parry\u2019s version of Reagan\u2019s role, but Mr. Parry amassed more evidence after publishing a book, \u201cTrick or Treason\u201d (1993), which implicated Reagan.He wrote five other books, including \u201cNeck Deep: The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush\u201d (2007), a collaboration with two of his sons, Sam and Nat Parry.Mr. Parry was featured in \u201cUkraine on Fire,\u201d a recent documentary film that argued that the 2014 uprising in Ukraine, which some Western news media depicted as a people\u2019s revolution, was actually a coup staged by nationalist groups with the complicity of the United States.In a telephone interview on Monday, Oliver Stone, one of that film\u2019s executive producers, said of Mr. Parry: \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a conspiracist, but as a man of common sense and integrity. He leaves a giant hole in American journalism.\u201dRobert Earle Parry was born on June 24, 1949, in Hartford to the former Elizabeth Caton and William Parry, publisher of The Middlesex Daily News in Framingham, Mass. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Colby College in Waterville, Me., in 1971.In addition to his wife, a former A.P. reporter, he is survived by their sons, Sam, Jeff and Nat; a daughter, Elizabeth Parry; a sister, Randine Parry; a brother, William; and six grandchildren.Mr. Parry worked briefly for his father\u2019s newspaper before joining The A.P. in 1974. Besides Washington, he worked for the agency in Baltimore and Providence, R.I. He was with Newsweek from 1987 to 1990.\u201cI remember asking him why he had to go,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe replied that it was important to go to these places and tell the truth about what was happening there. He mentioned that children my age were being killed in these wars and that somebody had to tell their stories.\u201dAfter decades of enraging conservatives, Mr. Parry began angering liberals in 2016 by suggesting that Russian meddling had had little influence on the election of Donald J. Trump, though he was critical of President Trump for what he called his \u201ccontempt for facts and his crass personal behavior.\u201dMr. Parry considered himself a pariah in the eyes of politicians as well as the major established news organizations, which he viewed as constituting a kind of parallel \u201cpermanent government.\u201dReferring to his coverage of the Iran-contra scandal, he was self-effacing, saying it \u201cdidn\u2019t require that much.\u201d\u201cIt just required sort of following the leads,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were all over the place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plight of Working Women, as Seen by the Woman in the Corner Office", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionOne wonders what Damore would make of Joanne Lipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said: What Men Need to Know (and Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of title, but one that seems eerily prescient in light of our continuing national conversation about sexual politics in the workplace. Lipman was until recently the editor in chief of USA Today and chief content officer of its parent company, Gannett, and as she documents in her book, even before the exposure this fall of the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s decades of sexual predation (and the swift deposition of powerful men in entertainment, technology, politics, news, art and finance brought down by similar charges), men were already pretty freaked out about what they should and shouldn\u2019t say to their female colleagues. It\u2019s a situation that one could argue has gotten only more complicated since Lipman began writing this investigation into why the gender gap and its offspring \u2014 the wage gap, the achievement gap, the confidence gap, the respect gap, etc. \u2014 persist, despite decades of near parity in the numbers of men and women who work.Lipman has pitched her plea to men, as she understands that they need to be at the forefront of any systemic change, but she seems to understand that her primary readers will most likely be women. (As she discovered while researching her book, most diversity training fails because it puts men on the defensive \u2014 as if they were all guilty of crossing an ever-shifting line. It\u2019s hard to imagine a man eyeing her book and thinking: \u201cJust what I\u2019ve been waiting for! Women tell me what I need to know!\u201d The title of her second chapter, \u201cShe\u2019ll Make You More Successful,\u201d may have more appeal.) Lipman has sympathy for men in power, writing in her introduction that \u201cthe politics and vocabulary of \u2018inclusion\u2019\u201d have made it \u201cmore fraught than ever for men to engage in this dialogue.\u201d Citing the rise of \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and, with them, a pervasive fear of \u201coffending any outsider group,\u201d she asks, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t men \u2014 especially the white men who dominate the upper reaches of business \u2014 be spooked?\u201dIt\u2019s an unfortunate opening salvo, as one could surmise that Lipman\u2019s compassion for white men burdened by the demands of \u201coutsiders\u201d is the organizing principle for what\u2019s to come. It\u2019s not. Instead, she offers a persuasive examination of the innumerable institutionalized prejudices, roadblocks and often unconscious undermining that women face in nearly every aspect of public and private life. Some of her facts will be familiar to H.R. directors, women\u2019s studies scholars and reporters who cover gender equality. They will likely be revelatory to nearly everyone else. Lipman\u2019s not wrong that those with power are loath to give it up: One study by Catalyst, an organization devoted to working women, found that 74 percent of men surveyed on what undermines their support for gender equality said fear \u2014 of loss of status, of other men\u2019s disapproval and of making a mistake \u2014 all of which, Lipman writes, has men \u201cwalking around on eggshells.\u201d But she also believes that most men, certainly those in the upper echelons of management, \u201cdon\u2019t need beating up with a two-by-four. They\u2019d like to see an equitable workplace, they just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do about it.\u201d She\u2019s here to tell them; here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re paying attention.Lipman, a former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and the founding editor of the short-lived Cond\u00e9 Nast business magazine Portfolio, is a skilled assembler of data and a graceful storyteller. She starts with a sketch of just how male by default the universe is, from the standard office temperature (set to accommodate the higher metabolic rate of 40-year-old, 154-pound, suit-wearing men) and male-centric design at Apple (the iPhone 6 Plus was too big for many women\u2019s hands and pockets) to the potentially dangerous side effects for women of the original prescribed doses of Ambien, a drug that was tested only on men, a still-common practice. All due, in part, to the lack of women in decision-making roles across industries and sectors, which, the data clearly show, is a financial mistake.A lot of assertions in the book begin with \u201cstudies have shown\u201d\u2014 a suspicious tactic. (Was the study that found a new potion \u201celiminated every wrinkle in a week\u201d conducted with the 12 people who work at that beauty start-up? Or was it a double-blind, controlled trial by a credible research team?) Yet each fact here is carefully accounted for on the nearly 50 pages of notes at the end of the book. It\u2019s not necessarily persuasive to read that \u201cmultiple studies have found that adding women to all-male teams leads to greater financial success,\u201d but this claim is bolstered by data from several sources, including The Journal of Financial Economics (\u201cFemale executives make more profitable acquisitions and take on less debt than male executives\u201d), Catalyst (\u201cFirms with the most female board members outperform those with the least by almost every financial measure\u201d) and the Credit Suisse Research Institute (\u201cCompanies whose top management is at least half female post returns on equity that are 19 percent higher than average\u201d).In the working world, well, it gets worse: A Carnegie Mellon University study found that when an equal number of job-seeking men and women visited 100 recruitment sites, men were shown the ad for the highest-paying job six times more often than women were. Lipman dismantles the so-called \u201cpipeline theory,\u201d which posits that when women enter the work force at the same rate as men, they will reach management positions in equal numbers. In the early 1990s, more than half of law-school students were women, so, according to the pipeline theory, by now 50 percent of partners at law firms should be women as well. But by 2013, women held just 17 percent of those jobs, a pattern that Lipman says holds steady across \u201cany\u201d industry.She also debunks James Damore\u2019s argument that the lack of gender parity at Google (about 70 percent of its employees are male) is a failure of nature by citing the in-house experts the company assigned to fix the problem. She interviews Brian Welle, a Google data scientist, and Laszlo Bock, a former head of its People Operations, who began working on the issue in 2006 and who eventually determined that Google\u2019s employees \u201cclearly had blind spots about their own prejudices against women and minorities.\u201d (Google\u2019s famously elaborate hiring process, in which candidates are evaluated, primarily by men, for their \u201cGoogleyness\u201d \u2014 the qualities that made them likely to fit in at the company \u2014 presumably had something to do with this.)The Google case study is among several Lipman uses to propel a narrative about the uncertain status of women in the workplace. She recounts how jealousy of the woman who built the Tupperware company into a household name in the 1950s drove its founder to fire her and write her out of the company\u2019s history, and she explains why Iceland is the only country in the world where men and women share power in almost equal numbers: After the global financial crisis of 2008, Icelanders embraced the idea that the bank failures were, as the female director of the country\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it, the result of a \u201cpenis competition\u201d among bankers. Not only did Icelanders jail unscrupulous bankers but they also elected more women to government posts, including that of prime minister, and mandated that women make up 40 percent of corporate boards.Lipman needs these stories to help give dimension to her statistics \u2014 though many women may find the statistics comforting all on their own, if only because they document an unease that many feel but can\u2019t name. For instance: Women are 15 percent less likely to get promoted than men, in part because men get promoted for \u201cpotential,\u201d while women get promoted for performance. And both men and women would rather work for a male boss \u2014 they\u2019d even take a lower salary to ensure it. The self-annihilating absurdity of this last fact underlies some of the more important insights in \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d which have to do with the unconscious bias women seem to have against themselves. Women in academia spend more time than men revising papers, in part because they\u2019re reluctant to burden anyone with what they feel is subpar work but also because they\u2019re so much more sensitive to criticism and hope to eliminate the possibility of any. Women underestimate their abilities at the same rate that men overestimate theirs, and a woman\u2019s self-esteem is more closely tied to compliments and criticism from her boss, with praise being more meaningful to women than even a raise or a promotion.There is much to recommend this book, especially now, when record numbers of women are organizing, preparing to run for office and demanding change. So it\u2019s a bit disheartening to get to the end with only a handful of paragraphs on sexual harassment. Lipman managed to fold in a reference to Harvey Weinstein, but if there\u2019s one thing missing, it\u2019s a consideration of how sexual harassment, and the perhaps less quantifiable issue of why men fear ascendant women, lead to the disparities that she documents so persuasively. She is optimistic that men are capable of acting not only out of self-interest \u2014 though it\u2019s true, more female colleagues will make them richer \u2014 but out of the same moral imperative that once led privileged white men to abolish slavery and to \u201cgive\u201d women the right to vote. Lipman offers 12 \u201ctips and takeaways\u201d for moving forward, one of which inspired her title. To address what we might call the \u201cacknowledgment gap,\u201d she exhorts those paying attention in a meeting to repeat a statement that a woman has already made, to ensure she\u2019s recognized for it. Like her other suggestions, it\u2019s a nice idea, one that\u2019s been circulating among working women for a while. It reinforces her conviction that we must be vigilant in matters large and small if we want to shift the culture.

The lack of the analysis raised questions whether Treasury\u2019s team of tax experts could really back up Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s claims that the tax bill would not balloon the deficit.\u201cIt is unclear whether the Department\u2019s involvement in the tax legislating process in 2017 has been any more or less \u2018political\u2019 than it has been in past years,\u201d Rich Delmar, the counsel to the inspector general, wrote in a report outlining its findings. \u201cI do not see a basis to conclude that the process employed by Treasury this past year was contrary to law, an abuse of authority or otherwise improper.\u201dThe career tax staff officials interviewed by the inspector general said that they were not shut out of the process or ordered to hide their work.In a letter outlining the report, Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general, said that Office of Tax Analysis officials said their analyses were not released publicly because the office had gotten the impression, as the legislative drafting process picked up, that Congressional staff and lawmakers were \u201cless interested in getting OTA\u2019s input.\u201dThe report, which is based primarily on an interview with the department\u2019s top tax expert, James Mackie, said that Mr. Mackie appeared to agree with Joint Committee on Taxation analysis that showed the Senate\u2019s version of the legislation would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade, even when factoring in additional economic growth.Mr. Mackie, the director of the Office of Tax Analysis, had no official position on the estimates but told the inspector general that they are \u201cwidely considered to be reasonable,\u201d according to the report. Mr. Mackie is retiring from the department this month.The inspector general said that Mr. Mackie \u201cdeclined to give a substantive answer\u201d as to the likelihood of the 2.9 percent economic growth rate, but the report points out that such growth is \u201crare.\u201d\u201cBureau of Economic Analysis data indicate that such a run, in duration and magnitude, would be greater than has been the case in the U.S. since World War II,\u201d the report said.The Treasury inquiry was requested by two Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee. They said the report shows that Treasury was hiding the truth about the cost of the Republican tax cuts.\u201cThis report confirms that congressional Republicans had no interest in unbiased analysis of the final tax bill by Treasury experts, and makes clear that Republicans sold the bill based on unsubstantiated and unrealistic assumptions so they could give a $1.5 trillion giveaway to their donors,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Mr. Wyden was unconvinced by the conclusion that the Treasury career staff members were free from interference.\u201cThis political meddling has left a black mark on the once-sterling reputation of the career employees at the Treasury Department,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Natural Gas Hurdles", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe journey of this liquefied natural gas from the Yamal Peninsula in northern Siberia to Boston may at first appear like a well-orchestrated move from the Kremlin playbook to hide what might be an embarrassing delivery for the United States. On Dec. 8, President Vladimir Putin oversaw the opening of Yamal L.N.G., Russia\u2019s second liquefied natural gas plant. The project was personal for Mr. Putin for several reasons.Because the time between the unloading of the Russian vessel and loading of the Gaselys vessel at Grain was brief, it is safe to assume that the Gaselys vessel was carrying at least some, if not all, of the Russian gas from the Yamal L.N.G. project. The storage facility in London might also have been holding L.N.G. from other producers. Nonetheless the Russia news media has gloated over this gas delivery to Boston and claimed it as Russian.If the United States plans to continue imposing sanctions on Russia and its energy sector, it should consider how to approach output from projects like Yamal L.N.G. This is because the original source of such gas will become increasingly difficult to determine as the trade becomes more global. The gas can be loaded and unloaded multiple times and its carrier redirected to various destinations while at sea.At the same time, the United States should not restrict L.N.G. exports to meet domestic demand. Such exports benefit American allies that have been dependent on imports from hostile state-owned monopolies like Russia\u2019s Gazprom.In addition, the federal government and private sector need to reassess the need for pipelines, storage facilities and L.N.G. export terminals as the Midwest and Northeast become powerhouses for natural gas production.We also need to end the environmentally and economically costly practice of flaring \u2014 the burning off of gas produced as a byproduct of oil and gas extraction that releases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Instead, equipment should be installed so that this gas can be collected for use.These changes would strengthen America\u2019s domestic energy sector, limit calls to curtail America\u2019s L.N.G. exports, reduce the need for imports, and help the country compete with Russia in the global natural gas markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brendan Byrne, Former New Jersey Governor, Is Dead at 93", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrendan T. Byrne, the former New Jersey governor who helped lure professional teams to a new sports colossus in the Meadowlands and won passage of the state\u2019s first income tax, a feat that prompted some pundits and pollsters to write his political obituary prematurely, died on Thursday at his home in Livingston, N.J. He was 93.His death was announced by Gov. Chris Christie. Mr. Byrne\u2019s son Brendan Jr. said his father had developed a lung infection and \u201cwas too weak to fight,\u201d The Associated Press reported. .A Democrat, Mr. Byrne could be a controversial governor and in many ways a contradictory man. Sometimes he spoke in a distracted monotone; other times he displayed an easy, self-deprecating wit.He was elected handily in 1973 and re-elected four years later after overcoming deep resentment over the income tax.\u201cThere was a poll that showed 96 percent of the people knew who I was, and 4 percent thought I was doing a good job,\u201d he joked years later at a Hudson County political dinner.Mr. Byrne was the first New Jersey governor to serve eight years with his own party in control of the Legislature the entire time. Yet his relations even with Democratic lawmakers were often so prickly it was hard to remember that he was not a Republican.His detractors said he was too much like the judge he had been and not enough like the tough Irish politician he should have been. They found him exasperatingly Hamlet-like, saying he was reluctant to make difficult decisions.Nonetheless, Mr. Byrne persuaded legislators to pass the income tax to help finance schools and ease property-tax burdens; to curtail building in the Pine Barrens wilderness; to back public financing in gubernatorial elections; to create a state public advocate who could sue state agencies on behalf of citizens; and to approve voter registration by mail. And his administration was free of major scandal.\u201cI never saw more executive control of the Legislature,\u201d one Republican said grudgingly well into Mr. Byrne\u2019s second term. \u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t know whether to ascribe this to executive strength or to legislative weakness.\u201dIt was fitting, somehow, that those remarks came from Raymond H. Bateman, who was a state senator when Mr. Byrne trounced him to win re-election in 1977. Mr. Byrne was often underestimated by his adversaries, usually to their sorrow.Despite what casual acquaintances saw as awkwardness in public, people who watched the governor more closely concluded that he was not really shy \u2014 that he was, in fact, a self-assured man.He just did not care for the baby-kissing and glad-handing that is endemic to politics. And sometimes he simply did not care what people said.During the gasoline crisis of 1979, after lecturing New Jerseyans on the need to conserve fuel, he flew to Washington to meet with White House aides on energy problems. Before leaving Trenton, he saw to it that his official limousine was dispatched to Washington so that he could be chauffeured around the capital. After the meetings, he flew back to Trenton. The limo went back empty, except for the driver.He was widely criticized for the episode, but there was never a hint that it bothered Mr. Byrne, who could give as well as he got in dealing with New Jersey journalists.\u201cIt is not true that I can only read at a fifth-grade level,\u201d he told a group of them, after being roasted at a press dinner. \u201cI read out-of-state papers, too.\u201dHe confounded the so-called experts again and again, at no time more dramatically than in 1977. That April, a poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers found that only 17 percent of New Jerseyans approved of his performance.His very vulnerability may have helped him: Nine Democrats were emboldened to challenge him in the primary. They consumed one another, allowing Mr. Byrne to be renominated with just 30 percent of the vote.Mr. Bateman had also survived a bruising primary, after which he led the incumbent governor by as many as 10 percentage points in several reputable polls. But Mr. Byrne campaigned relentlessly.He insisted that his Republican opponent had essentially no platform, except his condemnation of the income tax. Mr. Byrne never retreated from his stance that the income tax was not only right but also essential, and that its burden on homeowners would be offset by rebates on property taxes.He underscored some conspicuous first-term accomplishments, like his successful backing of a referendum to bring casino gambling to Atlantic City, at the time a shabby resort community, to revitalize it. He reminded voters of his support for building the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which lured the football Giants from New York City.He soon closed the gap in Truman-like fashion and won convincingly over the man who had been his adversary in squash as well as in politics.\u201cI knew I\u2019d get re-elected when people started waving at me using all five fingers,\u201d he reflected, perhaps only half-jokingly.Mr. Byrne began his public career in the mid-1950s as an adviser to Gov. Robert B. Meyner. In 1959, Governor Meyner named him Essex County prosecutor. He was reappointed by Gov. Richard J. Hughes in 1964.While Mr. Byrne was investigating organized crime, a phone conversation about him between mobsters was recorded. Forget about trying to bribe him, one gangster told another; Brendan Byrne was a man \u201cwho couldn\u2019t be bought.\u201d This was high praise in a state where municipal mischief was no rarity.After nine years as prosecutor, Mr. Byrne was named head of the state Public Utilities Commission by Governor Hughes. He held that post for two years before being appointed a Superior Court judge by Gov. William T. Cahill in 1970.As the election year of 1973 drew near, a number of influential Democrats thought that this couldn\u2019t-be-bought ex-prosecutor and ex-judge might be just the candidate to take on Governor Cahill. Mr. Cahill had never been accused of dishonesty himself but was bedeviled by improprieties among his top aides.Mr. Byrne later recalled that he was happy on the bench, but that the entreaties from party leaders kept coming. On April 24, 1973, he went to Governor Cahill\u2019s office, tendered his resignation from the court, then startled the governor\u2019s aides by announcing his own candidacy from Mr. Cahill\u2019s outer office.Mr. Byrne won in a three-way primary. Mr. Cahill was so weakened politically by corruption among his aides that he lost the Republican primary to Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., a South Jersey conservative. Mr. Sandman would soon become known as a strident supporter of President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate hearings.New Jersey Republicans did not unite behind Mr. Sandman, who was not liked either by Mr. Cahill or by Senator Clifford P. Case, a highly respected moderate. Mr. Byrne was elected governor by more than 720,000 votes, one of the biggest landslides in the state\u2019s history.His first term began auspiciously, with legislation to help finance future gubernatorial elections, create a public advocate\u2019s office and simplify voter registration \u2014 all measures that he had pushed. During the energy crisis of early 1974, he moved decisively to put into place a widely respected fuel-allocation program.But in June 1974, he called on the Legislature to pass a $1 billion tax package that included a state income tax. He argued that the levies were necessary; the State Supreme Court, finding wide disparities between rich school districts and poor ones, had ruled that New Jersey could no longer rely on local property taxes to finance education.Necessary or not, the $1 billion package was political poison. As a candidate, Mr. Byrne had not exactly promised that there would be no income tax, but he had not discouraged the impression that he had.Mr. Byrne\u2019s first attempt to win passage of his tax program passed by one vote in the Assembly but was buried in the Senate. He persisted nonetheless. The debate over taxes, particularly the income tax, came to dominate his first term, and while he finally won enactment of a compromise program (with an income tax), he had spent enormous political capital and lost some political friends in the process, assuring himself of an uphill struggle for a second term.During that second term, ground was broken at the Meadowlands Sports Complex for an indoor arena, and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority decided to name it after Mr. Byrne \u2014 a decision that drew strong criticism.The arena became the home of the New Jersey Nets basketball team and, until 2007, when they moved to Newark, of the New Jersey Devils hockey team. The Nets moved to Brooklyn in 2012. The name of the arena was later changed, first to Continental Airlines Arena and then the Izod Center.After retiring from politics in 1982, Mr. Byrne was a senior partner in a law firm in Roseland, N.J. He also became a part owner of the Devils, and because of that he may have lost a chance to succeed Bowie Kuhn as baseball commissioner in the early 1980s.That was because the primary owner of the Devils was John J. McMullen, who also owned the Houston Astros and had become known as a foe of Mr. Kuhn.Brendan Thomas Byrne was born on April 1, 1924, and grew up in West Orange, N.J. His father, Francis, was the city\u2019s public safety commissioner and later president of the Essex County tax board. His mother was the former Genevieve Brennan.Mr. Byrne briefly attended Seton Hall University before enlisting in the Army Air Forces during World War II.

{"Headline": "Rise of Bitcoin Competitor Ripple Creates Wealth to Rival Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world\u2019s richest people into disarray.Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks.Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week \u2014 and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin.While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires \u2014 albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies.Mr. Larsen\u2019s soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple \u2014 and his Forbes ranking \u2014 dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO.\u201cThis is beyond insane,\u201d said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation.\u201dRipple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens \u2014 including Einsteinium and Byteball \u2014 that rose more than Bitcoin\u2019s remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider.Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion \u2014 when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value \u2014 despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading.Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history.Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software.Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday\u2019s prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.)Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens \u2014 known as Lumens \u2014 worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency.In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion.Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens \u2014 and his riches.Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases.Mr. Larsen was Ripple\u2019s chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company\u2019s executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate.Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company\u2019s technology, including American Express and Banco Santander.But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple\u2019s software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens.Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple\u2019s software, but not its tokens.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP\u2019s valuation,\u201d said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital.Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple\u2019s chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using \u2014 or looking at using \u2014 XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements.Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company\u2019s growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,\u201d he said.Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse\u2019s company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge.But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company\u2019s board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple\u2019s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices.But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn\u2019t mean Ripple\u2019s price won\u2019t keep ascending. Why? \u201cBecause this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

The installments range from an infuriating look at payday lending to an offbeat story about Canadian maple syrup cartels.The common thread is the abuse of trust. And \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d argues that the problem goes all the way to the top.Mr. Stevens\u2019s narrative starts with Trump Tower, the gleaming metonym Mr. Trump hung his name on in brass letters. The splashy project landed him on talk shows and magazine covers as the photogenic shorthand for Reagan-age materialism.That served his other big 1980s construction effort \u2014 his media image, for which he poured the foundation in the New York tabloids. The gossip columnist A. J. Benza recalls Mr. Trump as a regular source, offering juicy tips with only one condition: that he be referred to in print as a billionaire.TV reports picked up on the description and embellished it, and Mr. Trump smiled and let them.\u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d interviews old friends, like the music mogul Russell Simmons, and associates like Barbara Res, the executive in charge of the Trump Tower construction, who remember his mythmaking bemusedly. Compared with real estate families like the Zeckendorfs, Ms. Res says, \u201cWho was Trump? He was nobody.\u201dMaybe Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t the biggest developer. But he was the most visible, and he banked on people taking one for the other. (A later ad for Trump University declared, \u201cDonald Trump is, without question, the world\u2019s most famous businessman\u201d \u2014 trusting the audience to read that as \u201cmost successful.\u201d)When it all went bad by the early \u201990s, fame was his guarantor. His creditors, who needed the Trump brand to survive in order to get paid back, put him on an allowance to keep up a glitzy front.Mr. Trump, the film argues, has thrived by finding partners \u2014 in finance, reality TV, politics \u2014 who were as invested as he was in propping up his image.That made him a perfect host for \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d whose premise was that Mr. Trump was a legendary businessman and desirable boss.TV fame opened up other opportunities, and the last half of \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d detours into dark intimations about Mr. Trump\u2019s partnerships with businessmen from former Soviet republics and his alleged self-enrichment as president. It also re-examines the fraud case, later settled, against Trump University that his opponents tried to make stick to him in the 2016 campaign.But the film\u2019s larger case is against the reasoning that helped elect him: He was the most famous businessman, therefore he was the best businessman, therefore \u2014 following the logic of Mitt Romney and H.

{"Headline": "Every One of the World\u2019s Big Economies Is Now Growing", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A decade after the world descended into a devastating economic crisis, a key marker of revival has finally been achieved. Every major economy on earth is expanding at once, a synchronous wave of growth that is creating jobs, lifting fortunes and tempering fears of popular discontent.No tidy, all-encompassing narrative explains how the world has finally escaped the global downturn. The United States has been propelled by government spending unleashed during the previous administration, plus a recent $1.5 trillion shot of tax cuts. Europe has finally felt the effects of cheap money pumped out by its central bank.In general terms, improvement owes less to some newfound wellspring of wealth than the simple fact that many of the destructive forces that felled growth have finally exhausted their potency.And still the fact that every major swath of the globe is expanding is a source of optimism. There is no guarantee that this expansion will prove more equitable. Yet if growth were to evolve, bolstering wages while adding to the security of middle-class lives, the beginning would probably feel something like now.\u201cThe world is less reliant on a few star performers,\u201d said Barret Kupelian, senior economist in the London office of PwC, the global accounting and consulting company. \u201cIf something bad happens in one economy, the fact that global growth is spread gives you more assurance that this is more sustainable.\u201dThe United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, is into its ninth year of growth, with the International Monetary Fund lifting expectations for expansion to 2.7 percent this year from 2.3 percent because of the tax cuts.The result is a hopeful albeit fragile recovery, one vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable predilections of world leaders.\u201cWe used to operate under the idea that Western markets are politically stable, while we accepted that frontier markets were risky,\u201d said Martin Scheepbouwer, chief executive officer of the OLX Group, which operates online classified advertising platforms in 41 countries. \u201cNowadays, with Brexit in Europe and the presidency in the United States, there\u2019s a new level of instability looming over the economy. That\u2019s something that concerns us.\u201dThe report also warned of rising economic inequality, growing threats to cybersecurity and increased incidence of extreme weather enhanced by climate change.\u201cMany of these risks are increasingly systemic,\u201d said Margareta Drzeniek Hanouz, an economist at the World Economic Forum, adding that they threaten \u201ccatastrophic consequences for humanity, and for the economy.\u201dGlobal businesses appear cautiously optimistic that the good times can last.In Poland and Brazil, online job listings are growing rapidly, according to OLX, a clear indication of growth. Across Europe, real estate ads offering homes for sale have increased at more than double the pace of rental properties, another sign that people are operating with more money.The global crisis began more than a decade ago with the calamitous end of an American real estate bonanza that set off a global disaster involving so-called derivatives.As the reckoning played out from the United States to Europe to Asia, oil prices plunged, hitting Russia and the Middle East. Soybean farms in Brazil and Argentina saw orders plummet. So did mines in Australia and India, and computer chip fabricators in Malaysia and South Korea.Washington engineered swift relief, with a bank rescue and an enormous injection of credit from the Federal Reserve. But Europe prolonged the agony with bitter recriminations over who should clean up the mess.This year, the 19 nations that share the euro are expected to see economic growth of 1.9 percent, according to I.M.F. That is not scorching. In Spain, Greece and Italy, young people still grapple with terrible rates of joblessness. Yet compared with the 4.5 percent decline in 2009, and smaller contractions in 2012 and 2013, it makes for a different era.As recovery has spread, factories in Eastern Europe have bustled with additional orders. Auto plants in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Romania have sent growing volumes of cars toward Germany, France and the Netherlands.DSM, a Netherlands-based multinational company that makes nutritional products, opened a $60 million factory in Rwanda last May that is buying soy and corn from nearly 10,000 local farmers and using it to produce instant porridge.\u201cWe are investing heavily in Asia and also in Africa because the growth of the population there is stronger,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Feike Sijbesma. \u201cAfrica, which always was the forgotten continent, is not the forgotten continent any longer.\u201dThe reawakening of Europe combined with growth in the United States has kept Chinese industry humming to satisfy demand for goods, from auto parts to tools to clothing. More factory production has lifted prices for commodities, and increasing revenues at copper producers in Chile and Indonesia, gold mines in South Africa and silver operations in Sweden.The world is now enjoying a positive feedback loop, with growing business confidence leading to more hiring, delivering gains in consumer spending. More money in consumer pockets gives businesses more reason to expand.\u201cThere\u2019s basically no country in the world where the consumer is not doing well,\u201d said Bart van Ark, chief economist at The Conference Board, a business and research association in New York.The question now is whether new investment will materialize quickly enough to sustain expansion. Factories in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal were operating at close to full capacity at the end of last year, according to data analyzed by The Conference Board.In the United States, investment is increasing, adding to momentum for expansion. In Europe, the growth is uneven.\u201cYou get into a trade war, that\u2019s the real worry,\u201d said Ben May, a global economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThe impacts on global growth would be quite severe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Subway Is Next Door. Should New Yorkers Pay Extra for That?", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, with the subway in precipitous decline and the city enjoying an economic boom, some policymakers think the time has come for the subway to profit from the financial benefits it provides, including its considerable contribution to property values.There is little dispute that access to public transit often results in higher real estate prices. Neighborhoods like trendy Williamsburg in Brooklyn would not have had a resurgence without the access provided by the L line, whose ridership grew at three times the rate of the system as a whole from 1998 to 2012 and which has benefited from an upgraded signal system that allows more trains to run.The Cuomo proposal calls for before and after assessments in neighborhoods where a new transportation project, like the extension of a subway line, raises property values. Officials would determine the difference between the previous assessment and the new, higher one.Of the tax on that difference, 75 percent would go to the transit agency and 25 percent to the city.\u201cTo simply impose it on the city isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he said.State officials said an existing four-person review panel would have the power to veto proposals the city opposed \u2014 and one member is appointed to represent the city. Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transit agency, said that the panel \u201cworks under what I call U.N. Security Council rules,\u201d meaning that if one of the members is against a project, \u201cthe entire proposal goes down.\u201dAs proposed, the governor\u2019s value-capture plan would apply only to transit projects costing more than $100 million. It could not be used to pay for already completed projects, like the $4.4 billion segment of the Second Avenue subway. But it could raise money for future segments planned to extend that line north to 125th Street.City officials maintain that including railroad projects is unfair because they largely benefit suburban commuters who would not be charged under the governor\u2019s tax plan. Mr. Fuleihan, the first deputy mayor, said 70 percent of the revenue for the transit agency comes from the city through taxes and fares, but suburban commuters who use the subway once they arrive in the city pay nothing but the fare.The governor\u2019s proposal would allow the transit agency to establish districts around new projects for value capture that could extend as far as a mile from a station. But city officials scoffed, arguing that living a mile from a stop is too far to consider it a convenience.What improved public transit can mean for a neighborhood is easy to see on the Upper East Side, which became a transit wasteland after elevated trains on Second and Third Avenues were demolished more than 60 years ago. Until the Second Avenue subway opened, residents on the eastern edge of the neighborhood had to trudge blocks to squeeze onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains on Lexington Avenue, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway line.Christian Moulin, a co-op owner who has lived on East 85th Street between York Avenue and East End Avenue for 17 years, said the Upper East Side used to be \u201cthe less expensive place \u2014 rents were reasonable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s changing,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s all because of the subway.\u201dHe said one indication was that fliers from brokers seeking apartments now appear in his and his neighbors\u2019 mailboxes every couple of weeks. \u201cWe never had that before,\u201d he said.Beth Fisher, a senior managing director for the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales for three new apartment buildings north of East 86th Street, said the distance to the subway had long been \u201ca metric for how people live\u201d but that value capture put too much of an emphasis on the subway\u2019s influence.\u201cThe Second Avenue subway, sure, is the protagonist, the key driver of value,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is not the only driver. It ought not be singled out in that manner.\u201dValue capture is a familiar concept outside New York and has been used as a way to fund transit projects in other cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, London and Hong Kong. In New York, Mr. Wright, of the Regional Plan Association, called the Second Avenue subway \u201ca lost opportunity\u201d in terms of value capture.But Mr. Wright cautioned that value capture in already developed neighborhoods would be more modest.\u201cIn developed areas \u2014 say, the Upper East Side where you\u2019re not looking at new virgin development on a rail yard, what you\u2019re talking about is increased values of buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe New York property tax system is such that that\u2019s not going to generate short-term and immediate returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Monkeys and a Beetle: Inside VW\u2019s Campaign for \u2018Clean Diesel\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 In 2014, as evidence mounted about the harmful effects of diesel exhaust on human health, scientists in an Albuquerque laboratory conducted an unusual experiment: Ten monkeys squatted in airtight chambers, watching cartoons for entertainment as they inhaled fumes from a diesel Volkswagen Beetle.German automakers had financed the experiment in an attempt to prove that diesel vehicles with the latest technology were cleaner than the smoky models of old. But the American scientists conducting the test were unaware of one critical fact: The Beetle provided by Volkswagen had been rigged to produce pollution levels that were far less harmful in the lab than they were on the road.The results were being deliberately manipulated.The Albuquerque monkey research, which has not been previously reported, is a new dimension in a global emissions scandal that has already forced Volkswagen to plead guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges in the United States and to pay more than $26 billion in fines.The details of the Albuquerque experiment have been disclosed in a lawsuit brought against Volkswagen in the United States, offering a rare window into the world of industry-backed academic research. The organization that commissioned the study, the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, received all of its funding from Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. It shut down last year amid controversy over its work.The organization, known by its German initials, E.U.G.T., did not do any research itself. Rather, it hired scientists to conduct studies that might defend the use of diesel. It sponsored research that challenged a 2012 decision by the World Health Organization to classify diesel exhaust as a carcinogen. It financed studies that cast doubt on whether banning older diesel vehicles from cities reduced pollution. It produced a skeptical assessment of data showing that diesel pollution far exceeded permitted levels in cities like Barcelona, Spain.Industries like food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals have a long history of supporting research that advances their political agendas. But the automakers\u2019 group consistently promoted the industry\u2019s claim that diesel was environmentally friendly \u2014 a claim now undercut by the Volkswagen scandal.\u201cThere are a lot of parallels between the industries in the way they try to downplay the harm and encourage people to become addicted,\u201d Ms. Douglas said.Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW said the research group did legitimate scientific work. \u201cAll of the research work commissioned with the E.U.G.T. was accompanied and reviewed by a research advisory committee consisting of scientists from renowned universities and research institutes,\u201d Daimler said in a statement.Daimler and BMW said they were unaware that the Volkswagen used in the Albuquerque monkey tests had been set up to produce false data. Volkswagen said in a statement that the researchers had never managed to publish a complete study.It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying.Documents produced in legal proceedings show that in August 2016 Michael Spallek, the director of the automakers\u2019 research group, emailed the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, the Albuquerque organization that conducted the tests with monkeys. \u201cThe E.U.G.T. point of view is that it\u2019s time to try to finalize the report and to present or discuss the problems of the study in a scientific way ASAP,\u201d Mr. Spallek wrote.That was almost a year after Volkswagen admitted to equipping millions of diesel vehicles sold in the United States and Europe with illegal \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that cranked up pollution controls when software detected that testing was being done in a lab. At other times, the controls were turned off, allowing the cars to produce more nitrogen oxides than a long-haul truck.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. Spallek declined to comment, saying his contract prohibited him from discussing the research group\u2019s work.The carmakers maintained that modern technology had solved diesel\u2019s big downside: emissions of nitrogen oxides and fine soot particles that can contribute to asthma, heart attacks and cancer.David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the British government, recalled being taken to a lab in the early 2000s where 10 diesel vehicles were running on rollers. The air was so clean that Mr. King, an asthmatic, could breathe freely.What Mr. King did not know is that most European automakers had built their diesel cars to pass laboratory emissions tests and no more. On the road, according to recent studies by the governments of Britain, France and Germany, diesel cars by almost all European manufacturers spewed toxic gases in quantities far above those allowed by law.\u201cWe were all misled by the car manufacturers,\u201d Mr. King said in an interview.Research sponsored by industry \u201call has the same fundamental aim,\u201d said Joachim Heinrich, an environmental health expert at the University of Munich who has spent his career studying the effects of air pollution, \u201cnamely to weaken or discredit regulation \u2014 to say \u2018the evidence is not that clear,\u2019 \u2018we shouldn\u2019t take it so seriously,\u2019 \u2018we need to think more about it.\u2019\u201dThe automakers\u2019 research group was created in 2007, as Volkswagen was readying a major push to market diesel technology in the United States, which has stricter limits on nitrogen oxide emissions than Europe. Mr. Spallek, the executive director, had been the chief medical officer of Volkswagen\u2019s commercial vehicles division.The negative health effects of diesel were starting to attract more attention. Zones where diesel was restricted were proliferating in Europe, posing a threat to automakers because the areas discourage sales of diesels.The industry group\u2019s studies on low emissions zones were influential, however. They were cited in reports by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a public body in Britain that provides guidance on health care.Elsewhere, a regional court in Austria cited the research in a 2014 ruling against residents of Graz who had sued to force officials to restrict diesel traffic. The decision, by the State Administrative Court for the province of Styria, called the study \u201cthorough\u201d and said it showed that the effect of low-emissions zones on fine soot pollution was \u201cless than expected.\u201d The decision did not mention that the study had been financed by the auto industry.Officials at the research group also sought to influence public debate. In 2016, Helmut Greim, the chairman of the group\u2019s research advisory board, testified before the German Parliament that it was impossible to establish a direct link between nitrogen dioxide pollution and lung ailments. Mr. Greim is a longtime b\u00eate noire for environmental activists, who say he consistently takes the industry point of view.Mr. Greim, 82, said in an interview that the group\u2019s research was independent and published only in peer-reviewed journals. During an interview in Munich, he said that fear of nitrogen dioxide pollution was \u201ccompletely overblown.\u201dIn September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.The research group intended the Albuquerque experiment to be a rebuttal to a 2012 finding by a division of the World Health Organization that had classified diesel exhaust as a carcinogen.The automakers\u2019 research group set out to show that new diesel vehicles were better. It hired the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, an established research center that has also done work for the Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct a study that would compare emissions from a late-model Volkswagen with those of a 1999 Ford diesel pickup.The tests were conducted in 2014 using 10 cynomolgus macaque monkeys, a breed used extensively in medical experiments, according to the legal records.Volkswagen took a lead role in the study. Company engineers supervised the installation of a treadmill that would allow the vehicles to run on rollers while equipment sucked exhaust from the tailpipes.The gas was then diluted and fed into chambers containing the monkeys. To keep the animals calm during the four hours they breathed fumes, lab workers set up a television showing cartoons.\u201cThey like to watch cartoons,\u201d Jake McDonald, the Lovelace scientist who oversaw the experiments, said in a sworn deposition taken last year as part of a lawsuit by Volkswagen diesel owners seeking damages beyond those provided for in a class-action settlement.Dr. McDonald said he did not know the Volkswagen Beetle was equipped with software that recognized when the car was being tested on a treadmill. The software did not interfere with the filter that removed carcinogenic fine soot particles from the exhaust, a technology that has in fact improved significantly.But it cranked up controls so that nitrogen dioxide pollution, which has been linked to asthma, bronchitis, heart attacks and possibly lung cancer, was only a small fraction of what it would be during normal driving.Even so, the study did not provide a clear finding. The researchers struggled to produce a paper that they could publish, a condition for receiving full payment.In the August 2016 email, Mr. Spallek complained about numerous flaws with the methodology used by the Lovelace research team. But he never mentioned the illegal software that had caused the Beetle to produce artificially low emissions.Discussions about publishing the study continued until last year, according to Dr. McDonald. A lawyer for Volkswagen, Michael Steinberg, implied during cross-examination that Dr. McDonald had pushed to publish the results so that the institute could collect $71,000 owed under the contract.Dr. McDonald disputed that assertion. \u201cThe decision to continue,\u201d he said in an emailed statement, \u201cwas the choice of the client.\u201dAlthough Dr. McDonald and other employees at the institute exchanged emails about the Volkswagen defeat device after its exposure in 2015, Dr. McDonald testified that he had not followed the Volkswagen case closely and had realized only recently that the Beetle used in the tests was manipulated to produce artificially low emissions.\u201cI feel like a chump,\u201d Dr. McDonald said.Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Diabetes Shouldn\u2019t Bankrupt You", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIf there was one thing that doomed the Republican proposals to remake health care last year, it was the great uncertainty about how they would cover patients with chronic illness and pre-existing conditions.Throngs of people with a wide range of ailments staged dramatic protests in and around the halls of Congress during the debate. Night after night, Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a serious congenital heart defect, took up the cause on his talk show.Who doesn\u2019t have a family member or friend with a long-term or potentially recurring medical condition, whose life is maintained by expensive treatments \u2014 patients with diseases like Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, heart failure, cystic fibrosis and cancer? They are grateful for medical innovations that allow them to lead long, productive lives but afraid of financial ruin or an inability to get good coverage.But there is one large group of patients whom the federal government long ago effectively immunized against these now-widespread fears. Through a quiet act of Congress in 1972, people on dialysis with end-stage kidney failure can gain automatic Medicare coverage.When the law passed, dialysis patients probably seemed pretty exceptional: They needed a lifesaving treatment, at a potentially bankrupting price, for the rest of their lives. But today people with many diseases fit that description. That\u2019s why, as the United States attempts to rein in its $3 trillion annual medical bill and revamp its health care system, any plan must involve a solution for people with serious chronic illness, like the one developed for kidney failure almost half a century ago.\u201cThis is an increasingly important issue as we get better at treatments and the risk and costs of chronic illnesses get more predictable,\u201d said Mark McClellan, a former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration under President George W. Bush, who is now a professor of business, medicine and policy at Duke University.The high cost of treating chronic illnesses poses a problem for every country. In the United States, it once meant that commercial insurers rejected such patients or charged them sky-high rates. The Affordable Care Act made such practices illegal, but even now insured people with chronic illnesses often face unaffordable costs in an era of high deductibles and co-payments.With varying success, other countries have found their own solutions, though mostly starting from different places.\u201cIf you have a chronic disease, you shouldn\u2019t be burdened by the cost,\u201d said York F. Z\u00f6llner, professor of health economics at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, explaining the German approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d He and others note that conventional insurance is meant to cover unpredictable costs. But the costs of chronic illnesses are predictably high.Germany offers people with chronic disease better-than-standard coverage. Every German is required to have insurance \u2014 and guaranteed access to it \u2014 typically through more than 100 public nonprofit insurers. People can pick which \u201csickness fund\u201d to join, and the system is financed through a \u201ccontribution\u201d equal to roughly 15 percent of their income \u2014 nearly half coming from their employer and the rest from their paycheck. The total payment is capped at about 650 euros per month for adults, which includes coverage for dependent relatives.While co-payments exist \u2014 for prescriptions and hospital stays, for example \u2014 they are capped at 2 percent of gross earnings, and people with chronic disease pay half of that, according to Dr. Z\u00f6llner, with their out-of-pocket spending on health cost capped at 1 percent of income.Since expensive prescription drugs are a big component of many treatments, Germany\u2019s state health insurers have been negotiating prices with drugmakers since 2011, and drug prices there are generally lower than in the United States. The patient contribution for any prescription is five to 10 euros.Kaitlyn West, an American with Type 1 diabetes who recently moved to Germany for graduate school, said that in the United States she had been paying on average $400 per month in out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 close to $5,000 each year. The amount fluctuated wildly depending on how her insurance policy at the moment covered her pumps and medicines.On German public insurance, the monthly contribution is about $105 and her yearly out-of-pocket spending is capped at about $140 for supplies and $45 for insulin. \u201cThere are no fees for doctors\u2019 visits, no fees for my blood draws and no hassle getting things done,\u201d she said. \u201cThis system allows me to live a normal, stress-free life.\u201dThe German health system is based on the principle of solidarity, not individuality, Dr. Z\u00f6llner said. But reframed to appeal to current American concerns, it might translate: \u201cThere but for the grace of God go I,\u201d since at this point there are so many treatable chronic diseases. The congressional logic that led to the 1972 kidney-care exception could apply to any of those conditions.In the 1960s, outpatient dialysis clinics and kidney transplantation were relatively new and too expensive for most patients, leaving insurers and employers to make hard choices about whether to pay for treatment.Against that backdrop, kidney specialists and lobbyists, including from the National Kidney Foundation, pressed for funding of treatment. One protest featured a patient being connected to dialysis on the House floor. An amendment to a Social Security bill in 1972 allowed kidney patients to enroll in Medicare.\u201cIt is one of the most interesting cases in health care because it\u2019s unique in how we treated a chronic condition,\u201d said Tonya Saffer, senior health policy director at the foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s been lifesaving.\u201dWhile protecting patients from death and financial ruin, the program has also come with lessons. Once people with kidney disease had Medicare coverage, outpatient dialysis centers popped up across the country to serve a new cohort of paying patients. As the business of medicine grew, treatment was progressively taken over by a small number of for-profit companies with which Medicare and commercial insurers have been locked in a perpetual tug-of-war over potentially exploitative billing. Dialysis centers, for example, were billing not just for the dialysis but also for expensive drugs that were sometimes overused.To prevent abuses, Medicare today reimburses dialysis by paying a set amount for each treatment session, with a typical limit of three per week, although advocates question whether that number is sufficient. This model, where providers get a \u201cbundled payment\u201d for each treatment session or a per-person payment for each month of care, could be used to cover all sorts of chronic diseases while controlling costs, whether through Medicare or not, Dr. McClellan said.Isn\u2019t that just as true now?Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and the author of \u201cAn American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation.

The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster.

{"Headline": "A New Leader for a Troubled New Jersey Transit", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. \u2014 Kevin Corbett is about to step into what may be the hardest job in New Jersey.On Tuesday, Mr. Corbett, a top executive at Aecom, a global construction and engineering firm, was introduced by Gov. Philip D. Murphy as the next executive director of New Jersey Transit, whose cascade of problems and rampant delays has turned a once model transportation agency into one of the worst commuter railroads in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal challenge, but it\u2019s one that is solvable,\u201d Mr. Corbett, 62, said in an interview. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff that was done right early on \u2014 without getting into why it deteriorated \u2014 clearly where it is now, the ability to bring it back is there. It\u2019s leadership.\u201dNearly 15 months after New Jersey Transit promised an overhaul following a fatal crash in Hoboken, the railroad, the third largest transit system in the United States, is by some measures actually doing worse.Despite being in a state that relies heavily on public transportation for commuters traveling to New York City, New Jersey Transit\u2019s rail ridership decreased last year by 2.3 million trips, or 2.3 percent, from 2016, while its bus ridership decreased by 5.4 million trips, or 3.4 percent.In addition to fewer riders, the list of problems the agency faces is long. On-time performance has sagged. A budget shortfall could top $60 million. It has the second-worst record for mechanical failures in the nation. It has struggled to retain top talent and many key positions were filled with political appointees with no railroad expertise. And, in what some say reflects a troubling culture, the agency has paid more than $10 million in harassment and discrimination settlements since 2012.New Jersey Transit also most likely will fail to meet a federal deadline for installing a modern system to control trains and improve safety.Mr. Murphy, a Democrat who took office this month, has called the railroad a \u201cnational disgrace\u2019\u2019 and has made reversing its fortunes a top priority.\u201cStarting today we will begin to measure success by actually getting better, not because New Jersey Transit didn\u2019t actually get any worse,\u201d Mr. Murphy said as he introduced Mr. Corbett at the train station here, adding that the agency was the \u201clinchpin\u201d to greater economic prosperity.But as he stood next to his two choices to fix the state\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 Mr. Corbett and Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, his choice to lead the Department of Transportation \u2014 Mr. Murphy noted that New Jersey Transit would not be turned around overnight.\u201cI ask for your patience as we start to rebuild this agency,\u201d he said.In an interview, Mr. Corbett said that since word of his nomination leaked last week, he has been hearing from friends wishing him well, but also sharing their grievances.\u201cI\u2019ve had people calling me that\u2019s just like a therapy session,\u201d he said, promising that once he takes charge, \u201cthe right kind of people are going to feel like they just had a heavy backpack taken off their back.\u201dMr. Corbett, whose nomination needs to be approved by the transit agency\u2019s board of directors, said his immediate focus would be on hiring and safety.But as of last September, only 7 percent of the hardware necessary for new system had been installed, just 125 of the 2,200 components. And of the 1,100 workers who need to be certified for the new system only 137 had completed the process, according to the Federal Railroad AdministrationNonetheless, the agency says it is committed to meeting the deadline.\u201cThis important safety technology remains a priority, and we work every day to keep it moving forward,\u2019\u2019 said Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for the agency. \u201cAt the same time, we are holding our prime contractor, Parsons Transportation Group, accountable to keep the project progressing.\u201dWhile Mr. Corbett cautioned that there was no \u201cmagic wand\u201d to address many of the problems, he believed that with the governor\u2019s support, chronic issues could be addressed. \u201cPhil Murphy is a very pleasant guy to deal with on a human level, but he wasn\u2019t successful at Goldman Sachs by letting people take their sweet time,\u201d Mr. Corbett said of the governor\u2019s previous employer.For riders, delays have become a near-daily frustration.In 2017, one out of every five trains traveling into New York City during morning commuting hours was delayed, a problem exacerbated by summer repairs at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, according to a report filed this month by New Jersey Transit\u2019s outgoing executive director, Steven H. Santoro.When it comes to delays, Mr. Corbett said he can commiserate with commuters \u2014 he has been riding New Jersey Transit for more than 20 years.\u201cEvery day we felt like it was like fricking Dunkirk,\u201d he said of the commute last summer from his home in Mendham, N.J. \u201cMaybe your train got there, maybe it didn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Corbett has never run a commuter rail system, but he said that his work at Aecom, which has many contracts with the state, and his role as a member of the board of directors at the Regional Plan Association give him strong familiarity with the infrastructure.Mr. Corbett is hoping to leverage some of that experience, particularly in expediting procurement practices.\u201cFive-hundred days to get a change order through? Contracts?\u201d he said. \u201cEven the people at Amtrak will say, \u2018Geez, I thought we were bad, and we take three months.\u2019 \u201dHe recalled a recent visit to a maintenance complex where cars are repaired. He said many cars there had their doors open, exposed to the elements and potentially draining their batteries.\u201cThat kind of thing, that\u2019s inexcusable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind stuff that has to stop as soon as you get in.\u201dThe agency has also been hampered by personnel problems. Since 2012, 146 internal complaints involving racial or sexual discrimination have been filed against the agency, leading to 21 findings of probable cause. Thirty-eight cases are pending, and 87 were withdrawn or closed because of a lack of probable cause, according to a document obtained by The New York Times. The agency has also paid more than $10 million in settlements since 2012.Mr. Murphy\u2019s predecessor, Chris Christie, a Republican, placed allies with no transit experience in high-ranking positions, a practice that Mr. Corbett wants to end.\u201cPolitics is not my strength,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf somebody at N.J.T. really is political in nature, good, run for office. You don\u2019t belong in N.J.T.\u201dBut whatever improvements Mr. Corbett can make will not necessarily make a difference to riders unless officials in New Jersey and New York can persuade the Trump administration to finance a new tunnel under the Hudson River. The current tunnel, which carries trains for New Jersey Transit and Amtrak, is over a century old, needs to be repaired and cannot handle the demand.Mr. Corbett said he intended to push for a more equitable seat at the negotiating table.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like if you\u2019re going into a casino, if you want to be in the back room with the big boys with the big chips, you can\u2019t go in and say, \u2018Well, I only have five cents but I want a seat at the table,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to pony up.\u201dAs for fares, Mr. Corbett said, \u201cthat is not my prerogative to promise, I leave that to the board and the governor,\u201d but as a rider he feels an increase would be unfair.\u201cFares have gone up a lot and you\u2019ve seen a decrease in service, so how do you go back asking for more?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The 20 or so study animals will be transferred to a sanctuary, the commissioner said.F.D.A. researchers are continuing other primate studies, the agency said, although Dr. Gottlieb said he wanted to reduce reliance on them.The suspended study, begun in 2014, was designed to inform agency officials who have expanded oversight of tobacco products, regulation of e-cigarettes and alternative nicotine delivery devices.The research was supposed to measure the effects of nicotine on addiction, mostly on young squirrel monkeys although it also included some adults. Researchers taught the squirrel monkeys to press a bar to get a dose of nicotine. After they became addicted, the scientists lowered the doses and observed the effects.They started with a group of 24 monkeys, but by the end of last summer four had died \u2014 three from anesthesia given while catheters were put in, and one from a type of gastric bloat.Patsie, another squirrel monkey in the study, nearly died while under anesthesia on July 20 of last year. Patsie stopped breathing, but veterinarians were able to revive him.In September, the F.D.A. suspended the studies and started investigating treatment of the animals. They found numerous deficiencies, although the agency has not released an inspection report with details.Anthony Bellotti, president of the White Coat Waste Project, which had enlisted Dr. Goodall\u2019s help, praised the agency\u2019s action. \u201dWe applaud the F.D.A. for ending these wasteful baby monkey nicotine tests and for retiring the primates,\u201d he said.Jack Henningfield, professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, disagreed with the decision to stop the study.\u201cThese studies are done to address really serious questions about the nature of tobacco addiction,\u201d Dr. Henningfield said. \u2018\u2018This is research in serious service to humanity.

{"Headline": "Where Pot Entrepreneurs Go When the Banks Just Say No", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "FeatureAs the legal markets for marijuana spread, a small credit union is solving a big problem: what to do with all the cash.Supported byBehzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh\u2019s small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations.One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna\u2019s manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver\u2019s north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants\u2019 flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out.Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh\u2019s office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse \u2014 Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh\u2019s \u201cmurse,\u201d for man purse \u2014 and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. \u201cOne day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,\u201d Behzadzadeh reminisced. \u201cI put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars.\u201d When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. \u201cSo Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there\u2019s a thousand dollars!\u201d They laughed heartily. \u201cIf we had bank accounts,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, \u201cit\u2019d be much easier.\u201dGrowing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase \u2014 and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for.In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners\u2019 personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado\u2019s, with the potential for many more banking headaches.But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law.Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state\u2019s financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry\u2019s biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery \u2014 a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000\u201d while someone fills out money orders.To manage these accounts, Seefried \u2014 working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution \u2014 created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried\u2019s bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients\u2019 finances and operations. \u201cI said it in every interview in the beginning,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201c\u2009\u2018You have to understand: We\u2019re going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.\u2019\u2009\u201dFive other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry. (They don\u2019t lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it\u2019s difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did.Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. \u201cHer openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,\u201d says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state\u2019s banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. \u201cShe understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,\u201d he said. (She has also written a book, \u201cNavigating Safe Harbor,\u201d about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn\u2019t been indicted, and she hasn\u2019t been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small \u2014 \u201cless than 20 percent,\u201d she says.Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. \u201cSundie,\u201d he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. \u201cShe wants my firstborn\u201d \u2014 and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business.After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling.Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh\u2019s companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cThat way, I know I counted them.\u201dSeefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, \u201cnobody wanted to talk about it.\u201d Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana \u2014 permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States \u2014 in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. \u201cIt prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,\u201d says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016.Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana \u2014 among them Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor\u2019s director of marijuana coordination, \u201cis a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean.\u201dBut that\u2019s not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado\u2019s first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze.Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado\u2019s lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union\u2019s volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. \u201cAll he kept saying to me during my research was, \u2018Sundie, there\u2019s no safe harbor.\u2019\u2009\u201d The credit union\u2019s accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman\u2019s prison memoir, \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201dSeefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado\u2019s board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking.Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote \u201cThe Canon of Medicine\u201d a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn\u2019t stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money.Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. \u201cI knew that this is a business of compliance before it\u2019s anything marijuana,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult.\u201dState and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado\u2019s marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna\u2019s extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he\u2019s obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day\u2019s end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men \u2014 apart from Angel, they were all men \u2014 supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh\u2019s office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives.But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up.So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days\u2019 worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day\u2019s total \u2014 the money had already been counted at the store, twice \u2014 but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh\u2019s big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan.When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the \u201cgenie bottle\u201d) over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he\u2019d been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash.Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh\u2019s employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime \u2014 clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora \u2014 and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone \u2014 insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive \u2014 replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh\u2019s cameras at Avicenna couldn\u2019t have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. \u201cIt would only take one really effective rip-off gang,\u201d Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, \u201cto terrorize that industry.\u201dOnce the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor\u2019s bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado\u2019s rules. Treasury\u2019s guidance implies that a bank can\u2019t properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California\u2019s large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won\u2019t implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest.Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company\u2019s ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they\u2019ve gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives \u2014 larger than typical, say, or from a new source \u2014 the banker holds the money until the client can account for it.Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. \u201cYou cannot bank what you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Seefried says.Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren\u2019t willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it.Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union\u2019s books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity.This sort of meticulous banking isn\u2019t cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don\u2019t actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year \u2014 less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won\u2019t reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution\u2019s sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million.Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor\u2019s marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million.For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. \u201cBanking,\u201d Koski says, \u201cjust provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out.\u201dOliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. \u201cI found out that he wasn\u2019t blowing smoke,\u201d she told me. (I couldn\u2019t tell if she intended the pun.) \u201cThat was my whole thing: You\u2019re just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope.\u201d She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn\u2019t produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation.Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh\u2019s financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh\u2019s compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check \u2014 almost always \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. \u201cIf you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201chow would you catch who did that?\u201d\u201cCut a bud off\u201d \u2014 the phrase in Oliver\u2019s Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado\u2019s marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant\u2019s scent after a few hours on site. The industry\u2019s brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: \u201cadult use\u201d for \u201crecreational\u201d and \u201ccannabis\u201d for \u201cmarijuana.\u201dElsberg replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 we have cameras on everything.\u201d The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s legal,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI checked his sosh\u201d \u2014 Social Security number. \u201cI checked his driver\u2019s license.\u201d He deadpanned, \u201cI sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too.\u201dNext, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch\u2019s history. She visited the grow next door (\u201cI\u2019m surprised they have as many cameras that they do,\u201d she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights.The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change,\u201d Oliver said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M.\u201dBehzadzadeh\u2019s machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn\u2019t even touch it himself.A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh\u2019s face. \u201cWait \u2014 I\u2019m not going to give my business to somebody else!\u201d he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn \u2014 maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. \u201cI have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I\u2019m not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201dOliver kept pressing. \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is loading the machine for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. \u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that\u201d \u2014 Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll make you coffee.\u201dThe robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. \u201cIf they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, \u201cit would have literally broken my back.\u201d But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them \u2014 Seefried had predicted as much \u2014 but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh\u2019s business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck.Yet despite Safe Harbor\u2019s efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn\u2019t want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor\u2019s waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years\u2019 worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt.Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor\u2019s existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry \u2014 the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn\u2019t missed any suspicious activity. \u201cIt cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201cThat\u2019s one client, with one problem.\u201d She plans to raise fees in the next couple months.Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii\u2019s handful of state-licensed dispensaries.In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. \u201cWe are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don\u2019t want us teaching them incorrectly,\u201d she says.One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. \u201cI came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,\u201d he says. \u201cThe longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic.\u201dRobb Mandelbaum is a regular contributor to Forbes and wrote the \u201cYou\u2019re the Boss\u201d blog for The Times.

{"Headline": "Lacma Seeks to Expand Its Footprint Into South Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is planning to expand beyond its mid-Wilshire campus to create a satellite campus, or possibly two, in South Los Angeles \u2014 the area once known as South Central but rebranded 15 years ago because of its association with riots and crime.The City Council has scheduled a vote for Friday on one site, owned by the city, and Michael Govan, the director of Lacma, said he is in \u201cvery serious discussions\u201d with county leaders about the other. The goal, he noted, is for the museum, which receives about 25 percent of its financing from the county, to reach what he called \u201cunderserved\u201d populations in Los Angeles with exhibitions, after-school programming and other events.\u201cIf you look at a map of L.A.\u2019s public schools, the dots representing the neediest students are all through South Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Govan said. \u201cYou start thinking, where can the value of your collection and program be the greatest, when you\u2019re behind a big fancy fence on Wilshire Boulevard or out in the community?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any real obstacles,\u201d said Curren D. Price Jr., the city councilman who represents the district containing the park. \u201cLacma\u2019s presence here is going to be very, very significant \u2014 part of a larger corridor for arts, recreation and education.\u201dBoarded up for decades, the Wetlands building once served as a garage for metropolitan trains and buses. It was originally constructed in 1911 without electric lighting but with large windows instead.If approved by the City Council on Friday, Lacma\u2019s new site will serve, for starters, about 9,500 students who don\u2019t live near its mid-Wilshire campus. Mr. Govan described an ongoing museum program at the Charles White Elementary School near MacArthur Park that brings students together with contemporary artists and gives them access to museum pieces as sharing similar aims.Mr. Govan identified another reason for seeking a satellite space: the museum currently pays for offsite commercial storage, with no such facilities under its own control. A new site could have built-in storage, if renovated to meet standards. He estimated that the Wetlands building would cost \u201c$300 to $400 per square foot zone to renovate, so we\u2019re looking at roughly $25 to $30 million for capital investment.\u201dDespite that big ask still in progress, the museum doesn\u2019t seemed worried about taking on another capital campaign. Mr. Govan said he doesn\u2019t think there would be any overlap in donors, noting that the South L.A. projects appeal to those supporting \u201ca different set of national initiatives toward social justice.\u201d\u201cUntil the funding drive has been finished for Lacma on Wilshire Boulevard, we are not seeking any resources from those who should and can be giving to that campaign,\u201d Mr. Govan said. \u201cWe are looking elsewhere.\u201dThe Ford Foundation, which is not involved with the Zumthor project, has already issued a $2 million flexible grant to Lacma \u201cfor the acquisitions of sites and community-based programming\u201d in South Los Angeles, said the foundation\u2019s president, Darren Walker. He called the project \u201ca radical idea, not being done at this scale by any museum in America.\u201d\u201cBy going right into the community, this turns the traditional, elitist museum model on its head,\u201d Mr. Walker noted. \u201cThe place of the museum is not only Fifth Avenue or Wilshire Boulevard but also Crenshaw Boulevard. It\u2019s about democratizing our idea of a museum\u2019s mission.\u201d He was especially excited, he said, by the museum\u2019s plans to develop programs and exhibitions in consultation with community members instead of simply importing existing shows.\u201cWe think Lacma could be a significant anchor in the park, and this is potentially the epicenter of cultural activity in the southeast portion of the county,\u201d Mr. Ridley-Thomas said. As for environmental problems, he said, \u201cWe are good to go. It took six years but we now have a handle on the scope of contamination and have begun remediation.\u201dHaving both sites in play could give Mr. Govan an alternative should members of either community not prove receptive. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to force an agenda on anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be somewhere where there is genuine interest.\u201dBesides, Mr. Govan said, he would welcome the chance to help fill two spaces with art and events. \u201cI can tell you now, it\u2019s not an either-or. If we get both spaces, I think that it will be even easier to make each work. Each property offers very different advantages in completely different neighborhoods.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Questions as Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan Take on Health Care: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital.\u2022 JPMorgan has (and hasn\u2019t) clarified its succession plans.\u2022 What should we expect in tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech?Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees.But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.1) What is it?The venture will be an independent company that \u201cis free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won\u2019t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm. His distinguished career of over 30 years leading global financial institutions and asset management businesses brings unique experience that will benefit Oz significantly.\u201dAnd a statement by Mr. Levin, who had weighed quitting \u2014 but was identified in today\u2019s statement as still being Och-Ziff\u2019s co-chief investment officer:\u201cOz is a tremendous firm with a talented and creative team that works each day to identify and execute on the most compelling investment opportunities around the world. I am excited about the future and look forward to welcoming Rob.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,\u201d JPMorgan said in its statement. But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years.Critics\u2019 cornerHere\u2019s what Ajit Pai of the F.C.C. said:\u201cAny federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\u201dIt lays bare the differences between two camps in the administration that have been present since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: economic nationalists and China hawks.Among those officials aggressively pushing the 5G network are two China hard-liners: Gen. Robert S. Spalding II, the senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council.Elsewhere in techThe recapMr. Weiss was one of Lazard\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking. He worked on InBev\u2019s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E. Master Blenders to JAB, the investment firm that later bought Keurig.)Since thenHe has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank. And he might yet start his own shop.Companies want to go public. But recent news suggests that many want to avoid the initial public offering process.Of course, there will still be I.P.O.s.: Uber, Dropbox and Airbnb are all working toward offerings. But if some companies can avoid the process, it appears they will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Set to Acquire the Next Generation of Subway Cars", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe agency that runs New York City\u2019s troubled subway said on Friday that it plans to spend close to $4 billion to buy over a thousand new train cars to modernize an aging fleet, a major investment meant to help remedy the delays and breakdowns that plague the system.New York will also join other cities around the world in deploying trains with open pathways between cars that can squeeze in more riders at a time when the subway struggles under the burden of accommodating nearly six million riders every day.The first cars, which will be manufactured under a contract between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Japanese company, Kawasaki, are scheduled to be delivered in July 2020.The contract, which still has to be approved by the M.T.A. board, is split into three phases. At the outset, the authority has committed about $1.45 billion to buy over 500 cars with an agreement to take steps to purchase more if the initial group performs well, for a total of 1,612 cars. The contract could ultimately pay Kawasaki more than $3.7 billion with the financing being provided by the federal Transit Administration. To win the contract, Kawasaki had to demonstrate it could deliver the first batch of cars 30 months from the day it is officially awarded, after the board votes later this month.\u201cWe know how important these new cars are to our system, to our customers,\u201d said Phil Eng, the chief operating officer for the M.T.A. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019ve had in the past is finding ways to get these cars into service sooner rather than later.\u201dThe award is a blow to the Canadian aerospace and train manufacturer, Bombardier, which was hired to build the city\u2019s last fleet of new cars, but delivered them two years behind schedule. Over the last two months, the first several dozen Bombardier R-179 cars began rolling on city tracks. \u201cThat is something that is unacceptable here,\u201d said Mr. Eng. The Kawasaki contract, he added, includes clauses that assess a penalty should the manufacturer fail to meet the schedule.As part of the agreement, the cars will be assembled entirely in America. They will be built in Kawasaki\u2019s plant in Yonkers in Westchester County, and another facility in Lincoln, Neb.\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d said John Samuelsen, international president of Transport Workers Union, which fought for the jobs component of the agreement. \u201cThe billions of dollars that transit agencies spend every year on new rail cars and equipment should to every extent possible be used to create jobs for American families, not jobs overseas.\u201dThe cars, which are designated as R211 , will be provided in three installments. Kawasaki will supply 535 at first, including 75 Staten Island Railway cars that will replace the borough\u2019s entire existing fleet of nearly 40-year-old cars. The R211 subway cars will gradually replace the authority\u2019s fleet of over 750 R46 cars, which were built between 1975 and 1978, and run on the A, F, R and C lines as well as the some shuttle.Aesthetically, they will have brighter lighting than existing cars, but the color scheme for seats and rails is yet to be decided. The doors on each car will be 58 inches wide, rather than the current 50 inches. Each car will have eight digital screens along the side, displaying information and advertisements.A batch of 20 trains will be the much-heralded open-gangway cars, which are similar in concept to accordionlike buses and are designed to hold more people. They are built in five-car units; a train will consist of two linked sets, for a total of 10 cars. If the first group proves successful, then the authority plans to obtain more, even perhaps, the entire rest of the order.\u201cI am very keen to introduce new, very customer-friendly, high amenity, very reliable rolling-stock into the New York system,\u201d said Andy Byford, the former chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission who this week became the president of New York City Transit, which operates the subway and buses. \u201cWe are determined to modernize the New York City subway, that\u2019s one of the prime reasons I\u2019ve come, and I\u2019m determined to push on with that.\u201dAs a result, one of the most striking changes will be invisible to commuters: R211 cars will be equipped with monitoring computers that will relay information in real-time about its performance \u2014 a health check of sorts \u2014 so that an ailing train can be diagnosed even before it has been hauled back to the repair shop.To further tackle the issue, the contract stipulates that the Kawasaki cars adhere to specific reliability requirements, as a warranty. The level of performance that the cars\u2019 critical systems \u2014 such as doors and brakes, some of the largest contributors to delays \u2014 are required to demonstrate, based in part in how many miles they travel before breaking down, is more than double that of past contracts, according to the agency. If they fail to meet those levels, Kawasaki itself must shoulder the cost of any repairs, instead of the authority.The Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, praised the introduction of gangway cars, which have been slow to catch on in America. Toronto in 2011 became the first North American city to adopt them and now more than 80 such trains run on one of its lines. In New York City, the open gangway train are expected to fit 1,785 people, 55 more than an equivalent regular train.\u201cOur system is at capacity, addressing overcrowding helps with reliability,\u201d said Rebecca Bailin, the campaign manager for the Riders Alliance. \u201cSubways are delayed when people can\u2019t fit in them.\u201d But, she added, a slew of new trains does not get at the root causes of the subway\u2019s ills, including the crumbling infrastructure, outdated signaling systems that have to be replaced as well as new ways to pay for it all.And open gangway cars are not without their complications: If one car breaks, the entire train set has to be taken out of service. It also remains to be seen how they are able to handle New York City\u2019s sharply curving tracks, Mr. Byford said. Nevertheless, he added, \u201cI\u2019m a big fan. I think people will love them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Corruption and Cronyism in Banking Fueled Iran\u2019s Protests", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI got angry and swore at them,\u201d Mr. Asgari said recently, referring to Caspian, adding that he joined other jilted depositors in demonstrations that he had learned about on social media.The cascade of defaults, economists say, was not just the result of risky banking practices, but also a case study in official corruption \u2014 a major reason Iranians found their losses so infuriating. Adding to their outrage, Iranian officials made a series of statements blaming the victims for not being more careful with their money.\u201cIf there is a little less corruption, our problems will be solved,\u201d demonstrators have chanted at protests against the financial failures.Many of the failing institutions sank the money into speculative investments during a real estate bubble, lent to well-connected friends or charged usurious interest rates to desperate borrowers. Now, regulators have quietly steered many of the companies into mergers with larger banks to try to absorb their losses, but that has created a worsening problem of bad loans and overvalued assets throughout the banking system.Economists say that as many as 40 percent of the loans carried on the books of Iranian banks may be delinquent.Even Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has acknowledged responsibility for the growing number of victims of \u201cproblematic financial institutions.\u201d\u201cThese appeals must be dealt with and heard out,\u201d he said this month. \u201cI myself am responsible; all of us must follow this approach.\u201dThe corruption underlying the bank failures has long been an open secret. In December, a lawmaker, Mahmoud Sadeghi, released a document listing the Top 20 debtors who had failed to meet payment deadlines for Sarmayeh Bank, which is co-owned by a pension fund for teachers. The loans totaled $1.9 billion, and almost all appeared to be held by well-known insiders.Among them was Hossein Hedayati, a business tycoon and former member of the Revolutionary Guards, whose swift rise was so conspicuous that websites speculated about the sources of his sudden wealth. The document released by the lawmaker showed that Mr. Hedayati owed $285 million, and in a television program discussing the loan, another lawmaker, Mohammad Hassannejad, accused Mr. Hedayati of using a series of front companies to swing the loans and hide his role.Mr. Hedayati dialed in to the program, sputtering with rage; he denied borrowing from Sarmayeh and threated to \u201csue everyone,\u201d but has yet to follow through on the threat.After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the new Islamic Republic initially nationalized all banks, among other industries. It also created a variety of semiofficial holding companies controlled by the supreme leader, senior clerics or top military commanders. Over the years, many of the companies have evolved into sprawling conglomerates with major roles in even the ostensibly private economy.Clerics controlled religious foundations, called bonyads, that acquired commercial businesses. The largest of these, under the supreme leader, now makes up \u201c15 to 20 percent\u201d of the Iranian economy, according to an estimate by Hooshang Amirahmadi, an economist at Rutgers University who studies Iran. The elite Revolutionary Guard Corps controls a separate business empire.All the semiofficial holding companies have major advantages over private businesses in favorable access to capital, tax exemptions and political connections. And most or all of them have been plagued by accusations of inefficiency and mismanagement, in addition to insider dealing and other forms of corruption.Government reformers took steps to open up the banking business in the late 1990s and early 2000s, first by allowing religious foundations to set up loosely regulated savings and loans, ostensibly to serve the poor. The opening of private banks or the sale of shares in state banks soon followed.Among those financial institutions not directly controlled by these semiofficial bodies, the largest were usually run by individuals close to the same ruling elite, economists and diplomats say. They say that made it almost impossible for even the best-intentioned regulators to police the banks.The outsize returns promised by the banks and financial institutions lured capital that might better have gone to more productive uses, contributing to an economic downturn brought on, in part, by international sanctions imposed because of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Economists say that helps explain why most sectors of the Iranian economy outside the oil industry have yet to reap the benefits of the sanctions\u2019 repeal after the nuclear deal with the West.When lenders began to fail over the past few years, some senior Iranian officials tried to blame the borrowers, noting that many of the institutions were not officially licensed or guaranteed by the Central Bank.\u201cHow many times do you want to be bitten by a snake from the same hole?\u201d asked Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, a government spokesman, in an interview with the semiofficial news agency ILNA. Officials, he added, \u201ctold people several times but still they invested.\u201dMohammad Bagher Olfat, a Muslim cleric who is deputy chief of the judiciary, said that jilted depositors shared the blame with the lenders and regulators.\u201cYes, their money is gone, but they shouldn\u2019t expect the state to pay for their loss,\u201d he told the same news agency.In that context, the release of a draft budget that proposed raising outlays for clerics\u2019 pet projects and their families while eliminating the $12 a month cash subsidy provided to 30 million Iranians and raising fuel prices by 50 percent provided the spark that ignited the protests.They were upset to read about the $2 million \u2014 a 9 percent increase \u2014 that went to the son of the late Ayatollah Shahab ad-Din Muhammad Hussein Marashi Najafi to maintain his father\u2019s library, and the $15 million provided to the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, to publish the late leader\u2019s works.But some Iranians had already had enough. When Mr. Asgari was told in May that Caspian was closing without repaying his $42,000, he stepped outside and checked the encrypted social media app Telegram, where he found many groups for \u201cproperty losers\u201d victimized by Caspian and others like it.\u201cWe organized demonstrations in front of their head office,\u201d he said. Bowing to pressure, the government eventually refunded most of his original deposit but deducted the three interest payments he had received. (The government has since tried to block the use of Telegram in Iran.)Arash Tajaloo, 42, a civil engineer in Tehran, deposited a total of $414,000 with Caspian in the spring of 2016, when the institution was promising him interest payments of as much as 30 percent a year. Caspian started restricting his withdrawals after six months, offering the excuse of temporary technical problems.\u201cThey kept buying time, week after week,\u201d he said in an interview over Telegram.A lawsuit he filed was consolidated into a class action, \u201cgiven the large number of cases,\u201d he said. He says he joined protests in front of Parliament, the presidential palace and the residence of the supreme leader, and took part in a 33-day sit-in outside the courthouse.Caspian has promised to repay him about one-eighth of his original deposits, he said, but he has yet to see any of it.\u201cWe still have not received either our deposits or the interest on them for 13 months,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is South Korea Spooking the Global Bitcoin Market?", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe question is how real that threat might be.The government has expressed alarm. Officials, including the prime minister, have voiced concerns about an irrational frenzy. Raids by South Korean tax officials on digital currency exchanges this week have added to unease among investors.\u201cI am so nervous,\u201d said Kim Su-jin, a 50-year-old investor in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies who works as a bookkeeper at a women\u2019s clothing store in Seoul. \u201cMy coins could become trash if the government closes the exchanges.\u201dThe country\u2019s justice minister, Park Sang-ki, said this week that his ministry was drawing up a bill that would include the complete shutdown of virtual currency exchanges, adding that trading in the tokens \u201chas started to resemble gambling and speculation.\u201dThe most popular Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea process hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions every day. Trades using the Korean won account for around 5 percent of the volume of Bitcoin trades globally.At the very least, a ban would not be passed quickly: Securing a majority of votes in the National Assembly could take months.\u201cThe power of the individual investor is very huge in South Korea,\u201d said Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Hashed, a fund in Seoul that invests in virtual currency projects.The National Tax Service in South Korea declined to comment on why its representatives visited two major virtual currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, this week. But Shin Won-hee, head of operations at Coinone, said the tax authorities had wanted to check that the company had paid proper corporate tax.Bithumb told local news outlets that it was cooperating with the investigation.Separately, the police in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, have been investigating whether Coinone is operating \u201ca gambling site.\u201d The company had previously allowed investors to buy and sell virtual currencies on margin \u2014 that is, to place bets using borrowed money. But Mr. Shin said that Coinone decided in November to stop allowing margin trading as government officials began expressing concerns about market overheating.Mr. Park, the justice minister, said this week that the depths of South Korean investors\u2019 irrationality was reflected in the high premium \u2014 around 30 percent on Friday \u2014 that they paid on Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea over those elsewhere.Experts said that South Korean prices were also higher because the exchanges there did not allow trading by foreigners. That prevents overseas investors from selling Bitcoin in South Korea to profit from \u2014 and thereby help narrow \u2014 the price gap.South Korea\u2019s isolation from the global market leads investors at home to seek better prices elsewhere. \u201cWe are seeing Koreans taking loads of cash to buy Bitcoin in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia where Bitcoin is cheaper,\u201d said Hong Ki-hoon, professor of economics at Hongik University in Seoul.With so many conflicting signals from the government, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us think that these strong measures will actually be implemented,\u201d said Hyon Hae-in, a 35-year-old Bitcoin investor.\u201cLongtime investors see times like these as opportunities to trade,\u201d she said.Su-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and Raymond Zhong from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Donors Plead Guilty, but the Mayor Is Not Charged. Why?", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother donor pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud that included making political contributions in exchange of official action \u2014 and again, no charges for the mayor.The outcome has led some, including the WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer, to an obvious question.\u201cHow can someone be guilty of giving you a bribe and you not be guilty of taking it?\u201d Mr. Lehrer asked Mr. de Blasio on Friday.\u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear,\u201d the mayor said. But it wasn\u2019t.\u201cThis man did a lot of bad things in a lot of places,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said of Harendra Singh, a restaurateur who pleaded guilty to bribing the mayor. \u201cI\u2019m someone who never did, never would be involved in such an effort.\u201dBut in fact, Mr. de Blasio sought a contribution from Mr. Singh for his 2013 campaign, and then took numerous steps to help him get a favorable resolution in a protracted legal dispute he had with the city. The dispute involved millions of dollars in back rent and other charges that Mr. Singh owed in relation to a restaurant that he operated on city property.\u201cIt was thoroughly looked at, and there\u2019s a reason there were no charges brought because there was nothing there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio continued.Charges were brought against Mr. Singh, who, in a federal courtroom in 2016, secretly pleaded guilty to conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud in relation to tens of thousands of dollars in donations to the mayor\u2019s campaign. The plea was sealed until this week when it was made public as part of an unrelated pending corruption case on Long Island.The guilty plea was won by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District, which covers Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ties to Mr. Singh and several other campaign donors for whom he did favors were investigated by federal prosecutors in the Southern District, which includes Manhattan. They decided not to bring charges against Mr. de Blasio or his aides \u2014 but in doing so, last year, they issued a cutting statement raising questions about the mayor\u2019s ethics and making it clear he had done favors for donors.A similar case arose with the other donor, Jona S. Rechnitz, who made campaign contributions and gave money to a nonprofit group the mayor created to support his City Hall agenda.Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty in 2016 to honest services wire fraud. But although Mr. de Blasio solicited and received the donations and made it possible for Mr. Rechnitz to get special access, he was not charged.Several factors were in play.The United States Supreme Court set a much higher bar for public corruption cases with its 2016 ruling that reversed the bribery conviction of the former Virginia governor, Bob McDonnell. In the ruling, the court determined that making introductions or setting up meetings, even in exchange for gifts or financial benefits, did not constitute a crime.Furthermore, bribery cases against elected officials based on campaign contributions are rare, the legal experts said. That is in part because the Supreme Court has drawn a clear distinction between a legal contribution to a political campaign and other kinds of payments like cash, gifts or other benefits that in effect go into the pocket of a public servant.It may also have been that it was simply easier for prosecutors to bring charges against the person buying access, because the men admitted guilt, in the face of abundant evidence, as part of plea deals in which they agreed to cooperate with the government against other defendants. Mr. Singh is a witness in corruption trials on Long Island; Mr. Rechnitz testified against a labor official who was accused of steering millions of dollars of officers\u2019 retirement funds into a hedge fund in exchange for promised kickbacks.Nonetheless, the outcomes seem incongruous: Mr. Singh pleaded guilty to bribing the mayor, charges brought by the Eastern District prosecutors, while those in the Southern District examined the same conduct and chose not to charge the mayor. But current and former federal prosecutors and defense lawyers said there could be several explanations.\u201cWhen there\u2019s an allegation that money has changed hands,\u201d said Paul J. Fishman, who served as the United States attorney in New Jersey for more than seven years, \u201csometimes the issue is whether the transaction actually occurred. But often it\u2019s not about that, and instead is about what the people were thinking at the time that they made that exchange.\u201dBut in Mr. Singh\u2019s case, the charges to which he pleaded guilty, detailed in a court document, amounted to more than just his admissions that he had received benefits from Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration in return for his contributions; they were the conclusions not only of the prosecutors handling the matter, but also of their boss, Robert L. Capers, then the United States attorney for the Eastern District, who signed the document.That included a July 2015 meeting in which Emma Wolfe, a top aide to Mr. de Blasio, met with Mr. Singh to negotiate a settlement, which contained more favorable terms than he had previously been offered.\u201cNothing that he described as having happened, happened, period,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on WNYC. But the meeting did happen, and so did City Hall\u2019s other efforts on behalf of Mr. Singh, which have emerged.Anthony M. LaPinta, Mr. Singh\u2019s lawyer, disputed the mayor\u2019s assertion. \u201cMr. Singh pleaded guilty to his crimes because he is, in fact, guilty of those crimes,\u201d Mr. LaPinta said in a emailed statement.Advertisement"}

But during his first year in office, he did almost nothing on that front \u2014 possibly because corporate America managed to inform him that it has invested a lot of money based on the assumption that we would continue to honor Nafta and other trade agreements, and would lose bigly if he broke them.If this seems like a flimsy justification for an action that will significantly raise consumer prices, that\u2019s because it is.

And here\u2019s the thing: Everything we know about the Trump administration suggests that hurting renewables is actually a good thing from its point of view. As I said, this is an administration of dirty old men.Over the past decade or so there has been a remarkable technological revolution in energy production. Part of that revolution has involved the rise of fracking, which has made natural gas cheap and abundant. But there have also been stunning reductions in the cost of solar and wind power.Whatever the specific motivations, the administration\u2019s first significant trade policy move is stunningly boneheaded. You shouldn\u2019t even call it protectionism, since its direct effect will be to destroy far more jobs than it creates. Plus it\u2019s bad for the environment. So much winning!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russell Simmons Sued Over Rape Accusation", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Los Angeles woman has accused the music mogul Russell Simmons of sexual battery and rape in a civil lawsuit filed against him Wednesday in federal court there.Mr. Simmons has strenuously denied any misconduct. In a statement Wednesday, he called the lawsuit allegations \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d He added: \u201cI look forward to having my day in court \u2014 where, unlike the court of public opinion, I will have the ability to make use of fair processes that ensure that justice will be done and that the full truth will be known.\u201dIn the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Jennifer Jarosik, 37, said she first met Mr. Simmons, 60, in New York in 2006, and that they became friends based on a mutual interest in meditation, yoga and veganism. Ms. Jarosik was interested in interviewing Mr. Simmons for a documentary she was making; Mr. Simmons agreed and said he would help her produce and finance the film, which they began working on, the complaint says. Ms. Jarosik said that, in 2016, she went to Mr. Simmons\u2019s home in Los Angeles, at his invitation, and he asked her to have sex. She said no. He became aggressive, the complaint alleges, and pushed her onto the bed; when she tried to push back, he knocked her to the floor and raped her, she says.She described the incident to the director and editor of her film at the time, the complaint says. It interrupted her work and led her to feel humiliation, fear and depression, for which she needed medication, the complaint says, in the request for damages.Perry C. Wander, a lawyer for Ms. Jarosik, said in a telephone interview Thursday that Ms. Jarosik also alleges that Mr. Simmons assaulted her in his home in New York in 2011, and that she intends to file a criminal complaint with the New York Police Department, which has been investigating several sexual misconduct complaints by other women against Mr. Simmons, as well as the Los Angeles police.Mr. Wander said that, until other women began describing their experiences with Mr. Simmons, Ms. Jarosik felt guilty about her encounters. \u201cShe was blaming herself,\u201d he said.Joe Coscarelli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It concluded that, \u201cdespite all unwarranted allegations, Pakistan cannot act in haste and will remain committed to playing a constructive role towards an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s post and Pakistan\u2019s response point to a nose-dive in the relationship between the United States and Pakistan, which has become deeply strained in recent months.In several recent high-profile visits, United States officials have repeatedly expressed frustration over Pakistan\u2019s failure to confront terrorist networks within its borders. But Pakistani officials say they have done more than enough.Privately, Pakistani officials say that the United States has failed in Afghanistan and is looking to blame Pakistan for that failure. Pakistani officials continue to deny that militants, especially those with the Haqqani network, which is allied with the Afghan Taliban and is responsible for many lethal attacks inside Afghanistan, have havens inside Pakistan.During a news conference last week, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s military, warned the United States against taking any unilateral antiterrorism action on Pakistani soil.Pakistan\u2019s military says it is working to build a fence along the Afghan border to curb infiltration. Officials also say that the estimated 2.7 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan need to be repatriated because their presence in the country complicates action against Taliban militants. Pakistani officials say fighters from the Taliban and other groups are able to hide in settlement camps by mingling with refugees.Pakistani officials also insist that Mr. Trump has his figures wrong, taking aim at his claim that the United States had \u201cfoolishly\u201d given it $33 billion since 2002.\u201cAbout $14 billion of that $33 billion was part of coalition support fund, which was compensation for services rendered,\u201d said Miftah Ismail, an adviser to the prime minister on finance, revenue and economic affairs, in an interview. \u201cOur billings were for $22 billion and we got only $14 billion. So we think the U.S. owes us $8 billion.\u201dMr. Ismail said the $255 million was a tiny fraction of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cSo, not a great deal of money.\u201dPakistani leadership was also comforted by a strong expression of support from China.Geng Shuang, the spokesman of China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said during a news conference on Tuesday said that \u201cPakistan has made great efforts and sacrifices for combating terrorism and made prominent contributions to the cause of international counterterrorism, and the international community should fully recognize this.\u201dWhile there was characteristic chest thumping on television talk shows, with guests lampooning the United States threats, some critics said there was indeed a need for greater introspection in Pakistan.\u201cThere is a need to fill the gaps in our policy,\u201d Muhammad Nawaz Chaudhry, a former Pakistani ambassador, said in an interview. \u201cWe cannot take the bilateral relationship to a dead end.\u201d\u201cWe are living in denial,\u201d he added. \u201cThe world, especially the United States, is not accepting our narrative.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet on Monday, a charity run by Mr. Saeed, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, was prohibited from collecting donations, according to a government order. But Mr. Chaudhry said that the order was just playing to the gallery.\u201cRather than becoming belligerent,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to be realistic and go with the world opinion.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Says U.S. Troops to Stay in Syria Beyond Battle With ISIS", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American troops will remain in Syria long after their fight against the Islamic State to ensure that neither Iran nor President Bashar al-Assad of Syria take over areas that have been newly liberated with help from the United States, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday.\u201cWe cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said during a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University near San Francisco. \u201cISIS has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.\u201dISIS is another name for the Islamic State.There were roughly 2,000 American troops in Syria last month, a mix of engineering units that build fortifications and Special Operations units that fight and train with local militias. Additionally, American military contractors in Syria help demine recaptured areas as the Islamic State is pushed back.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s comments were the first time a senior Trump administration official pledged to keep American troops in Syria well after the current battle ends. They also marked another step in President Trump\u2019s gradual evolution from a populist firebrand who promised to extricate the United States from foreign military entanglements to one who is grudgingly accepting many of the national security strategies he once derided.Mr. Obama won the White House in 2008 in part by promising to wind down the war in Iraq, and agreed to only a limited role in the 2011 airstrikes in Libya. Those decisions have haunted the military officers who now serve in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet and, in turn, have led to the administration\u2019s deepening military involvement in Afghanistan.He did not say whether other countries would help pay for the American military effort or other stabilization costs, even though Mr. Trump also promised during the presidential campaign that he would compel Germany and Persian Gulf nations to contribute financing \u201cbecause they have the money.\u201dMr. Tillerson said the military commitment to Syria was \u201cconditions-based\u201d and not indefinite. But he underscored that it would take time to foster a democratically elected government in Syria that he \u2014 like the Obama administration \u2014 said would require Mr. Assad\u2019s departure from power.\u201cResponsible change may not come as immediately as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,\u201d he said.Analysts raised concerns that there might never come a time when withdrawal would be deemed appropriate.\u201cYes, we can leave troops there for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former ambassador and career diplomat. \u201cBut is that 20 years, the way Afghanistan soon will be?\u201dThe United States has five key goals in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said. They are: ensuring that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda never re-emerge; supporting the United Nations-led political process; diminishing Iran\u2019s influence; making sure the country is free of weapons of mass destruction; and helping refugees to return after years of civil war.Mr. Tillerson conceded the steep challenge in fostering peace and democracy in Syria, where efforts by world leaders and diplomats across the Middle East and the West have fallen short.He is working on a reorganization of the State Department, which so far has resulted in steep budget cuts and the departure of some of its most senior diplomats, including some top Middle East experts. Such expertise is vital to any military or diplomatic ventures in the Middle East, where contradictory and crosscutting rivalries are endemic.On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag of Turkey said his country had reached the limit of its patience regarding developments along its borders. Mr. Tillerson sought to allay the concerns, saying that \u201cany interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any neighboring states.\u201dNawaf Khalil, a former official in the Syrian Kurdish local government who now works at a German research institute, praised Mr. Tillerson\u2019s speech as \u201ca clear American vision on the situation in Syria.\u201d\u201cStressing the importance of diplomacy, as well as strengthening U.S. allies in the region, is the needed approach at this stage,\u201d Mr. Khalil said. He added: \u201cIt finally seems like the White House and the Pentagon are on the same page in Syria.\u201dThere was no immediate comment from the Syrian government, but it has consistently rejected any American interference as illegal and counterproductive.Anne Barnard and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First State of the Union Address: A Call for Unity That Wasn\u2019t Always Heard That Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The centerpiece of the State of the Union address was what Mr. Trump called a \u201cdown the middle\u201d compromise on immigration, but Democrats booed some of his proposals.\u2022 The president called for bipartisan unity, citing infrastructure, but he gave no details and offered no road map for how to enact such an ambitious plan.\u2022 Also notable was what he left out. He made no mention of the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, nor did he acknowledge the #MeToo moment, even as female lawmakers wore black to mark the cultural moment.\u2022 Mr. Kennedy\u2019s use of Spanish in the middle of his speech signaled a different attitude toward immigrants than Mr. Trump\u2019s.The president promised an optimistic, bipartisan speech, and he largely avoided some of the negative imagery of past speeches. Gone was the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201dBut aside from a few offerings to the Democrats, mainly he appealed to enthusiastic Republicans. He did propose paid family leave and backed vocational schools and job training, winning grudging applause from Democrats.But his policy proposals were conservative: Keep open the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, burn coal, and above all, take on an immigration system that favors family reunification over skills-based migration.When he took office, President Trump painted a bleak picture of a country ravaged by economic turmoil, a landscape of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as he so memorably put it. A year later, he presented the nation on Tuesday night with a different narrative, one of a booming economy and a \u201cnew American moment.\u201dThe stock market has \u201csmashed one record after another.\u201d Retirement accounts have \u201cgone through the roof.\u201d Companies are \u201croaring back\u201d to the United States. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a long time,\u201d he exulted from the rostrum of the House chamber as he delivered his first formal State of the Union address. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming back.\u201dNever mind that in some fundamental ways the economy is growing no faster than it did at points during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Mr. Trump is at heart a salesman, and he rarely lets details get in the way of a good story. And by some measures, he has managed to convince many Americans, especially corporate leaders, that the economy really is surging in a way it has not for years.Read more of Peter Baker\u2019s analysis here \u00bbRepresentative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, emerged on the national stage to give the Democratic response \u2014 from \u201ca proud American city, built by immigrants.\u201dHere are some excerpts:\u201cIt would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.\u201d\u201cWe choose A Better Deal for all who call this country home. We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive. We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford. We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction. We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a full transcript \u00bbHe wasn\u2019t chosen as the official Democratic responder. But Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, spoke to his faithful with his own response to the State of the Union address.\u201cThe simple truth is that, according to virtually every poll, Donald Trump is the least popular president after one year in office of any president in modern American history. And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201dPresident Trump called for an infrastructure that would leverage federal dollars, state and local government contributions and private sector funds to total $1.5 trillion.But Democrats, who have pressed for infrastructure spending since Barack Obama was president, were not satisfied.\u201cPresident Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years. He expects states, localities, and the private sector to come up with $1.3 trillion on their own,\u201d said the office of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.Tonight\u2019s speech became the most Tweeted #SOTU or #Joint session address ever, passing last year\u2019s record of 3 million Tweets, according to Twitter.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump returned to a phrase he has used many times before: \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201dBut it has never been entirely clear what he means by it.Democrats were generally stone-faced for the president\u2019s address. But when Mr. Trump denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d some of them spoke out \u2014 with boos.For decades, immigrants who become American citizens have been able to sponsor their family members to join them from abroad. The \u201cfamily-based migration system\u201d has been relabeled \u201cchain migration\u201d by opponents, a new nomenclature not appreciated by many Democrats.\u201cI just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\u201d he said.Specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s order revokes an ill-fated January 2009 order signed by former President Barack Obama directing the government to close the prison within a year \u2014 a goal Mr. Obama failed to achieve. He did, however, winnow down the number of detainees, from the 242 he inherited from President Bush, to the 41 remaining there when Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Obama also refused to bring any new detainees to the prison. Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign that he intended to fill it back up \u201cwith some bad dudes,\u201d but to date his administration has not added any newly captured terrorism suspects to the inmate population, instead following the Obama approach of using law enforcement procedures and civilian courts to handle them.In August, Mr. Trump was on the cusp of signing it when he appointed the John Kelly, a retired marines general who formerly oversaw the prison operation as the leader of Southern Command, as his chief.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.In October, Mr. Trump declared that the crisis had become a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Overdoses killed about 64,000 Americans in 2016, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50.Mr. Trump mentioned the opioid crises again in his speech on Tuesday.\u201cWe must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting the number of overdose deaths in 2016. \u201cMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind having Congress enact legislation to update the 16-year-old statute that provides the legal basis for most counterterrorism operations around the world, making it explicitly cover the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS.\u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201dCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., in September 2001. It authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored or aided them \u2014 that is, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But in 2014, the Obama administration stretched it to justify combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without new Congressional sanction.That step was legally contentious because even though Islamic State grew out of an Al Qaeda affiliate, the two organizations had split and gone to war with each other. One of the reasons the Trump administration has not brought any Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo is warnings by legal specialists that doing so would risk giving a judge an opportunity to rule that the A.U.M.F. does not cover the group, jeopardizing the broader war.The Obama administration had fruitlessly asked Congress to enact a specific military force authorization for the Islamic State as well, while also saying it was legally unnecessary. But disputes over what it should say \u2014 including whether it should contain limits on duration, geographical scope, or the use of ground forces \u2014 prevented any consensus.President Trump praised Apple for a promise made earlier this month to invest $350 billion in the United States and create 20,000 domestic jobs over five years.But his speech was devoid of any mention of the role of technology in his vision for the economy. He called for legislation for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments for \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d He mentioned roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways. But he did not mention any of those funds going to the expansion and improvement of broadband internet networks.Trump talked about investing in work force development and job training. But instead of training for science, technology, engineering or math \u2014 or STEM \u2014 training, he talked about opening vocational schools.His words stood in contrast to State of the Union speeches by President Obama, who called for universal broadband for all Americans and the importance of spreading faster networks to close the digital divide.Yeah, there\u2019s the first lady\u2019s clothes or which big wig will fall asleep this year. But the State of the Union proceedings also have this bit of intrigue: Which cabinet official will earn the distinction of designated survivor?The mystery this time was solved two hours before Mr. Trump was due to give his address on Tuesday, when the White House said that the honor would go to Mr. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia and the president\u2019s agriculture secretary.Glamorous in title but, thankfully, not so far in practice, the designated survivor does not attend the president\u2019s address, and is poised to take over the commander-in-chief\u2019s responsibilities in the event that catastrophe strikes the Capitol and wipes out most of the government. If tradition holds, Mr. Perdue will be watching from a distant and secure location while Mr. Trump speaks.\u2014 Katie RogersHours before his first State of the Union address, President Trump told a group of news anchors at a lunch in the White House that his first year in office has taught him that the biggest difference between excelling in business and performing his current job is that governing takes compassion.\u201cI\u2019ve really learned a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump told the reporters, according to a partial transcript of an off-the-record lunch released publicly by the White House. \u201cIn doing what I\u2019m doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money \u2014 such as immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, who is expected to use Tuesday night\u2019s speech to call for a bipartisan compromise that pairs legal status for a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children with funding for a border wall, tougher enforcement and new restrictions on legal immigration, recently said he was hoping to sign a \u201cbill of love.\u201dThat tone is sharply at odds with the president\u2019s approach on immigration thus far, which has included a travel ban against visitors from six countries, slashing refugee resettlement and revoking temporary protected status for people from El Salvador and Haiti. He has been more publicly conflicted about his decision last fall to rescind DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has given legal status to certain people brought illegally to the United States as children.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned maybe more than anything else: You have to \u2014 you govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before.\u201dHere\u2019s a peek at the transcript:\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisDemocratic lawmakers have decided to put a face on the difficult negotiations happening in Congress over the fate of young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. They are bringing scores of such \u201cDreamers\u201d to the Capitol for Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address.Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s guest, Melody Klingenfuss, is just one of them. Born in Guatemala, she was brought to Los Angeles when she was 9, earned a degree in communications and political science from California State University, Los Angeles, a master\u2019s degree from the University of Southern California, then won protection under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2015.\u201cTonight, when President Trump looks into the gallery during his State of the Union, he will see the dignity, courage and patriotism of dozens of Dreamers,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.But there is a flip side. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, has called the cops.So much for the warm welcome.Mr. Gosar\u2019s fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake, didn\u2019t take kindly to his colleague\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri who faces a difficult re-election campaign this year, set the tone with a blast on Twitter.That concern is bipartisan, at least in some quarters of the Republican Party. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was flummoxed by the administration\u2019s decision:\u201cThat bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate. It was not partisan in the least,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cThe one thing we know for sure already is the Russians did attempt to meddle in our elections, and not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year, because we know that the Russians have not given up on their disinformation campaign and their attempt to sow discord in this country and also to undermine faith in democratic institutions.\u201dTestifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department had followed instructions under the sanctions law and drawn up a list of Russian targets for sanctions. An imposition of sanctions could still follow.President Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and one of the authors of the sanctions legislation, declined to criticize the administration\u2019s actions. He did say, \u201cI look forward\u201d to the implementation of the sanctions.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin spent part of the morning before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech tamping down expectations about a secretive Republican memo that some House members have claimed contains evidence that could undercut the Russia investigation.That was not enough to quiet the most ardent proponents of the notion that federal law enforcement agents have conspired to bring down the Trump White House. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, called on the president to release the memo during the State of the Union.\u2014 Nicholas FandosPresident Trump loves to brag about the stock market setting record highs, but on the day of his first State of the Union speech, the market isn\u2019t loving him back \u2014 for reasons that probably have nothing to do with him or his policies.As of midafternoon, Mr. Trump had not tweeted about the market news.\u2014 James TankersleyOne constant refrain from White House officials when it comes to State of the Union speeches is this: the president was personally involved in drafting the speech.It was no different on Tuesday as officials in President Trump\u2019s White House described a \u201crobust,\u201d monthslong process in which Mr. Trump actively reviewed drafts of the speech and repeatedly made suggestions of phrases or anecdotes or words that he wanted to be used when he delivers the address.The speech was assembled over weeks, with agency heads and cabinet secretaries offering suggestions on accomplishments that the president should highlight or priorities he could push for. Speech-writing meetings at the White House with Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top speechwriter, John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and others were coordinated by Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary.Aides said that in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump received printed drafts of the speech \u2014 with ample margins \u2014 and used a black felt marker to make additions, deletions and changes. They said he often edited the drafts in the Oval Office, but sometimes would come down from the residence in the morning with a new draft that he had marked up overnight.\u2014 Michael D.

He could come out with a very traditional State of the Union and for a normal president, that would help set the agenda for at least, you know, maybe a few weeks. In Washington, you\u2019d plan other policy speeches to follow up on certain aspects of the State of the Union and there would be an entire rollout around the State of the Union.I think with this president, you would expect it would be much shorter. Even if there is a surprise \u2014 Oh, look, Donald Trump sounded presidential \u2014 but then the next day there could be a tweet, and then, you know, work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by a 280 characters.That\u2019s my one prediction. In some sense, whatever he ultimately says is overshadowed by a 280-character tweet.\u201d\u201cThe power of that podium is not just the audience watching. It\u2019s the sense that the president is somebody who speaks for the whole country. And the way he has governed over the past year has been so filled with denunciations and racial division and flat-out falsehoods that he doesn\u2019t have a lot in the tank when it comes to credibility for anybody who isn\u2019t already an avid supporter.Often, these State of the Union addresses can be a time when the panoply of the presidency can give whoever the president is, sort of, a second chance with a lot of people. I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the case here.\u201dCody Keenan, chief speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, also had concerns:\u201cPresident Obama always wanted to close his State of the Union addresses with an argument about the state of our politics. You know, what can we do to make them better? What can we do to be better citizens? I always remember reading criticisms the next day, certainly from the left, saying why is he wasting real estate in the speech on that? It\u2019s never going to happen.\u201cWell, that\u2019s part of leadership. You know, there\u2019s a vision of what we should be, even if the odds of us getting there in one year or eight years is pretty slim.\u201d\u2014 Interviews by Michael D. ShearAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. to Use Children\u2019s Health Insurance as Lure for Averting Shutdown", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With little hope of an immigration agreement this week, Republicans in Congress are looking to head off a government shutdown this weekend by pairing another stopgap spending measure with long-term funding for the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, daring Democrats to vote no.The bill would leave in limbo hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But Democrats would still be left with a difficult political decision: withhold their votes unless the plight of such immigrants, known as Dreamers, is addressed and risk a government shutdown, or vote to keep the government open and fund the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for nearly nine million children.The bill would set up another possible showdown in mid-February, with government funding set to expire Feb. 16. But it would give lawmakers time to continue negotiations on immigration and long-term government funding levels.\u201cWith no imminent deadline on immigration and with bipartisan talks well underway, there is no reason why Congress should hold government funding hostage over the issue of illegal immigration,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Tuesday.The plan, put forth by House Republicans on Tuesday, does not extinguish the suspense on Capitol Hill this week. House Republican leaders may be unable to secure passage of the bill with solely Republican votes, since Republicans eager to increase military spending have been frustrated with stopgap spending measures.\u201cThis is just buying time,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best of the available bad choices.\u201dIn the meantime, Dreamers and those who support them protested at Republican lawmakers\u2019 offices.\u201cWe want to keep the government open,\u201d Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to be held hostage to do things that we think are contrary to the best interests of the American people.\u201dIf Republican leaders can push the bill through the House this week, the Senate \u2014 where at least nine Democratic votes will be needed \u2014 is no sure bet. Some Democrats in that chamber \u2014 especially those considering a White House run \u2014 are expected to oppose any spending measure that does not protect the young undocumented immigrants.But Democrats up for re-election this year may be reluctant to oppose the bill and risk being blamed for a shutdown.Mr. McConnell said lawmakers have \u201cat least until March, at a minimum, and possibly even longer\u201d to reach a DACA agreement.In the bill to be passed this week to avoid a shutdown, Republicans would also suspend a tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act on medical devices, as well as a tax on providers of health insurance. In addition, it would delay the law\u2019s tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, known as the Cadillac tax.Having dithered for months, Congress has suddenly discovered a painless, cost-free way to extend the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. The bill would extend the program\u2019s funding for six years.\u201cI cannot see the Democrats voting against the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program,\u201d said Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, \u201cbut they\u2019ll be given that option in this funding bill.\u201dMembers of Congress responsible for the program said the new estimate should clear the way for a swift renewal of the program.The solution results almost entirely from a curious quirk in the way costs are estimated by the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 and from the unforeseen consequences of Congress\u2019s decision to eliminate a pillar of the Affordable Care Act, the penalties for people who go without health insurance.\u201cThanks to the repeal of the individual mandate tax, C.B.O. updated its score and gave us the momentum to push a long-term CHIP extension across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWe must stop holding CHIP hostage.\u201dFunds for the program lapsed at the end of September. Congress provided a short-term infusion of money last month, and the Trump administration has shuffled money among states to help those with the most urgent needs. Nevertheless, some states have informed families that their children could lose coverage because of delays and inaction by Congress.Extending CHIP for six years \u201cmay have no cost\u201d to the federal government, said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said that extending the program for 10 years would save $6 billion, according to the budget office. \u201cWith this news,\u201d he said, \u201csecuring kids\u2019 health care for the long-term should be a no-brainer.\u201dThe Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, created in 1997 with bipartisan support, is given credit for a big increase in the proportion of children who have coverage. But Republicans and Democrats have squabbled for months over how to pay for it.In the tax bill signed last month by Mr. Trump, Congress eliminated the penalties for people who go without health insurance, starting in 2019. The Congressional Budget Office, like many health policy experts, believes that healthier people will be less likely to obtain insurance, so that people who remain in the health law\u2019s marketplace \u2014 including children \u2014 will face higher premiums than they otherwise would.Extending CHIP saves money, the budget office said, because it would be less expensive for the government than the alternatives \u2014 if many of those children enroll in Medicaid or in government-subsidized marketplace coverage.The taxes on medical devices, health insurance providers and high-cost employer-sponsored health plans were all imposed by the Affordable Care Act, to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the law. All three would have been repealed under the bill passed last year by the House to dismantle that law.Many Democrats have joined Republicans in opposing the device tax, which they describe as a threat to innovative medical technology. The bill would suspend it during two years, 2018 and 2019.Health insurance companies have strenuously opposed the tax on insurance providers, saying the additional costs are generally passed on to consumers, businesses, state governments and taxpayers. The bill would suspend it for 2019.The \u201cCadillac tax\u201d is meant to help rein in the cost of employee health benefits. Instead of taking effect in 2020, it would be delayed until 2022.Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexican Governor Says His State Is Being Punished for Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 A Mexican governor said Monday that the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was denying his state vital resources in order to squash a corruption investigation that reaches the highest ranks of the nation\u2019s governing party.The governor, Javier Corral, was promised millions of dollars last December by the federal government to help fill budget shortfalls in his state, Chihuahua, which is in the midst of a financial crisis. But the federal Ministry of Finance has refused to deposit some of the funds, Mr. Corral said at a news conference on Monday in Mexico City.\u201cWe were taken by surprise,\u201d Mr. Corral told a crowd of reporters gathered at a hotel. \u201cThey could have sugarcoated it, but they said it clearly and outright.\u201dAnother attendee at the meeting, Mr. Corral\u2019s state finance chief, backed up the governor\u2019s version of events in an interview with The New York Times.In a written statement the minister of finance claimed that nearly $4 million dollars was not paid to the state partly because of an incorrect bank account and partly because of a lack of available funds.The ministry declined to comment on the accounts of the meeting.President Pe\u00f1a Nieto told local reporters that the news conference held by Governor Corral, as well as the accusations he made, seemed like \u201cpolitical act.\u201dThe case in question has the potential to be explosive: State prosecutors in Chihuahua are examining the alleged embezzlement of more than $10 million in public funds used to finance the campaigns of candidates from the president\u2019s political party, according to hundreds of documents and testimony by former state officials reviewed by The Times.The case has already ensnared more than two dozen people, including an ally of the president and a high-ranking member of his party, Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, who is accused of operating the embezzlement scheme nationwide.The arrest has rattled officials in Mexico City, where the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, presides over the federal government. Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez was a top financial aide to the former president of the party, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, a major power broker who has also been described as the mastermind of the embezzlement scheme, according to the documents reviewed by The Times.The investigation has the potential to derail the party\u2019s ambitions to maintain power in this year\u2019s presidential elections. Corruption and impunity have been stains on the legacy of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is suffering some of the worst approval ratings in a quarter century. As the nation hurtles toward elections this summer, analysts say the PRI is growing desperate to keep a lid on any potential corruption scandals.It is in this environment that Mr. Corral, a governor who hails from an opposition party, has set out on his crusade against corruption. Now, the governor appears to be gambling with his state\u2019s finances to preserve his investigation.\u201cThere is a clear intention to financially strangle the state,\u201d Mr. Corral said.On Monday, the governor cried foul publicly, claiming that the federal government had reneged on its commitment to Chihuahua. According to documents reviewed by The Times, the federal Ministry of Finance signed four agreements in December with officials in Chihuahua promising to transfer roughly $5 million to the state by the end of the month.As the year\u2019s end drew near, Mr. Corral said, the money had not arrived. To date, only one of the agreed payments, for roughly $1 million, has been sent, state officials said.But when Mr. Corral called to inquire about the missing funds, he said, he was told a meeting in person was required to resolve the matter.Pressed for time, and with state salaries to pay, Mr. Corral said he had been forced to take a bank loan to cover the shortfall, a costly expenditure for a state with ailing finances. Several days passed before Mr. Corral said he was able to sit down with the minister of finance, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya.In the meeting, the governor said, Mr. Anaya at first told Mr. Corral that there was an issue with the funds because they appeared to be similar to those associated with the investigation underway in his state. Given the conflict, and Mr. Corral\u2019s position that previous transfers were used to embezzle funds, the minister was not sure how he could transfer the money, Mr. Corral recalled being told.The governor said he had stood firm, saying he believed they were two separate issues. One was the abuse of public funds for political purposes, which took place under the last governor, who was a star member of the president\u2019s party. The other involved the signed agreements from Dec. 14 promising nearly $5 million in federal funds to fill a state budget hole, according to the four agreements reviewed by The Times.Mr. Corral said that the finance minister then openly asked him about the investigation, and that he had told him the funds would not be transferred until there was more clarity about the case. Mr. Corral said he took the comment as direct pressure to halt the investigation in order to save his state.\u201cWe are aware we struck at the modus operandi of political corruption in Mexico, but the difference is that we have accounted for it technically and legally,\u201d Mr. Corral said. \u201cWe won\u2019t give up the fight to break the pact of impunity, regardless of the retaliation and punishment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret Memo Hints at a New Republican Target: Rod Rosenstein", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A secret, highly contentious Republican memo reveals that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein approved an application to extend surveillance of a former Trump campaign associate shortly after taking office last spring, according to three people familiar with it.The renewal shows that the Justice Department under President Trump saw reason to believe that the associate, Carter Page, was acting as a Russian agent. But the reference to Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s actions in the memo \u2014 a much-disputed document that paints the investigation into Russian election meddling as tainted from the start \u2014 indicates that Republicans may be moving to seize on his role as they seek to undermine the inquiry.The memo\u2019s primary contention is that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials failed to adequately explain to an intelligence court judge in initially seeking a warrant for surveillance of Mr. Page that they were relying in part on research by an investigator, Christopher Steele, that had been financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Democrats who have read the document say Republicans have cherry-picked facts to create a misleading and dangerous narrative. But in their efforts to discredit the inquiry, Republicans could potentially use Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s decision to approve the renewal to suggest that he failed to properly vet a highly sensitive application for a warrant to spy on Mr. Page, who served as a Trump foreign policy adviser until September 2016.A handful of senior Justice Department officials can approve an application to the secret surveillance court, but in practice that responsibility often falls to the deputy attorney general. No information has publicly emerged that the Justice Department or the F.B.I. did anything improper while seeking the surveillance warrant involving Mr. Page.Mr. Trump is now again telling associates that he is frustrated with Mr. Rosenstein, according to one official familiar with the conversations.It is difficult to judge whether Republicans\u2019 criticism of the surveillance has merit. Although House members have been allowed to view the Republican memo in a secure setting, both that memo and a Democratic one in rebuttal remain shrouded in secrecy. And the applications to obtain and renew the warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are even more closely held. Only a small handful of members of Congress and staff members have reviewed them.Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, whose staff wrote the memo, could vote as early as Monday, using an obscure House rule, to effectively declassify its contents and make it available to the public. Mr. Trump would have five days to try to block their effort, potentially setting up a high-stakes standoff between the president and his Justice Department, which opposes its immediate release.The White House has made clear to the Justice Department in recent days that it wants the Republican memo to be made public. Asked about the issue on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Marc Short, the White House\u2019s head of legislative affairs, said that if the memo outlined serious concerns, \u201cthe American people should know that.\u201dBut Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, warned in a letter last week to the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, that it would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d to release a memo drawing on classified information without official review and pleaded with the committee to consult the Justice Department. He said the department was \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing related to the FISA process.\u201dTo obtain the warrant involving Mr. Page, the government needed to show probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. Once investigators get approval from the Justice Department for a warrant, prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge, who decides whether to approve it.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment, and a spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to requests for comment. The people familiar with the contents of the memo spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details remained secret.A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said in a statement: \u201cThe president has been clear publicly and privately that he wants absolute transparency throughout this process. Based on numerous news reports, top officials at the F.B.I. have engaged in conduct that shows bias against President Trump and bias for Hillary Clinton. While President Trump has the utmost respect and support for the rank-and-file members of the F.B.I., the anti-Trump bias at the top levels that appear to have existed is troubling.\u201dMr. Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker who later founded an investment company in New York, had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years. In 2013, an investigation revealed that a Russian spy had tried to recruit him. Mr. Page was never charged with any wrongdoing, and he denied that he would ever have cooperated with Russian intelligence officials.In a speech on Friday in Norfolk, Va., Mr. Sessions appeared to wade into the debate. Without mentioning the Republican memo, he said that federal investigations must be free of bias, and that he would not condone \u201ca culture of defensiveness.\u201d While unfair criticism should be rebutted, he added, \u201cit can never be that this department conceals errors when they occur.\u201dKenneth P.

{"Headline": "Is This the Collusion We Were Waiting For?", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdam Schiff, Democrat of California and ranking member of the intelligence committee, told me that the committee\u2019s interest in the gun lobbying organization predated its meeting with Simpson. \u201cThe issue of whether there was an effort to either create a back channel through the N.R.A., or provide funding through the N.R.A., has been an issue of concern for the committee, and something we\u2019ve endeavored to look into with the limited resources we have,\u201d he said.If a relationship between the N.R.A., Trump and Russia exists, Torshin and Butina appear to be the nexus of it. Torshin helped create a Russian gun-rights group called Right to Bear Arms, and Butina runs it. The purpose of the group is ambiguous. Gun laws in Russia are strict, and if people close to Putin actually wanted to change them, creating a group alluding to America\u2019s Second Amendment seems like a weird way to do it. As Simpson said in his House testimony: \u201cVladimir Putin is not in favor of universal gun ownership for Russians. And so it\u2019s all a big charade, basically.\u201dIf so, the charade has been useful in building relationships between Putin allies and American conservatives. In 2015, Right to Bear Arms hosted a luxurious trip to Russia for N.R.A. leaders, where, according to McClatchy, they met with \u201ca senior Kremlin official and wealthy Russians.\u201d (Among the American delegation was former Sheriff David A. Clarke, the Trump supporter and Fox News regular.)As McClatchy reported, Erickson \u2014 the author of the \u201cKremlin Connection\u201d email \u2014 and Butina set up a limited liability company together in 2016. Erickson told McClatchy that the company was founded to provide Butina with money for her graduate studies, should she need it. That, noted McClatchy, is \u201can unusual way to use an L.L.C.\u201dSpeaking of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into the N.R.A., Liz Kennedy, the senior director of Democracy and Government Reform at the center, told me, \u201cIf this investigation in fact finds that illegal behavior occurred, this would really be the kind of illegal foreign spending that we were warning would happen.\u201d (During the Obama administration, Senate Democrats twice tried to pass the Disclose Act, which would require greater transparency about the sources of political donations; both times Republicans filibustered.)That $30 million, however, is just what the N.R.A. spent on the presidential race. It also backed other candidates, reportedly spending $55 million overall. The organization helped Republicans cement control of Congress. If it did so with Russia\u2019s assistance, the whole party is implicated.\u201cIn terms of what the Russians are doing in the United States, it\u2019s far broader than just the Trump campaign,\u201d Schiff told me. \u201cIn that sense when people think that the Russian intervention was just about tipping the scales to one of the candidates in 2016, they\u2019re thinking far too narrowly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Exiled Billionaire Whistle-Blower", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "FeatureFrom a penthouse on Central Park, Guo Wengui has exposed a phenomenal web of corruption in China\u2019s ruling elite \u2014 if, that is, he\u2019s telling the truth.Supported byGuo\u2019s New York apartment is a 9,000-square-foot residence along Central Park that he bought for $67.5 million in 2015. He sat in a Victorian-style chair, his back to a pair of west-facing windows, the sunset casting craggy shadows. A black-and-white painting of an angry-looking monkey hung on the wall to Guo\u2019s right, a hat bearing a star-and-wreath Soviet insignia on its head and a cigarette hanging from its lips. Guo had arrived dressed entirely in black, except for two silver stripes on each lapel. \u201cI have the best houses,\u201d he told me. Guo had picked his apartment for its location, its three sprawling balconies and the meticulously tiled floor in the entryway. He has the best apartment in London, he said; the biggest apartment in Hong Kong. His yacht is docked along the Hudson River. He is comfortable and, anyway, Guo likes to say that as a Buddhist, he wants for nothing. If it were down to his own needs alone, he would have kept his profile low. But he has a higher purpose. He is going to save China.Nothing in Guo\u2019s story is as straightforward as he would like it to seem. Guo is 47 years old, or 48, or 49. Although he has captured the attention of publications like The Guardian, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the articles that have run about him have offered only hazy details about his life. This is because his biography varies so widely from one source to the next. Maybe his name isn\u2019t even Guo Wengui. It could be Guo Wugui. There are reports that in Hong Kong, Guo occasionally goes by the name Guo Haoyun.When pressed, Guo claims a record of unblemished integrity in his business dealings, both in real estate and in finance (when it comes to his personal life, he strikes a more careful balance between virility and dedication to his family). \u201cI never took a square of land from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a penny of investment from the banks.\u201d If you accept favors, he said, people will try to exploit your weaknesses. So, Guo claims, he opted to take no money and have no weaknesses.Yet when Guo left China in 2014, he fled in anticipation of corruption charges. A former business partner had been detained just days before, and his political patron would be detained a few days afterward. In 2015, articles about corruption in Guo\u2019s business dealings \u2014 stories that he claims are largely fabrications \u2014 started appearing in the media. He was accused of defrauding business partners and colluding with corrupt officials. To hear Guo tell it, his political and business opponents used a national corruption campaign as a cover for a personal vendetta.Whatever prompted Guo to take action, his campaign came during an important year for China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. In October, the Communist Party of China (C.P.C.) convened its 19th National Congress, a twice-a-decade event that sets the contours of political power for the next five years. The country is in the throes of a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign, and Xi has overseen a crackdown on dissidents and human rights activists while increasing investment in censorship and surveillance. Guo has become a thorn in China\u2019s side at the precise moment the country is working to expand its influence, and its censorship program, overseas.In November 2017, the Tiananmen Square activist Wang Dan warned of the growing influence of the C.P.C. on university campuses in the United States. His own attempts to hold \u201cChina salons\u201d on college campuses had largely been blocked by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association \u2014 a group with ties to China\u2019s government. Around the same time, the academic publisher Springer Nature agreed to block access to hundreds of articles on its Chinese site, cutting off access to articles on Tibet, Taiwan and China\u2019s political elite. Reports emerged last year that China is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars quarterly to purchase ads on Facebook (a service that is blocked within China\u2019s borders). In Australia, concerns about China\u2019s growing influence led to a ban on foreign political donations.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling the United States they should really be careful,\u201d Guo said. China\u2019s influence is spreading, he says, and he believes his own efforts to change China will have global consequences. \u201cLike in an American movie,\u201d he told me with unflinching self-confidence. \u201cIn the last minutes, we will save the world.\u201dThe tight grip that the C.P.C. keeps on information may be nothing new, but China\u2019s leadership has been working hard to update the way it censors and broadcasts. People in China distrusted print and television media long before U.S. politicians started throwing around accusations of \u201cfake news.\u201d In 2016, President Xi Jinping was explicit about the arrangement, informing the country\u2019s media that it should be \u201csurnamed Party.\u201d Likewise, while the West has only recently begun to grapple with government-sponsored commenters on social media, China\u2019s government has been manipulating online conversations for over a decade.\u201cThey create all kinds of confusion,\u201d said Ha Jin, the National Book Award-winning American novelist born in China\u2019s Liaoning Province, and a vocal supporter of Guo. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what information you have and whether it\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know who are the informers, who are the agents.\u201dOnline, the C.P.C. controls information by blocking websites, monitoring content and employing an army of commenters widely known as the 50-cent party. The name was used as early as 2004, when a municipal government in Hunan Province hired a number of online commenters, offering a stipend of 600 yuan, or about $72. Since then, the 50-cent party has spread. In 2016, researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the University of California-San Diego estimated that these paid commenters generated 448 million social-media comments annually. The posts, researchers found, were conflict averse, cheerleading for the party rather than defending it. Their aim seemed not to be engaging in argument but rather distracting the public and redirecting attention from sensitive issues.In early 2017, Guo issued his first salvos against China\u2019s ruling elite through more traditional channels. He contacted a handful of Chinese-language media outlets based in the United States. He gave interviews to the Long Island-based publication Mingjing News and to Voice of America \u2014 a live event that was cut short by producers, leading to speculation that V.O.A. had caved to Chinese government pressure. He called The New York Times and spoke with reporters at The Wall Street Journal. It did not take long, however, before the billionaire turned to direct appeals through social media. The accusations he made were explosive \u2014 he attacked Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping\u2019s corruption czar, and Meng Jianzhu, the secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, another prominent player in Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign. He talked about Wang\u2019s mistresses, his business interests and conflicts within the party.In one YouTube video, released on Aug. 4, Guo addressed the tension between Wang and another anti-corruption official named Zhang Huawei. He recounted having dinner with Zhang when \u201che called Wang Qishan\u2019s secretary and gave him orders,\u201d Guo said. \u201cThink about what Wang had to suffer in silence back then. They slept with the same women, and Zhang knew everything about Wang.\u201d In addition, Guo said, Zhang knew about Wang\u2019s corrupt business dealings. When Zhang Huawei was placed under official investigation in April, Guo claimed, it was a result of a grudge.\u201cEveryone in China is a slave,\u201d Guo said in the video. \u201cWith the exception of the nobility.\u201dTo those who believe Guo\u2019s claims, they expose a depth of corruption that would surprise even the most jaded opponent of the C.P.C. \u201cThe corruption is on such a scale,\u201d Ha Jin said. \u201cWho could imagine that the czar of anti-corruption would himself be corrupt? It is extraordinary.\u201dGuo quickly resumed posting videos and encouraging his followers. His accusations continued to accumulate throughout 2017, and he recently started his own YouTube channel (and has yet to divorce his wife). His YouTube videos are released according to no particular schedule, sometimes several days in a row, some weeks not at all. He has developed a casual, talkative style. In some, Guo is running on a treadmill or still sweating after a workout. He has demonstrated cooking techniques and played with a tiny, fluffy dog, a gift from his daughter. He invites his viewers into a world of luxury and offers them a mix of secrets, gossip and insider knowledge.Wang Qishan, Guo has claimed, is hiding the money he secretly earned in the Hainan-based conglomerate HNA Group, a company with an estimated $35 billion worth of investments in the United States. (HNA Group denies any ties to Wang and is suing Guo.) He accused Wang of carrying on an affair with the actress Fan Bingbing. (Fan is reportedly suing Guo for defamation.) He told stories of petty arguments among officials and claimed that Chinese officials sabotaged Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing, in order to cover up an organ-harvesting scheme. Most of Guo\u2019s accusations have proved nearly impossible to verify.\u201cThis guy is just covered in question marks,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna who specializes in Chinese governance.The questions that cover Guo have posed a problem for both the United States government and the Western journalists who, in trying to write about him, have found themselves buffeted by the currents of propaganda, misinformation and the tight-lipped code of the C.P.C. elite. His claims have also divided a group of exiled dissidents and democracy activists \u2014 people who might seem like Guo\u2019s natural allies. For the most part, the democracy activists who flee China have been chased from their country for protesting the government or promoting human rights, not because of corruption charges. They tell stories of personal persecution, not insider tales of bribery, sex and money. And perhaps as a consequence, few exiled activists command as large an audience as Guo. \u201cI will believe him,\u201d Ha Jin said, \u201cuntil one of his serious accusations is proved to be false.\u201dDespite Guo\u2019s high-powered supporters and his army of online followers, one important mark of believability has continued to elude him. Western news organizations have struggled to find evidence that would corroborate Guo\u2019s claims. When his claims appear in print, they are carefully hedged \u2014 delivered with none of his signature charm and bombast. \u201cWhy do you need more evidence?\u201d Guo complained in his apartment. \u201cI can give them evidence, no problem. But while they\u2019re out spending time investigating, I\u2019m waiting around to get killed!\u201dThe story continues into Guo\u2019s pre-teenage years, when he moved back to his hometown in Shandong Province. He met his wife and married her when he was only 15, she 14. They moved to Heilongjiang, where they started a small manufacturing operation, taking advantage of the early days of China\u2019s economic rise, and then to Henan. Guo got his start in real estate in a city called Zhengzhou, where he founded the Zhengzhou Yuda Property Company and built the tallest building the city had seen so far, the Yuda International Trade Center. According to Guo, he was only 25 when he made this first deal.The string of businesses and properties that Guo developed provide some of the confirmable scaffolding of his life. No one disputes that Guo went on to start both the Beijing Morgan Investment Company and Beijing Zenith Holdings. Morgan Investment was responsible for building a cluster of office towers called the Pangu Plaza, the tallest of which has a wavy top that loosely resembles a dragon, or perhaps a precarious cone of soft-serve ice cream. Guo is in agreement with the Chinese media that in buying the property for Pangu Plaza, he clashed with the deputy mayor of Beijing. The dispute ended when Guo turned in a lengthy sex tape capturing the deputy mayor in bed with his mistress.Following the construction of Pangu Plaza in Beijing, Guo\u2019s life story becomes increasingly hard to parse. He started a securities business with a man named Li You. After a falling-out, Li was detained by the authorities. Guo\u2019s company accused Li and his company of insider trading. According to the 2015 article in Caixin, Li then penned a letter to the authorities accusing Guo of \u201cwrongdoing.\u201dAs this dispute was going on, China\u2019s anti-\u200bcorruption operation was building a case against Ma Jian. In Guo\u2019s telling, Ma had long been rumored to be collecting intelligence on China\u2019s leaders. As the anti-corruption campaign gained speed and officials like Wang Qishan gained power, Ma\u2019s well of intelligence started to look like a threat. It was Guo\u2019s relationship with Ma, the tycoon maintains, that made officials nervous. Ma was detained by the authorities in January 2015, shortly after Guo fled the country. Soon after Ma\u2019s detention, accounts began appearing in China\u2019s state-run media claiming that Ma had six Beijing villas, six mistresses and at least two illegitimate sons. In a 2015 article that ran in the party-run newspaper The China Daily, the writer added another detail: \u201cThe investigation also found that Ma had acted as an umbrella for the business ventures of Guo Wengui, a tycoon from Henan Province.\u201dIn the mix of spies, corrupt business dealings, mistresses and sex scandals, Guo has one more unbelievable story to tell about his past. It is one reason, he says, that he was mentally prepared to confront the leaders of the Communist Party. It happened nearly 29 years ago, in the aftermath of the crackdown on Tiananmen Square. According to Guo, he had donated money to the students protesting in the square, and so a group of local police officers came to find him at his home. An overzealous officer fired off a shot at Guo\u2019s wife \u2014 at which point Guo\u2019s younger brother jumped in front of the bullet, suffering a fatal wound. \u201cThat was when I started my plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your brother had been killed in front of your eyes, would you just forget it?\u201d Never mind the fact that it would take 28 years for him to take any public stand against the party that caused his brother\u2019s death. Never mind that the leadership had changed. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everyone in the Communist Party is bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system is bad. So what I need to oppose is the system.\u201dThe revelers decided to hold the event in the park partly for the available grills but also partly because the square in front of Guo\u2019s penthouse had turned dangerous. A few weeks earlier, some older women had been out supporting Guo when a group of Chinese men holding flags and banners showed up. At one point, the men wrapped the women in a protest banner and hit them. The park was a safer option. And the protesters had learned from Guo \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a live audience they were hoping for. The group would be filming the protest and posting it on social media. Halfway through, Guo would call in on someone\u2019s cellphone, and the crowd would cheer.Despite this show of support, Guo\u2019s claims have divided China\u2019s exiled dissidents to such an extent that on a single day near the end of September, two dueling meetings of pro-democracy activists were held in New York, one supporting Guo, the other casting doubt on his motivations. (\u201cThey are jealous of me,\u201d Guo said of his detractors. \u201cThey think: Why is he so handsome? Why are so many people listening to him?\u201d) Some of Guo\u2019s claims are verifiably untrue \u2014 he claimed in an interview with Vice that he paid $82 million for his apartment \u2014 and others seem comically aggrandized. (Guo says he never wears the same pair of underwear twice.) But the repercussions he is facing are real.In December, Guo\u2019s brother was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for destroying accounting records. The lawsuits filed against Guo for defamation are piling up, and Guo has claimed to be amassing a \u201cwar chest\u201d of $150 million to cover his legal expenses. In September, a new set of claims against Guo were made in a 49-page document circulated by a former business rival. For Ha Jin, Guo\u2019s significance runs deeper than his soap-opera tales of scandal and corruption. \u201cThe grand propaganda scheme is to suppress and control all the voices,\u201d Jin said. \u201cNow everybody knows that you can create your own voice. You can have your own show. That fact alone is historical.\u201d In the future, Jin predicts, there will be more rebels like Guo. \u201cThere is something very primitive about this, realizing that this is a man, a regular citizen who can confront state power.\u201dHo Pin, the founder of Long Island\u2019s Mingjing News, echoed Jin. Mingjing\u2019s reporters felt that covering Guo was imperative, no matter the haziness of the information. \u201cIn China, the political elite that Guo was attacking had platforms of their own,\u201d Ho said. \u201cThey have the opportunity, the power and the ability to use all the government\u2019s apparatus to refute and oppose Guo Wengui. So our most important job is to allow Guo Wengui\u2019s insider knowledge reach the fair, open-minded people in China.\u201d Still, people like Pei urge caution when dealing with Guo\u2019s claims. Even Guo\u2019s escape raises questions. Few others have slipped through the net of China\u2019s anti-corruption drive. \u201cHow could he get so lucky?\u201d Pei asked. \u201cHe must have been tipped off long before.\u201dAt the barbecue, a supporter named Ye Rong tucked one of his children under his arm and acknowledged that Guo\u2019s past life is riddled with holes. There was always the possibility that Guo used to be a thug, but Ye didn\u2019t think it mattered. The rules of the conflict had been set by the Communist Party. \u201cYou need all kinds of people to oppose the Chinese government,\u201d Ye said. \u201cWe need intellectuals; we also need thugs.\u201dGuo, of course, has his own opinions about his legacy. He warned of dark times for Americans and for the world, if he doesn\u2019t succeed in his mission to change China. \u201cI am trying to help,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am not joking with you.\u201d He continued: \u201cI will change China within the next three years. If I don\u2019t change it, I won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the name of the province where the Chinese government hired online commenters in 2004. It is Hunan Province, not Henan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Race in America, College Amenities and Loneliness: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events Conversation_________I don\u2019t think that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d - I think that America has always had a dark underbelly. Beneath apple pie, baseball, and the glitz and glamour of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d, there has always been a side that most Americans have the decency to be ashamed of.America was built on slavery and racism, but the credit was taken by Europeans.In school, we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. We read speeches by Lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. In present-day America, we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.Racism has been ingrained into American society. Beyonce\u2019s quote sums it up best. In a speech she gave when presenting Colin Kaepernick with the Muhammed Ali Legacy Award, she said, \u201c...racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.\u201d She is right. America\u2019s dark underbelly should be shamed, it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards, the thing that we apologize for and work to end. It should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. I see the uprisings of racism in high school, unfortunately - it\u2019s not my classmates\u2019 fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. It is America\u2019s fault, it is society, it is generations and generations who failed us.Is America backsliding on race? No. Are individuals backsliding on race? Now that is a different story. I think as a whole, America has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the America we live in today is slightly comparable to the \u201cearlier, uglier\u201d version. I agree with Sterling Tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. Everything needs to be politically correct. Some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. Who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. Do I feel as if America is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? No, I do not. I think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. All over social media whether the person is young or old, white or black, they have something political to say. Racism is a two way street. One race should not be at fault for being more \u201cracist\u201d than the other because wouldn\u2019t that be considered racist too? Ever since Donald Trump has been elected, racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. In my opinion, I think racism is on the rise, and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism.I feel as if racism is on the rise we\u2019ve had plenty of killings in the United States on the account of another race not liking African Americans and it\u2019s not fair. Being a young African American lady I have experienced a lot of racism as I\u2019ve gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. I get on social media and run across racism. But its going to continue to be on the rise because Americans let this be acceptable.Do I believe that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d? No. America has always been ugly, it\u2019s just covered up. America has a foundation of prejudice, and many minorities suffer from this today. The fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly.Since the election of Trump, more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. I have certainly heard racial slurs in person, but where I see the most insensitive comments is on social media. I see people responding to Trump\u2019s barbaric tweets about immigrants, people say that \u201cOnly REAL Americans should be here\u201d. My response to that is that any of us who are black, white, or asian are not \u201creal Americans\u201d, we trace back to elsewhere. The only true Americans race was nearly decimated. In fact, the people who are often told to \u201cgo back to their country\u201d are Mexicans and people from Central and South America. What many don\u2019t understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount Native American ancestry.Therefore, this is their country. They\u2019re the \u201creal Americans\u201d.I believe that America is turning back \u201cinto an uglier version of itself\u201d because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. This idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. This is not fair because everyone is born equal, and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. Donald Trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the \u2018way to make America great again\u2019 and to get rid of the people that don\u2019t belong. The people that don\u2019t belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. In this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief._________What London is doing is a great need of society today. Neighbors don\u2019t talk to each and people just don\u2019t care about each.Yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? How many people here in the last year or so have1. Picked up medicines for a sick person 2. Consoled a grieving soul. 3. Sat with an elderly person 4. Sat with a friend and lent them an ear.We talk about all the big issues in the world but don\u2019t we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with.Anxiety, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. We all face it, whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time, loneliness never seems to go away. Young or old, friendly or shy, confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous, illness creator, so why not arm ourselves against? In the U.K, they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness, and how more than 200,000 Britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! The fight against this battle starts in the U.K with a minister for loneliness, but in the U.S, no action has been made. We have almost 5X as many residents as the U.K, and I will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness, and still no action. We arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer, so why not try and fight loneliness. Just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. Just one group \u2026 one difference maker._________I don\u2019t plan on going to college so I can lounge around and sit in a lazy river, especially one that my friends and I paid 85 million dollars for. According to the article, tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. Now if that\u2019s true; then I want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students\u2019 money, but this time, for completely useless renovation projects. How could anyone in good faith, knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. I truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that I\u2019m just going to be in debt for even longer after I get out of college.I completely agree with the author of this article. Student debt is a huge problem in the US, and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. College is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in, and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in, and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. Colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics aren\u2019t helping. While it is true that students need to relax, having expensive amenities won\u2019t make or break that\u2013there\u2019s plenty to do on campuses alreadyAfter perusing the article about the \u201ctop 25\u201d in the nation, I believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. There are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. In the beginning of this article, amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. As I looked through the attached top 25 article, my opinion changed. Some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance, such as a lazy river or bowling alley. On the other hand, if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus, then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. Having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science, or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college, where you get to study what you want and find your true self. Going to a college with amazing classrooms, labs, and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there.Watch out \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re falling into the same trap that the author warns about. When you use language like \u201cfind your true self\u201d and \u201cunforgettable experiences\u201d, you\u2019re falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. If you take both your coursework and your education seriously, your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. College can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration, but don\u2019t idealize it too much.College will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply, and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value, and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. But \u201cfinding your true self\u201d is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.You\u2019re right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new, upgraded laboratories. If you want to study sciences, that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities, and if you want to study art, a new art gallery on campus may provide value. If your dream is to study history, though, you\u2019re much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access, though \u2014 not a fancy new humanities building. Be very discerning about what resources you actually need, and be realistic about what resources you\u2019re likely to take advantage of.There is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. They may be nice to use, but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. At L.S.U., the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. This is not something they should have to use fees for when they\u2019re already on a tight budget. Textbooks, tuition, and food costs add up.Adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions, but that shouldn\u2019t be their number one priority. They should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. A student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool, they should go there because the school offers amazing classes, fits what they want to major in, and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful.Lavish amenities attract students. But they also harden people against forgiving student loans.I think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. College students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum, and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. These amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. Studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful.Water parks are nice, but students, parents, alumni, and\u2014yes, members of the school\u2019s oversight board\u2014should have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. Students, why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach, or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? Campus leaders, why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (Outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the school\u2019s liability should a student get hurt\u2014admins, are you listening?) If I were a college student today, then the last thing I\u2019d want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus that\u2019s causing me stress!_________My family has many cooking traditions, some new and some old. Spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, my mother\u2019s homemade green chili, and my father\u2019s famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my family\u2019s diverse food catalog. No matter what happens earlier that day, I can always count on my parents to make a delicious, home-cooked dinner. New recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with.Just the other night, my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas, chicken, rice, mushrooms, and spices in it. I am very open to trying new foods. This is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and I were younger: Two bites of everything. No exceptions. Full, complete bites. This rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether it\u2019s escargot, alligator, calamari, sushi, or just a simple steak.My family and I don\u2019t really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions, but we have made some of our own that I\u2019m sure will be passed down. These traditions are usually held on the holidays. On Superbowl Sunday, if that\u2019s considered a holiday, my sister and I have a dessert cook-off. We don\u2019t really pick who wins or losses(even though I\u2019m the obvious winner), instead, we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game.Another tradition we have falls on Christmas. It is called the Kong Fu Panda Pizza. I believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the Kong Fu Panda after eating it. It is rolled out croissant bread with eggs, cheese, and bacon bits on top. A couple days later, New Year\u2019s Eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own, homemade Coke Floats.Lastly, there\u2019s a tradition that has died out that I wish we would decide to continue. It would happen on Sunday after church. My family and my cousin\u2019s family would all go to my grandma\u2019s for a big, home-cooked lunch. We would have green beans, peas, fried chicken, barbeque, slaw, biscuits, and potatoes; finished off with a nice, cold glass of sweet tea. Later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.I thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have, but I wish we had more. I love food and it\u2019s something that everybody can relate to. It also brings people together.My family and I have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. For example - for all holidays, we cook a variety of German food - Kebassi, Spaetzel, etc. We also make Slovakian food, such as a really good recipe for Bondukis. When I personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen, it makes me feel like I\u2019m really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. I can celebrate my German and Slovakian culture, and learn more about it, while I help cook. My parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake, so, it helps me to feel more informed.In the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. We top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. In the winter time my family eats Ukrainian perogies and soup. These are an everyday meal. My favorite time is summertime because I get to spend time with my family outdoors. Participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people I love eating what I love.My parents were both raised in lower middle class households with Northern European lineages; essentially, meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word.They were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up, turning to more exotic fare. They raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. My mom loves to reminisce about the time that I asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. I grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. My parents\u2019 refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual, ready to try almost anything you put in front of me!_________I think this political cartoon relates to President Trump\u2019s recent comments about certain countries. Many of you may know the inappropriate things our President said, in spite of our country\u2019s reputation of acceptance of many cultures, whether they are wealthy or not. The statue of liberty now reads: Give Me Your Norwegians. People should be able to come from anywhere, by choice. The statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag, symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by President Trump\u2019s actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process.President Trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. He says it is because of terrorism, or because they are not wealthy countries, but in reality it is just people who are not like him. President Trump is shutting out the rest of the world, isolating our country. Multiple countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, Chad, and predominantly Muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time Trump\u2019s presidency is over. This will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. Immigrants do not steal our jobs, they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. Immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our \u201cfree\u201d nation.The cartoonist is using the comment on the Statue of Liberty to send the message that President Trump\u2019s recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. The cartoonist is implying that America only wants to have white, law abiding immigrants come to our country. This is the complete opposite position the US had in late 1800\u2019s/early 1900\u2019s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the US for a better and brighter future. But the other implied message is that the US has a big immigration problem, which needs to be handled very carefully. Unfortunately, I do not think that the US will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. I also feel that President Trump should really think before he speaks or Tweets, because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously.The original inscription on the Statue of Liberty is well know for the phrase, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019 s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what America is supposed to represent. This political cartoon In is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. The Statue of Liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable._________I feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO\u2019s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will \u201cstop significant touch-ups of images\u201d.Every weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world.The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don\u2019t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone.The world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the \u201cgive me this, give me that\u201d norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. \u201cWhere does this product come from?\u201d, \u201cIs this brand cruelty-free?\u201d, \u201cDoes this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?\u201d, and \u201cHow does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?\u201d are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed.Even if a company isn\u2019t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us.I think in the past, companies didn\u2019t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities.One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company\u2019s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create \u201ca new capitalism\u201d by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don\u2019t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate.When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years.When it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it\u2019s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase.For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no \u2018Our Story\u2019 page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That\u2019s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren\u2019t as fortunate as me.Milton Friedman said \u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities\u201d, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative.It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called \u201cGen X\u201d, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn\u2019t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it.The extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that \u201cmake short term sense\u201d but eventually threaten their \u201clong term viability,\u201d as said by Jana in the article.Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock\u2019s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, \u201cWe know that we\u2019re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!\u201d, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I\u2019ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it.I think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap?_________What do you do when there\u2019s nothing to do? You take out your phone. What do you do when there\u2019s something to do? You take out your phone. Replace \u2018phone\u2019 with \u2018cigarette\u2019, and we\u2019re back in the 50s. Unlike cigarettes, though, phones don\u2019t have addiction warnings. Like cigarettes, they should. In German, there\u2019s one word for both \u2018addiction\u2019 and \u2018dependence\u2019. When we\u2019re addicted to something, it\u2019s synonymous to being dependent on it. Instead of asking yourself if you\u2019re addicted, ask the following: \u201cDo I take out my phone when I\u2019m in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being?\u201d If the answer is yes, you\u2019re dependent, ergo, addicted. \u201cDo I take out my phone the moment I feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air?\u201d Yes? Addicted. Dependent. Obsessed. Possessed. You name it.Phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. It is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. I think of it as like eating junk food. You need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. Fast food companies don\u2019t go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc. It is up to us to make that choice for ourselves.I think phones should not come with addiction warnings. Tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. It is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. I feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings, the overall outcome wouldn\u2019t change. Yes, there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage, like phones giving a report on how you spent your time, but in the end it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary. People know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. It is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not.It is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device, the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. People use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance, people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. Now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company.The most I would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because it\u2019s like buying Netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people don\u2019t get addicted to it and slack off on their work.With the addition of smartphones, Smart speakers(Alexa and Google Home), and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore, were always connected.The threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. If Apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then I believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. Because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Calls U.S. Conviction of Banker \u2018Scandalous\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey on Thursday criticized a United States jury\u2019s decision to convict a Turkish banker on charges of conspiring to evade American sanctions against Iran, calling the verdict \u201cunjust\u201d and the trial an \u201cunprecedented interference\u201d in its internal affairs.Yet the sanctions-evasion scandal, in which ministers and even President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were linked to a billion-dollar gold-for-oil trade to help Iran evade American sanctions, appears to have passed in Turkey. The official comments had an air of repetition, and the reaction on social media was muted.Political analysts predicted that the affair would blow over because Mr. Erdogan had not been indicted or badly hurt by new evidence revealed at the trial. The government had successfully framed the case as a plot by its enemies, they said, so the verdict came as no surprise.\u201cIt will have zero impact,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital. \u201cErdogan has already persuaded his supporters that it is a conspiracy.\u201dMr. Erdogan had seemed particularly concerned by the case of another defendant, the wealthy gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty before the trial and became the prosecution\u2019s star witness. Although Mr. Zarrab indicated several times that Mr. Erdogan knew of the sanctions-evasion plan, many in Turkey did not see his testimony as damning.Mr. Erdogan, who excoriated United States officials over the trial, and personally raised it in a telephone conversation with President Trump in September, made no statement on Thursday, leaving the reaction to others.The foreign ministry called the verdict \u201cunjust and unfortunate\u201d and the trial an \u201cunprecedented interference in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said it represented \u201can attack on Turkey\u2019s judiciary and sovereignty, and we do not accept it.\u201d A senior presidential adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, described the verdict as a \u201cscandalous decision in a scandalous trial.\u201dThe officials repeated government complaints that evidence used in the case against Mr. Atilla had been compiled by followers of Fethullah Gulen, a United States-based preacher whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016. Mr. Gulen has denied any involvement.Turkey has also accused Mr. Gulen\u2019s movement of being behind the nation\u2019s own criminal investigation into the sanctions-busting scheme, in 2013, which provided much of the evidence used in the American indictment.The consistent government message, explaining the court case as a plot against Turkey and Mr. Erdogan, has found a ready audience among many Turks who already believe that the United States was behind the failed coup of July 2016, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cThis fits into the conspiracy that the U.S. wants to topple the government,\u201d he said.Mr. Erdogan has depicted popular demonstrations against him in Taksim Square in 2013 as a first move to unseat him, followed by two others: the 2013 criminal investigation into the sanctions-busting scheme and the failed coup three years later, which left more than 200 people dead.It is widely believed in Turkey that followers of Mr. Gulen were behind the failed coup, and the failure of the United States to agree to his extradition is perceived as a sign of American complicity by many Turks. American officials say Turkey lacks convincing evidence for extradition.\u201cIt is a shameful political operation,\u201d Mr. Kalin, the presidential adviser, said at a press briefing in Ankara. \u201cThose who think they can harm Turkey that way, our nation clearly sees the game that was set up.\u201dThe judge presiding over Mr. Atilla\u2019s trial, Richard M. Berman, criticized the defense lawyers for introducing such theories, describing them as far-fetched.Turkish officials are now concerned about shoring up confidence in the economy, as analysts predicted that Halkbank would be fined by the United States Treasury Department for having a role in the violations of the sanctions.Halkbank, in a statement on its website, insisted that it had not violated any regulations.\u201cOur bank is always going to maintain its policy of transparency in transactions and compliance to international regulations decisively,\u201d its statement said.Financial analysts said previous cases resulted in banks\u2019 being fined $5 billion to $10 billion. Turkey\u2019s Finance Ministry has said it will support banks in case of penalties, and Halkbank\u2019s share price rose by two percentage points on Thursday, an indication of confidence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Confirms Jerome H. Powell as Fed Chairman", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell sailed to Senate confirmation on Tuesday to become the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve with a final vote of 84 to 13. He will replace the outgoing Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, on Feb. 3.He will take the helm of the central bank during a period of relative economic tranquillity, in the ninth year of one of the longest uninterrupted expansions in American history. He has said he plans to continue the Fed\u2019s gradual retreat from its postcrisis stimulus campaign and is expected to continue its slow but steady pace in raising interest rates.He won confirmation by a much wider margin than Ms. Yellen did four years ago, as most Democrats embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s selection. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, endorsed Mr. Powell on the Senate floor Tuesday.\u201cHis track record over the past six years shows he is a thoughtful policymaker,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Among those voting in opposition were several Democrats considering presidential bids in 2020, and several Republicans who have long opposed the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, initially voted for Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation but later changed her vote to no, explaining that she had meant to vote against confirmation.The bipartisan support for Mr. Powell was a sharp break from another Fed hearing earlier on Tuesday, when Mr. Brown and other Democrats questioned the qualifications of Marvin Goodfriend, a conservative economist nominated by Mr. Trump for a seat on the Fed\u2019s board.Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly predicted after the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed\u2019s actions were about to unleash higher inflation. That did not happen. Inflation has consistently remained below 2 percent.At a confirmation hearing Tuesday, Mr. Goodfriend was flustered by questions about his predictions. He conceded that some had been wrong, but defended others and declined to explain his thinking.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, \u201cI think based on the kind of judgment you have demonstrated, American families are very lucky that you weren\u2019t on the Fed board over the last several years.\u201d She added that she hoped Mr. Goodfriend would not be confirmed to the Fed job.The rocky performance is unlikely to hurt Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s confirmation prospects, as Republicans do not require Democratic support.After the crisis, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign as likely to generate inflation rather than economic revival. He told Bloomberg in 2012 it was \u201creally doubtful\u201d the Fed could reduce unemployment, which was then hovering above 8 percent, to 7 percent. Furthermore, he said, even if the Fed succeeded in doing so, \u201cit would give rise to rising inflation in the next few years, which would be disastrous for the economy.\u201dThe unemployment rate has fallen consistently over the past several years, hitting 4.1 percent in December, while inflation has remained sluggish.Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said Mr. Goodfriend was \u201cwell qualified.\u201d As a member of the Fed\u2019s board, Mr. Goodfriend would hold a vote on the Fed\u2019s monetary policymaking committee, and he would participate in decisions about regulatory policy.Democrats took a different view, reading some of Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s old statements into the record.\u201cWhy were you so wrong so many times?\u201d Mr. Brown asked.Mr. Goodfriend responded that the Fed needed to prioritize low inflation.He said he was committed to the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate\u201d of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation, but added the best way to maximize employment was to stabilize inflation. In recent years, under Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed has sought to maximize employment by stimulating economic growth, and not only by maintaining stable rates of inflation.On Tuesday, Mr. Goodfriend said he remained in favor of a policy rule, but he was less critical of current Fed policy, which he described as being \u201cmore or less on the right path going forward.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor Murphy Pledges a Progressive Course for New Jersey", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 Philip Dunton Murphy, whose brand of pragmatic progressive politics propelled him from Democratic donor and former American ambassador to the 56th governor of New Jersey, was sworn into office on Tuesday, claiming a mandate to provide sweeping change and promising to focus heavily on the stagnant economy.\u201cWe can once again be the state that leads the nation in progressive policies and puts common sense and our residents first in line,\u201d Mr. Murphy said during his 34-minute inaugural address inside a theater here.An unabashed liberal, Mr. Murphy\u2019s rise to one of the most powerful governor seats in the country comes against the backdrop of the polarizing Trump administration. And Mr. Murphy pledged that his stewardship of New Jersey will be a check on what he portrays as conservative overreach and abusive policies stemming from the White House.Indeed, Mr. Murphy, one of the most liberal candidates to win in an increasingly Democratic state, represents a significant shift for New Jersey as he succeeds Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a supporter of President Trump. Mr. Christie\u2019s tumultuous eight-year tenure was marked by funding cuts in education, public pensions and transportation.\u201cDespite the challenges we face, I remain an optimist,\u201d Mr. Murphy said as he laid out an ambitious agenda. Here\u2019s a look at how his plans stack up against those challenges.PROMISE: \u201cWe will resist every move from President Trump and a misguided congressional leadership that would worsen income inequality; or divide families or deny access to college for our Dreamers; or defund essential infrastructure; or gut health care for our children, seniors and the working poor; or provide a tax windfall to giant corporations and billionaires at the expense of our working- and middle-class families.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey is rooted in an economy that creates better jobs and provides higher wages that creates places where industries can grow and communities can rise, where innovative companies are born and where millennials want to live and where seniors want to retire.\u201d He added: \u201cfor small businesses, and women, veteran and minority-owned businesses to thrive instead of delivering massive tax breaks to a handful of select and connected big corporations that don\u2019t need them in the first place.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey funds its public schools and delivers on the promise of property tax relief. It makes a four-year college more affordable and provides free access to community college. And it creates new training programs to prepare our residents for jobs in an innovation-driven economy.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey embraces comprehensive criminal justice reform comprehensively, and that includes a process to legalize marijuana.\u201dREALITY: Mr. Murphy\u2019s push to legalize marijuana \u2014 which he frames as a way to achieve criminal justice reform while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the state \u2014 will likely test his ability to marshal the Democratically-controlled State Legislature. While there are two bills that could lead to legalization, there are strong voices of opposition that will need to be reckoned with.PROMISE: \u201cI ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women\u2019s health and Planned Parenthood; to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; to promote equal pay for women; to give every worker the peace of mind of earned sick leave; to tear down barriers to voting; and, to strengthen our gun laws.REALITY: Mr. Murphy quickly took action on some of these promises hours after his speech, signing an executive order aimed at promoting pay equity for women by prohibiting state agencies from asking the pay history of prospective employees. Some of his other promises will require legislative approval and though some bills, such as providing funding to Planned Parenthood, are pending, other issues, like increasing the minimum wage, will require intense negotiations.Mr. Murphy made no direct mention of two of the state\u2019s most pressing issues: its large public pension liability and its decrepit transportation system, especially the chronic complaints about the reliability of New Jersey Transit\u2019s commuter trains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Woes Deepen for New York G.O.P. as Best Hope to Challenge Cuomo Bows Out", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican prospects to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in November just grew exponentially more daunting, with Harry Wilson\u2019s decision this week to forgo his bid \u2014 leaving party strategists downcast, frustrated and scrambling.Mr. Wilson, a businessman who unsuccessfully ran for state comptroller in 2010, was widely seen as the Republicans\u2019 top recruit, and he had seriously looked at the governor\u2019s race for months.He registered the site www.wilsonforgovernor.com in May 2017. He told Republican officials that he would invest $10 million of his own fortune into his campaign. He repeatedly pinged New York and national strategists about his pathway, including traveling to gatherings like the Republican Governors Association.But he officially pulled the plug in a New Year\u2019s Day Facebook post, citing his commitment to his family.\u201cEveryone was really hoping for Harry Wilson,\u201d said Andrea Catsimatidis, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party. \u201cWe thought he would be great.\u201dNow New York Republicans are headed into the midterm elections, saddled by a president who is deeply unpopular in this heavily Democratic state and without a clear leader of their own for the top of the ticket. Whoever does run faces the financial might of Mr. Cuomo, who had banked more than $25 million for his run as of mid-2017 and is expected to report having millions of dollars more in the coming weeks.\u201cBecause Harry was able to come to the table with his own personal financial commitment, we all kind of held in place wondering whether he\u2019d get in or out,\u201d said Marcus Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is also considering a Republican bid for governor. Just to match Mr. Cuomo\u2019s treasury from six months ago, any Republican would need to raise more than $550,000 every week between now and November.In a dozen interviews, Republican operatives and officials expressed a fresh urgency at their predicament. The state\u2019s Republican congressional delegation is in the cross hairs of national Democrats hoping to win back the House, especially following the passage of a new tax law that punishes high-tax states like New York. And the party\u2019s current lone foothold on power in Albany, their control of the State Senate bolstered by fragile alliances with renegade Democrats, is also imperiled this fall.Over sodas and sandwiches, more than a dozen of New York\u2019s top Republican political strategists gathered last month, convened by Ms. Catsimatidis, to plot a path back for the party.On a whiteboard, they brainstormed together a list of ideal characteristics for a statewide Republican candidate, among them: resources (i.e. having money or the ability to raise vast sums), being a woman, being a political outsider, speaking Spanish and having a political base in downstate New York.The problem? The current crop of Republicans check off almost none of those boxes.In addition to the messaging challenge of ousting a two-term governor for a political insider, Mr. Cuomo has proved adept at locking up campaign cash from institutional Albany, the same donors those challengers would likely have to rely upon.\u201cYou can\u2019t take the fight to Albany if you\u2019re from Albany,\u201d said one of the Republican operatives who attended, who spoke anonymously to not disparage the eventual nominee because so many of the current candidates are linked to Albany.Some have urged Chele Chiavacci Farley, a finance chairwoman for the New York Republican Party, to challenge Mr. Cuomo. Ms. Farley is currently laying the groundwork to run against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand this year, and has begun assembling a campaign team, including John Brabender, a former adviser to the presidential candidate Rick Santorum, and the pollster John McLaughlin.But Ms. Farley has told people she is set on a Senate bid.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that hard-working taxpayers are fed up with Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s obstruction, political grandstanding, and ineffectiveness,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn the next few weeks, I will be making an official announcement about my intentions.\u201dRepublican county party leaders are set to gather in Albany on Monday to plot their next steps; two days later, in Manhattan, the same strategists that met last month are scheduled to reconvene.For now, the Republican political strategy seems to be mostly hoping that Mr. Cuomo, riding high in polls, self-destructs: that the transit woes of New York City\u2019s subways worsen; that the upcoming corruption trial of one of his former top aides, Joseph Percoco, tarnishes his image; that the state budget falls out of whack; that Democrats challenge and wound him from the left in a primary; and that the third term curse proves an actual curse.Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York Democratic Party, rattled off Mr. Cuomo\u2019s accomplishments, including gun control, infrastructure investment and managing the budget for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strong position.\u201cThat\u2019s a hard record to run against, and these would-be candidates know it,\u201d Mr. Berman said. \u201cNew Yorkers aren\u2019t stupid. They know a good thing when they see one and are not going to be fooled by the empty rhetoric of extreme conservatives, no matter how well-funded or rich they may be.\u201dEd Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said the governor\u2019s race would be an \u201canybody but Cuomo\u201d campaign, just like the one that felled Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994. Except now Republicans are expected to battle Trump headwinds; in 1994, they were riding an anti-Clinton wave.\u201cThe Bills are in the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, so I always remain hopeful that we can win statewide,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a Buffalo-based Republican strategist who previously ran communications for House Republican campaigns nationally.But in New York, she said, Republicans are inured to a weak top of the ticket.\u201cIt\u2019s just a benefit that we haven\u2019t enjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be awesome, but \u2026\u201dHer voice trailed off, and she didn\u2019t finish the sentence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Swiss Banker Helped Americans Dodge Taxes. Was It a Crime?", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "Stefan Buck created bank accounts for dozens of Americans hiding money from tax collectors. The U.S. tried to hold him personally accountable.Supported byDiane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors.One bank after another turned her down on that afternoon in 2009. They were worried about a United States crackdown on tax evasion and were no longer willing to shelter American money.Finally, across the street from a city park, up a discreet elevator, seated in a luxurious conference room, Ms. Butrus found a banker ready to help. His name was Stefan Buck.Mr. Buck said that his employer, Bank Frey, would be happy to take Ms. Butrus\u2019s money, according to court documents and interviews with Mr. Buck and Ms. Butrus. He instructed her to wire the $1.5 million to Bank Frey. He told her that her name wouldn\u2019t be attached to the new account. It would be known internally as Cardinal, an alias she chose in a nod to her favorite baseball team.After that, Ms. Butrus contacted Mr. Buck via prepaid cellphones she picked up at a Walgreens drugstore. Every six months or so, she flew to Zurich to withdraw money directly from Mr. Buck. She would return to the United States secretly carrying just under $10,000 in cash \u2014 the cutoff for having to make a customs declaration.The setup allowed Ms. Butrus to avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes. And it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Mr. Buck and Bank Frey.As much as chocolate and watches, Switzerland is known for bank secrecy. That made the country a destination for money that the wealthy wanted to hide. Last decade, it also made Swiss banks targets for an assault by the United States government, which was tired of Americans escaping taxes on money in offshore accounts.Many banks came clean, divulging their clients to American authorities. Many Americans, including Ms. Butrus, searched for new places to park their money.Bank Frey was among the very few to defy the legal onslaught. And Mr. Buck, a clean-cut and self-confident 28-year-old at the time he met Ms. Butrus, was the bank\u2019s public face, responsible for landing and then managing American accounts.That put Mr. Buck in the government\u2019s cross hairs. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted him for conspiring to help Americans avoid taxes. It seemed like another blow against Swiss bank secrecy.But things didn\u2019t go as prosecutors had planned \u2014 and the chain of events could have big consequences for America\u2019s fight to keep people from evading taxes using offshore bank accounts.Mr. Buck was raised in Germany. His parents had been championship ice dancers; his mother competed in figure skating for Switzerland in the 1972 Olympics in Japan.His father ran an insurance company, and Mr. Buck figured that one day he would take it over. But an acquaintance from business school offered him a job in early 2007 at Bank Frey. The bank was tiny, with about 20 employees. Mr. Buck shared an office with four people, including the bank\u2019s receptionist. \u201cWe all got along well,\u201d he said.The business revolved around clients that the bank\u2019s founder, Markus Frey, had accumulated over the years, according to Mr. Buck and the court testimony of another former bank employee. At first, there wasn\u2019t a focus on Americans.Soon Swiss banks were expelling American clients.Not Bank Frey. It didn\u2019t have offices in the United States, and executives didn\u2019t see it as their responsibility to police whether their clients were paying taxes.\u201cWe decided there\u2019s no reason not to maintain business with American clients,\u201d Mr. Buck said in an interview. Executives consulted with legal experts to ensure they weren\u2019t crossing any lines. \u201cWe really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct.\u201dOpening accounts for desperate Americans seemed like a golden opportunity. \u201cThe positioning of Bank Frey as a solely Swiss private bank is now considered as a competitive advantage by the market,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Gregor Bienz, said at a board meeting in late 2008, according to records of the meeting. Mr. Bienz didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Ms. Butrus was one of them. C. Richard Lucy, a former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America executive in New York, was another.In late 2009, Mr. Lucy\u2019s contact at Julius Baer, where he\u2019d had an account for many years, told him he had to move it elsewhere. Mr. Lucy traveled to Zurich and met with about 15 banks. None would take his money, according to his court testimony.There was one exception. \u201cA couple of times the name Bank Frey came up as a bank that was new and aggressively seeking out accounts,\u201d he testified. (He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)Sure enough, when Mr. Lucy showed up at Bank Frey\u2019s offices, Mr. Buck said he would open him an account.Mr. Lucy was impressed by Mr. Buck\u2019s assurances that his bank had nothing to worry about in the American tax-evasion investigations. \u201cI had found what I was looking for,\u201d Mr. Lucy said.Mr. Lucy said that Mr. Buck arranged for him to get a Matterhorn-emblazoned debit card that didn\u2019t have Bank Frey\u2019s or Mr. Lucy\u2019s names on it. Mr. Lucy was told that, when he needed money, he should call Bank Frey and ask them to load money onto the debit card. He could use it at any ATM.Mr. Lucy wanted to bring some account documentation back to New York. He said Mr. Buck advised him not to take anything with Bank Frey\u2019s name on it. (Mr. Buck denies giving that advice.) Mr. Lucy took a pair of scissors and snipped Bank Frey\u2019s name and logo off the paperwork.Back in Manhattan, Mr. Lucy bought a prepaid phone card for his calls to Zurich. He made them from a pay phone outside his apartment building. When that phone was damaged, the only other functioning pay phone he could find nearby was inside the kitchen of a boutique hotel. Surrounded by the kitchen\u2019s hubbub, he chatted on the phone with his Swiss banker.By the turn of the decade, other Swiss banks were booting their American customers \u2014 and handing them glossy Bank Frey brochures on the way out the door.Mr. Buck, who eventually rose to be Bank Frey\u2019s head of private banking, said he felt he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. All the same, he warned one client, Christine Warsaw, against sending banking instructions through the United States Postal Service, she said in court. \u201cNo USPS, use fax,\u201d she wrote in a note to herself. Mr. Buck said he didn\u2019t tell her not to send materials through the mail.By 2011, it was dangerous for Americans to keep their money in undeclared offshore accounts. More banks were handing over client lists to the Justice Department. If you showed up on a list, prosecutors might pursue you.A safer option was to turn yourself in to the I.R.S. through a voluntary self-disclosure program. It allowed taxpayers to pay back taxes, cooperate with investigators and move on with their lives.Ms. Butrus closed her Bank Frey account and eventually declared the money to the I.R.S. She paid her taxes and a stiff penalty and pledged to help the I.R.S. and prosecutors. Mr. Lucy did, too. On disclosure forms, both identified Mr. Buck as their relationship manager.Prosecutors were hunting for bankers to hold accountable. The theory was that bankers knew they were enabling Americans to break the law and therefore were part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Prosecutors turned to people including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy.By 2013, more than 20 employees of Swiss financial institutions had been criminally charged. At least a dozen pleaded guilty and received a fine, probation or both. Several hunkered down in Switzerland, which refused to extradite its citizens to the United States for actions that weren\u2019t illegal in Switzerland.None had actually gone on trial.At 5 o\u2019clock one morning in April 2013, Mr. Buck was awakened by a phone call. Bank Frey\u2019s chief executive was on the line. \u201cGo look at Bloomberg,\u201d Mr. Buck recalls him saying, referring to the business-news service.\u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Mr. Buck said he replied.\u201cDo it now,\u201d his boss ordered.Mr. Buck pulled out his cellphone. There it was: an article saying he had been indicted.Mr. Buck, 32 years old at the time and single, went to work to hand in his I.D. card and cellphone. He was placed on paid leave; the bank would cover his legal expenses.Then Mr. Buck headed to his sister\u2019s house. It was her husband\u2019s birthday, and they were hosting a barbecue.His sister, Sylvia Muther, was nearly nine months pregnant. \u201cWe were scared he\u2019d go to jail,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried not to think about that.\u201d\u201cI got hammered,\u201d Mr. Buck said.Mr. Buck spent months weighing his options. He could plead guilty and be done with it. He could spend the rest of his life in Switzerland, which wouldn\u2019t extradite him. Or he could fight the charges.That third road was perilous. If Mr. Buck won at trial, he would be free \u2014 and the Justice Department\u2019s fight against bankers who enable tax evasion would be dealt a serious blow. If he lost, he was looking at up to five years in prison.The same week, a Los Angeles jury acquitted an Israeli banker who faced similar accusations. The Americans\u2019 pursuit of foreign bankers no longer looked invincible.A few months later, on a cloudy morning in January 2015, Mr. Buck was skiing with friends in the Swiss Alps. Above the tree line, they started their descent.A sign on the slope marked the boundary between France and Switzerland. Mr. Buck realized he was crossing an international border \u2014 and that meant he theoretically could be picked up on an American arrest warrant in France. \u201cI was scared,\u201d Mr. Buck said.He told his friends to continue without him. He snapped off his skis, trudged back up the slope and skied down the Swiss side of the mountain.Mr. Buck realized he couldn\u2019t spend the rest of his life fearful of crossing a border. \u201cThere was no way I was just going to stay in Switzerland,\u201d he said.Mr. Buck told his lawyer, Marc A. Agnifilo, that he wanted his day in court.On Nov. 9, 2016, Mr. Buck boarded a flight to New York. He had spent the previous two nights too scared to sleep. Mr. Agnifilo had negotiated with Manhattan prosecutors to let Mr. Buck out on bail once he arrived. The catch was that he would have to stay in the United States, with his passport confiscated, until his trial.\u201cDo you have any idea when I\u2019m going to come back?\u201d he asked Mr. Agnifilo.\u201cNo,\u201d his lawyer responded. \u201cHopefully you don\u2019t have a cat you need to feed.\u201dAn I.R.S. agent collected Mr. Buck as he exited the plane in New York. He was fingerprinted, photographed, shackled and driven to a prison next to the Brooklyn Bridge. He spent the night with a cellmate whose hedge fund had been raided that morning by agents with machine guns.It would be months before his trial was scheduled.Mr. Buck made the most of the free time. He trained in Central Park for the New York City Marathon. He became a Yankees fan. For New Year\u2019s, he went to Miami with friends. Since he had no I.D., he couldn\u2019t fly; instead he spent 33 hours on a Greyhound. \u201cHe sees it all as an adventure,\u201d Mr. Agnifilo said.He spent much of his time in Mr. Agnifilo\u2019s 26th-floor law offices, helping his lawyers translate German-language documents.Mr. Buck had heard of Mr. Shkreli. He hadn\u2019t realized they would be sharing a lawyer. Mr. Agnifilo and Mr. Buck both recall shouting matches over whether the lawyer was sufficiently devoted to his client\u2019s case.Mr. Buck\u2019s trial started in October. Prosecutors branded him as a crucial cog in an international tax-evasion scheme.Mr. Agnifilo decided that Mr. Buck shouldn\u2019t testify. While the defendant was confident of his innocence, the cross-examination promised to be brutal. And Mr. Buck\u2019s English was imperfect.Jurors heard from a parade of Mr. Buck\u2019s former clients, including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. They testified that Mr. Buck and Bank Frey had been instrumental in allowing them to dodge taxes.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want anyone, specifically the I.R.S., to find out we had an account at the time,\u201d Ms. Butrus testified.Prosecutors said all the secrecy \u2014 the nameless debit cards, the scissored bank paperwork, the shadowy phone calls \u2014 showed Mr. Buck knew what he was doing was wrong. \u201cThese are techniques used by a person who is trying to keep from getting caught, not by a person who thinks he\u2019s operating legally,\u201d said Sarah E. Paul, an assistant United States attorney, near the end of the trial.Then it was Mr. Agnifilo\u2019s turn.\u201cAt the center of the crime scene, there is an American with a pen,\u201d he intoned. \u201cStefan Buck has nothing whatsoever, nothing whatsoever, to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes\u201d to not declare offshore assets.Mr. Agnifilo said the fact that Mr. Buck came to America, rather than staying in Switzerland, confirmed that he had nothing to hide. \u201cLet Mr. Buck go back to Switzerland,\u201d he finished.It was a moving performance. \u201cI\u2019m close to crying the first time in 25 years,\u201d Mr. Buck wrote on a Post-it note he handed his lawyers.The judge, Jed S. Rakoff, also was impressed. \u201cI knew you were a powerful orator,\u201d he told Mr. Agnifilo after the jury left, \u201cbut you have exceeded all bounds.\u201dThe jury deliberated for a little more than a day. On Nov. 21, Mr. Buck was sitting on a toilet in the courthouse bathroom when the verdict came in. He hustled to the courtroom.A pair of United States Marshals hovered at the back. \u201cAre they here for me?\u201d Mr. Buck recalled asking his lawyer.No, Mr. Agnifilo fibbed. He knew the marshals were there to take Mr. Buck into custody if he was found guilty.The jury filed in and delivered the verdict: not guilty.Afterward, Mr. Buck spoke to the jurors in the hallway \u2014 the first time they had heard his voice. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving,\u201d he told them.Mr. Buck\u2019s acquittal reverberated through the legal community. The Justice Department had now lost the three cases it had tried against foreign bankers who helped Americans avoid taxes.Dozens more cases are pending. Those who represent accused Swiss bankers say they expect Mr. Buck\u2019s verdict to embolden defendants and to cause prosecutors to think twice before bringing new charges.\u201cIt should change their calculus,\u201d said Marc S. Harris, a lawyer at Scheper Kim & Harris, who successfully defended the Israeli banker in 2014. He said the cases represented a \u201cmisguided effort\u201d by the Justice Department to respond to political pressure to prosecute bankers.In early December, Mr. Buck\u2019s family and friends greeted him at the Zurich airport with a giant welcome-home poster. His priority was to get to the Alps for peak ski season.\u201cThe timing of my return is perfect,\u201d he said. He hopes to get back to work soon in the Swiss finance industry.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Count Bank Overdraft Fees as a Holiday Expense, Too", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserConsumers struggling with holiday spending hangovers may want to reconsider resorting to overdrafts on their checking accounts.An overdraft occurs when you spend more than you have in your checking account, but your bank allows the payment to go through, and charges you a fee. The fees vary, but big banks typically charge about $35. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently estimated that consumers pay $17 billion in such fees each year.Banks\u2019 overdraft revenue tends to rise each quarter of the calendar year before dropping again in the first quarter, suggesting that consumers may be crunched for cash and particularly vulnerable to such fees at the end of the year, said Thaddeus King, an officer with Pew\u2019s consumer finance project.The federal government requires consumers to give permission by \u201copting in\u201d to overdraft coverage for debit card purchases and automated teller machine withdrawals. If they don\u2019t opt in, and they attempt a debit card purchase or A.T.M. withdrawal that exceeds their balance, the transaction is declined, without a fee. But many consumers \u2014 nearly three in four, according to Pew\u2019s finding \u2014 don\u2019t realize that they have a choice. Among those who have overdrawn their accounts in the past 12 months, Pew found, more than half are \u201cheavy\u201d overdrafters, who have done it at least three times.Customers\u2019 understanding of how overdraft coverage works is low, even among those who have spoken to their bank about it, the report found. That suggests that banks\u2019 communication about overdraft programs is ineffective, according to the report.Customers \u201cdon\u2019t seem to understand that when you opt out, you don\u2019t pay the fee,\u201d Mr. King said. He called the finding \u201csomewhat disheartening.\u201dPew suggested that many consumers would benefit if banks were instead able to offer lower-cost, small-installment loans with clear rules to protect borrowers. Such loans could be safely made if they were capped at 5 percent of the borrower\u2019s paycheck, Pew said. Many banks and credit unions have said they would be open to making such loans if they were given clear guidelines from regulators, Mr. King said.The Pew report, published in December, was based on a telephone survey in April and May of more than 1,000 adults who reported paying an overdraft fee in the prior year.Here are some questions and answers about bank overdraft fees:How can I avoid overdraft fees?Consumers can change their minds and drop overdraft coverage at any time, according to the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail banks.If you do choose coverage, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggests setting up low-balance alerts on your account so that you receive a text or email when your account drops below a certain level. Also, most banks now offer smartphone apps that make it easy to check your balance before making a purchase so you can hold off if funds are tight.You can also set up an overdraft transfer by linking your checking account to a savings account; funds will be automatically transferred when you overspend.

{"Headline": "G.E. Reports $9.8 Billion Loss and Discloses S.E.C. Accounting Inquiry", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Electric reported quarterly results on Wednesday that illustrated how far it has fallen, and the steep hill the company \u2014 once a titan of American industry \u2014 must climb to turn itself around.There were no big surprises; those had mostly come earlier.But in a conference call with analysts, G.E. disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the company\u2019s handling of its insurance obligations and how it accounted for certain services contracts. The inquiry was in its \u201cvery early stages\u201d and G.E. was \u201ccooperating fully,\u201d said Jamie Miller, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Last fall, shortly after taking over as chief executive, John Flannery told investors that G.E.\u2019s big electricity-generation division had badly misjudged the market and produced too many power turbines, warning that it would take a year or more to fix the business.At the time, G.E. sharply reduced its earnings forecast and cut its dividend by half, only its second payout cut since the Great Depression.Throughout the conference call on Wednesday, Mr. Flannery emphasized that despite its current challenges, G.E. had industrial businesses that were fundamentally strong. \u201cWe have a lot to work on,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have a lot to work with.\u201dMuch of the turnaround, Mr. Flannery insisted, could be accomplished with belt-tightening and improved execution. And he pointed to what he described as a bright spot: that cash flow from industrial operations, although down, was above expectations. The cash flow, he said, was one of the \u201cgreen shoots\u201d beginning to emerge as G.E. tries to reverse its slide.The company\u2019s operating earnings per share fell 41 percent to 27 cents a share, or 2 cents below the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue last year declined by 5 percent, to $31.4 billion, well below analysts\u2019 forecast of nearly $34 billion.Still, the company\u2019s aviation unit, a leading manufacturer of jet engines, and its health care business, which includes life sciences and medical-imaging equipment, delivered strong profits.Revenue for the aviation division was flat at $7.2 billion, but the company reported that orders rose 11 percent in the quarter. The health care business saw sales grow by 6 percent to $5.4 billion.Yet last week, after the surprising setback because of insurance claims at GE Capital, Mr. Flannery suggested that even one of the three core businesses could be a candidate for a spinoff to generate returns for shareholders.The company\u2019s share price has dropped by 44 percent over the past year, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has climbed 25 percent. G.E. shares slipped 1 percent during trading on Wednesday morning, after the earnings report and the conference call.Given the earlier surprises, G.E.\u2019s new leadership needs to show that it can stabilize the company and begin a turnaround, analysts say. The S.E.C. investigation only adds more uncertainty. After the setbacks in the past few months, class action shareholder suits have been filed.\u201cThese things are further risks that make G.E. difficult to value,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cThey have to right the ship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Conservative\u2019s Case Against Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Frum argues that Trump\u2019s greatest talent \u2014 his genius really \u2014 is spotting and exploiting weaknesses. The Republican establishment spent $100 million to put the crown on Prince Jeb Bush\u2019s head. Trump incinerated Bush (and all that cash) with his gibe about \u201clow energy.\u201d He then proceeded to incinerate \u201clittle\u201d Marco Rubio and \u201clyin\u2019\u201d Ted Cruz. Trump\u2019s campaign against Hillary Clinton was in some ways a model of how not to run campaigns \u2014 he lurched from crisis to crisis and never bothered to enumerate any detailed policies. But he understood her great limitation: that she represented the nexus between meritocracy and plutocracy, indebted to Big Money and divorced from millions of heartland Americans.Trump grasped that America is suffering from an epistemological weakness as well as economic ones: The line between truth and falsehood is becoming dangerously blurred. Again, America\u2019s knowledge elite is partly responsible for this: Armies of postmodern academics had prepared the way for Trump by arguing that truth is a construct of the power elite. But the biggest culprit is technological progress. Digitalization is not only creating a deafening cacophony of voices. It is also making it harder to finance real journalism while simultaneously making it easier to distribute tripe.Frum thinks the combination of Trump\u2019s drive for self-aggrandizement and America\u2019s current weaknesses is nothing less than a threat to the democratic order. \u201cThe thing to fear from the Trump presidency is not the bold overthrow of the Constitution, but the stealthy paralysis of governance; not the open defiance of law, but an accumulating subversion of norms; not the deployment of state power to intimidate dissidents, but the incitement of private violence to radicalize supporters.\u201d Any supposed solutions to Trump\u2019s behavior, however, may be worse than the disease: American liberals have found themselves investing extraordinary hopes in the generals who now surround the president.Trump isn\u2019t alone in the weakness-exploitation business. Some of the most eye-catching investors in his real estate empire since he won the Republican nomination hail from countries where there is a faint line between business and politics. And some of Trump\u2019s biggest ideological backers have an almost apocalyptic sense that America needs to be purged in order to be saved. Hanging over everything is the figure of Vladimir Putin, a man who has devoted his career to accumulating information on weaknesses, both personal and political, and turning that information into power. Rather than Russia turning into America, as America\u2019s policymakers argued in that great age of illusion, the 1990s, America seems to be turning into Russia.Adrian Wooldridge is the political editor of The Economist and the author of the magazine\u2019s Bagehot column.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.B.I. and Justice Dept. Brace for Possible Release of Secret Memo", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department and the F.B.I. were bracing on Tuesday for the release of a secret memo that Republicans say shows the agencies abused their authorities to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser.President Trump, who spent Tuesday preparing for his first State of the Union address, was eager to release the memo, but the White House has not said when that might happen.\u201cThere are no current plans to release the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s memo,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday night. \u201cThe president has not seen or been briefed on the memo or reviewed its contents.\u201dChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein went to the White House on Monday in the hopes of getting West Wing aides to in turn persuade Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to delay the vote that night, according to a current administration official and a former one who were familiar with the events. Mr. Wray and Mr. Rosenstein spoke with John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, but were unsuccessful.Even without having seen it, Mr. Trump, whose preferred cable channel, Fox News, has focused on the memo extensively, has told people close to him that he feels strongly that the memo makes the case that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials acted inappropriately when they sought the highly classified warrant in October 2016 on the campaign adviser, Carter Page.The Justice Department said in a letter last week that it knew of no wrongdoing related to the FISA process, and department officials believe the Republican memo leaves out key facts about the case \u2014 an argument also made by Democrats.Mr. Trump has up to five days to decide whether to block the release for national security reasons. His aide Kellyanne Conway said on Tuesday that the White House took the possibility of disclosing the memo seriously.Officials at the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency were similarly concerned about the push to release the memo. They fear the precedent that would be set if sensitive information on sources or methods were to be released as part of a partisan political brawl.Both agencies also contributed intelligence that was used in the Trump investigation. The agencies have concerns that, should House Republicans prevail in their push to release the memo, they would be tempted to continue to selectively release sensitive intelligence when it suited their political needs \u2014 and that next time, it could put C.I.A. or N.S.A. intelligence at risk of being revealed.On Capitol Hill, House members began reviewing a separate document drafted by Democrats. People familiar with that memo said it was a 10-page point-by-point rebuttal of the Republican document, including dozens of footnotes. Democrats had hoped to release their rebuttal publicly as well, but a motion to do so was voted down on Monday.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who has backed the memo\u2019s release, tried to tamp down expectations about its contents on Tuesday. In a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, Mr. Ryan \u201cimplored\u201d his fellow lawmakers not to overstate the facts of the memo and urged them not to tie the contentious document to the work of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to a person in the room.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mathilde Krim, Mobilizing Force in an AIDS Crusade, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMathilde Krim, who crusaded against the scourge of AIDS with appeals to conscience that raised funds and international awareness of a disease that has killed more than 39 million people worldwide, died on Monday at her home in Kings Point, N.Y. She was 91.Her death was confirmed by Bennah Serfaty, a spokeswoman for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, of which Dr. Krim was the founding chairwoman.When the nation learned in the early 1980s that the virus that causes AIDS had begun its terrifying attack upon the human immune system, Dr. Krim, a geneticist and virologist with wide experience in cancer research and a passion for causes, plunged into a fight not only against the virus but also for the civil rights of people who had it.Over the next several decades, she became America\u2019s foremost warrior in the battle against superstitions, fears and prejudices that have stigmatized many people with AIDS, subjecting them to rejection and discrimination. There is still no cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has become pandemic, although antiretroviral medication can slow the disease and may lead to near-normal life expectancy with prompt diagnosis and treatment.In 2016, there were more than 36.7 million people, worldwide, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or H.I.V., which causes AIDS. That was 300,000 fewer than in 2015, but the cases nevertheless resulted in one million deaths, down from a peak of 1.9 million in 2005.The virus that causes AIDS is spread by many vectors: through sex, needle-sharing among drug users and accidental needle sticks among medical personnel, as well as through blood transfusions and from mother to infant during pregnancy or breast feeding.In Africa, where the disease originated and where it is most widespread, most transmission is through heterosexual sex.In the early days of the American epidemic, AIDS killed large numbers of hemophiliacs, infected by tainted blood-clotting factors, and Haitians, because the virus had apparently reached the Americas there first.But the American public focused on two other high-risk groups, gay men and drug addicts, people long shunned by family-oriented Americans and the mostly heterosexual establishment.\u201cThey felt that this was a disease that resulted from a sleazy lifestyle, drugs or kinky sex \u2014 that certain people had learned their lesson and it served them right,\u201d Dr. Krim told The New York Times Magazine in 1988. \u201cThat was the attitude, even on the part of respectable foundations that are supposed to be concerned about human welfare.\u201dIn his book \u201cThe Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America\u201d (1997), Charles Kaiser wrote: \u201cOne scientist outside the government was more important than any other heterosexual in New York City in sounding the alarm about the growing crisis. Her name was Mathilde Krim.\u201dMoney for research and literature to educate the public were needed, and Dr. Krim had access to both. Her husband was the entertainment lawyer Arthur B. Krim, a former chairman of United Artists and Orion Pictures and of the Democratic National Finance Committee. He was a confidant of many national leaders, including Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter.Dr. Krim mobilized a galaxy of friends from the worlds of politics, the arts, entertainment, society and Wall Street. She organized art sales, auctions, fashion shows and other fund-raisers, held benefit parties at her Manhattan townhouse, gave television interviews, lobbied government officials and testified before Congress.And she dazzled them with her scientific knowledge, grounded in her doctoral studies at the University of Geneva, and her dignified appeals to conscience, in many languages. The daughter of parents of Swiss, Italian and Austrian heritage and a convert to Judaism who had joined the Zionist underground, Dr. Krim spoke Italian, German, French and Hebrew as well as English.In 1983, she and others created the AIDS Medical Foundation to raise money and support AIDS research. It often acted faster than federal agencies, which could take a year to process grants. In 1985, her group and another in Los Angeles merged to form the American Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Elizabeth Taylor was its founding international chairwoman, and Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen and Warren Beatty lent their names.The foundation became the nation\u2019s pre-eminent private supporter of AIDS research, prevention, treatment and advocacy. In 2005, when Dr. Krim stepped down as founding chairwoman, it was renamed the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR, reflecting its international scope. The foundation has raised and invested an estimated $517 million for thousands of programs.Using the foundation as her platform, Dr. Krim promoted needle-exchange programs and the use of condoms and other safe-sex practices; castigated religious leaders who denounced homosexuality as immoral; fought mandatory AIDS testing that might be used to persecute gay people; opposed the use of placebos in experimental drug trials, saying patients might be dead before outcomes were proved; and campaigned for laws to bar discrimination against gay people in housing and employment.Her effectiveness derived partly from her credentials. Besides earning her doctorate in biology, she had served on White House commissions and conducted research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and at the Cornell Medical College and Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.But it also arose from a moral perspective that could supersede science. She argued, for example, that heterosexuals and homosexuals were all one big risk group. American epidemiologists did not concur at the time, because so many victims were gay, but she was partly right: Although gay sex now accounts for most transmission in the United States, about 24 percent is through heterosexual sex, and women bear the brunt of that, often through sex with partners who conceal the fact that they are bisexual or injecting drugs.Dr. Krim sometimes waded into deep political waters. In 1990, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York asked her advice on naming a city health commissioner. She recommended Indiana\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr.But gay groups objected when they learned that Indiana, by law, recorded the names of people with AIDS and could even quarantine those who knowingly had unprotected sex. Although recording the names of carriers and tracing their contacts is standard practice in fighting venereal diseases, and though quarantine has been used to control outbreaks of, for example, drug-resistant tuberculosis, the advocates felt such measures would be stigmatizing.Dr. Krim and others on a search committee first stepped back for a reassessment, then re-endorsed Dr. Myers, then withdrew the endorsement. Dr. Myers was appointed anyway, and Dr. Krim found herself at odds with longtime allies. But her admirers tempered their ire with respect.\u201cI think she\u2019s exceptionally na\u00efve politically,\u201d said the playwright Larry Kramer, a prominent advocate for people with AIDS. \u201cWe are all very angry with her, so far as one can ever get angry with Mathilde, because we love her so.\u201dShe was born Mathilde Galland in Como, Italy, on July 9, 1926, to Eugene Galland, a Swiss-Italian, and the former Elizabeth Krause, an Austrian. Her father was an agronomist. The family moved to Geneva when Mathilde was 6.At the University of Geneva, Mathilde was a brilliant student of biology and genetics. Appalled by newsreels of Nazi concentration camps in 1945, she sought out Jewish activists, joined the Zionist underground Irgun and spent a summer smuggling guns over the French border for resistance fighters against British rule in Palestine.After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948, she married an Irgun comrade, David Danon, a Bulgarian medical student, and converted to Judaism. The couple had a daughter, Daphna, in 1951, and in 1953, after Mathilde received her doctorate, they emigrated to Israel, where the marriage ended in divorce.In 1954, she joined the research team of the German-born Israeli molecular biologist Leo Sachs at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. She studied cancer-causing viruses and helped write a dozen papers, including one by Dr. Sachs that laid groundwork for the prenatal diagnostic technique of amniocentesis, detecting gender and possible defects in a fetus.She married Mr. Krim, a Weizmann trustee, in 1958 and moved to New York the next year, exchanging pioneer life in a perpetual war zone for the Upper East Side and an illustrious social milieu.Restless for challenges, Dr. Krim resumed research \u2014 at Cornell Medical College from 1959 to 1962 and at Sloan Kettering from 1962 to 1985. She thought she glimpsed a cure for cancer in interferons \u2014 proteins released by body cells to fight pathogens \u2014 but it was not the cure-all she had envisioned. She was later an adjunct professor at Columbia University.Dr. Krim\u2019s many awards included the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. Awarded by President Bill Clinton in 2000, it recognized her \u201cextraordinary compassion and commitment.\u201dIn his book \u201cThe Gay Metropolis,\u201d Mr. Kaiser wrote that Dr. Krim had been disturbed by the initial indifference to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s in part because it carried echoes of her past.\u201cThe reaction of many of her heterosexual friends,\u201d he wrote, \u201creminded her of the stories she had heard about Jews during the war, before she knew any herself, that they were dirty and evil and deserved to die.\u201cDr. Krim was determined to prevent America from using AIDS to stigmatize homosexuals,\u201d he continued, \u201cand with the help of many of her famous Hollywood friends, she would be magnificently successful.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary misstated the actress Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s position with amfAR. As the obituary says, she was the founding international chairwoman, not the founding chairwoman. (That title was held by Dr. Krim.)An earlier version of this obituary referred incompletely to the founding of the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983. It was founded by Dr. Krim and several others; she was not the sole founder.Donald G. McNeil Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to the Neighborhood: America\u2019s Sports Stadiums Are Moving Downtown", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 Hours before the Sacramento Kings played their N.B.A. home opener in October, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 stood on the balcony of the team\u2019s new fourth-floor office at the $1 billion Downtown Commons. He watched hoops fans stream into the year-old Golden 1 Center. He smiled at guests swimming in the rooftop pool of the brand new, 250-room Kimpton Sawyer Hotel. Below him, the open-air plaza at street level bustled with life.\u201cFour years ago, this place was dead,\u201d said Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9, referring to downtown Sacramento, the capital city of the most-populous state in the union. Like many cities, Sacramento\u2019s urban core needed some serious rethinking. \u201cYou could have thrown a bowling ball,\u201d he said, \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t have hit a soul.\u201dNo longer. Three years after Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9, the owner of the Kings, partnered with the city to scrape away a nearly empty downtown mall, and a year after he opened the arena and the 1-million-square-foot commons, Sacramento is a city reborn.The number of downtown jobs has increased 38 percent, according to the Downtown Sacramento Partnership, a city economic development group. In the last year, 27 new stores have opened and 23 others are scheduled to open this year. So much construction is happening that the city has decided to hire two dozen new employees to process applications and building permits.And Sacramento is not alone. Across the country, in more than a dozen cities, downtowns are being remade as developers abandon the suburbs to combine new sports arenas with mixed-used residential, retail and office space back in the city. The new projects are altering the financial formula for building stadiums and arenas by surrounding them not with mostly idle parking lots in suburban expanses, but with revenue-producing stores, offices and residences capable of servicing the public debt used to help build these venues.The explosion in mixed-use developments like these is owed, in part, to the urban American economic renaissance. City populations grew faster from 2010 to 2016 than those in the suburbs, reversing a 60-year trend that started in 1950, according to census data. And cities \u2014 not suburbs \u2014 are the now primary generators of the nation\u2019s economic growth, according to research compiled by the Federal Reserve.\u201cIt\u2019s the one-square-mile effect,\u201d said Bruce Katz, an urban development specialist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cDowntowns and midtowns possess an enormous amount of value in a relatively small geography.\u201dFor years, owners used their team\u2019s popularity or perceived economic importance to strong-arm government officials. In many cases, owners threatened to move their teams if governments did not build them new stadiums along with the roads and public utilities needed to operate them.A 2016 study by the Brookings Institution found that 45 stadiums and arenas for the four major professional sports \u2014 football, baseball, basketball, hockey \u2014 were constructed or renovated in the United States from 2000 to 2014 at a cost of nearly $28 billion. Of that, $13 billion was publicly financed with tax-exempt bonds.But previous projects that foundered, particularly in the 1990s, point up the potential risk of these investments. \u201cWhat was at work in those deals was the idea that a large public subsidy for a stand-alone facility would keep the team in place and would stimulate economic activity,\u201d said Roger Noll, emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University. \u201cThe financial catastrophes that occurred convinced cities and residents that multimillion-dollar subsidies for stand-alone stadiums are a loser.\u201dUrban design specialists also raised their voices in opposition to the old model. They noted that generous public-stadium financing ignored almost every facet of sound real estate development, like location. America was producing a generation of isolated arenas in the suburbs and countryside, ringed by giant parking lots, many of which sat empty much of the year.That certainly characterized Detroit\u2019s comparatively brief experience with suburban sports stadiums. In 1975, the NFL Lions moved from the nine-acre, 63-year-old Tigers Stadium in Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood to the $55.7 million Silver Dome in Pontiac, which was surrounded by over 100 acres of surface parking near the center of the struggling Oakland County city. The team stayed until 2002, when it returned to Ford Field, a $500 million stadium alongside the two-year-old $300 million Comerica Park, the baseball Tiger\u2019s new home on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit. Both stadiums were partially financed with taxpayer dollars.Last year, Little Caesars Arena opened across the avenue, completing a strategic development vision, developed by business and civic leaders in the 1990s, that focused on professional sports as a catalyst for Detroit\u2019s revival. The NBA Pistons play in the new arena after spending the previous 29 seasons in The Palace of Auburn Hills, a 22,000-seat arena in a prosperous suburb 33 miles north of downtown Detroit that opened in 1988.If there is particularly good model for what\u2019s happening in Sacramento, it can probably be found in Kansas City and the city\u2019s Power and Light District. The $1 billion, 12-block district features a 150,000-square-foot covered plaza, more than 50 restaurants and taverns and hundreds of market-rate apartments. It opened in 2007 next to the city\u2019s publicly financed $263 million, 18,500-seat Sprint Center, which, though it does not host a professional team, has been frequently used as a site for college basketball games, including regional rounds of the annual NCAA tournament.Troy Schulte, city manager of Kansas City, explained how the project was initially seen as a risk but eventually remade his city and its finances. \u201cI was budget director at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the guy saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know if this is going to pay for itself.\u2019\u201dThe transition from empty parcels to crowded streets was swift. H & R Block opened its 17-story, 531,000 square foot headquarters in the neighborhood in 2006.A year later, the arena opened and so did a 150,000-square-foot KC Live! entertainment plaza across the street. Office workers strolled the sidewalks by day. Thousands more rolled into town for dinner and drinks before concerts and games, and stayed afterward to party.Mr. Schulte and his colleagues have been criticized for a consultant\u2019s overly enthusiastic estimate that the district would generate sufficient tax revenue to service the bond debt, which is $17 million this year. The district produces $6 million in revenue from taxes on property, sales, earnings and utilities.\u201cThat debt was issued with almost no safety cushion,\u201d a former city councilman, Dan Cofran, told The Kansas City Star in 2015. \u201cIt was reckless.\u201d Mr. Cofran said the project should have been smaller and constructed in stages.Mr. Schulte disagrees. He said the city tried to finance the development with a dedicated sales tax, which was rejected in a referendum. Depleted at its center and stranded in an era of sluggish growth, the city pursued what he said was the next best option \u2014 selling municipal bonds paid for with revenue from a special taxing district.Kansas City\u2019s tax base now raises $8 billion annually, with $2 billion from downtown activity. Before the Power and Light District opened, the city\u2019s tax base was $5 billion with $1 billion from downtown. There are now 40,000 downtown jobs, twice as many as a decade ago.Mr. Schulte acknowledges that although tax revenue from the district is steadily increasing, it is not clear that enough will be generated to cover the debt service. \u201cBut from the perspective of economic development and economic resurgence,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the best $300 million we\u2019ve ever spent.\u201dSacramento\u2019s downtown was ready for a makeover back in 2013, when Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 met with Mayor Kevin Johnson to consider a pitch by David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner, to buy the Kings.A growing city of about 480,000, and the hub of a seven-county metropolitan region with 2.4 million residents, Sacramento struggled for years to replace the home of the Kings, the 17,300-seat Sleep Train Arena, the smallest in the N.B.A. and which the team had played in since 1988.Various proposals to build a new arena in the same area, publicly financed with sales tax or other public sources were floated and then sunk, two times by failed ballot measures. As the venue aged and the Kings consistently lost more games than they won, the owners, the Maloof brothers, sought to sell the team. A buyer\u2019s group from Seattle, which lost its own N.B.A. team to Oklahoma City in 2008, was interested. But city officials were determined to keep the team \u2014 and Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9, who had become a Silicon Valley billionaire with the software company he founded, was a prime recruit to help make that happen.Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 had earlier parlayed the success of his company, TIBCO Software, into a role as vice chairman and co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, lending him credibility with Mr. Stern and Mr. Johnson, who himself had been an N.B.A. all-star during the 1990s.As part of the pitch, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 and Mr. Johnson toured a decrepit downtown mall that would be replaced with a new arena for the Kings. The mayor proposed spending $255 million, essentially a long-term loan, to construct the $560 million facility.Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 would be expected to pay the balance, plus 65 percent of the city\u2019s investment through a 35-year lease agreement and property taxes. When all was said and done, Sacramento\u2019s investment in an arena that it would own would be $86.7 million.The proposal departed from almost every previous arena-financing deal. Arena-construction packages that relied on public investments typically featured taxpayers paying all, or nearly all of the development costs without ever being paid back.Would Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 bite?He did. Visiting downtown Sacramento that day, he said, he envisioned crowds on the sidewalks, and in the space occupied by the near-empty 42-year-old mall, he saw a plaza surrounded by a state-of-the art arena, hotel, offices, restaurants and stores. And he sensed opportunity in a city desperate to keep its N.B.A. franchise.In May 2013, as the principal investor, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 bought the Kings for $534 million, at the time the highest price paid for an N.B.A. franchise up to that date. (It\u2019s since been eclipsed by the $2.2 billion paid last September for the Houston Rockets.) In buying the Kings, and agreeing to pay for more than half the new arena, he hoped to leverage his knowledge in technology, sports, information, and design to not only gain control of a sports franchise, but to revive what he considered an important American city.\u201cFour years ago, I said no other city is going to steal our team,\u201d Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cThe Kings are the heart and soul of the city.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populism Is Waning, Which Is Reason to Party in Davos", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 The World Economic Forum has never suffered from a lack of extravagance. But this year the champagne may be flowing even more freely than usual in the Swiss Alps resort of Davos, owing to a turn in the global situation pleasing to the sorts of people who make the annual pilgrimage \u2014 heads of state, corporate chieftains and those who manage extraordinary piles of money.The last time these putative guardians of civilization convened for this festival of internationalist concern, they found themselves in an uncustomary position: in the cross hairs of a global insurrection.From inside the World Economic Forum, which starts on Tuesday, these events seemed part of the same storm system, one energized by anger in many major economies over widening income gaps. Those wealthy enough to own jets \u2014 a group amply represented at Davos \u2014 were pulling away from everyone else. The resulting popular fury was threatening to tear down decades-old international agreements.The Davos crowd had plenty of reasons to feel fortunate before. Now, they have more.For the first time since the global economic downturn that began a decade ago, the world\u2019s major economies are growing in unison.\u201cThere are increasing signs that the global economy has turned a corner with evidence that resurgent economic confidence is beginning to match the optimism which has long been a feature of financial markets,\u201d declared Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank AG in London, in a recent note to clients. \u201cThe global economy looks to be on a solid footing, with global growth in 2018 expected to be the fastest since 2011.\u201dThough Europe appears far stronger than it did a year ago, a looming election in Italy could elevate the Five Star movement, a party that has been skeptical of the euro and the European Union.Not least, the same sources of anger that built the populist wave are still operative, even if the political tenor has \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 moderated.At last year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the official agenda was full of conversations about how to reform capitalism to make it more bountiful for broader portions of the public. It was not a new conversation for Davos attendees, but it had gained urgency with the sense that the pitchforks were then massed at the palace gates.Corporate executives with eight-figure compensation packages said that workers needed to take ownership of their own job training to earn more. Billionaire hedge fund managers suggested that the best way to make wages climb for working people was to cut taxes for the wealthiest.If anyone was inclined to suggest that one way to address inequality might be for people with enormous amounts of money to share some with the less affluent via progressive taxation, they did not enjoy a prominent platform at Davos (or in Washington, as it turned out).But the public-facing agenda is really just the wallpaper at Davos, a realm in which the world\u2019s largest financial institutions throw lavish dinners for clients in hotel ballrooms, where mergers are explored in private suites, where diplomacy is pursued, lucrative relationships are forged and pop bands entertain at parties underwritten by tech titans.Everywhere in Davos, signs remind the assembled of the World Economic Forum\u2019s stated mission \u2014 \u201cImproving the State of the World.\u201dBut for those who make it to the mountaintop, things are already pretty good. Indeed, they may be better than ever.All of which means that Davos is likely to present an especially raging party for those fortunate enough to attend this year.Those elsewhere on earth can be forgiven for wondering what all this lofty talk has to do with them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Church Deacon Found the Biggest Prime Number Yet (It Wasn\u2019t as Hard as You Think)", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA prime number discovery in December was made in the unlikeliest of places: on a church computer in a Memphis suburb.But for this behemoth to come to light, someone had to have installed free software used to search for Mersenne prime numbers, and that someone is Jon Pace, a deacon, FedEx finance manager and math aficionado who had spent 14 years hunting for such a number.\u201cThere are tens of thousands of computers involved in the search,\u201d Mr. Pace, 51, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. \u201cOn average, they are finding less than one a year. The odds of one of my computers making a prime number discovery are astronomical.\u201dAs the years went by, and other Mersenne prime numbers were found, Mr. Pace kept running the software in the background. \u201cThe C.P.U. will only work on it if there is literally nothing else for it to do,\u201d he said. He started with computers at home and then used the ones at the Germantown Church of Christ, where he is a deacon and the network administrator.Mr. Pace, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and an M.B.A., described growing up in a community so small and rural that there were \u201ccattle across the street.\u201d He said his passion for math was ignited by an inspirational high school teacher named Harold Knight, who had a reputation for putting together formidable math teams.\u201cHe was giving me problems that were unambiguous, as in there was one and only one correct answer,\u201d Mr. Pace said, explaining how this appealed to his problem-solver personality.\u201cHe\u2019d challenge me, and if I failed he\u2019d show me where I\u2019d made a mistake or used an incorrect method, then move to the next challenge,\u201d Mr. Pace recalled of the teacher, who died years ago.The moment of the discovery on Dec. 26 was not immediately apparent. The system is supposed to tell you if you find a Mersenne prime, Mr. Pace said, but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead George Woltman, who founded the Gimps project, emailed him.\u201cCongratulations Jon!\u201d Mr. Woltman wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s either a new Mersenne prime (99.999%)\u201d or a \u201cbug (.001%).\u201dThe software itself can help spot problems. Mersenne prime software is used to test computers for hardware errors, Mr. Woltman said. Smaller prime numbers are important to cryptography, but larger ones, so far, mostly just dazzle us.To demonstrate the length of the number, Mr. Pace said that it took 69\u00bd sheets of 11 by 17 paper to print out the number he found \u2014 in two-point font.Discoverers of a Mersenne prime get their names recorded and, if it\u2019s not a benchmark number, a modest cash prize. Mr. Pace is eligible for a $3,000 award. He has been interviewed by TV crews from as far away as Brazil.All that publicity has led his college-age son and daughter, who were less interested before, to proudly make it known that this nerdy discovery was made possible by their father.Mr. Pace\u2019s son, Bryan, 22, who is studying computer engineering and shares an interest in math, said that the recent success had motivated him to set up the Gimps program again on his own computer.And Mr. Pace\u2019s daughter, Katherine, 19, has her own thoughts about the discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m oddly proud of, even though it isn\u2019t actually my accomplishment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe coolest thing about it is really seeing my dad\u2019s humility on display. He is quick to tell people that anyone could have done it.\u201dIndeed, even as Mr. Pace promised to keep searching for the next big trophy \u2014 the 100-million-digit Mersenne prime, with a prize of $150,000 \u2014 he said there were two much smaller numbers he was even prouder of: \u201cthe 20 years I\u2019ve served as a deacon at Germantown,\u201d and \u201cthe 44 gallons of blood and platelets I\u2019ve donated in my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bargain Hunters Turn to Emerging Market Stocks", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBargain hunters have begun to pay close attention to emerging market stocks.They are a little late to the game. After all, momentum-driven investors have already noticed that shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like China and India came roaring back to life over the last year. Led by hot tech names such as Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group, many of them doubled in value in 2017.But now value-minded mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are rummaging in the parts of the emerging markets that many have ignored \u2014 staid sectors like manufacturing, mining and finance. Even these parts of the emerging markets posted sizable returns over the last year as global economic growth started to reaccelerate.But while the fast-growing segments of the emerging markets returned around 40 percent in 2017, the so-called value stocks rose about half as much.The more muted returns, coupled with the five-year bear market in emerging market equities before this surge, mean emerging market value stocks are still trading at relatively attractive prices. Some bargain hunters say emerging market value stocks are the only truly undervalued part of the global equity market.While the price-to-earnings ratio for the fastest-growing segments of the developing markets stands around 16, emerging market value stocks are trading at a P/E of just below 10.\u201cIf you can buy a well-diversified equity portfolio with a P/E of 10, you\u2019re getting an awful lot of earnings for each dollar of price you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Research Affiliates.There are risks, though, to the strategy of emphasizing value stocks in emerging markets. \u201cWhen most people think about the demographic trends driving the emerging markets and the high growth rates of India and parts of China, these things are all favorable to growth\u201d stocks, Mr. Jayaraman said \u2014 but not necessarily to value-oriented shares.But, he says, \u201cThe rubber band can only stretch so far\u201d when it comes to the rising prices of growth stocks.Ernest C. Yeung, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund, notes that in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate that much of the emerging markets have been mired in recently \u2014 where investors worry that growth will be hard to come by \u2014 \u201cpeople are willing to pay up for future growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why in this environment, high-quality growth stocks \u2014 names like Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 have done so well,\u201d he said. But that should start to shift, he said. \u201cWhen the macroeconomy recovers, value stocks normally begin to work.\u201dIn particular, value stocks in the financial industry stand to benefit.\u201cFinancials are a driven by the health of the macroeconomy and the direction of interest rates,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. And they\u2019re cheap.As a result, the stock now trades at just 0.7 times the bank\u2019s book value, which represents the net asset value of the company, compared with a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.5 to 2 before the global financial crisis. \u201cSo we are nowhere back to historical norms,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.The steel industry is another place that should thrive as the economy improves.\u201cThe common perception is that China keeps dumping cheap steel into the global markets,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. That may have been true several years ago, but the Chinese government recently carried out supply-side reforms that have reduced China\u2019s steel supply more than 20 percent, he said.As a result, Chinese exports have fallen more than 40 percent, creating breathing room \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for other emerging market steel producers.Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, notes that investors need not limit themselves to staid industries to gain exposure to attractively priced emerging market stocks.\u201cThink information tech based in Taiwan instead of China,\u201d she said.Why? A number of Taiwanese tech companies are regarded as old tech because they are involved in the manufacturing and supply chain that propels new economy tech products and services.Partly because Hon Hai is not regarded as a new economy name, the stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, compared with around 60 for Tencent Holdings, one of China\u2019s largest internet and social media companies.But Mr. Jayaram says that \u201cif we see better sales for iPhones in the first quarter, that could be a big catalyst\u201d to move Hon Hai\u2019s stock, too. And that creates a buying opportunity for bargain hunters right now.Advertisement"}

Our results, over the past several years, including 2017 and the insurance charge, only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape GE.\u201dIt\u2019s more likely that Mr. Flannery and his team will consider unique ways of separating G.E.\u2019s core business units without actually splitting them completely apart. But it\u2019s all somewhat speculative at the moment.It is now abundantly apparent that the previous management team led by Jeff Immelt had little handle on the comings and goings of all the pieces of this sprawling conglomerate. The reasons for keeping GE together \u2014 shared resources and technology \u2014 look increasingly tenuous. If you ask employees, they don\u2019t really see the benefit of having both a power and an aviation business, for example.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Michael J. de la MercedThe attorneys general said the rollback of so-called net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and a reversal of a longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.The petition to begin the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court of Appeals in Washington, is the first legal challenge against the F.C.C.\u2019s order in December.

At the same time, this move allows Nestl\u00e9 to invest and innovate across a range of categories where we see strong future growth and hold leadership positions, such as pet care, bottled water, coffee, frozen meals and infant nutrition.\u201dThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOne of Elliott\u2019s first campaigns of 2018 sees the activist hedge fund going even further abroad: Its latest target is Bezeq, the once-government-owned Israeli telecom company. The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.The context Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.What Elliott wants\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the companyAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.What could lie aheadBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release. (More on that below.)The backstoryThe advisers\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe firstQualcomm unveiled its first official \u201cfight letter\u201d in its campaign to beat back Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for the chip maker.Among the highlights of the letter:\u2022 Qualcomm says that it will deliver between $6.75 and $7.50 in pro forma earnings per share for its 2019 fiscal year.\u2022 A pledge to continue the company\u2019s its cost-savings program.\u2022 A reiteration that Broadcom\u2019s offer ignores the upswing that the emerging 5G wireless standard will bring for Qualcomm\u2019s stock.Broadcom is asking Qualcomm stockholders to voluntarily transfer to a hostile acquirer the considerable near- and long-term value creation Qualcomm has in front of it. It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.The secondRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done \u2014 but at a higher price.Should Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s a look at its results by the numbers:\u2014 Stephen GrocerGoldman\u2019s commodities unit has been under scrutiny both within the bank and among investors since it revealed its second-quarter performance was the worst in its post-IPO history. That triggered an informal review of the unit and several high-profile departures, including global commodities head Gregory Agran.The bank\u2019s commodities earnings in the final three months of 2017 were better than the previous two quarters as losing natural gas trades were closed. Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.Goldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time.It took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.And it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\u2014 Stephen GrocerVia ValueWalk:Despite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.More in corporate social activism \u201cThese guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures.\u201dIn other media deals:A few years ago I met with a very successful entrepreneur who built his company outside of the tech sector. When I asked him about equity compensation he said to me \u201cYou people in tech are crazy. I pay my employees handsomely in cash and I keep all of the equity for myself.\u201dHe adds:We should be confronting the true cost of this practice and asking ourselves if it is best for our employees, and if so, which ones, and if it is best for our companies and our shareholders.The tech and telecom flyaround\u201cWe talk to everybody, and we are continuously learning and making selections on the basis of the best available technology.\u201dMr. Marchionne also confirmed that this will be his last year leading Fiat Chrysler, with a successor to be named in March.The Detroit Auto Show flyaroundThat\u2019s an actual question posed in a private forum that was sent to us by a reader this weekend.Investors \u201cshould be prepared to lose all their money\u201d in Bitcoin, said Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong.The digital money flyarounddamageAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cutting Into Afghan Patronage: A Struggle to Make Government Younger", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When Ashraf Ghani, a former academic and World Bank technocrat, took office as the president of Afghanistan in 2014, he promised to change the way the country was governed by putting a new generation of Afghans into leadership positions.The long war with the Taliban was still raging. A disputed election had almost fractured the country. The treasury was drained. The state operated more as a patronage network for the elite than a government delivering to its people.But Mr. Ghani still saw an opportunity. He wanted to take a country stuck in a hostile geopolitical vise and held together by fragile compromises and transform it into a regional hub for trade and transportation between Central Asia and South Asia.To carry out this transformation, he would rely on a class of relatively young Afghans who since 2001 had gained better access to quality education, embraced new ideas from beyond their borders and appeared ready to buy into Mr. Ghani\u2019s vision. He promised to increase the number of government positions for women, who had struggled to find leadership jobs beyond the token ones.Three years later, Mr. Ghani\u2019s coalition, including his partner in government Abdullah Abdullah, has largely kept with that promise, injecting educated young people into senior positions across the government.But many of the young technocrats have found themselves in a daily struggle against long-entrenched patronage systems. And they have proved vulnerable in part because Mr. Ghani has been unable to manage the country\u2019s elite power brokers, who have a deep interest in keeping the patronage status quo, and has failed to create a political consensus for the reforms he wants.Although Mr. Ghani has tried to bring about a generational shift at the top by making an opening for the young and well educated, nepotism still trumps merit for much of the rest of country\u2019s civilian work force.Afghanistan produces 50,000 to 90,000 university graduates each year, but the government generally recruits applicants for only about 15,000 positions each year. Such is the competition that in recent months more than 280,000 people applied for 18,000 entry-level government positions. Entrenched patronage networks have long favored those with connections.The challenge for educated young men and women who lack connections to break into the bureaucracy can be seen from a visit to the Civil Service Commission, which regulates the recruitment of a civilian work force of 400,000 people.Once a week, the commission\u2019s new leaders \u2014 ranging in age from 26 to 42, and mostly government outsiders \u2014 open their doors to the public to hear tales of frustration and disillusionment with corruption from visitors who are mostly young, educated and heartbroken.One young man with a master\u2019s degree had been shortlisted for dozens of government positions over two years, but never got a final call. He said he was considering emigration. Another, who has a law degree from Egypt, was denied a position at Afghanistan\u2019s election commission despite having completed a rigorous recruitment process.\u201cWhat happened to all the calls for youth to come work for the government?\u201d the young man said.Nader Nadery, the chairman of the Civil Service commission, said his team had two urgent missions. One is to revamp the government\u2019s recruitment process, replacing patronage and favors with transparency and technology to ensure merit.The other mission is trying to change, one conversation at a time, a deeply rooted culture in which an Afghan visiting a government office can often expect humiliating treatment.They begin with consoling disappointed applicants.\u201cI am sorry for what you have been through,\u201d Mr. Nadery said to the young man turned down for a job. \u201cYour case, unfortunately, is not an exception \u2014 often the reality is that hiring happens based on biases. But we need your patience. Until a new system takes the place of connections and meddling, it will take a little time.\u201dAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in the United States, Abdullah Habibzai, a 33-year-old university lecturer in engineering, began writing about the urban chaos of Kabul, the capital. The city was designed for a million people but now houses as many as five million. Seventy percent of its growth is unplanned.President Ghani read some of the writings and, in the spring of 2016, asked Mr. Habibzai to meet with him. After a brief conversation, the president appointed him to be Kabul\u2019s deputy mayor, and within a month Mr. Habibzai was promoted to acting mayor.With Mr. Ghani\u2019s blessing, Mr. Habibzai started revamping the mayor\u2019s office, which employs about 8,000 people and tens of thousands of contractors. He replaced 80 percent of the top officials with Western-educated Afghans 25 to 35 years old who, in one of the country\u2019s oldest and most corrupt institutions, operate the city government like a start-up enterprise.\u201cBeing Kabul mayor is not an easy task \u2014 this city has problems that no other capital has,\u201d said Sayed Makhdoom Raheen, a former minister of culture. \u201cThe people expect overnight change, and they have the right to. They have been pained and slapped by misfortunes. But I see the future of this city as bright with a young mayor who understands the challenges.\u201dBut Mr. Habibzai said that he underestimated the political resistance he would face, and has found himself pleading with the president and Kabul\u2019s residents for more time to carry out his promised changes.At city meetings Mr. Habibzai clicks through PowerPoint presentations, his soft voice barely audible above the screeching of chairs. He explains how he has increased the city\u2019s revenue by about $14 million, designed new roads and a bus system to ease congestion, and developed plans to transform the traffic police, now equipped with only whistles and paddles, into a force with body cameras and tablet computers.The struggles faced by young women in the government have been even more formidable.Last year, Mr. Ghani asked Nargis Nehan, 37, to run, and clean up, the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, a crucial institution if Afghanistan is to ever tap into its natural resources. Years earlier, when Mr. Ghani served as finance minister, he appointed Ms. Nehan as the director of revenue collection when she was only 23. He trusted her incorruptibility in the face of pressures from criminal networks.For several months after her appointment early last year as she waited for parliamentary approval, Ms. Nehan worked to gain the trust of the ministry\u2019s staff. But when Parliament later voted to confirm a list of ministerial appointments, she was the only nominee among 12 who was rejected.\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d said Adela Raz, a deputy foreign minister. \u201cShe is a strong woman, she is capable and she knows what she is doing.\u201d But, she added, \u201cthe majority of the men could not process the fact that this woman should be a minister.\u201dMs. Raz was appointed to her post in 2016 when she was 30, and she looks after a portfolio that is central to Mr. Ghani\u2019s vision: regional economic and political cooperation. She said that young women in the government were struggling against a culture in which men were not used to the idea of women in positions of power.\u201cThey get confused, totally confused,\u201d Ms. Raz said. \u201cThey try to fit this individual into the image they have in their head, and it doesn\u2019t fit.\u201dThe work is draining, Ms. Raz said, with daily indignities against women, from the bias shown in seating arrangements at high-level meetings to the disrespectful behavior of guards at the entrances of government buildings. But she said that she still believed that if members of her generation, having found a champion in Mr. Ghani, could tough it out they could change the culture of Afghanistan\u2019s government.\u201cThere were days I literally thought, \u2018This is my last day,\u2019\u201d Ms. Raz said. \u201cI felt I would just go upstairs, pick up my purse, and go.\u201d\u201cWe are going to be crushed, we will be disappointed, we will be hurt,\u201d she added. \u201cI have been, a lot of times. But I pulled myself back, and we will have to continue to do so until we become the majority within the system. It is absolutely possible.\u201dJawad Sukhanyar and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Testimony in Corruption Case Hinges on the Meaning of \u2018Meatballs\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was not immediately clear what role the meatball testimony played in jurors\u2019 deliberations.When is a meatball not a meatball?That was the question in a federal courtroom in Pennsylvania on Thursday, where the mayor of Allentown, Pa., is on trial for charges wholly unrelated to that beefy fixture of nonnas\u2019 kitchens across the country.It is a classic allegation of City Hall corruption. And as Allentown\u2019s former finance director Garret H. Strathearn testified for the prosecution that he had helped nudge a contract toward a company affiliated with one of Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s supporters, talk turned to the classic dish.The question turned on whether Mr. Strathearn and Mike Fleck, a political consultant for Mr. Pawlowski, were really discussing meatballs \u2014 seared, simmered and sauced \u2014 in a series of phone calls, or whether they had taken a cue from shady deals of yore and were using \u201cmeatballs\u201d as a code word for a payoff.In the recording, Mr. Strathearn is heard asking Mr. Fleck if he can come over to pick up some meatballs, and Mr. Fleck tells him to come by. In court, Ms. Morgan sought to portray Mr. Strathearn as a man who simply liked a good meatball, and asked if Mr. Strathearn had ever eaten the Fleck family meatballs.Mr. Strathearn said that he had indeed eaten meatballs prepared by the family at a Christmas party, and that Mr. Fleck\u2019s wife had promised to make him some more.\u201cI said, \u2018Well, they\u2019re really delicious,\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll make you some,\u2019 and that\u2019s what it was; they made me some meatballs,\u201d Mr. Strathearn said.In response to further questions from Ms. Morgan, Mr. Strathearn said that he was unmarried at the time, and that he kept Tupperware in his car so he could take home leftovers whenever possible.And, she asked, did he actually pick up said meatballs?\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Mr. Strathearn said, adding that he got fewer than he expected: four.But Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s lawyer, Jack McMahon, seemed to view \u201cmeatballs\u201d as something more in line with \u201cclams,\u201d \u201cdough\u201d and \u201ccheddar.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to get your meatballs,\u201d Mr. Fleck said, according to The Morning Call. Mr. Strathearn later replied, \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to lose that meatball recipe, you know?\u201dMr. McMahon, the defense lawyer, was incredulous, and the ensuing exchange in court prompted an hail of objections from prosecutors.\u201cYou want these people to believe that it\u2019s really meatballs?\u201d Mr. McMahon said, his voice rising. \u201cIt\u2019s a payoff.\u201dMr. Strathearn eventually responded, with a line that rivals one of Gertrude Stein\u2019s finest: \u201cThe meatballs were the meatballs were the meatballs.\u201d\u201cThere was nothing to do with anything other than meatballs, period, paragraph,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd don\u2019t laugh, because that tells me that you don\u2019t believe me.\u201dJudge Juan R. Sanchez, clearly exasperated, called a short recess, and then told the jury to ignore that exchange, according to The Morning Call.Meatballs are, of course, a rich and versatile dish \u2014 equally at home on pasta, rice or a sandwich \u2014 and it is not impossible to imagine them joining the vast library of code words for illicit activity.Mr. Pawlowski, who was re-elected to his fourth term last fall despite the charges against him, has pleaded not guilty and has indicated plans to take the stand in his own defense. It is not known whether the subject of meatballs will come up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does \u2018Three Billboards\u2019 Say Anything About America? Well \u2026", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, that movie was \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Two years before that, it was arguably \u2014 suddenly \u2014 \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d (winner of nothing especially big, but big in the meaning we ascribed it). In 2005, it was \u201cCrash.\u201d This year, the entrant is \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d The movie won four Golden Globes, including best drama, making it a contentious Oscar favorite (the nominations come our way Jan. 23.)\u201cThree Billboards\u201d is about a mother determined to humiliate and harass a small-town police force into solving the months-old rape and murder of her teenage daughter. Frances McDormand plays the woman \u2014 her name is Mildred Hayes \u2014 and the billboards are the site of her campaign. \u201cRaped while dying,\u201d reads one. \u201cAnd still no arrests,\u201d read another. \u201cHow come, Chief Willoughby?\u201d asks the last.What\u2019s got people arguing is whether the movie is convincingly about America (Ebbing is as real a place as Narnia) and whether this movie about America ought to be, say, redeeming one of the racist cops serving and protecting Ebbing. Of course, anybody who loves \u201cCrash\u201d already knows the answer to that one \u2014 \u201cWhy not!\u201dThe reason to do any barking \u2014 well, the reason for me \u2014 is that \u201cThree Billboards\u201d feels so off about so many things. It\u2019s one of those movies that really do think they\u2019re saying something profound about human nature and injustice. It\u2019s set in the country\u2019s geographical middle, which should trigger a metaphor alert. We\u2019re talking about the sort of heartland populated by average-looking people meant to be made poetically interesting by their exotic brides (from Australia!), dying words (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d) and symbolically sadistic late-night film taste (one vindictive woman who isn\u2019t Mildred is glued to \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now\u201d). Individually, not one of these choices qualifies as a disaster. But they\u2019re conflated here in a way that achieves a grating otherworldliness.This is a revenge movie that\u2019s also a dead-child tragedy that\u2019s also a local-law-enforcement comedy that leaves room for physical comedy, cancer and a bad date. Someone is thrown from a window. Somebody else smashes through one while on fire. And Mildred seems desperate to believe in the power of the billboards as a shaming vehicle for justice. Meanwhile, the issues of the day come and go: brutal police, sexual predators, targeted advertising. It\u2019s like a set of postcards from a Martian lured to America by a cable news ticker and by rumors of how easily flattered and provoked we are.The Martian is actually Martin McDonagh, a playwright from the U.K. \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is his third movie (\u201cIn Bruges\u201d and \u201cSeven Psychopaths\u201d precede this one), and the second set in the United States. He\u2019s a dramatist and a linguist who can be glorious about the ordinariness and misery of duty and work. His plays \u2014 like \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane\u201d or \u201cThe Cripple of Inishmaan\u201d \u2014 tether behavior to state of mind. You believe what people do because they appear to be making the choices \u2014 ugly ones \u2014 as opposed to an author you can picture yanking the strings.But his movies are all strings. Often they feel as if other filmmakers are doing the pulling. \u201cIn Bruges\u201d featured two hit men on a chatty stroll in Belgium, and certain people\u2019s passion for it is fit for Valentine\u2019s Day. But it was Tupperware Tarantino to me.To \u201cThree Billboards\u201d admirers and to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the outfit that hands out the Golden Globes, something about the movie rings true or feels timely. That presumption of truth is driving some of the annoyance over this movie. My favorite bad thing about \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is its ambition to play around with America\u2019s ideological and geographical toys.One of the toys is the word \u201cnigger.\u201d Another is the concept of political correctness. There\u2019s a scene between Mildred and a hotheaded dimwit cop \u2014 the racist \u2014 named Jason (Sam Rockwell), in which she baits his racism by calling him a \u201cnigger torturer.\u201d He hits the roof. \u201cPerson-of-color-torturing\u201d is what Jason says you must call it now, with exasperated lament. They volley the word and poke fun at its impropriety. You can tell that Mr. McDonagh relished the application of absurdism to the political correction (he knows \u201cperson-of-color-torturing\u201d really is linguistic torture, maybe even for a person of color). But he also seems to like the loaded nonsense in the sound of the word \u201cnigger.\u201d What you hear in a scene like this is a kind of careless virtuosity. It\u2019s a fun scene that\u2019s sunk by how much fun it\u2019s having with things you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with. The whole movie is like that \u2014 it\u2019s like Mildred \u2014 rude for sport and proud of it.There\u2019s certainly a place for a white artist to poke, laughingly, at our racial and class messes. (Mel Brooks, for instance, excelled at it.) But Mr. McDonagh doesn\u2019t want to do more than poke. The Danish director Lars von Trier tried a more explicit damnation of the United States with \u201cDogville\u201d (2003) and \u201cManderlay\u201d (2005). But I liked the nihilism in Mr. von Trier\u2019s respective approximations of racism and slavery, even if he followed a European habit, especially in documentaries, of diagnosing America\u2019s ills in the least surprising and most patronizing way.For a movie that asks you to behold so much violence \u2014 defenestration and talk of rape, a bludgeoning, a suicide, charred skin, a dental drill that treats a thumb like drywall \u2014 \u201cThree Billboards\u201d feels weirdly benign. Its black comedy doesn\u2019t leave a bruise. The violence curdles into the cartoonish. The movie could be about grace and vengeance, but they\u2019re presented as hoary lessons and hokey contrivances \u2014 happening upon a deer, sharing your orange juice with the madman who tried to murder you, juxtaposing the reading of an inspirational letter with an inferno. There\u2019s no reckoning with anything, no introspection, just escalating mayhem. The mix of the silly and the serious puts the movie in Coen brothers territory. But they can adjust the settings for their cynicism. Even at their worst, they\u2019ve got their finesse. Mr. McDonagh just keeps bashing away.This really is an action movie whose action is played for laughs. Mildred beats up teenagers and tells off priests. Her precision with a Molotov cocktail should land her in the Super Bowl. Ms. McDormand certainly makes the most of the tirade machine Mr. McDonagh has built for her. (Not since \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d has anybody gotten to tell off this many people with this much gusto.) You feel for Mildred, but you fear her more. When she approaches a table in a restaurant carrying a wine bottle, the audience practically begs her not to use it. By this point, Mildred is way past being a mad mommy. She\u2019s Charles Bronson.But she\u2019s not the only bereft mother fueled by vengeance. The foreign language Golden Globe went, in a surprise, to Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cIn the Fade,\u201d which has Diane Kruger as a white German who must endure the legal trial of the neo-Nazi terrorists who killed her Turkish-German husband and their young son. It doesn\u2019t rank up there with \u201cHead-On\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d (2007), Mr. Akin\u2019s masterwork melodramas. It\u2019s too well oiled a machine, too morally simple to be completely satisfying. But it\u2019s more clear-eyed and serious than \u201cThree Billboards\u201d about what it means to inflict pain. Maybe there\u2019s a way to laugh through rage, but Mr. Akin doesn\u2019t know what way that would be. Neither, I would argue, does Mr. McDonagh.Frances McDormand\u2019s leading turn in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d is being praised as one of the finest of her career. But that\u2019s no small claim, considering the variety and power of her filmography thus far.I thought a lot about this movie watching \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d an eight-part, sitcom-length show created by Dan Perrault and Tony Yacenda, on Netflix. It parodies the true-crime boomlet epitomized by \u201cThe Jinx\u201d on HBO, \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d on Netflix and podcasts like \u201cSerial.\u201d And, like \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d the series revolves around jerks. Someone spray-painted 27 penises on 27 cars in the staff parking lot of a high school in Oceanside, Calif. And two student reporters investigate. The prime suspect \u2014 a stoner-skate punk senior named Dylan Maxwell \u2014 has been expelled. The two reporters poke holes in the case against him and explore a gamut of alternative culprits.Like Mr. McDonagh\u2019s movie, \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d takes a circuitous route to earnestly asked philosophical questions about human nature. The show has a breezy confidence that never tips all the way into mockery. But it\u2019s a lot less impressed with itself. It undermines the piety and ethical lapses in nonfiction mystery shows, while sharing with \u201cThree Billboards\u201d a belief in semaphores and that people aren\u2019t any one thing. Also \u2014 and this feels important \u2014 it feels like the people who made this show understand their setting and the people who live there. I\u2019ve never been to Oceanside, but I believe this show\u2019s rendition of it.Even in a setting as generic as an American high school, the show has a sense of place. And it\u2019s a white show whose nonwhite characters don\u2019t feel like objects. I\u2019m not sure what Ebbing is. You can feel that uncertainty in the movie\u2019s cop-out of a finale, in its bewildering loftiness (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d as a character\u2019s last words) and in the coveralls Mildred spends most of the movie wearing. Her job is at a rustic gift shop, but the coveralls point to the harder blue-collar work we\u2019ve seen Ms. McDormand do in movies like \u201cNorth Country.\u201d Here, these clothes signify emotional work, yet they feel like a put-on, too. Three billboards, sure \u2014 but outside a coffee shop in Portland, Ore.The movie isn\u2019t an explicit work of politics, but it reaches something political in certain people in the same way it touches something emotional in others. And yet in arguing about this movie what I don\u2019t want, but where I\u2019m afraid we are \u2014 with lots of film this time every year \u2014 is in another fight over a movie\u2019s politics that manages to leave the movie itself behind.Whose fault is that? We\u2019ve been seduced and bullied into thinking of the awards season as a process of politics.

{"Headline": "How the Finance Industry Is Trying to Cash In on #MeToo", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAccusations of sexual harassment have felled dozens of executives, but in one quiet corner of the financial world, the #MeToo movement looks like a golden opportunity.Companies that offer money to plaintiffs in anticipation of future legal settlements are racing to capitalize on sexual harassment lawsuits.That is setting off alarms in some quarters because the industry, like payday lenders, has a history of providing cash at exorbitant interest rates to customers who need the money for living and sometimes medical expenses.The largely unregulated companies have operated with less public scrutiny than the rest of the litigation finance industry, which provides money to law firms to fund commercial lawsuits.Historically, settlement-advance businesses have targeted personal injury and medical malpractice plaintiffs, many of them referred by their lawyers. But in recent months, lawyers say, more pitches are directed at women with sexual harassment claims.The settlement-advance firms get paid back only if a plaintiff collects money from a lawsuit. They make money by charging interest rates as high as 100 percent, which they are able to do because technically the money is considered an advance \u2014 not a loan \u2014 and therefore is not subject to state usury laws.Consumer groups call the industry predatory. The companies counter that they are providing a vital service to people without other options.Legal and business experts said there are scores of firms providing advances to tens of thousands of plaintiffs each year. The largest firms make cash advances totaling up to $40 million a year, according to an unpublished 2014 report by Diligence, a business intelligence firm.Legal Bay of Fairfield, N.J., is one of the settlement-advance firms trawling for sexual harassment clients.Mr. Janish said he did not know if the pitches had landed any clients. \u201cIt just really is more of a public awareness and branding thing,\u201d he said.The firms advertise on television and include hot-button search terms on their websites to lure traffic. That was how Heather Rothermund of Redding, Calif., learned of Nova Legal Funding in Los Angeles last summer. She had sued her employer, an adult care facility, for failing to discipline a co-worker who she said had groped her breasts and forced his hands down her jeans. Along with a state civil rights agency, she sought $250,000 in damages. The facility\u2019s owner did not respond to a request for comment.Ms. Rothermund, 41, said the alleged assault left her with bills for therapy and anxiety medications that she couldn\u2019t afford. Her car was about to be repossessed when she came across Nova\u2019s online advertisement. The company advanced her $2,000 against an anticipated future legal settlement, she said.The money got her out of a financial hole and helped her avoid having to accept a lowball settlement offer. She said that if the case settled within the year she might owe $4,000 \u2014 double what she borrowed. If the case drags on, she will owe more.\u201cIt is expensive, but it does help and it is available,\u201d Ms. Rothermund said.For the past two decades, settlement-advance companies have been chasing the hottest \u2014 and most lucrative \u2014 trends in litigation. They have provided advances to victims of surgical vaginal mesh products; those suffering from ailments related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks; and former National Football League players with brain injuries.Mr. Colwell said his firm had been providing cash advances to women with sexual harassment claims for 15 years. He said many clients worked in less glamorous industries than Hollywood and needed money to cover basic living expenses.Only a handful of states regulate or license the settlement-advance firms, and little more than a website is necessary to get into the business.Legal Bay\u2019s promotional materials don\u2019t mention Mr. Janish\u2019s past. He said his legal history wasn\u2019t relevant to customers. \u201cMy only obligation is to disclose to them the terms of the money they seek,\u201d he said.The industry says it charges high fees to compensate for the risk of not being repaid.But the industry\u2019s lucrative model has attracted mainstream financial institutions. The D. E. Shaw hedge fund, the private equity firms Parthenon Capital and Victory Park Capital, and Germany\u2019s DZ Bank have either bought stakes in or lent money to settlement-advance firms. D. E. Shaw has sold its stake in Oasis Financial.In addition to providing cash upfront to sexual harassment plaintiffs, some firms are pursuing the more traditional form of litigation finance, providing money to law firms in exchange for a cut of potential settlements.Nova \u2014 the same company that advanced money to Ms. Rothermund \u2014 plans to announce that it will provide financing for lawyers pursuing Hollywood sexual harassment cases.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to level the playing field in cases against big Hollywood players,\u201d said Ron Sinai, Nova\u2019s founder.And Legalist, a San Francisco litigation finance start-up, said that a Weinstein-related marketing pitch had attracted new clients, and that the company was now bankrolling three lawsuits against alleged sexual abusers.The practices used by the settlement-advance industry have proved particularly controversial, uniting consumer groups and big business in opposition. Consumer activists argue that recipients don\u2019t understand how quickly the costs accumulate. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argue that cash advances artificially drive up litigation costs.\u201cI would never recommend an individual finance his or her recovery,\u201d said Robert Kraus, a New York employment lawyer. \u201cIt is inconsistent for a lawyer, if he believes in a client\u2019s case, to recommend that he or she should limit their recovery.\u201dSome of the larger settlement-advance firms use lawyers to drum up business. The firms recruit lawyers in much the same way that pharmaceutical companies woo doctors: with perks such as holiday gift baskets and invitations to year-end parties.At Oasis, one of the industry\u2019s biggest players, employees who got a lawyer to send at least three clients in a year were celebrated as \u201chunters,\u201d according to court documents in an employment dispute.Michael Gibson, a former case manager at Oasis, said he had worked on up to 70 cases a day. The typical customer, he said, borrowed less than $2,000 but paid a fee that was the equivalent of an 80 percent annual interest rate.\u201cMy personal opinion is that legal financings are predatory loans,\u201d Mr. Gibson said.Some customers say the cost is worth it.Nickie Burdick, 28, had been unable to work for two years after she was injured in a car accident. Ms. Burdick, of Batavia, N.Y., said her attorney had suggested she take out a loan against a potential settlement in her case.She knew the rates were steep, but she didn\u2019t see another viable option, she said. She recently has been borrowing $2,000 a month from Oasis, accruing $220 in fees each time.\u201cIt was either that or I lose my house and be homeless,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Republicans Vote to Release Secret Memo on Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vote, made along party lines, threw fuel on an already fiery partisan conflict over the investigations into Russia\u2019s brazen meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Republicans invoked a power never before used by the secretive committee to effectively declassify the memo that they had compiled. It was an extraordinary maneuver, cheered on by President Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed the Russia investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a sham.Committee Republicans said the memo\u2019s release would shed useful light on potential political bias that may have warped the early stages of the Russia investigation without compromising intelligence gathering. Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, a senior Republican on the committee, said on Monday that he was confident the Republican memo itself would not present a national security risk and was complete and fair as written.Democrats called the three-and-a-half-page document a dangerous effort to build a narrative to undercut the department\u2019s continuing Russia investigation, using cherry-picked facts assembled with little or no context. Speaking to reporters after the closed-door vote, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said Republicans had voted \u201cto politicize the intelligence process.\u201d\u201cSadly, we expect that the president of the United States will not put the national interest over his own personal interest,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut it is a sad day indeed when that is also true of our own committee.\u201dMr. Schiff said the committee had opened new avenues to investigate the Justice Department and F.B.I., a characterization disputed by Mr. Conaway.What comes next was less clear. Under the obscure House rule invoked by the committee, Mr. Trump now has five days to review the document and decide whether to try to block it from going public. The White House has repeatedly indicated that it wants the memo out, but Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department had been working to slow or block its release.Shortly after Monday\u2019s vote, the memo was taken to the White House, where it was being reviewed by White House lawyers, according to a person familiar with the review.Voting as a bloc, Democrats tried to advance a series of motions on Monday that they said would help put the Republican memo in context. All but one of those motions failed along party lines. The committee did make a Democratic memo rebutting the Republican version available to the full House, but Republicans said they wanted time for members to review the document before considering its public release.The inclusion of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s action in the memo could expose him to a torrent of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from conservatives in the news media who have seized on the surveillance to argue that the Russia investigation may have been tainted from the start. Mr. Rosenstein is overseeing that investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. It was Mr. Rosenstein who appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel.To obtain the surveillance warrant, the government would have had to demonstrate probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. Investigators must seek approval from the Justice Department for such a warrant, and then prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge.People familiar with the underlying application have portrayed the Republican memo as misleading in part, they say, because Mr. Steele\u2019s information was insufficient to meet the standard for a FISA warrant. They said the application drew on other intelligence material that the Republican memo selectively omits. That other information remains highly sensitive, and releasing it would risk burning other sources and methods of intelligence-gathering about Russia.Democrats tried unsuccessfully on Monday to push forward a motion for the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to brief the entire House in a private session on that material before the release of the Republican memo so that they could make a more informed judgment about its contents.There is no known precedent for the Republicans\u2019 action. Though House rules allow the Intelligence Committee to vote to disclose classified information if it is deemed to be in the public interest, the rule is not thought to have ever been used. Typically, lawmakers wishing to make public secretive information classified by the executive branch spend months, if not years, fighting with the White House and the intelligence community over what they can release.Until this past weekend, the committee had refused to let anyone from the Justice Department or the F.B.I., who provided the materials underlying the memo, review it. Representative Devin Nunes of California relented on Sunday, allowing Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, to review the document. But Mr. Schiff said later in the day that Mr. Wray had conveyed to him that he still had concerns about its release.In a letter last week to Mr. Nunes, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d to release a memo drawing on classified information without official review. He said the department is \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing related to the FISA process.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin largely stayed out of the dispute, deferring to Mr. Nunes and the committee on how to proceed.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, was not so circumspect.\u201cClearly, House Republicans\u2019 desire to protect President Trump has clouded their judgment and caused them to lose sight of what\u2019s at stake: the security and integrity of our elections,\u201d her office said in a statement.Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It has been a long time.So when was the last time the market fell 5 percent from a recent high? The aftermath of Brexit in June 2016.The statement is part of a legal settlement that Mr. Ford reached over the weekend with Morgan Stanley, according to a person who was briefed on the resolution but was not authorized to speak publicly. The broader contours of the settlement were unclear, including whether there was a financial component. Through a spokesman, Mr. Ford declined to comment.Before his firing last month, Mr. Ford had spent seven years at Morgan Stanley recruiting clients. He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006.Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014. At the time, Morgan Stanley said he had been fired \u201cfor conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.\u201d Some media reports of his firing said it had been triggered by the harassment allegation.Since Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point emerged as an investor in the Swiss food giant, Nestl\u00e9 has sold off its U.S. confectionary business, named new directors and bought Blue Bottle coffee.All of those have been great moves, according to the hedge fund. But there\u2019s more to be done, Third Point wrote in its latest letter to investors.From the investor letter:These actions are important steps in the right direction that make it clear that Nestle\u0301 is responding to calls for action. While we recognize that Nestle\u0301 has certain unique cultural and structural constraints, we hope now that Dr. Schneider has completed his first year and there is new blood on the Board, the company is able to move with greater alacrity.What Third Point wants\u2022 Better demonstrate that the company is focused on \u201cnutrition, health and wellness,\u201d with the implication being to divest products like ice cream and frozen pizza.\u2022 Buy back more shares.\u2022 Again consider selling the L\u2019Oreal stake, something Nestl\u00e9 has been loath to do historically.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMore from the article by Michael Kranish of the WaPo:\u201cAll I know is that we are not at all concerned, and we are cooperating,\u201d Kushner said in a half-hour interview at his headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue. \u201cAnd they can knock themselves out for the next 10 years reading those papers as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201dThe elder Mr. Kushner also lamented the amount of criticism that his son, a senior presidential adviser, has taken:\u201cI try not to focus in my life on the haters but it\u2019s just, I have never seen anything like this,\u201d Kushner said. \u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe transaction is expected to bolster the A.I.G.\u2019s general insurance business, by adding a reinsurance platform, an insurance-linked securities asset manager and \u201ca meaningful presence\u201d at the Lloyd\u2019s of London marketplace.Here\u2019s what Brian Duperreault, A.I.G.\u2019s chief executive, said:\u201cValidus is an excellent strategic fit for AIG, bringing new businesses and capabilities to our General Insurance operation, expanding the bench of our management team and deepening our underwriting expertise.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayRemember that earlier this month, Celgene agreed to pay up to $7 billion for Impact Biomedicines, which also makes a treatment for a kind of blood cancer.Celgene, which is based in Summit, N.J., already owns about 9.7 percent of Juno\u2019s shares.Here\u2019s what Mark Alles, Celgene\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers.\u201dThe detailsThe advisers\u2014 Chad BrayFrom a recent note by analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics:We would be astonished if Congress could not cobble together a majority of the sane in order to prevent a default. But astonishment has been quite common in response to events over the past couple of years, so investors would be well-advised to rule out nothing, however outlandish.Where things standElsewhere in WashingtonThe tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture.Improving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum.Yet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.So what gives? The tax law.Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201dExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.Two points of note:Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it\u2019s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.Mr. Chakrabarti added that while the company was slow to address Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s working to prevent it happening again.More news from FacebookThe tech flyaroundMore from the FT\u2019s Martin Arnold and Miles Johnson:Tiger Global appears to back Mr. Staley\u2019s view that the bank\u2019s 40 percent discount to book value is unjustified after it recently completed its multiyear restructuring and sold off most of its African operation to address longstanding concerns about its capital levels.UBS\u2019s turnaround hits a bumpMore from Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Matt Goldstein of the NYT:Officials from human resources interviewed as many as a dozen people who have worked with Mr. Malik. He left roughly two weeks before annual bonuses were to be handed out.The misconduct flyaroundHere\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, told Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:\u201cI would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus\u2019s worth of electricity consumption to global warming.\u201dSome, however, say an independent, decentralized monetary system is worth the cost.The virtual currency flyaround\u201cI truly believe I was put on this Earth to make money, but also to be generous with it.\u201dto tosaleAdvertisement"}

No wonder the system is a wreck.To the Editor:Nowhere in all the mentioned improvements of our antiquated subway system do I see any suggestion of installing more escalators for the use of elderly and disabled passengers.It is inconceivable, in light of the Americans With Disabilities Act, that our subways have not been required to provide these amenities, which are essential for so many people.How many times have you located the rare platform escalator and found the dreaded orange traffic cone in front of it, indicating that it is, once again, out of order?We should be ashamed to subject our citizens and visitors to such conditions. I recently visited Paris and was blown away by the improvements in its subway amenities. There are many more escalators (no traffic cones in sight!) and moving sidewalks! We can certainly do as well or better.To the Editor:While many of the ideas put forth by transit experts sound great, the rush to automated self-driving trains is not realistic or safe for New York City. Neither is the idea of permanently shutting down service at night. How many of these experts consistently ride the trains? Ignorance is not bliss in this situation.The main focus should be on modernizing the signals, properly maintaining subway cars and rehabilitating stations. Over the years, the MetroCard has done well by the M.T.A. Amid all the chaos plaguing the system, is now the time to replace it? Wouldn\u2019t that money be better spent modernizing signals?NICK GATSOULIS, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The political and financial agreements to run the city subways have largely been broken since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was created more than 50 years ago.The mayor wants to tax wealthy residents in New York City, and the governor wants to create revenue from new congestion pricing that requires state legislative approval. Both approaches have many slippery slopes.Until a unified funding program agreement occurs and the management merry-go-round stops going in circles and promotes consistent, long-term planning, the system will not move forward.FLOYD LAPP, NEW CITY, N.Y.The writer is a former director of transportation at the New York City Department of City Planning.To the Editor:Your comprehensive report on subway construction brings to mind Boss Tweed\u2019s looting of the city\u2019s coffers. Isn\u2019t it time to bid out subway expansion to private operators? Find out what a private firm would expect to be paid to build the remaining three phases of the Second Avenue subway.As with the original Interborough Rapid Transit company, the private firm would own and operate all the new stations, collecting and keeping the fares at all the new stations, and bearing the continuing cost of maintaining the stations and tracks. The trains themselves would be operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.The public would get something it badly needs without being bled dry to finance it.RICHARD ALTABEF, GREAT NECK, N.Y.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Paper Tears Apart in a City That Never Quite Came Together", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When an ambitious Civil War colonel from Ohio seized control of a fledgling daily newspaper here in the late 19th century, Los Angeles was a rough-hewed frontier town with no paved streets and a population of a few thousand people. The newspaper was four pages and cost a penny.The ambitions of that colonel, Harrison Gray Otis, became the city\u2019s ambitions, and the newspaper, soon to be called The Los Angeles Times, was put in the service of transforming Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today.The turmoil at The Times in recent months \u2014 with upheaval in the editorial ranks and a publisher suspended over sexual harassment allegations \u2014 is a reminder of the slow decline of a newspaper that had long been a cohesive force in Los Angeles civic life. But more than that, it is symptomatic of something that this community has struggled with for nearly half a century: the absence of strong institutions to bind it together.\u201cThis seems like a three-alarm fire to me,\u201d said Donna Bojarsky, a second-generation Los Angeles native who two years ago created an organization of community leaders here to deal with the civic vacuum. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a dynamic, efficacious city without any kind of L.A.-centric media or press.\u201d\u201cIt says something that we are in this position,\u201d Ms. Bojarsky added. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any public outrage, and I think you would in other cities.\u201dFor all its successes, Los Angeles has not developed the political, cultural and philanthropic institutions that have proved critical in other American cities. The turmoil at The Times comes just months after Eli Broad, who has been the city\u2019s biggest philanthropist, announced he was retiring.There are many reasons for this problem. Los Angeles County is made up of 88 different cities, including the City of Los Angeles, rolling across 4,571 square miles that stretch from the ocean to the desert. People here are more likely to identify themselves with the city or neighborhood where they live \u2014 be it Glendale, Compton, Beverly Hills or Whittier \u2014 rather than Los Angeles. The worsening traffic has encouraged people to stay close to the places where they live and work.\u201cIt\u2019s so vast,\u201d said William Deverell, a historian of California at the University of Southern California. \u201cL.A. was self-consciously designed to be a decentralized place. What we call sprawl in the 21st century was part and parcel of the decentralized nature of the place.\u201dThe region has become increasingly economically and ethnically diverse, a challenge for any political or civic leader looking to unify a community. And this is a relatively young city, filled with recent arrivals who do not have the history of the kind of old-line families who have defined civic foundations in established cities like Boston and Philadelphia.The overlapping maze of governments works against the emergence of a single powerful political leader, such as an Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York City. The mayor here has little control over the school board or the health system.Unlike New York, which has two feisty daily tabloids and a 24-hours news station devoted only to New York news, The Los Angeles Times has stood increasingly alone as other news organizations have gone out of business, such as The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which closed in 1989. That has meant the absence of different voices and the kind of competition that can ensure a live civic debate, particularly since Los Angeles does not have the prodding that comes with an aggressive tabloid culture.Marylouise Oates, who was an influential society columnist for The Times in the 1980s, writing closely followed columns that covered every aspect of life here \u2014 politics, Hollywood, culture, along with events in the Jewish, Latino and African-American community \u2014 said she was distressed that there were few journalistic voices in the community today.\u201cThis city is so silo-ized,\u201d Ms. Oates said. \u201cI covered everything. At the time it was all one city. Otis Chandler made that possible. He decided it was a good thing to do.\u201dAntonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor, said the lack of these kinds of forces was a constant obstacle to accomplishing anything ambitious when he was in City Hall.\u201cRallying the city around big challenges becomes more difficult when you don\u2019t have the broad cross-section of institutional players,\u201d said Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is running for governor. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that here. We\u2019ve been struggling for 50 years with weakened institutions.\u201dBut he said he thought that was changing. \u201cWe are a global city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see ourselves as a global city.\u201dMr. Broad said he was not worried that no one would step up to fill the shoes he has left since retirement. For example, he suggested, David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul who lives in Beverly Hills and New York, pledged $150 million last year for the construction of a new Los Angeles County Museum of Art building.\u201cIt\u2019s a changing city,\u201d Mr. Broad said. \u201cIt\u2019s a younger city. We\u2019re growing up.\u201dGeography may be seen as an impediment to strong institutions, but it is also a central piece of Angeleno identity \u2014 a landscape of beaches, mountains, valleys, open skies and clusters of buildings. \u201cGeography is part of our values,\u201d said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of the county board of supervisors and a professor at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live on top of each other, like in New York or Philadelphia.\u201dSouthern Californians, he said, \u201cwant to be independent.\u201dBill Boyarsky, a former editor at The Los Angeles Times and the author of \u201cInventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times,\u201d a book on the newspaper, described the idea that people in Los Angeles \u201ccan\u2019t see beyond their block\u201d as an East Coast stereotype.\u201cI always thought geography was an unusual but true way of binding the city together,\u201d he said.The developments come as Los Angeles \u2014 by many other measures \u2014 is on an upswing. The economy is humming. Its youthful mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, is traveling the country, a potential presidential candidate in 2020, which in some circles provokes eye-rolling, but is also a source of pride, particularly at a time when political activism in this relatively apolitical city has risen since the election of President Trump.The city now has two professional football teams \u2014 after 20 years when there were none \u2014 and was chosen as the site of the 2028 Olympic Games. And a raft of new museums are opening or are being renovated, including one financed by the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and another by George Lucas in downtown Los Angeles.\u201cWe are a trendsetting city,\u201d Ms. Bojarsky said. \u201cAnd we look much more like what cities of the future are going to look like. We have the diversity of the economy, the diversity of the people. There are no all-white cities or single-economy cities anymore.\u201dStill, the absence of progress on big issues \u2014 homelessness, education and battered streets, to name a few \u2014 is a source of frustration and embarrassment for many civic leaders.\u201cLos Angeles plays small ball really well,\u201d said Austin Beutner, a former deputy mayor who served briefly as the publisher of The Times. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing oftentimes is the ability to bring the entire community together on behalf of issues or opportunities that will benefit the community as a whole.\u201dThe contrast with the era when Otis was a power at his newspaper and in the city is striking. Upon arriving here, Otis, through subterfuge, conspired to steal water from the Owens Valley and bring it to Los Angeles, making rapid growth possible. The newspaper\u2019s power helped secure funding for a new harbor, opening the city to global trade.With special sections, the newspaper marketed Los Angeles to the rest of the country, attracting waves of striving migrants with the promise of sunshine, cheap land and abundant opportunity. In politics, the newspaper bent City Hall to its will, and along the way propelled the rise of favored leaders, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The Chandlers sold the family-controlled Times Mirror Company to the Tribune Company in 2000.The newspaper developed from being less a political player and more a civic leader \u2014 a paper with international prestige that helped set the conversation every morning here. \u201cIt proved to be the golden age for an organization like The L.A. Times to engage citizens of Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Beutner said. \u201cWith everything going on here today you\u2019d expect it to be a leader in the conversation. Meanwhile, it is being pummeled from above.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The World Bank Is Remaking Itself as a Creature of Wall Street", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank\u2019s president, is trying to revitalize a hidebound institution. But his embrace of Wall Street is controversial.Supported byIn the fall of 2016, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, sat down with some of the most powerful figures in the global economy.Hosted by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, their discussion focused on financial trouble spots around the globe. There was scant talk about poverty, which the World Bank has committed to eradicate. And as such, there was no cause for Mr. Kim to join the discussion in a meaningful way.\u201cI sat there and thought, \u2018we are completely irrelevant to the majority of these countries,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kim recalled. \u201cThe I.M.F. is a systemically important financial institution. But we are seen as just a bunch of do-gooders.\u201dThe World Bank, once a powerhouse of global finance, is searching for relevance. Mr. Kim\u2019s unusual solution: embrace Wall Street.For decades, the World Bank followed a simple formula. Developed-world governments that are the bank\u2019s members provided the bulk of its money, which was used to make loans to developing nations for infrastructure projects and the like.But that model is under strain. Some 1.3 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and the bank\u2019s war chest is dwarfed by the funds pouring into developing countries through financial markets. Perhaps most important, the World Bank\u2019s biggest benefactor and largest shareholder \u2014 the United States \u2014 has become its most trenchant critic.Mr. Kim\u2019s mission is to revitalize the World Bank by increasing its firepower and winning over the United States. To do so, he is fundamentally, and controversially, changing how the bank operates.Instead of relying solely on contributions from reluctant donor governments, he is pushing private investors \u2014 sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and insurance companies \u2014 to pony up trillions of dollars for projects in Indonesia, Zambia, India and elsewhere. His pitch: They can reap rich returns by putting their money to work alongside the World Bank.As well as visiting villages, Mr. Kim tours financial capitals, hobnobbing with chief executives, bankers and fund managers. Interest rate swaps, internal rates of return, first-loss debt instruments: the jargon rolls off his tongue with the fluency of an investment banker.Trained as an anthropologist and medical doctor, Mr. Kim now says that the world of high finance is \u201csome of the coolest stuff I have ever looked at.\u201dIn December, at an environmental summit in Paris, he used the phrase \u201cdeals on the table\u201d seven times in an eight-minute speech. During the address he promoted four World Bank projects that would use private-sector capital.World Bank traditionalists are squirming.\u201cIt is not enough to be just another private equity fund,\u201d said Scott Morris, a former United States Treasury official who worked with the World Bank, now at the Center for Global Development.The World Bank was founded at the end of World War II, part of an effort to remake the international financial system in a free-market mold.Through subsidized loans, the goal was to stimulate recovery in ravaged Europe and, later, economic development in the world\u2019s poorer parts.The dams, pipelines and roads that these loans built spurred progress. They also stirred controversy when the bank was criticized for environmental destruction and supporting despots.Along the way, an entrenched bureaucracy of economists and development experts took shape. Resistant to change, they sustain and defend the bank\u2019s original mission: funneling loans to emerging economies.The son of Korean immigrants, Mr. Kim worked in the slums of Haiti and Peru, guided by the liberation theology of Catholic priests and the outrage of leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.At the root of this effort is his dream to persuade the private sector to help the bank achieve its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.Via the International Finance Corporation, which is its private sector lending arm and provides cash to companies in exchange for equity stakes, the World Bank currently drums up more than $7 billion a year from the private sector to invest in ventures in the developing world. Mr. Kim wants that figure to increase eventually to $30 billion.In 2016, the bank announced a $5 billion deal to raise cash from insurers like Allianz and Prudential for a vehicle that would invest in infrastructure projects. The World Bank promised to protect investors against some losses.There has been a $500 million bond offering and derivatives offering to fight disease outbreaks. The bank formed a $1 billion partnership with private-equity firm Apollo Global to buy debt in developing countries. Mr. Kim is creating a venture with Credit Suisse to let clients invest in certain World Bank projects. And money is being raised for a $2 billion fund, managed by Amundi, the French investment giant, to buy bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects.Mr. Kim is conducting this experiment at a perilous time for the institution. The United States government is the bank\u2019s largest shareholder, with a 16 percent stake. Under President Trump, it has been openly skeptical about the bank\u2019s mission.Nearly 20 years later, the report\u2019s critique remains pointed. Last year, the World Bank dispensed $61 billion in loans and investments. By contrast, investors now inject more than $1 trillion a year into emerging markets, financing every manner of corporate or government investment. That is more than the $900 billion the World Bank has doled out in its history.It was 8 a.m. at World Bank headquarters in Washington, and Mr. Kim took his seat at the boat-sized table that dominates the bank\u2019s board room. Its vast length evokes a more majestic time for the bank, when its voice \u2014 and loan book \u2014 loomed large across continents.Mr. Kim, 58, was on a video feed, urging financiers in Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia to put more of their own money to work in local markets.In effect, he was pitching the bank\u2019s services as a middleman, ready to back projects with guarantees and other incentives. No longer could the World Bank be the sole provider of loans, which, he said, are \u201ccrowding out\u201d the private sector.Mr. Kim is, by nature, a cheery person, but there was no mistaking the edge to his voice when he started talking about the World Bank economists whose pay is tied to how many loans they churn out. In his view, the bank needs to reward staff, Wall Street-style, for devising innovative financial solutions.\u201cOne of the most difficult things to do in a large bureaucracy is to change incentives,\u201d Mr. Kim told the financiers. \u201cAnd if you have a large bureaucracy full of economists it is especially hard, because it turns out that economists really hate it when you change the incentives.\u201dLike others before him, Mr. Kim came to his job at the World Bank with bold plans to attack the institution\u2019s bureaucracy. For most of his first term, which started in 2012, following a short stint as the president of Dartmouth, he was consumed by an unpopular reorganization. There were layoffs and bitterness in many areas of the bank.For Mr. Kim, his vision of the bank as an institution more closely resembling Wall Street poses his biggest challenge. Dominated by economists from the public sphere, the bank tends to see private sector solutions \u2014 those involving the profit motive \u2014 as morally questionable.\u201cThis would be a cultural and organizational shift for the bank, which has not engaged with the private sector in a substantial way,\u201d said Joel Hellman, a former top economist at the bank who is now dean of Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \u201cWorld Bank staffers are used to talking to governments, and now they have to leverage the private sector? It is a different skill set, and flexibility is not the hallmark of development institutions.\u201dMr. Kim is looking to change staff behavior with positive reinforcement. On the video call, he singled out a lending executive who, instead of simply signing off on a World Bank loan to help Jordan build an airport, created a package that relied heavily on private sector finance.\u201cHe had to work against his own incentives,\u201d Mr. Kim said, referring to the bank\u2019s practice of rewarding staff for loans. \u201cAnd that is part of the institutional problem here.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s public criticism of staff has struck a nerve.\u201cHe has pursued a strategy of making himself popular in Davos by attacking the organization and its staff,\u201d said Lant Pritchett, a retired World Bank executive. \u201cIt is this idea that his hand has been hampered by bureaucratic machinations. That may be accepted in Davos \u2014 but it\u2019s completely false.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s advisers say morale at the bank is improving and that the work force understands the importance of luring more private sector cash.But Mr. Kim\u2019s motives are more complex than keeping employees happy or even finding the best financial solutions for poor countries. He needs to win over the Trump administration \u2014 a task he has attacked energetically.When talking about his relationship with the administration, he drops the first names of White House players. \u201cIvanka, Jared, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell \u2014 they all know our business model very well,\u201d Mr. Kim said.His biggest coup was working with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, on the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which the bank introduced last October and that has raised $340 million. World Bank staffers sniff at the project, which they have nicknamed the Ivanka Fund. Outside the institution, however, the project was seen as a savvy move by Mr. Kim to outflank his critics at the Treasury Department.In his few meetings with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim has tried to present the bank as a tool to enhance the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. That could mean generous loans to strategically important countries or even providing expertise for United States infrastructure projects.He was the son of parents who escaped the ruin of the Korean War. They eventually settled in Muscatine, Iowa, where Mr. Kim was a high school quarterback before going on to Brown and securing advanced medical and anthropology degrees from Harvard.While at Harvard, he helped found Partners in Health, a nonprofit that devises treatment strategies in some of world\u2019s poorest countries.He devoured Marx as a young man, he likes to tell audiences. Now he takes counsel from \u2014 and socializes with \u2014 private equity titans Leon Black and David Rubenstein.Some critics at the bank think Mr. Kim has become too dazzled by bold faced names and billionaires. He golfs (very well, by all accounts) with Michael Bloomberg \u2014 who has backed several projects at the bank and hails Mr. Kim as a \u201cdoer\u201d \u2014 and swaps books with President Emmanuel Macron of France, most recently sending him a copy of \u201cOrientalism,\u201d Edward Said\u2019s critique of Western attitudes toward the Middle East and Asia.Mr. Kim\u2019s turn at the Paris environmental summit in December was an opportunity to trumpet the potential of his reimagined institution.The World Bank has been trying to shed its less-than-green image, and it was a main sponsor of the event, held on an island in the Seine. Mr. Kim had promised Mr. Macron that he would announce some eco-friendly deals.The day before, Mr. Kim had been in Zurich with Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, pitching clients on a new emerging market fund. And after wall-to-wall meetings at the Paris conference, he planned to fly to Tokyo to sell investors on the World Bank\u2019s latest financial innovations.His voice was hoarse; hectic travel and speechmaking had taken their toll. But now, with Mr. Macron and 50 other heads of state, not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sean Penn and Bill Gates, watching him closely, it was showtime.Mr. Kim strode onstage and started talking deals.There was a bid to attract $2 billion in private capital to protect coastal shores in West Africa; a $4 billion scheme to back geothermal energy in Indonesia; the establishment of a global investment bank to spur environmentally friendly investments in cities; and a big bet on electric cars in India.All would be blessed by the bank. But their ultimate success would hinge on how much money the private sector would kick in.Mr. Kim concluded by announcing that the bank would no longer back oil and gas drilling projects.A roar of applause filled the auditorium. Mr. Kim grinned.For the moment, at least, the World Bank was relevant again.Advertisement"}

The objects of his attention had a vast and seemingly disconnected range, from taunting Kim Jong-un about his nuclear prowess to flaunting his own successes. But there was more.

{"Headline": "BMW and Daimler Move Against Executives Over Diesel Tests on Monkeys", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The German carmakers BMW and Daimler said on Wednesday that they had taken action against executives involved in an organization that sponsored emissions experiments on monkeys, as the companies tried to squelch a public outcry that threatens to tarnish the image of Germany\u2019s most important exports.The executives, who were not publicly identified, belonged to the board of an organization established by BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen. The group commissioned research intended to play down the health risks caused by diesel exhaust.Even before the monkey research came to light, the carmakers had been struggling to stem a decline in diesel vehicles\u2019 share of the European market, which is at its lowest point in a decade.The falloff began after Volkswagen was caught in 2015 using software to conceal excess emissions by its diesel cars. The resulting scandal highlighted the health hazards of diesel exhaust. Public outrage has been further inflamed \u2014 and has spread to BMW and Daimler \u2014 by the carmakers\u2019 use of monkeys as test subjects in what was effectively a marketing campaign.Andrea Mayer, a Munich prosecutor, said the homes that were raided belonged to middle managers and were searched as part of an investigation into emissions cheating. Prosecutors have identified 13 suspects, Ms. Mayer said, but have not yet filed criminal charges against any of them.The monkey experiments were paid for and overseen by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials, E.U.G.T. BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen financed the organization and all three companies had representatives on its board.The research took place at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque in 2014. Researchers there exposed one group of the monkeys to exhaust from a late-model diesel Volkswagen; a second group was exposed to exhaust from an older Ford diesel pickup truck.Using monkeys as experiment subjects was not illegal, but it has angered animal-rights advocates and others who say the tests lacked the usual justification for research on primates, which is to advance medical science and protect human lives. In this instance, the monkeys were being used to try to help the companies sell diesel cars by showing that emissions were less harmful than many scientists had maintained.The research suffered from procedural flaws and had not been published by the time the E.U.G.T. folded last year.A separate project financed by the carmakers subjected human volunteers to doses of nitrogen dioxide, one of diesel\u2019s most noxious byproducts. The research, in 2015, was authorized by an ethics commission at the RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany, where it took place.Daimler said Wednesday it had suspended its representative on the E.U.G.T. board. The company did not disclose his name, but a report by the organization summarizing its activities from 2013 to 2015, said the carmaker was represented by Udo Hartmann, whose title was head of Daimler\u2019s group environmental protection and energy management.Mr. Hartmann could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.Daimler continued to try to distance itself from the monkey testing, in which Volkswagen employees took a leading role.\u201cEven though Daimler did not have influence on the study\u2019s design, we have launched a comprehensive investigation into the matter,\u201d the company said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe will fully investigate the facts, and make sure that such things do not happen again.\u201dBMW said its representative on the E.U.G.T. board had been \u201crelieved of his current tasks\u201d while the company conducted an internal investigation. The man remains a BMW employee, the company said.According to the E.U.G.T. report about the organization\u2019s activities from 2013 to 2015, BMW\u2019s representative on the board at the time of the monkey research was Frank Hansen, a member of a company team that works on car-sharing and other new forms of urban transportation.Mr. Hansen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BMW implicitly defended his conduct on Wednesday, saying in a statement that the employee has provided credible assurances \u201cthat he critically called into question the commissioning of animal tests during his mandate on the board.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced Tuesday that he would retire at the end of the year, rebuffing personal pleas from President Trump to seek an eighth term and paving the way for Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s, to run for the seat.Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision marks another political setback for Mr. Trump, who lost a Senate seat in Alabama after his preferred candidates were rejected.

Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber.\u201cWhen there are things he agrees with him on, he\u2019ll be a big supporter,\u201d Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney\u2019s longtime fund-raiser, said of Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd when there are things he disagrees with, he\u2019ll voice that.\u201dMr. Hatch, 83, made his decision public on Tuesday afternoon via a video announcement.\u201cWhen the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter. I\u2019ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I\u2019ve brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.\u201dMr. Hatch was under heavy pressure from Mr. Trump to seek re-election and block Mr. Romney. Last month, Mr. Trump flew with Mr. Hatch, who has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most avid loyalists in the Senate, on Air Force One to Utah for a day of events that was aimed entirely at lobbying the senator to run again. At the request of the senator, the president announced that he was vastly shrinking two of Utah\u2019s sprawling national monuments, reversing decisions made by Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.And Mr. Trump used a speech in Salt Lake City to say that he hoped Mr. Hatch would \u201ccontinue to serve your state and your country in the Senate for a very long time to come.\u201dThen on Dec. 20, at a White House event celebrating passage of the comprehensive tax cut that Mr. Hatch helped write, the president pulled him aside to again ask him to run.The senator lauded Mr. Trump at the event, calling him \u201cone heck of a leader.\u201d\u201cWe are going to make this the greatest presidency we have seen, not only in generations, but maybe ever,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.But the presidential intervention failed. Mr. Hatch decided to retire after discussing the matter with his family over the holidays.That clears the way for the political resurrection of Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is now a Utah resident and is popular in the Mormon-heavy state, where he ran the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mr. Romney has told associates he would likely run if Mr. Hatch retires.\u201cHe\u2019d be a very difficult candidate to beat in Utah,\u201d said Michael O. Leavitt, a former Republican governor of Utah.Mr. Romney repeatedly assailed Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, calling him \u201ca fraud,\u201d and Mr. Trump returned the favor, stating that Mr. Romney \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in the 2012 race. The two had something of a rapprochement after the election when Mr. Romney was briefly considered as secretary of state, but after Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating statements that followed the racist and anti-Semitic violence in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, Mr. Romney regained his critical voice.When it comes to Mr. Trump, Mr. Leavitt said, Mr. Romney has \u201cnot been reluctant to speak his mind, and I can\u2019t imagine he would change in the Senate.\u201d\u201cAs Chairman of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees and as the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history, Senator Hatch has represented the interests of Utah with distinction and honor,\u201d he said.By Tuesday evening, Mr. Romney had updated his Twitter profile to change his location to Holladay, Utah, from Massachusetts.Mr. Romney intends to make his intentions known in a matter of weeks, according to an adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His senior campaign team will include Mr. Zwick; Matt Waldrip, who had been running Mr. Romney\u2019s annual policy retreats; and his former chief of staff, Beth Myers.Mr. Zwick did not confirm Mr. Romney would enter the race, but said that \u201cof all the people who can run, Mitt will represent and honor the legacy of Senator Hatch more than anybody.\u201dMr. Hatch, who briefly ran for president in 2000, amassed a distinguished record over his four decades in Washington and became a fixture in a Senate once noted for its bipartisanship. While considered an institution in his home state, Mr. Hatch was facing harsh poll numbers in Utah, where 75 percent of voters indicated in a survey last fall that they did not want him to run again.Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision comes just weeks after Mr. Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, a measure that the senator helped shepherd as chairman of the Finance Committee. The bill represented something of a capstone to Mr. Hatch\u2019s career, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, even deemed it as such last month in what was seen as a subtle effort to usher his colleague to the exit.Mr. Romney was unaware of Mr. Hatch\u2019s decision and of late had been operating under the assumption that the senator would run again, not even bringing up the possibility of a campaign while skiing Monday with friends in Utah.That is in part because Mr. Hatch had privately told Mr. Romney he was not sure he was ready to leave a seat he has held since 1977, and White House officials did all they could to nudge him into another campaign.The president has had Mr. Romney on his mind. Over golf last year, Mr. Trump asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, what he thought of the former Republican nominee. (Mr. Graham said he praised Mr. Romney and predicted he would be a solid senator.)\u201cIt would be good for Utah if Hatch, having finally caught the Great White Whale of tax reform, were to call it a career. If he doesn\u2019t, the voters should end it for him,\u201d the editorial concluded.In announcing his retirement, Mr. Hatch joined an exodus of Republican heavyweights in what promises to be a difficult election season. Also on Tuesday, Representative Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, disclosed that he planned to retire at the year\u2019s end. Mr. Shuster, 56, was facing a possible primary election challenge from the right and said his decision would allow him to focus exclusively on trying to steer major infrastructure legislation, a long-sought bipartisan priority, into law.Other retiring House chairmen include Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, of the Judiciary Committee; Jeb Hensarling of Texas, of the Financial Services Committee; and Lamar Smith of Texas of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.In all, 29 House Republicans have resigned, announced they will retire or run for another office, compared to 16 Democrats. Mr. Hatch joined Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, in announcing an end to his Senate career.Mr. Hatch defeated a Democrat 42 years ago this November, arguing that the incumbent had stayed in Washington too long, and became one of the country\u2019s most prominent senators for a generation. While he usually voted a conservative line, he also developed close relationships with his Democratic colleagues, most famously with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, the two collaborated on what became a landmark health care plan, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and Mr. Hatch even wrote a love song for Mr. Kennedy and his wife, Victoria, called \u201cSouls Along The Way.\u201d\u201cOrrin\u2019s long list of accomplishments means he will depart as one of the most productive members ever to serve in this body,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Failed War on Drugs", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe war on drugs in the United States has been a failure that has ruined lives, filled prisons and cost a fortune. It started during the Nixon administration with the idea that, because drugs are bad for people, they should be difficult to obtain. As a result, it became a war on supply.As first lady during the crack epidemic, Nancy Reagan tried to change this approach in the 1980s. But her \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign to reduce demand received limited support.Her warning was prescient, but not heeded. Studies show that the United States has among the highest rates of drug use in the world. But even as restricting supply has failed to curb abuse, aggressive policing has led to thousands of young drug users filling American prisons, where they learn how to become real criminals.The prohibitions on drugs have also created perverse economic incentives that make combating drug producers and distributors extremely difficult. The high black-market price for illegal drugs has generated huge profits for the groups that produce and sell them, income that is invested in buying state-of-the-art weapons, hiring gangs to defend their trade, paying off public officials and making drugs easily available to children, to get them addicted.Add it all up and one can see that focusing on supply has done little to curtail drug abuse while causing a host of terrible side effects. What, then, can we do?First the United States and Mexican governments must acknowledge the failure of this strategy. Only then can we engage in rigorous and countrywide education campaigns to persuade people not to use drugs.The current opioid crisis underlines the importance of curbing demand. This approach, with sufficient resources and the right message, could have a major impact similar to the campaign to reduce tobacco use.With such a complicated problem, we should be willing to experiment with solutions. Which advertising messages are most effective? How can treatment be made effective for different kinds of drugs and different degrees of addiction? We should have the patience to evaluate what works and what doesn\u2019t. But we must get started now.As these efforts progress, profits from the drug trade will diminish greatly even as the dangers of engaging in it will remain high. The result will be a gradual lessening of violence in Mexico and Central American countries.We have a crisis on our hands \u2014 and for the past half-century, we have been failing to solve it. But there are alternatives. Both the United States and Mexico need to look beyond the idea that drug abuse is simply a law-enforcement problem, solvable through arrests, prosecution and restrictions on supply. We must together attack it with public health policies and education.We still have time to persuade our young people not to ruin their lives.George P. Shultz, a former secretary of the Treasury and secretary of state, is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Pedro Aspe is a former secretary of finance in Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Western Edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen Goes Residential", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is still a good place to service cars and ship packages. But with gathering speed, the western edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen is going residential, and in the process, it is becoming New York\u2019s latest industrial district to reinvent itself.Apartment houses with rentals and condos are now rising between 10th Avenue and the West Side Highway, in the West 40s and West 50s. Developers are betting that the area can overcome its reputation for being far from subways and lacking stores, and become a more typical neighborhood.Although he admits that the boom has resulted in too many blocked-off sidewalks, Mr. Rosado, 40, said the situation is preferable to when he was growing up in the 1980s, when 11th Avenue was \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d He added that in later decades, the area was unappealingly sleepy.Of the big-name developers investing in the neighborhood \u2014 a list that includes TF Cornerstone, the Elad Group and Taconic Investment Partners \u2014 perhaps the most notable might be the Moinian Group. It has helped shape the look of the modern Far West Side.But what Oskar may lack in scale it makes up for in style. It was originally designed as a condo, a generally more luxurious property type, said Joseph Moinian, the firm\u2019s chief executive. Despite the change in use, which gives the developer more \u201clongevity\u201d at the site, the building\u2019s design was never downgraded, Mr. Moinian said. Finishes like Caesarstone kitchen counters were retained, he said, adding, \u201cthe quality is very, very high.\u201dAmenities will include an airy second-floor lounge with a 100-inch television over a wide fireplace and access to an adjacent landscaped terrace. For a fee, residents will also be allowed to use many of the amenities at the nearby and well-appointed Sky, including its basketball court, spa and pools.The building is named for Oskar Brecher, the Moinian Group\u2019s former development director, who died in 2016. In mid-January, Oskar had not yet set specific rents, as it won\u2019t open until the spring. Mr. Moinian said that studios will likely be about $3,000 a month and one-bedrooms about $4,500.In the broader Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood, west of Eighth Avenue, studios average $2,700 a month, according to StreetEasy.com data, while one-bedrooms average $3,400.Of Oskar\u2019s apartments, 46 will be available at below-market rents for those who are eligible based on their incomes. Those affordable units were required because the $180 million project is benefiting from state bond financing.Mr. Moinian and other developers in the area have been helped by rezoning. In 2011, the city approved a plan to allow more apartments on the blocks between 10th and 11th Avenues, while permitting bigger industrial buildings between 11th and 12th Avenues. But because of lingering effects of the last recession, brokers say, residential development has been scattered until now.Oskar\u2019s site previously held the Market Diner, which opened in 1962 and closed in 2015. It was one of a handful of diners that once sparkled amid the area\u2019s brick factories and warehouses. Most are now gone.The Max is named for Max Elghanayan, son of the TF Cornerstone co-founder Frederick Elghanayan; Max Elghanayan died earlier this month. The Max will also have a school, a spokesman for TF Cornerstone said.In comparison, in the entire Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood, one-bedroom condos list for an average of $1.34 million, including existing units and those in new buildings, according to StreetEasy data.Less far along appears to be 615 10th Avenue. It is a block-wide project between West 44th and West 45th Streets, where there was once a gas station. Here, an 82-unit building is planned in a seven-story building, according to public filings. Target said that one of its stores will occupy the building\u2019s storefront, with about 29,000 square feet, and will open in 2019, a Target spokeswoman said.Other business in the area include a UPS facility, at 11th Avenue and West 43rd Street, and several television studios. Ad agencies have also arrived in recent years.A Lexus showroom will be razed to make room for a 225-unit condo. The condo, at 646 11th Avenue, will have an auto dealership at its base said Scott Shnay, a principal at CBSK Ironstate, the development entity behind the project. Mr. Shnay said he hopes to finalize the purchase of the site this summer.\u201cNew York is a city where neighborhoods evolve, and a transformation can happen so quickly,\u201d Mr. Khurana added. \u201cIt can just take a few years, with a few developers and a few new buildings.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Ordered Mueller Fired, but Backed Off When White House Counsel Threatened to Quit", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump ordered the firing last June of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, according to four people told of the matter, but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.The West Wing confrontation marks the first time Mr. Trump is known to have tried to fire the special counsel. Mr. Mueller learned about the episode in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.After receiving the president\u2019s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.Mr. McGahn disagreed with the president\u2019s case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that Mr. Trump would not follow through on the dismissal on his own. The president then backed off.The president dismissed the revelations on Friday, when asked about them by reporters as he arrived at the Congress Center in Davos, Switzerland, for meetings with world political and business leaders.Ty Cobb, who manages the White House\u2019s relationship with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, said in a statement, \u201cWe decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.\u201dMr. McGahn, a longtime Republican campaign finance lawyer in Washington who served on the Federal Election Commission, was the top lawyer on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. He has been involved in nearly every key decision Mr. Trump has made \u2014 like the firing of the former F.B.I. director \u2014 that is being scrutinized by Mr. Mueller.Most of the news about Russia falls into one of three categories, which we break down.Mr. McGahn was also concerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation.Mr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions. But for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, it reinforced the idea that, although Mr. Mueller is a Republican, he had assembled a team of Democrats to take down the president.He advised Mr. Trump that he had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller, a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb\u2019s arrival, the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, not to fight him.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has wavered for months about whether he wants to fire Mr. Mueller, which is an omnipresent concern among the president\u2019s legal team and close aides. The White House has denied nearly a dozen times since June that Mr. Trump was considering firing Mr. Mueller. The president\u2019s lawyers, including Mr. Cobb, have tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him for months, amid new revelations about the inquiry, that it is close to ending.Mr. Trump has long demonstrated a preoccupation with those who have overseen the Russia investigation. In March, after Mr. McGahn failed to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the inquiry, Mr. Trump complained that he needed someone loyal to oversee the Justice Department.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me because I hope that he\u2019s going to be fair,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response to a question about whether it bothered him that Mr. Mueller had not yet ended his investigation. \u201cI think that he\u2019s going to be fair.\u201dMr. Trump added: \u201cThere\u2019s been no collusion. But I think he\u2019s going to be fair.\u201dElisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Davos, Switzerland.Advertisement"}

The group claimed that his law firm had facilitated bribes to lawmakers in an attempt to pass legislation favorable to a mining company. Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s government initiated a trial of Mr. Sherman, which has not yet concluded.Analysts say that the president\u2019s expulsion from the party could raise questions about her legacy.\u201cThe dominant narrative is of her being a leader that promoted good governance \u2014 this expulsion will lead people to question that narrative,\u201d said Ibrahim al-Bakri Nyei, a Liberian who is completing a Ph.D. at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \u201cIt will leave room for people to ask questions as to why she didn\u2019t support the party.\u201dBut for some it appeared that the president may have abandoned her party long before it expelled her.\u201cShe clearly wasn\u2019t in support of her party, and that is a big deal because it hasn\u2019t happened in our political history,\u201d said Aaron Weah, the director of Search for Common Ground, a nongovernmental organization focused on conflict resolution.While the expulsion is yet another chapter in Liberia\u2019s recent political drama, analysts take it as a sign that the nation\u2019s democracy is maturing since its second civil war ended in 2003.Last year\u2019s elections unfolded peacefully, with parties and citizens respecting the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings. Now, parties are expelling their leaders in accordance with their own rules.\u201cIt shows,\u201d Aaron Weah said, \u201cthat political parties are beyond the influence of a president or one particular person.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul Is a Blow to Affordable Housing Efforts", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The last time that Congress approved a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, in 1986, it created a tax credit meant to encourage the private sector to invest in affordable housing. It has grown into a $9 billion-a-year social program that has funded the construction of some three million apartments for low-income residents.But the Republican tax plan approved last month amounts to a vast cutback, making it much less likely that such construction will continue apace. Because the tax rate for corporations has been lowered, the value of the credits \u2014 which corporations get in return for their investments \u2014 is also lower.\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest shock to the affordable-housing system since the Great Recession,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, managing partner of Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco.Already, developers and city agencies are scrambling for new financing and scaling back longer-term plans.Don Falk can see the fallout from his window. Mr. Falk is the chief executive of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, an affordable-housing developer in San Francisco\u2019s impoverished Tenderloin district. Directly across the street from his office sits a new project, a rising eight-story building that will have 113 units, a third of those set aside to serve the city\u2019s swelling homeless population.A year ago, as the market for tax credits started falling in expectation that a Republican president and a Republican Congress would steeply lower taxes, the project developed a $3 million deficit. The city stepped in to cover the shortfall, but the financing problem was an early indication of what affordable-housing groups and developers expect to be a declining pace of new building.Kate Hartley, director of the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development \u2014 the agency that backstopped Mr. Falk\u2019s development when it needed help \u2014 said the lower corporate tax rate had increased the cost of building affordable housing in the city by roughly $50,000 per unit. That adds up to a lot of multimillion-dollar leaks, she said, \u201cand we have less money to build the units we want to build.\u201dFor renters like Sandy Hernandez, who lives south of San Francisco in a two-bedroom apartment with her ex-husband and two children, this is coming at the worst possible time. Her building was recently purchased by a group of investors, and next month her $1,900 rent is scheduled to go up $850 \u2014 more than 40 percent \u2014 to $2,750. Ms. Hernandez said there is no way she can pay that much, but she\u2019s stuck because the list for affordable housing is so long.\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s a lot of people in the same situation,\u201d she said.Programs to build subsidized rental housing date back to the Great Depression, and were greatly expanded during President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d Support for these programs started to wane under President Richard Nixon, and they were vastly scaled back under President Ronald Reagan.But unlike public housing programs, which tended to expand under Democratic administrations and shrink under Republican ones, tax credits proved enduring and politically popular.Conservatives saw the approach as a tax break and a way to use private markets to solve public problems. Liberals saw it as a way to direct federal money to local communities. Since 1987, it has funded construction and rehabilitation of about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s 10 million affordable units, which are defined as units that people making 60 percent or less of a city\u2019s median income could afford.\u201cIt\u2019s the most successful social program that nobody has heard of,\u201d said David Erickson, director of community development at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the author of \u201cThe Housing Policy Revolution.\u201dIt works like this: State governments award credits to affordable-housing developers, who transfer them to corporations in exchange for equity in rental buildings whose units are set aside for low-income tenants. Corporations use the credits as a coupon against future taxes. Low-income housing tax credits are particularly popular among banks because affordable-housing investments help satisfy their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act.Developers have responded with an apartment building boom. But since renters tend to have higher incomes than in years past \u2014 households making more than $100,000 a year accounted for a third of the growth in renters over the past decade \u2014 many of the newer units are in the pricey glass and steel buildings that have sprouted in downtowns across the country.For now, there is little to suggest the rental burden will get better anytime soon. Over the next decade the younger half of the millennial generation will move into their 20s and 30s, adding to the pool of renters. Over that same period, more than a million units of affordable housing financed by low-income housing tax credits and other government programs are set expire and shift to higher rents, according to the Joint Center.One result of the surge in higher-income renters is that units that policymakers politely refer to as \u201cnaturally occurring affordable housing\u201d \u2014 run-down buildings where lower-income residents can afford an apartment without subsidy \u2014 are being pulled toward the higher end of the market.That has put a squeeze on tenants like Ms. Hernandez, a 41-year-old holding down two low-wage jobs, one cleaning houses and another at an elder care facility. She has spent a decade waiting for a subsidized rental apartment to open up.Jesshill Love, an attorney for the investors who now own Ms. Hernandez\u2019s building, said that with demand exploding, the rents could have actually been raised even more. \u201cThe decision was made by the property management company not to raise the rent to full market value in an effort to minimize the impact upon the families,\u201d he said.The protest attracted lots of honking horns and a visit from Redwood City\u2019s mayor. Directly across the street from the hubbub sat a recreational vehicle parked for the evening. Its two homeless residents popped their heads out to see what was going on.Lisa Hannibal, 52, who lives in the vehicle and is unemployed, said that she was also on a list for affordable housing, but that nothing had opened up.\u201cWe\u2019re at the hard-suffering point,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can happen to anybody these days.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cuomo this fall, and Ms. Miner\u2019s public ruminations about such a challenge are sure to rankle state Democratic Party officials.\u201cI\u2019m still seriously considering it,\u201d Ms. Miner said about a campaign for governor.Just as Ms. Teachout highlighted some of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s perceived shortcomings, suggesting that he had tilted too far to the right, Ms. Miner, an unapologetic progressive, wasted no time in pointing out Mr. Cuomo\u2019s vulnerabilities.In an interview in Midtown Manhattan, Ms. Miner, who is teaching a course on municipal finance at New York University, chastised the governor for his handling of the transit crisis, with the subway system troubled by delays and breakdowns.\u201cAnywhere and everywhere I go, people talk about the transit issue,\u201d she said over coffee at Pennsylvania Station, where she was preparing to board an Amtrak back to Syracuse. \u201cPeople\u2019s frustration and anger is palpable. I think he bears a great deal of responsibility.\u201dSome political experts said that Mr. Cuomo could be damaged by another primary challenge by a progressive woman.\u201cIf she does primary Cuomo, I\u2019d be worried, if I\u2019m Cuomo\u2019s people \u2014 not necessarily that she would win or get within 10 points of him,\u201d said Doug Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College. \u201cBut even a loss by her \u2014 if it were close \u2014 would be damaging. So the governor would have to go all out.\u201dIn the interview on Thursday, she also faulted what she called the governor\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d approach to government, which, she said, was designed to get \u201cgood headlines,\u201d but has \u201cnot changed the dynamic of the upstate economy.\u201dMs. Miner\u2019s decision came as a disappointment for Democrats who were hoping she would challenge Rep. John Katko, a Republican who represents the district that includes Syracuse, where she was mayor for eight years until term limits forced her to step down on Dec. 31.Geoff Berman, executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said the loss of Ms. Miner\u2019s candidacy against Mr. Katko was a blow to the party\u2019s efforts to make inroads into the Republican-controlled Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Stephanie chose not to capitalize on her local name ID and help the party take on Washington Republicans,\u201d Mr. Berman said.When asked of Ms. Miner\u2019s consideration of a primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Berman deflected, saying the governor\u2019s progressive agenda \u201csets a solid foundation for a third term.\u201dBill Mulrow, chairman of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign, also defended the governor\u2019s progressive record, pointing to measures like a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, gun control, a ban on fracking and free college tuition at public colleges for the middle class.\u201cGov. Cuomo has the strongest progressive record of any elected official in this country \u2014 period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we look forward to building on that record in the third term.\u201dThis is the second time Ms. Miner, 47, has publicly declared that she would not run for Congress. After the tax vote, she said she would reconsider an earlier decision not to challenge Mr. Katko. But this time, she sounded resigned.She said she did not relish the idea of \u201cgetting on a plane on a Sunday night and coming back on a Thursday and having to raise money five hours a day, every day.\u201dAs for antagonizing state Democratic stalwarts by flirting with a run against Mr. Cuomo, the leader of the party, Ms. Miner said such concerns would not factor into her decision.\u201cI think now more than ever people realize that in a democracy, all of us have a responsibility to be active and voice our opinion about where we think we are going,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of different ways to be active. Sometimes that means running for office.\u201cSometimes that means standing up and saying things that are uncomfortable. Sometimes that means making tough decisions. Ruffling feathers is a natural part of being a leader.\u201dFollow Lisa W. Foderaro on Twitter: @lisanytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Is Back. And Rejecting Trumpism.", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron laid claim to the mantle of leader of the free world on Wednesday, with an ambitious speech before a packed assembly at the World Economic Forum.He sought to place France at the center of a mission to revamp global capitalism while spreading its spoils more equitably, forging a mode of commerce centered on innovation, yet bearing protections for workers set back by change.Mr. Macron\u2019s hourlong speech before the annual gathering of the world\u2019s wealthy and powerful in the Swiss Alps came on the same day that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni issued their own forceful speeches toward advancing European integration, while defending the notion of international cooperation.Collectively, they signaled that Europe \u2014 only a year ago dismissed as a crippled economic realm fraught with political recrimination \u2014 has regained force. Europe\u2019s leaders left no doubt that they aim to channel their newfound economic strength toward advancing the project of European integration first launched in the middle of the last century, seen as an antidote to the brutalities of two world wars.President Trump was not in the room (he is not due to speak here until Friday). But the shadow of his America First policies hung heavily. The three speeches resonated as a broad rebuttal of the doctrine that Mr. Trump has made his own.In contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s pullback from international trade agreements and his renouncing of the Paris climate accord, the European leaders emphasized their commitment to prosperity through global commerce.In place of Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateralism, the three European leaders pledged to strengthen the bonds of the European Union and the 19 nations that use the euro currency.They underscored their commitment to multilateral approaches as the salve to trouble, including widening economic inequality, terrorism and the ravages of climate change.\u201cIf we want to avoid this fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe, it\u2019s absolutely key,\u201d Mr. Macron declared. \u201cFrance is back. France is back at the core of Europe, because we will never have any French success without a European success.\u201dTo an audience fearful that the global, rules-based trading system was unraveling, Mr. Xi\u2019s commitment to internationalism drew a mixture of relief and acclaim. But China was at best a compromised claimant to that role, given its preferential credit for state-owned companies, its theft of intellectual property and its jailing of dissidents and journalists.Mr. Macron put forth his own credentials as a leader singularly able to help guide Europe and the global economy.\u201cOur vision, our DNA in terms of the relationship between freedom and the furtherance of individual rights, is unique,\u201d Mr. Macron said.He described a sense of responsibility to translate French values into a form of capitalism that can deliver growth along with increased opportunities for middle-class and working people.\u201cIt\u2019s a transformational moment for Europe,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThere is clearly determination to deepen European governance. These leaders do believe in the rule of law. They do believe in globalization.\u201dAmong the many casualties of Europe\u2019s decade-long economic crisis was a sense of collective purpose among the region\u2019s leaders. The downturn was exacerbated by the unique defects of the euro \u2014 a shared currency that operates without a joint budget or political agreement among member states.Ms. Merkel has expressed cautious support while assiduously avoiding blessing anything that smacks of transferring German wealth to the less prosperous countries of the Mediterranean \u2014 a radioactive proposition among German voters.Many analysts have assumed that political fragility in Germany would complicate Mr. Macron\u2019s efforts to win German support for his integration proposals. But the coalition taking shape would bring a more pro-European orientation, many analysts say.\u201cI came here thinking about the fractured world, and one day later I feel I\u2019m in a converged world,\u201d said Charles-Edouard Bou\u00e9e, chief executive of Roland Berger, a global consultancy with offices in Shanghai and Munich.In her speech here on Wednesday, Ms. Merkel reaffirmed her commitment to completing a so-called banking union, a system that shares the risks of financial breakdown across national borders.She cast the drive to better integrate Europe as a historical responsibility of grave import, noting that the concept of the European Union dates back to the effort to limit future bloodshed in Europe by building economic ties.\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, when we have fewer and fewer people who remember these events of history, have we learned the lessons of history?\u201d Ms. Merkel asked.\u201cMany people seem to worry, will multilateralism find an answer to the problems that mankind has in a fair and equitable way?\u201d Ms. Merkel said, seemingly referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cWe think that shutting ourselves off against the world, isolating ourselves, will not lead to a good future. Protectionism is not the right answer.\u201dFor years, Italy has been the face of Europe\u2019s most deep-seated problems: its banks stuffed with terrible loans, its communities full of young people who have moved in with their parents for lack of jobs.\u201cWe must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers,\u201d Mr. Gentiloni said. \u201cThis worry, and these frustrations, are our main concern.\u201dThese sorts of mission statements are increasingly dominating the political conversation in Europe \u2014 nowhere more than in France, where Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, has pledged to make his country more appealing to business while strengthening unemployment benefits and training for castoff workers.Mr. Macron promised to fill the void, vowing to spend 15 billion euros \u2014 about $18.6 billion \u2014 over the next five years on education and retraining.\u201cIf I cannot explain to people that globalization is good for them, and that it will help them develop their own lives, then they will be the nationalists, the extremists who want to get out of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they will win in every country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Crime Decline", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of those theories has long been known as \u201cbroken windows\u201d \u2014 the idea that by cracking down on minor forms of disorder, the police prevent worse behavior.Over the last several years, New York City has conducted a natural experiment on a central tactic of the broken-windows strategy: stop-and-frisk. In 2011, New York\u2019s police department conducted more than 685,000 stop-and-frisks \u2014 or nearly 2,000 a day \u2014 of people whom officers deemed suspicious. But the combination of a court order and the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned against the practice in 2013, have largely ended it.The demise of stop-and-frisk is worth celebrating. Its costs were clearly high, and its benefits now appear to have been tiny. But the larger mystery remains: What does explain a decline in crime that has improved life in almost every major city over the last few decades \u2014 and which almost nobody saw coming?To say that online retailers are merely outcompeting traditional stores, Sabin suggests, is wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vance Bans Donations From Lawyers With Pending Cases", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Vance also said he would not solicit contributions in person and would ask campaign officials to keep the names of donors secret, adopting the same campaign finance rules that candidates for judgeships must follow in New York State.Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign had received large contributions from defense lawyers who represented Mr. Weinstein and the Trumps.The public integrity center\u2019s report recommended that lawyers with clients facing criminal charges in Manhattan donate no more than $320 to a candidate for district attorney, though that cap would be lifted six months after a case was resolved. Partners in their firms would be limited to $3,850 in each election cycle, roughly the same general election cap as exists for borough president candidates under city rules, the report said.\u201cMy campaign will meet and exceed these recommendations,\u201d Mr. Vance said in a statement.Donations to candidates running for district attorney from defense lawyers are legal in New York and have been made since the 19th century. Individual contribution limits are based on the number of voters in a county. In Manhattan, the legal donation limit in a general election is $50,000.The recommendations in the 38-page report are aimed at limiting the influence of donations on the criminal justice system. The report said district attorneys should never accept donations from people under investigation or indictment, or from assistant district attorneys.It also recommended prosecutors enforce a strict separation between their campaign and office staffs, so that the district attorney\u2019s office has no knowledge of who has offered financial support.The report suggested limits of $250 for lawyers with pending cases in counties with smaller populations.Perhaps the most radical recommendations involved keeping the list of donors secret from sitting district attorneys, and banning prosecutors from soliciting contributions in person.Mr. Vance said he did not expect other district attorneys in the state to follow his lead, but he believed the blind approach to raising money would allay public concerns that lawyers could buy leniency for their clients. Barring donations from lawyers with clients facing criminal proceedings until six months after the case is resolved is \u201ca sound, solid rule that makes sense,\u201d he said.He said he will abide by these campaign contribution rules even if a challenger does not. \u201cThat\u2019s their decision and that\u2019s for the newspapers to ask them about,\u201d Mr. Vance said.Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor who leads the public integrity center, said the study found a wide variation in practices among the state\u2019s 62 prosecutors\u2019 offices. Most do not have any written policy regarding campaign donations, she said.If all the state\u2019s district attorneys voluntarily adopted the recommendations, Ms. Rodgers said, it would go a long way toward eliminating the appearance that contributions can buy a prosecutor\u2019s decision.But she said a voluntary system has limitations. Some incumbents and challengers may not opt to follow the guidelines. Only a change in state law would ensure everyone across the state is playing by the same rules, she said.\u201cIt definitely is something that should be addressed by the Legislature,\u201d she said.Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, called Mr. Vance\u2019s decision \u201ca really strong step in the right direction,\u201d but she said the Legislature should now codify the recommendations into law.Even if voluntarily followed by all candidates, the guidelines may not remove the influence of campaign money entirely. For instance, under the center\u2019s recommendations, district attorneys would still be allowed to attend fund-raising events where they could give campaign speeches. They would be able to see who attended the event, but in theory the candidate would not know how much each person donated. The report also acknowledged that there is no way to stop a candidate from learning the identities of donors through public websites maintained by the city and state election boards.About 40 percent of the $6.1 million in contributions to Mr. Vance, who was re-elected in November, came from lawyers. But many of the biggest givers are not criminal defense lawyers who practice in Manhattan, but financiers and business leaders.In the case involving Trump SoHo, Mr. Vance\u2019s chief assistant at the time, Daniel R. Alonso, directed the campaign to return a $25,000 contribution from the Trumps\u2019 lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, before a meeting with Mr. Kasowitz. A year later, however, Mr. Vance\u2019s campaign accepted a $32,000 gift from Mr. Kasowitz, only to end up returning it after reporters highlighted it.Scott D. McNamara, the district attorney for Oneida County, said capping donations from defense lawyers with active cases would be easier for prosecutors in smaller counties, where there are few large contributions.But in the end, he said, it would depend on the honor system.\u201cIt\u2019s only as good as a candidate\u2019s word,\u201d he said.Follow James C.

{"Headline": "Eric Wynalda Discusses His Financial Problems \u2014 and Everything Else", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "The former member of the United States national team is taking an aggressive outsider approach in his campaign to be president of U.S. Soccer.Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Four weeks before delegates meet to elect the next president of the United States Soccer Federation, Eric Wynalda was in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday to address the state of soccer in a town hall before about 100 angry fans of the local Major League Soccer team.It was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men\u2019s national team failed to qualify for this summer\u2019s World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades.It is the rest of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 his detractors say is lacking. Wynalda\u2019s critics point out his campaign is being financed in part by a minor-league owner who is locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer, and they say he has little experience to prepare him for the task of running an organization with more than 170 employees and multi-million-dollar contracts with some of the biggest entities in sports, including Nike and ESPN.According to public records, Wynalda filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009, and subsequently had significant liens placed against his assets as recently as three years ago. He said the liens were filed in error and were discharged without his having to pay any additional taxes or penalties.In interviews, Wynalda said the roots of his financial problems dated to 2003, when he separated from his wife. Wynalda moved out and, he said, he expected her to pay the mortgage and taxes on their Southern California home.His former wife did not respond to a request for comment.The couple divorced in 2008. In 2009, Wynalda\u2019s personal bankruptcy filings showed him owing nearly $90,000 in mortgage and tax payments. The next year, Wynalda sold the house to satisfy creditors, with the proceeds going to pay off his mortgage and back taxes.According to bankruptcy filings, he reported annual business income ranging from $14,000 to $135,000. He later had to revise the report, explaining to the bankruptcy court, \u201cUpon further review it is now clear to me that I drastically overestimated my income.\u201dWynalda has also run an eponymous soccer academy, which \u201cnever made any profit,\u201d according to his bankruptcy filings, and he worked as an independent fruit drink sales representative for the now-defunct distribution company MonaVie. He stopped selling the product in 2010.\u201cWhen you have an ex-wife that is attached to you financially, there is a lot of stuff you\u2019ve got to go through,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have gone through divorces. I think they get it.\u201dWynalda said the focus should be on the problems at U.S. Soccer, rather than on personal financial problems he insisted are in his past. He dismissed concerns about what may appear to be a lack of business experience as failures of the imagination, rooted in an inability to conceive of a different sort of U.S. Soccer presidency, one in which the president prioritizes development of the sport above profit.\u201cUnderstanding those two components of the revenue that come into the federation is in my wheelhouse,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, he has pulled no punches, and it seems there is nothing and nobody Wynalda will not take aim at.On the current U.S. Soccer president, Sunil Gulati, an economist who teaches at Columbia University: \u201cHe\u2019s a lecturer, O.K. Some people buy it, and some people don\u2019t.\u201dOn fellow candidate Carlos Cordeiro, a semiretired partner at the investment bank Goldman Sachs: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Carlos Cordeiro knows nothing about television, and he certainly knows nothing about putting shoes on and playing in a World Cup.\u201dOn the business acumen of the board members and paid staff members currently running the federation: \u201cThey are a group of accountants moving money around and tripping on themselves, and falling in a bucket of TV money and calling themselves businessmen.\u201dGulati and U.S. Soccer declined to comment. In a statement, Cordeiro said he was the only candidate with \u201cthe skills to help oversee an organization with a 170 person staff, a $110 million budget, a $150 million surplus, and more than four million players, coaches, and referees.\u201dBetween the insults, though, Wynalda delivers a rousing pitch about American soccer, with enough internal logic to allow him to point to it as the solution for whichever particular problem one thinks ails the sport.\u201cI propose a threat to a monopoly,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what this is.\u201dHis sharpest criticisms often are saved for those at the highest level of the federation. He argues that U.S. Soccer, in concert with M.L.S. and its marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing, has for years propped up soccer in the 18 American cities with M.L.S. franchises, to the detriment of clubs and youth players elsewhere.His solution is a three-step process as simple to explain as it is difficult to implement. All soccer leagues in America should move to the same schedule that much of the world follows; M.L.S. should transform from a single-entity structure to individually run clubs; and the league and the lower divisions of soccer should also adopt a system of promotion and relegation \u2014 in which teams move up and down between division based upon their results.In Wynalda\u2019s estimation, the changes would produce a flood of television and sponsorship dollars in the sport. They also would improve the national team by forcing players into stronger competition for playing time, and give lower-level clubs an incentive to invest more heavily in youth development by giving them something more vital to play for.An added benefit, he said, is that it would improve U.S. Soccer\u2019s relationship with FIFA, the sport\u2019s global governing body which has criticized the U.S. for sticking to a March-through-December schedule rather than the August through May schedule used in Europe.Some of his language and proposals mirror the claims of those who have taken their grievances against U.S. Soccer, and M.L.S., to federal court. M.L.S. and its owners counter that a plan like Wynalda\u2019s would crater the country\u2019s top division and waste the hundreds of millions of dollars they have invested in it since it began play in 1996.To Wynalda, this misses the larger point. When the federation talks about business, \u201csoccer gets lost in the shuffle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up failing to make a World Cup, and then nobody knows who\u2019s to blame. But the people who run the machine, if you will, will continue to tell you everything is just fine.\u201dFor those in the audience in Columbus, Wynalda\u2019s challenge to the soccer hierarchy was music to their ears. Many fans of the local M.L.S. team, the Columbus Crew, believe they are suffering the brunt of what they see as their club\u2019s decision to prioritize profits over its connection to the city. Anthony Precourt, the owner of the Crew, has said he will move the team to Austin, Texas, next year unless an agreement can be reached on the construction of a downtown stadium.Wynalda spoke to their grievances. He also speaks to the grievances of those in charge of the second-division North American Soccer League, many of whom believe U.S. Soccer has stymied them from legitimately competing with M.L.S.\u201cWe are very aligned with Mr. Silva and his belief system,\u201d Wynalda said, \u201cand he wants, clearly, to see change in this country.\u201dWith a byzantine election process that involves allocating shares of votes to U.S. Soccer\u2019s various councils, Wynalda faces the difficult task of winning votes from an electorate that consists of many of the insiders he so publicly criticizes.The election for president of U.S. Soccer is not so much a popularity contest as it is a coalition-building proposition. U.S. Soccer\u2019s president is elected in a vote of representatives of its various councils: 25 percent shares for the youth, adult and pro councils; 20 percent to an athletes council; and the rest to a small group that includes board members, life members and even a fan representative.Yet in at least one way, Wynalda has already won. There is talk of a circumscribed role for the next president and of the hiring of a permanent general manager to oversee the national team programs. Topics that previously were rarely addressed \u2014 like promotion and relegation and whether Soccer United Marketing\u2019s long-term relationship with the federation is good for the broader interests of American soccer \u2014 are at the heart of the election.Wynalda\u2019s campaign has set the election\u2019s agenda, even if he eventually loses to a more well-connected candidate.\u201cThe reasoning for choosing to select somebody from within would be fear,\u201d he said.\u201cFear of the unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Members of Didi\u2019s technology and engineering team have been in Brazil working with employees at 99, which is based in S\u00e3o Paulo, for about a year, these people said.The new deal calls for Didi to pay roughly $600 million for the shares of 99 that it does not already own, giving it complete control of the Brazilian company, the people said. Didi has also agreed to put additional cash into 99. The acquisition will help 99\u2019s previous investors \u2014 a group that includes SoftBank, Riverwood Capital, Qualcomm Ventures and Monashees \u2014 cash out, representing a rare successful exit for investors in Brazilian internet start-ups.Peter Fernandez, 99\u2019s chief executive, is expected to stay on at the company, as are other top executives, the people familiar with the transaction said. Brazil is likely to remain the company\u2019s focus, although it may also expand elsewhere in Latin America.\u201cGlobalization is a top strategic priority for Didi,\u201d Cheng Wei, Didi\u2019s founder and chief executive, said in a statement.Talks between the companies were previously reported by The Information, a technology news website.99, originally named 99Taxis and founded in 2012, focused initially on working with licensed taxi drivers, taxi unions and government regulators. Uber entered Brazil two years later, and the companies have battled each other since. By the end of 2015, 99 had the most Brazilian users with the app on their mobile devices, according to data from research firm 7Park Data, with another ride-hailing company, Easy Taxi, in second place and Uber in third.In 2016, 99 had trouble securing additional financing amid an economic and political crisis in Brazil. That year, Paulo Veras, the company\u2019s co-founder and then chief executive, brought on Mr. Fernandez to be chief product officer. Mr. Fernandez later succeeded Mr. Veras and was tasked with finding global strategic partners for 99.In an interview with The New York Times last May, Mr. Fernandez said: \u201cWhen I joined the company, my top priority was to reach out to Didi. I was impressed with things Didi was doing in transportation.\u201dIn a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Fernandez said that 99 was \u201cconfident that being part of Didi Chuxing will vastly enhance our capability to expand our services throughout Brazil to bring critical value to users, drivers and cities.\u201dDidi has said it was drawn to 99\u2019s initial approach of working with regulators and taxi drivers instead of against them. In an interview with The Times last year, Stephen Zhu, a senior vice president at Didi, said: \u201c99 shares a lot of similarities with Didi in terms of business model and its evolution. Their culture and philosophy is very similar to ours.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Amasses $30 Million War Chest", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo raised an average of more than $32,000 per day for the last six months, according to campaign finance reports, and has now amassed a $30.5 million campaign chest in 2018 that so far has helped him scare away serious rivals in his bid for a third term.Mr. Cuomo received donations from an array of wealthy individuals and companies, from big Albany lobbying shops to real estate developers, from Hollywood moguls to the pharmaceutical industry. Many of the donors have business dealings with the state.New York maintains caps on donations \u2014 $65,100 is the maximum Mr. Cuomo can receive from an individual \u2014 but the limits and rules are some of the loosest of any state with such restrictions.Mr. Cuomo took full advantage. He collected $129,200 from the hedge fund manager Joseph DiMenna and his wife, $50,000 from the billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad, $25,000 from the Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, and $30,000 from Barry Diller, the billionaire businessman. Last week, three limited liability companies linked to the address of Brookfield Properties gave Mr. Cuomo a total of $150,000. Three of the nation\u2019s biggest accounting firms, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, combined to give Mr. Cuomo $100,000 last week, as well.The combination of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s cash and polling strength has proved daunting for would-be challengers.Whoever runs against him, Mr. Cuomo is almost certain to try to run up his margins in a show of strength, both for a third term in Albany, and as a potential presidential candidate in 2020.But while the governor\u2019s race has been slow to develop, there has been a swirl of intrigue in the undercard contest of lieutenant governor in the last 48 hours.By the end of the day, Ms. Hochul\u2019s spokeswoman, Haley Viccaro, said that Ms. Hochul \u201cfully intends to run for re-election as lieutenant governor.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Cuomo spent most of the last six months squirreling away his cash, operating with a lean political staff dedicated mostly to raising more money. He spent $1.3 million since July but that figure is deceptively inflated.His single largest expenditure was giving away old donations from Harvey Weinstein. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo donated the $111,400 he has received over the years from the disgraced Hollywood producer, who faces numerous accusations of sexual misconduct, to a group called Women\u2019s Justice Now.Mr. Cuomo spent another $140,000 on polling, split between Global Strategy Group and Central Marketing Inc.Most of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s spending was more mundane: more than 100 Uber, Lyft and taxi rides and 45 trips to Duane Reade. Docks Oyster Bar, the seafood restaurant downstairs from the governor\u2019s Manhattan office, is a frequent campaign haunt, with 15 visits, including a $1,118.43 meal tab one day last August.Advertisement"}

The adventurous program of his inaugural DSO concert in the fall seemed designed to show off the orchestra, and its new maestro, in their chameleonlike diversity. It featured Strauss\u2019s showstopping \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra,\u201d together with a French Baroque suite and a large-scale contemporary symphony.Although best known for early music, the repertoire performed by RIAS is wide-ranging. A program this spring will juxtapose Bach and Tom\u00e1s Lu\u00eds de Victoria with the 20th-century composers Hans Werner Henze and James MacMillan. \u201cWe always live in a continuum. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting to me,\u201d Mr. Doyle said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re told you only do \u2018alte Musik,\u2019 it\u2019s terribly dull being in a pigeonhole.\u201dMr. Doyle also has a long relationship with Opera North in Leeds, England, and his operatic experience should prove useful in RIAS\u2019s ongoing project of live recordings of Mozart operas under Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin, the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s music director designate.

In recent years, the Rundfunkchor has become something of a house choir for the Berlin Philharmonic, and won acclaim for its prominent role alongside that orchestra in Peter Sellars\u2019s well-traveled staging of Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d from 2010.For the 45-year-old Mr. Petrenko, who arrives in Berlin in the summer of 2019, the new job is something of a homecoming: Between 2002 and 2007, he was the general music director at the Komische Oper. But in part because of his reputation as an opera conductor, the philharmonic\u2019s decision caught many by surprise. Last March, he made his first appearance with the orchestra since his appointment in a program that included a smoldering performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth Symphony.Perhaps this affinity for opera has shaped Mr. Jurowski\u2019s flair for the dramatic. So far his first season at the RBS \u2014 the oldest of Berlin\u2019s radio orchestras, founded in 1923 \u2014 included a thunderous performance of Mahler\u2019s \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony (featuring the Rundfunkchor), as well as that composer\u2019s rarely heard orchestrations of Beethoven\u2019s Third and Fifth Symphonies. Mr. Juwoski \u201ccountered megalomania with a depth and tonal vastness that make many recordings look pale,\u201d the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote.After winning conducting competitions in Bamberg, Germany, in 2010, and Salzburg, Austria, in 2011, Mr. Rubikis was the music director of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater in Russia from 2012 to 2014. This summer, he will make an early debut as the Komische\u2019s director with Mr. Kosky\u2019s production of Shostakovich\u2019s \u201cThe Nose.\u201dAccording to Mr. Barenboim, the music director since 1992, the Staatsoper is now making an effort to attract individual and corporate sponsorship in a country lacking a strong tradition of private philanthropy.\u201cI\u2019ve worked in Europe, in Paris, here and in Chicago. I know both systems,\u201d Mr. Barenboim said. \u201cIn Chicago, it\u2019s zero public money, and in Berlin it\u2019s practically zero private money. And neither system can work in the world in the 21st century. It needs a mixture.\u201dMr. Barenboim called Mr. Schulz\u2019s appointment, which was suggested by the outgoing general manager, J\u00fcrgen Flimm, a \u201cvery smooth transition.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very open-minded,\u201d Mr. Barenboim added. \u201cWe will continue to do new operas, to commission new pieces.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Slaps New Sanctions on North Korea", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration unfurled new sanctions on Wednesday targeting North Korea and its weapons program, underscoring the aggressive approach that President Trump has promised to take against the government of Kim Jong-un.The new sanctions, released by the Treasury Department, target North Korean and Chinese trading companies, North Korean ships and North Korea\u2019s ministry of oil. They also hit North Korean representatives in China and Russia who are members of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and who have helped North Korea transfer chemicals and equipment used for weapons production.\u201cTreasury continues to systematically target individuals and entities financing the Kim regime and its weapons programs, including officials complicit in North Korean sanctions evasion schemes,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement.Mr. Mnuchin said that, in accord with United Nations Security Council resolutions, he also is calling on Russia and China to expel anyone working in their countries on behalf of North Korea\u2019s financial networks.The moves come as the White House has been ratcheting up pressure on North Korea following a fiery exchange between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim earlier this year, in which Mr. Trump declared on Twitter that America\u2019s nuclear arsenal is \u201cmuch bigger\u201d and more powerful than Mr. Kim\u2019s. The saber-rattling renewed fears about the prospect of war and raised questions about whether such a bombastic approach was the best way to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.In recent weeks, however, Mr. Trump has suggested that he might be willing to hold direct talks with Mr. Kim. He also voiced his support for the political thaw between North and South Korea, which have agreed to march their athletes together under one flag at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.The United States has been working systematically to undermine North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions by curbing the financing behind its weapons program.In testimony before Congress last week, Ms. Mandelker noted that North Korea has been using cover representatives and front companies to hide and transfer funds that finance its weapons program.Sanctions experts have suggested that the United States faces limited options targeting North Korea\u2019s illicit financing schemes because of the broad swath of sanctions that already have been imposed on the isolated Asian nation. The designation on Wednesday of two Chinese trading companies, Beijing Chengxing Trading Co. Ltd. and Dandong Jinxiang Trade Co., Ltd., signals that the Treasury Department is looking more broadly for ways to squeeze North Korea.\u201cThe Chinese trading companies that were targeted are the most interesting,\u201d said Mike Casey, a sanctions expert at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis International. \u201cEven though the U.S. hasn\u2019t been able to get a ton of direct economic pressure on North Korea, it certainly hasn\u2019t given up on exerting indirect economic pressure on North Korea.\u201dThe sanctions enable the United States to freeze the assets of the people or businesses that are designated and blocks Americans from doing business with them.On Wednesday, Japan said that a military plane had spotted a North Korean tanker and a Dominican-registered tanker side by side in the East China Sea on Saturday, apparently transferring cargo. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, on Thursday called that a sign that fuel sanctions were working, in that the North had been forced to go outside normal methods to obtain fuel.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A.I. Has Arrived in Investing. Humans Are Still Dominating.", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachines are starting to take the place of the people who flip burgers, drive across town and, lately, manage stock portfolios.Artificial intelligence is taking on a bigger role in making investment decisions.A.I., including an ability to analyze data and actually learn from it, is considered useful in executing certain investing models, such as high-frequency trading, and in helping fund managers with tasks that rely on gathering and interpreting reams of information. Going a step further, an exchange-traded fund introduced in October uses A.I. algorithms to choose long-term stock holdings.It is to early to say whether the E.T.F., A.I. Powered Equity, will be a trendsetter or merely a curiosity. Artificial intelligence continues to become more sophisticated and complex, but so do the markets. That leaves technology and investment authorities debating the role of A.I. in managing portfolios. Some say it will only ever be a tool, valuable but subordinate to its flesh-and-blood masters, while others envision it taking control and making decisions for many funds.\u201cWe are just beginning to see a rise of the machines in investment management,\u201d said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University. Although, he said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to define what the markets will look like\u201d if human judgment is usurped, he predicted that \u201cin the end, it will be a good thing for investors.\u201dArtificial intelligence is a term that may be spoken more than understood. Many investment firms use software to sift through data and perform rudimentary analysis by following fairly simple rules. The programs can create portfolios by screening universes of stocks to select ones that meet criteria related to corporate results, valuation metrics or trading patterns, or by tweaking the proportions of the constituent companies in an index based on certain factors.Those programs may be useful, but they are not A.I. because they are static; they do the same thing over and over until someone changes them. A.I. involves machine learning, in which a program updates itself as new information comes in. Whatever goal the program was created to achieve remains the same, but the problem-solving tools it uses keep changing and reflect the sum of the information it has to work with.Large fund management companies like Fidelity and Vanguard say they use A.I. for a range of purposes, but they decline to be specific.BlackRock says it relies on it for heavy cognitive lifting, often by scouring data to tease out patterns that might remain obscure to human eyes and brains. Examples offered by Jessica Greaney, a company spokeswoman, include identifying and trying to exploit nonintuitive relationships between securities or market indicators, perusing social media \u201cto gain insights on employee attitudes, sentiment and preferences,\u201d and monitoring search engines for words being entered on particular topics, say cars or luxury goods.These algorithms play a supporting role in BlackRock\u2019s investing, Ms. Greaney said. Decisions on what to buy and sell are made by living, breathing managers.The A.I. Powered Equity E.T.F. is different. It uses algorithms to go the last mile and select its holdings, usually 30 to 70 stocks, said Art Amador, one of the founders of EquBot, the company that created the fund. He had the assistance of an I.B.M. program that fosters technology start-ups, and the E.T.F. runs most of its calculations on I.B.M.\u2019s Watson supercomputer.\u201cEquBot\u2019s A.I. tech mimics the investment process of an army of equity research analysts working around the clock,\u201d Mr. Amador said. \u201cIt has data on 6,000 companies, one million articles and filings a day, and data on market sentiment.\u201d Beyond sorting through that information and using its programming to ensure it has what it considers the optimal portfolio \u2014 the fund typically makes at least one trade every day \u2014 it constantly fine-tunes its stock-picking methods.Mr. Amador says that artificial intelligence has an edge over the natural kind because of the inherent emotional and psychological weaknesses that encumber human reasoning.\u201cWhen it comes to traditional portfolio management, managers are going to talk to analysts and sector specialists, but these people have biases and incentives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe algorithm doesn\u2019t have them.\u201dWhat it also doesn\u2019t have is a superior track record. Between Oct. 18, when it began trading, and the end of the year, the E.T.F. rose 3.1 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Amador attributed the underperformance to a normal variability in returns. The fund\u2019s programming beat the market when tested against historical data, he said, and he expects the same in real life as time passes.Others aren\u2019t so sure how effective A.I. will be when put in charge of otherwise ordinary funds. Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment firm Research Affiliates, noted that A.I. can process immense amounts of data; the flip side is that it needs immense amounts of data for the algorithms to learn.Certain activities, like high-frequency trading, process market information tick by tick and seek to profit from making numerous trades and holding positions for matters of hours or minutes. Compared with conventional investing, this sort of trading gives A.I. programs more data, Mr. Arnott said, but it is limited in scope to patterns related to stock price movements, not the broader economic and commercial landscape.When it comes to managing long-term portfolios, however, there are too many moving parts in financial markets for A.I. to get its mechanical head around, in his view, and too many humans with flaws, motivations and unpredictable behavior doing the moving. He says the markets are far more complex than the games like chess and backgammon that A.I. algorithms have mastered.Tim Clift, chief investment strategist at Envestnet PMC, a firm that helps build portfolios, said that while artificial intelligence can give managers an edge, it is \u201ca little gimmicky at this point.\u201d\u201cWe know the markets are irrational, especially in the short term,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the machines aren\u2019t going to know how to behave in that kind of environment.\u201dGregg Fisher, a portfolio manager at the Gerstein Fisher Funds, cautioned that A.I. programs could be stumped by off-the-wall and out-of-the-blue developments that have no obvious analogues in their databases.They learn \u201cby studying past patterns that they expect to continue,\u201d he said. Referring to the events that precipitated the global financial crisis, he wondered: \u201cHow would A.I. have observed and planned for that? The quantity of different things that can happen is seemingly unlimited.\u201dBut for advocates of A.I., like Mr. Harvey at Duke, the ability to gather data and put it to good use also seems to be unlimited. He expects great strides in machine learning in the decades to come, allowing A.I. to assume a major role in how funds are managed and by whom.\u201cLarger firms will be providing information to managers that other firms have no chance of getting\u201d because they can\u2019t afford the necessary data management systems, he said. The result will be \u201c15 to 25 investment management superpowers that can harvest all that data.\u201dMaybe so, but some investment professionals prefer to give the final say to portfolio managers who were born, not made.\u201cI\u2019m a fan of automating everything possible, but having a human being push the last button is still a good thing,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cHopefully, we all get better and better and smarter and smarter, but there\u2019s something comforting about having an informed human being with sound judgment at the end of the process.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Personal Finance for Those Who Don\u2019t Have a Clue", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfChelsea Fagan sets herself a high bar in writing \u201cThe Financial Diet\u201d (Henry Holt, $19): She wants to prove to people who know little about personal finance that investing is both vital and not all that difficult.Does she deliver?Yes, and surprisingly well. If you had to give her a grade, it would be a solid \u201cB\u201d because of both her supportive tone and her ability to reduce what can be fairly complicated concepts \u2014 such as how you put together a comprehensive investment plan \u2014 to easily understood bite-size pieces.For example, in explaining why not enough of her generation understands money, she writes: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that the information available about personal finance oscillates between a less fun version of your dad yelling at you about stocks and tone-deaf articles about how millennials are not buying homes. (It\u2019s because we have billions in dollars of student debt.)\u201d There is actually another word after the word \u201cdebt,\u201d but it is a noun that this paper won\u2019t publish unless it is spoken by a prominent politician.The design by Lauren Ver Hage, who gets billing on the cover, also helps make the book appealing by making important ideas and intriguing thoughts jump out. For example, this sentence gets its own page: \u201cThe scariest thing about buying a home, in a lot of ways, is that it requires you do a not-insignificant amount of math.\u201dSo many finance books are relentlessly masculine in tone and focus that it\u2019s worth mentioning that this one skews female: Most of the experts quoted are women, and many references, to television shows like \u201cSex and the City,\u201d appear to be oriented toward women, too. But her advice is universal.For example, she suggests saving a combined 20 percent of your income for both short and long-term goals. And, she notes, \u201cSaving, living below your means, and diversifying your income often make the difference between being stuck in a job you can\u2019t stand and having the freedom to move on to something better.\u201d These ideas apply to just about everyone.So why does she not get a higher grade? For two interrelated reasons that boil down to this: She seems to advocate putting too much money into investments that are too conservative for younger investors.The good news is Ms. Fagan is terrific about emphasizing the need to save. Early on, she creates \u201cA Bank Account Pyramid,\u201d explaining where to put the money and when, and she also makes saving money a significant part of a five-point plan that she describes as \u201cThe Total Idiot\u2019s Guide to Investing.\u201dBut if you look at both, it is easy to see the two problems.The pyramid starts out with a strong base: Have a basic savings account to house your emergency fund.But it gets shakier from there. In the next layer up, she calls for putting money in certificates of deposit, which are \u201cgood for things like saving to buy a house in the next few years and other medium-term savings.\u201dCertainly, you don\u2019t want your down payment to disappear in a market crash the day before the money is due. But having all your money tied up in low-yielding C.D.s for more than three years before you buy a home will make it hard for your money to grow. As I write this, a three-year C.D. yields about just 2.2 percent and a five-year one isn\u2019t much better, 2.6 percent. (Three to five years would seem to fit within Ms. Fagan\u2019s definition of medium-term savings.)So her argument about where to put money for medium-term objectives is debatable \u2014 my position would be to hold some stock, shifting the money to more conservative investments as your goal draws nigh. For example, have 100 percent of the money in equities when the goal is five years out; 60 percent in equities and 40 percent in short-term bond funds and C.D.s if you will need the money in 36 months, and only move all the money into short-term C.D.s a year before you have to write the check.Ms. Fagan goes on to say that after putting cash into an emergency fund and buying C.D.s for short and intermediate goals, the rest of your savings should be in \u201clonger term investments.\u201d Like what? She doesn\u2019t say. A 30-year bond would qualify, but it\u2019s an awfully conservative place for a millennial investor saving for the long-term.The same flaw exists in her investment guide. Her first two points are great. Again, it starts with the emergency fund, followed by working hard to pay off nondeductible debt. That is sound advice. But after that, things get squishy.Her third point about opening a retirement account is fine as far as it goes, but where do you put that money? Ms. Fagan doesn\u2019t tell us.And her last point is confusing. After taking the first three steps, she writes, \u201cExplore other low-risk options such as mutual funds and index funds.\u201d Now on the surface that\u2019s just wrong. Mutual funds and index funds that invest in equities, and bonds for that matter, have risk. As the prospectus of each always points out, you can lose money.Giving Ms. Fagan the benefit of the doubt, I think she was trying to say that index funds and other mutual funds carry less risk to your portfolio than investing in individual stocks.However, there are fixed- income mutual funds that offer low yields. Simply saying invest in mutual funds is not helpful.But to be fair, Ms. Fagan did not set out to write the definitive investment book, and she emphasizes throughout that if you are confused, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to pay professionals\u201d to help you with things \u201cyou don\u2019t know how to do and will put off until it\u2019s too late.\u201d These quibbles aside, for the most part her advice and conclusions are solid.\u201cWe live in a world that encourages us to spend wastefully, accumulate more than we need, and put off things like retirement saving until \u2026 we are basically retired,\u201d she says. \u201dAnything that can help improve matters is a good thing.Advertisement"}

Gas riches and an independent-minded ruling family changed that. Now it\u2019s in the fight of its life.Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 For the emir of Qatar, there has been little that money can\u2019t buy.As a teenager he dreamed of becoming the Boris Becker of the Arab world, so his parents flew the German tennis star to Qatar to give their son lessons. A lifelong sports fanatic, he later bought a French soccer team, Paris Saint-Germain, which last summer paid $263 million for a Brazilian striker \u2014 the highest transfer fee in the history of the game.He helped bring the 2022 World Cup to Qatar at an estimated cost of $200 billion, a major coup for a country that had never qualified for the tournament.Now at age 37, the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has run into a problem that money alone cannot solve.Tamim denies the accusations, and chalks up the animosity to simple jealousy.\u201cThey don\u2019t like our independence,\u201d he said in an interview in New York in September. \u201cThey see it as a threat.\u201dThe Saudi prince has shaped the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Middle East and his endeavors could have far-reaching consequences, potentially driving up energy prices, upending Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and raising the chances of war with Iran.The Qatar dispute is perhaps the least understood piece of the action, but it has a particularly nasty edge.In September, at a normally soporific meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, Saudi and Qatari diplomats exchanged barbed epithets like \u201crabid dog\u201d and heated accusations of treachery and even cruelty to camels. \u201cWhen I speak, you shut up!\u201d yelled Qatar\u2019s minister of state for foreign affairs, Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi.\u201cNo, you are the one who should shut up!\u201d his Saudi counterpart shouted back.The highly personalized rancor has the unmistakable air of a family feud. Qataris, Saudis and Emiratis stem from the same nomadic tribes, share the same religion and eat the same food. So their dispute has shades of quarreling cousins, albeit ones armed with billions of dollars and American warplanes.That the other Gulf countries even care about Qatar enough to despise it is a relatively new development.Then, in 1971, Qatar struck gas.The discovery of the world\u2019s largest gas field was initially a source of bitter disappointment. \u201cPeople hoped for oil,\u201d said Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, a former energy minister. But by the 1990s, new technology allowed gas to be liquefied and exported in tanker ships.The bet paid off spectacularly. Gas boomed, and by 2010 Qatar accounted for 30 percent of the global market.But Qatar\u2019s swagger is deeply contentious among its neighbors. In their reach for global influence, the Thanis have pursued ambidextrous, sometimes contradictory policies \u2014 preaching the virtues of peace, education and women\u2019s rights while bankrolling Islamist extremists in Syria and hosting the biggest United States military base in the Middle East.To Saudi Arabia and the Emirates \u2014 and Bahrain and Egypt, who have joined them in the boycott \u2014 Qatar is a nation of vexatious meddlers, intoxicated by its own wealth, that needs to be cut down to size.Three dueling, headstrong royals are at the center of the dispute.Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Mohammed, 32, is leading a campaign to overhaul and energize his stultified society, including with outlandish proposals such as a $500 billion city on the Red Sea run by robots. He has a staunch ally in Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, 56, the hawkish crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective ruler of the Emirates, who has built a formidable military and shares his Saudi counterpart\u2019s deep hostility toward Iran.Both princes are arrayed against Tamim, the emir of Qatar. A towering man with a diplomatic mien, Tamim is in many respects a classic Gulf potentate: educated like his father at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England, he has three wives and 10 children, and lives in several luxurious palaces in Doha, a futuristic city of glass towers and curling highways.His rise to power in 2013, at the age of 33, offered a stark contrast with the gerontocracy of Saudi Arabia, where rulers clung to their thrones till reaching their deathbeds. And his easy manner belies a stubborn streak that his neighbors see as the mark of a dangerous gadfly.The baroque feuding among the three leaders \u2014 a twisting tale of cyberespionage, propaganda salvos, palace intrigue and high-stakes desert hunts \u2014 is worthy of an ancient Gulf power drama. Played by rich men in flowing white robes known as thobes, it has been called the \u201cGame of Thobes.\u201d But it also represents a profound moment of reckoning for the glimmering city-states of the Gulf.Having largely avoided the turmoil of the Arab Spring in 2011, they find themselves hurtling toward an uncertain new economic and political order. At the center of the tumult is Qatar, the Lilliputian contender that for years punched above its weight and is now thrust into the fight of its life.In downtown Doha, behind the imposing palace where the emir holds court twice a week, lies a discreet new museum that tells an ugly story with bracing honesty.Through a series of polished exhibits, the museum, the Bin Jelmood House, delves into Qatar\u2019s ignominious history of slavery, which was not abolished here until 1952. An evocative video recreates the suffering of the African slaves shipped from Zanzibar to dive for pearls, the mainstay of Qatar\u2019s economy until the mid-20th century. A price list outlines the trade\u2019s heartless calculations: 1,200 rupees, then about $550, for a driver in 1926; 1,500 rupees for a cook in 1909.The museum, in its willingness to openly address the sins of the past, mirrors the image the Thanis seek to project for their country \u2014 open and enlightened, less dour than archconservative Saudi Arabia, more restrained than freewheeling Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.While Saudi women will finally be allowed to drive in June, Qatari women have been driving for decades. In Qatar, there are cinemas, bars and even female race jockeys. Christians can worship openly. Although Qataris share the puritanical Wahhabi strand of Islam with Saudi Arabia, there are no public beheadings or other spectacles that offend the modern conscience.Tamim lauds his country\u2019s democratic values. In 50 years, he recently predicted, Al Jazeera will be seen to have \u201cchanged the whole idea of free speech in the region.\u201d In many respects, it already has.But the openness goes only so far.Although foreign workers make up 90 percent of Qatar\u2019s three million residents, they have paltry rights, and Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations have been marred by a stream of reports by human rights organizations about abuses of migrant workers. A new law announced in October could significantly improve the situation if it is put in place.Even the slavery museum is not quite as it seems. To avoid offending Qataris about a delicate aspect of their history, it opened in 2015 without the fanfare usually accorded a royal project.As a result, few Qataris seem to have heard of the museum, and it is often empty.For over a century, Qatar\u2019s rulers were plagued by insecurity, usually at the hands of their own relatives.Tamim\u2019s grandfather toppled a cousin as emir in 1972, only to be pushed from the throne himself by his son, Hamad, in 1995. The ousted emir, who learned of his fate while on vacation in Switzerland, denounced his son as an \u201cignorant man\u201d and then retreated into exile.Once the gas billions flowed, starting in about 2000, family tensions eased, paving the way for an ambitious, reform-minded cast of royals.In the Middle East, though, Qatar\u2019s rulers have deployed their wealth to assert their independence from their larger neighbors.For decades, Saudi Arabia, which is 186 times as large, treated Qatar as a virtual vassal state. In the 1940s, Saudi rulers took a slice of Qatar\u2019s modest oil revenues; later they nibbled at Qatar\u2019s territory and dictated its foreign and defense policy.Tamim\u2019s father, Hamad, accused the Saudis of trying to oust him in a failed coup in 1996 \u2014 a bitter episode that has framed the decades of simmering rivalry ever since.Striking out on their own, the Qataris at first played the role of regional peacemaker, turning Doha into a sort of Geneva-on-the-Gulf where protagonists from wars in Sudan, Somalia and Lebanon could hash out their differences in five-star hotels. They embraced America, hosting a vast air base since 2003, the year of the Iraq war, and won popular influence through Al Jazeera, whose provocative style irked just about every Arab government.The Qataris hosted leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, causing Israeli officials to call Doha a \u201cClub Med for terrorists.\u201dBut it was the Arab Spring in 2011 that truly set Qatar apart. As grass-roots movements rose up against the established order across the Middle East, the Saudis and Emiratis were alarmed by the growing strength of political Islamists, like Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, which they feared could spread chaos in their own countries.Qatar supported the Islamists.The emir could afford to be bold. Qatar had vast wealth, a sprawling American air base just a few miles from his palace and no domestic opposition to speak of.\u201cThere was a feeling they could do anything they wanted, as long as they threw enough money at the problem,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, the author of \u201cQatar and the Arab Spring.\u201d \u201cTheir self-confidence was at a peak.\u201dBut in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, frustration was brewing.In February 2016, the two princes traveled to the eastern desert of Saudi Arabia on a hunting safari, followed by summer shooting expeditions in France and Wales, trips that bonded the hyperactive 32-year-old Saudi and the older, like-minded Emirati. As well as a modernizing vision for their countries, they share a penchant for Shakespearean drama.\u201cThey are two peas in a pod who see the need for unusual action in unusual times,\u201d said David B. Roberts, a Gulf expert at King\u2019s College London.Until recently, the royal rivalry was most evident in their global contest for the most expensive and attention-grabbing ventures. In the Emirates, Dubai has the world\u2019s tallest building, while Qatar has the 2022 World Cup and a number of American universities.They flame each other through their media. Al Jazeera gives free rein to Saudi dissidents, while Sheikha Mozah is the object of lurid, often misogynistic insults in the Saudi, Emirati and Egyptian media, where she is portrayed as a power-hungry manipulator of weak men.But at its core the rivalry is political. It matters little that Qatar lost its Arab Spring bets: Across the region, Islamist forces bankrolled by Doha are vanquished or in retreat. Still, Qatar\u2019s neighbors view it with near pathological suspicion.That mistrust burst into the open in 2014 when Saudi Arabia and the Emirates withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, setting off a diplomatic crisis that ended nine months later with a smooth reassurance from Tamim that he would meet their concerns.Then last year, without warning, those tensions spiked again.The crisis that set off the Gulf\u2019s biggest confrontation in decades started with a series of random, seemingly unrelated events. And in vintage 2017 fashion, they involved fake news and the new American president, Donald J. Trump.In March, a sulfurous dispute erupted over the fate of Alaa Alsiddiq, an Emirati dissident who has been living in Doha since 2013. After she published an article on Al Jazeera\u2019s website about women\u2019s rights in the Gulf, the Emiratis, who had canceled her passport, renewed longstanding demands that Tamim send her home.The emir refused, telling one Western ambassador that he feared she could be tortured or killed. Emirati fury grew.It also offered a powerful talking point with the new American president.Even before Mr. Trump landed in Saudi Arabia in May, on the first foreign trip of his presidency, he appeared to be firmly in the Saudi camp. For months, the Saudi and Emirati leadership had cultivated a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s adviser and son-in-law.Mr. Kushner, a foreign policy neophyte, absorbed the princes\u2019 views on the region, including their hostility to Qatar, a senior State Department official said, describing the relationships as very close.Mr. Trump also met with Tamim, and the Qatari leader thought it went well. But two days later, back in Doha, the emir was shaken from his sleep with disturbing news: Someone had hacked the state-run Qatar News Agency and posted on its website a report of the emir calling Iran a \u201csuperpower,\u201d lauding Hamas and speculating that Mr. Trump might not last long in power.The report was pure fiction, but Qatar\u2019s neighbors pounced on it as the real thing. Within minutes, pundits at Emirati and Saudi television stations were expounding on the perfidy of Qatar and issuing heated denunciations. Tamim frantically called his ministers and had the article taken down.Thinking the problem solved, he settled in to watch a big National Basketball Association game, the Golden State Warriors and the San Antonio Spurs. In fact, his troubles had just started.Over the following weeks, Emirati and Saudi news outlets accelerated their attacks on Qatar, accusing it of threatening Gulf stability. Several conservative think tanks in Washington joined the chorus. Then on June 5, without warning, the four-country boycott crashed onto Qatar.Mr. Trump was eager to take credit.\u201cDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,\u201d he wrote in a tweet the next day. \u201cLeaders pointed to Qatar \u2014 look!\u201dAmerican intelligence officials determined that the planting of the fake news story had been orchestrated by the Emirates, which had been quietly pushing for a boycott of Qatar since 2016, a United States official told The New York Times.\u201cThe smoking gun leads to Abu Dhabi,\u201d the seat of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, he said, citing briefings from intelligence officials. \u201cThere is no ambiguity.\u201d Moreover, the official said, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had prior knowledge of the ruse and had signaled his approval.Yousef al-Otaiba, the Emirates\u2019 ambassador to Washington, said his country \u201ccategorically denied\u201d any involvement in the hack. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.One afternoon last August, I drove to Aqua Park, a water park in the desert 20 minutes outside Doha, to see how Qatar was surviving the boycott. Inside the park, where midday temperatures reached 120 degrees, men and women wearing swimsuits mingled freely, although bikinis were discouraged. Screaming children barreled down the Boomerango, the park\u2019s largest ride. American warplanes rumbled overhead, bound for battle zones in Iraq and Syria.The park is a typical Qatari business in that no Qataris work there: The park\u2019s manager, Mohammed Firdous Raj, is Malaysian, the lifeguards are Kenyan and other employees are Lebanese and Egyptian. Before the boycott, one quarter of its business came from Saudi tourists, who made the 25-minute drive from the border. But now the desert highway was half-empty, as were many hotels in Doha.\u201cWe\u2019d like them to come back,\u201d Mr. Raj said of the Saudis. But the park\u2019s owner, a former Qatari government minister, had allowed him to discount ticket prices, so business was about the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity about the Saudis,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cEither way, we will manage.\u201dThe boycott has inflicted some pain on Qatar. With its only land border closed, its ships blocked from passing through Emirati ports and its planes restricted from flying over neighboring airspace, import costs have soared. The stock exchange lost one-fifth of its value last year. Foreign workers, unable to party in Dubai on weekends, grumble about the claustrophobia of buttoned-up Doha. And the travel bans have torn apart families, whose relatives have straddled borders for centuries.But for the most part, daily life in Doha is largely unchanged. Pricey wine flows in five-star hotels, work continues on a new metro system, and a striking National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, is set to become the city\u2019s latest architectural marvel.And the boycott has backfired in some respects. The trade restrictions have forced Qatar into deeper economic ties with Iran, while Tamim has become the object of a fervent personality cult. The emir\u2019s image adorns billboards draped off skyscrapers, and he is lionized in saccharine songs hailing his steely leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s the embodiment of the philosopher king,\u201d said Dana al-Fardan, one such balladeer.Although Mr. Trump has since stopped his attacks on Qatar, presenting himself as a mediator, some senior advisers continue the fight. Breitbart News Network, which until recently was run by Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime ideological firebomber Stephen K. Bannon, has published dozens of articles attacking Qatar as a rogue ally.Is Qatar soft on terrorism? Some of the charges are red herrings, American officials say. Tamim cut funding to most extremist militias in Syria and Islamist groups in Libya in 2015, at the urging of the Obama administration. His cordial ties with Iran are a matter of necessity because the two countries share the giant gas field that is the source of Qatar\u2019s wealth.Where Qatar does have a case to answer, officials say, is in its treatment of Qatari citizens accused of financing terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Trials of accused financiers, when they take place, occur in secret, making it hard to know what punishment, if any, is imposed.For Qatar\u2019s supporters, the hypocrisy reveals what they say is the boycott\u2019s true goal: to cut down or take out Qatar\u2019s youthful emir, the royal who refuses to go along to get along.For Tamim, the ultimate aim of his neighbors is to oust him from power. In the interview with The Times, he cited as precedent the 1996 Saudi-sponsored coup attempt against his father. \u201cThis was always the warning at the back of our heads,\u201d he said.His fears may be justified. In the early days of the boycott, two American officials said, Saudi and Emirati leaders mulled possible military action against Qatar. The precise details were unclear, but the talk was deemed serious enough for Mr. Tillerson to personally warn the Saudi and Emirati leaders against precipitous action. Mr. Trump later repeated that advice in a call to Saudi leaders.Yousef al-Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to Washington, denied in an interview that there was ever a military plan. \u201cWe never contemplated it,\u201d he said.But even the suggestion of military action highlighted how the old rules have been shattered in the Gulf. The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional body that is supposed to resolve such disputes, has been invisible during the crisis. Instead the Saudis have promoted a string of exiled Qatari businessmen as potential political rivals to Tamim.Qatar denied any involvement in the hacking. \u201cQatar, as a matter of policy and principle, does not engage in cyber crimes or traffic in \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d the government said in a statement to The Times on Sunday.Nothing suggests that the dispute will be resolved anytime soon. Although the Saudis and Emiratis may have overestimated the boycott\u2019s ability to pressure Qatar, they may feel they have little to lose by continuing it.\u201cI think they are content to bleed Qatar,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, the analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s an indignant anger at what they see as a rich, cocooned, perfidious little state that is finally feeling the consequences of its actions.\u201dBut as the dispute moved to the skies last week, with accusations of Qatari warplanes buzzing Emirati commercial jets, it highlighted how easily the crisis could escalate.Days later, Tamim hosted a lavish banquet for President Emmanuel Macron of France at Idam, a French restaurant on the top floor of the Museum of Islamic Art that offers a shimmering panorama over the Doha skyline.Over a sumptuous meal prepared by the celebrity chef Alain Ducasse, the two leaders toasted the deals they had signed that morning. The emir had ordered another 12 French fighter jets.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaymi.

He was 85.His wife, Linda Kay Hall, said the cause was prostate cancer.Mr. Hall\u2019s versatile output drew on Southern roots \u2014 country, blues, R&B, gospel \u2014 and on his instincts for concisely emotive storytelling, lean arrangements and solid grooves. He was a proud taskmaster in the studio.In the segregated Alabama of the 1960s, black and white performers collaborated at FAME, as they did at another fortress of Southern soul, Stax in Memphis.\u201cIt was a dangerous time, but the studio was a safe haven where blacks and whites could work together in musical harmony,\u201d Mr. Hall wrote.Rick Hall was born Roe Erister Hall on Jan. 31, 1932, in Forest Grove, Miss. He grew up in rural poverty in northern Alabama, raised by his father, a sawmill worker and sharecropper. He was 6 when his father gave him a mandolin, and he would go on to learn fiddle, guitar and bass.In 1959, Mr. Hall, Mr. Sherrill and a third partner, Tom Stafford, started FAME as a demo-recording studio and music publisher. Mr. Hall and Mr. Sherrill also formed a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band, the Fairlanes, that added Dan Penn as lead singer; he would become a Southern soul mainstay as a songwriter and producer.The initial FAME partnership fractured, and Mr. Hall restarted FAME Studios across the Tennessee River in Muscle Shoals. He wrote songs that were recorded by country singers including Roy Orbison, Brenda Lee and George Jones. But he saw more opportunity in rhythm and blues.The producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records brought Wilson Pickett to FAME for sessions that yielded five singles: \u201cLand of a Thousand Dances,\u201d \u201cMustang Sally,\u201d \u201cFunky Broadway,\u201d \u201cHey Jude\u201d and \u201cHey Joe.\u201d The idea of recording \u201cHey Jude\u201d came from the studio\u2019s lead guitarist: Duane Allman.Mr. Wexler returned to the studios with Aretha Franklin, who recorded two career-defining songs there in a day: \u201cI Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)\u201d and \u201cDo Right Woman, Do Right Man.\u201dBut that day ended in a fistfight between Mr. Hall and Ms. Franklin\u2019s husband and manager at the time, Ted White. Ms. Franklin never returned to FAME Studios; Muscle Shoals musicians, without Mr. Hall, recorded \u201cRespect\u201d with her in New York City. Still, FAME\u2019s soul hits continued, among them Etta James\u2019s \u201cTell Mama\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d Rather Go Blind\u201d and Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cSlip Away\u201d and \u201cPatches.\u201dA studio band Mr. Hall had assembled at FAME \u2014 Barry Beckett on keyboards, Jimmy Johnson on guitar, David Hood on bass and Roger Hawkins on drums \u2014 became recognized as the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, also known as the Swampers. In 1969, in partnership with Mr. Wexler, they founded the rival Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Ala., and went on to record with the Staple Singers, Paul Simon, Bob Seger, Traffic, Bob Dylan and many others. They eventually reconciled with Mr. Hall.Mr. Hall gathered other musicians and continued to make hits. The Osmonds had a No. 1 pop single with \u201cOne Bad Apple,\u201d produced by Mr. Hall in 1970. Mr. Hall was nominated for a Grammy Award for producer of the year in 1970, and Billboard magazine named him producer of the year in 1971.Mr. Hall largely turned toward country and pop with hits including Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 \u201cFancy,\u201d Mac Davis\u2019s \u201cBaby, Don\u2019t Get Hooked on Me\u201d and Paul Anka\u2019s 1974 duet with Odia Coates, \u201c(You\u2019re) Having My Baby.\u201d He co-produced Shenandoah, which had been a bar band in Muscle Shoals, as it became a country hitmaker in the late 1980s.In addition to his wife, Mr. Hall is survived by his sons, Rick Jr., Mark and Rodney; his brothers, Larry and Jerry; his sister, Betty Bedford; and five grandchildren.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location of Mr. Hall\u2019s home, where he died. It is in Muscle Shoals, Ala. \u2014 not Florence, Ala.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can States Fix the G.O.P. Tax Law?", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut their celebrations may have been premature. In their rush to enact tax cuts before the end of 2017, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress created a legislative monster riddled with flaws and loopholes that even they don\u2019t fully understand. They have offered up a bonanza to tax lawyers and accountants looking for provisions that can be exploited to lower taxes for clients.There are three approaches state officials could use to undercut the tax law. First, they could encourage families to donate money to the state government by offering them a credit for those gifts against state income taxes. The idea would be to turn state taxes into charitable donations that are deductible against the federal income tax. This might sound like a gimmick that the Internal Revenue Service could easily shut down. But David Kamin, a law professor at New York University, says there is precedent supporting such a policy. For example, some states offer tax credits to people who donate money to private schools, and these donations also qualify for the federal charity deduction.But other experts warn that switching to a payroll tax would be complicated and could have unintended consequences if states don\u2019t put in place other safeguards. For example, it might not be possible for employers to reduce the wages of workers who are covered by union contracts or who earn the minimum wage. A switch to a payroll tax might also tempt some businesses to move to nearby states that do not have such a tax.It is hard to say if any of these maneuvers would be successful. But they could potentially cost the federal government billions of dollars in tax revenue. No doubt Republicans in Washington would be peeved and might try to pass legislation that seeks to outlaw or reduce the effectiveness of these state policies. But that might not be an option if Democrats gain House seats or take control of one or both chambers of Congress in the November election \u2014 an outcome that has probably become more likely thanks to the tax law.None of this should come as a surprise. Republican leaders invited taxpayers and state governments to play tax avoidance games by rushing through an unpopular mess of a tax bill that, over time, will benefit few and hurt many.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan Dentist Must Pay His Mother Nearly $1 Million for \u2018Upbringing\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 It is an age-old arrangement, and one that is usually implicit: Parents pay for their children\u2019s educations, and hope that in their old age the children will support them.But in a case that made its way to Taiwan\u2019s highest court, a mother who had financed her son\u2019s dental training sued him, asserting that he had broken a written agreement to support her from the proceeds of his dental practice.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court sided with his mother.The case attracted considerable attention because the mother and son had put down in a written contract \u2014 signed when he was 20 \u2014 what is often left unsaid, particularly in a heavily Confucian-influenced society that emphasizes filial piety. The principle is backed up by law in Taiwan, where adults are legally prohibited from abandoning their parents.Each side advanced arguments: The mother urged the court to enforce the contract. The son maintained that he had already paid his mother $1 million and should not have to pay her more.According to news outlets in Taiwan, the woman, identified only by her surname, Luo, raised her two sons after she and their father divorced, putting both through dental school. (Her ex-husband remarried.)When she filed her lawsuit eight years ago, the woman said she had come from a well-to-do doctor\u2019s family.\u201cWhen I was young I came from a na\u00efve and wealthy family and married into a military family that didn\u2019t even have a license\u201d to practice medicine, Ms. Luo said, according to Apple Daily in Taiwan. \u201cI sacrificed all of my leisure time.\u201dMs. Luo\u2019s family provided funds that enabled her to run a dental clinic where her husband, surnamed Chu, practiced until their divorce.Ms. Luo told the Supreme Court that when she worked as a single mother to put her sons through dental school, she was concerned that they might not help support her in old age, so she had each sign an agreement when they turned 20. Her sons both became practicing dentists in 2003, Apple Daily reported.The agreement stipulated that after becoming dentists, her sons would pay her 60 percent of their net profits until the total amount paid reached 50 million new Taiwan dollars, or just under $1.7 million.According to a report in The Liberty Times, the younger son told the court that he worked in his mother\u2019s dental clinic and repaid her more than $1 million. Given that he signed the contract when he was only 20 \u2014 and that he had already paid back so much of his contractual debt to his mother \u2014 he argued that his debt should be cleared.The court disagreed, however, ruling on Tuesday that because he signed the agreement as a legal adult, he was responsible for satisfying its terms.The court ordered Dr. Chu to pay an \u201cupbringing fee\u201d of more than $754,000, with additional interest bringing the total award for his mother to more than $967,000.In Taiwan, filial piety and education are widely recognized as important virtues, but young people face a tougher economic environment than their parents. The verdict drew mixed reactions.\u201cI believe everyone should want to repay their parents for raising them once they\u2019ve grown old,\u201d one Taipei-based dentist, Wu Chih-hang, 30, said in a phone interview, \u201cso I support the judges\u2019 decision.\u201d\u201cI also sympathize with the dentist\u2019s rough lot,\u201d he said. \u201cHis mother went as far as to put a value on raising her son, which is probably a difficult environment for the average person to imagine growing up in.\u201dBut a Facebook user, Huang Ya-ling, was critical of Dr. Chu. \u201cUnfilial people are beneath pigs and dogs,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Have Met the Enemy, and He Is Us", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is well documented that Americans are ever more divided: along party, ideological, socio-economic and cultural lines; by geographic, demographic, racial and religious differences. Our political polarization hampers our ability to tackle important national issues, whether immigration, infrastructure, timely budgeting or closing Guant\u00e1namo. The recent government shutdown and the looming threat of another underscore this problem.The same policy stagnation afflicts our ability to confront the most pressing threats to our security, from North Korea to the risk of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction, from pandemic disease to Russian aggression. Our ability to counter such outside menaces is increasingly undermined by our collective failure to work together. Indeed, the most significant, long-term threat to our security may be our domestic political polarization.America\u2019s adversaries exploit the vulnerability created by our dysfunctional democracy. Today, in contrast to Sept. 11, a terrorist attack is more likely to divide than unite us, as we saw after Benghazi, San Bernardino, Calif., and, most recently, Niger. This makes us an even more attractive target, as our enemies benefit not only from the initial attack but also from the lasting consequences of a more fractious, fragmented America.Similarly, the Iranians know that our resolve to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon may crumble under partisan pressure. China is pursuing its economic and strategic ambitions in Asia unconstrained by an America so divided that we jettisoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement we negotiated, while its signatories reap its rewards without us.Our divisions impede our ability to defend against foreign adversaries. Two of the three congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election are foundering over partisan efforts to distract from mounting evidence supporting the intelligence community\u2019s high confidence that such meddling occurred. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, and the F.B.I. have also been subjected to outrageous and dishonest assaults on their integrity and professionalism.Now, with midterm elections just nine months away and the Russians seemingly undeterred, neither the administration nor Congress has taken discernible action to reduce our vulnerability to electoral interference. There appears little prospect that our leaders are ready to \u201cput country over party,\u201d even to confront the most serious foreign threat to our democracy since World War II.Domestic divisions are longstanding, but they are worsening to an extent not seen since the Vietnam era. Many factors have contributed: unregulated money in politics; partisan gerrymandering; cable news and social media, which allow us to filter the information we consume; and political segregation along geographic lines. All have accelerated the atrophy of the political center in favor of extremists on both left and right.We lack civil discourse across ideological boundaries, such that college professors issue trigger warnings and students seek to block campus speakers whose views they find noxious. And now we have a president who fuels political, racial and religious fissures from the White House bully pulpit and gives comfort to white nationalists. Worse, many of his congressional allies serially defend or ignore his behavior.I know of no silver bullet to address our deepening domestic divisions. I do know we need to acknowledge and defeat them with the urgency a wartime adversary warrants. We need to demand leaders who aim to unite rather than divide us. We need to stop demonizing \u201cthe other,\u201d and explain, listen and learn from one another. We need to teach our children, and reteach ourselves, that facts are facts. There is no eliding truth and falsehood.We need to know basic civics, our founding documents, how to think critically, and to distinguish the bogus from the truthful. We need social media to require truth in advertising, so that foreign adversaries can\u2019t stoke discord undetected. We need to reform campaign finance and end gerrymandering. We need to fix our electoral vulnerabilities and hold our adversaries accountable, as bipartisan legislation just introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rightly aims to do.Above all, we need to decide whether we want to remain the world\u2019s pre-eminent power \u2014 a strong, cohesive beacon of democracy \u2014 or if we are content to allow our national autoimmune disorder, like a flesh-eating disease, to devour our body politic. President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address next week has the potential to be pivotal. Some will no doubt be comforted if he somehow manages to strike a unifying tone. But what truly matters is whether his actions can finally match any short-lived words.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Hong Kong Official Pleads Not Guilty in Africa Bribery Case", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe former official, Chi Ping Patrick Ho, and a former foreign minister of Senegal, Cheikh Gadio, were arrested in November and charged with money laundering and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.According to United States prosecutors, Mr. Ho took part in two bribery schemes. One involved a $2 million bribe offered to President Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad \u201cin exchange for securing business advantages\u201d for the conglomerate in its effort to obtain oil rights in the country without facing international competition. Mr. Gadio was the conduit for the offer, and was compensated by Mr. Ho with $400,000 wired through New York, the prosecutors said.Prosecutors say the second scheme involved a $500,000 bribe, again wired through New York, to an account controlled by Uganda\u2019s foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, and gifts and promises that profits would be shared with businesses controlled by his family from a potential joint venture involving the conglomerate.The governments of Uganda and Chad have denied the allegations, as has Mr. Gadio.Douglas S. Zolkind, a federal prosecutor, told Judge Forrest that \u201cvoluminous\u201d evidence would have to be shared with Mr. Ho\u2019s lawyers, including \u201cseveral hundred thousand documents consisting of emails and attachments\u201d from more than 10 accounts that prosecutors received warrants to search. Many of the documents are in Chinese, and some are in French.He also estimated that \u201cmultiple thousands of pages of bank and financial and wire records relating to multiple different entities\u201d would need to be shared, along with about seven boxes of paper documents and information from 11 phones, four computers, a camera and other equipment seized during a search of the energy organization\u2019s offices in Virginia; data from two cellphones, an iPad and multiple USB drives seized from Mr. Ho; records from three iPhones, a Samsung phone, and multiple USB drives and SIM cards seized from Mr. Gadio.The volume of information is so great, Judge Forrest said, that \u201cmy guess is that it will be a year\u201d before the start of the trial. Then he said, \u201cWe really can go to trial whenever the defense is prepared to go to trial.\u201dAt a hearing on Dec. 1, Mr. Ho was denied bail. A federal prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that \u201cif he were to make it back to China, or for that matter, Uganda or Chad, the countries in which he committed the bribery offenses, we can never get him back.\u201d Mr. Ho\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Kim, argued that \u201cto flee would be a disgrace,\u201d and said, \u201cIt would destroy everything he\u2019s worked for and it would destroy his international reputation.\u201dMr. Ho\u2019s lawyers on Friday asked Judge Forrest to allow Mr. Ho to live under house arrest, with electronic monitoring, on a $10 million bond, with an agreement that he waive extradition, to minimize the chance he might flee.The case has received coverage in China, where CEFC, a once-obscure company, has become a major energy player, with investments in Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.CEFC is one of a small number of Chinese companies to receive Beijing\u2019s approval to pursue high-profile deals at a time when the government has largely restricted overseas acquisitions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fox in the Globalist Henhouse? Davos Awaits Trump\u2019s Arrival", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 As the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum gets underway here this week, the conversation among business and policy leaders in the Alps is already dominated by one topic: What will the first-time invitee President Trump say?Mr. Trump, who is to arrive later this week, is drawing a mix of breathless anticipation, anxiousness and downright agitation among a crowd that has long considered him an outsider.Davos has always been a playground for elites who believe in globalism, climate change and free trade. The cast of multinational leaders this year ranges from chief executives like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to philanthropists like Bill Gates and policymakers like Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor. Over the years, it has attracted artists like Bono and Matt Damon.It is both speed-dating at high altitude for the cognoscenti and a cerebral affair filled with panel conversations about issues such as gender diversity, harassment, artificial intelligence and the environment. The official theme this year is \u201cCreating a shared future in a fractured world.\u201dAll of which makes Mr. Trump the anti-Davos Man.\u201cTrump is as loathed by the elites of Western Europe as he is by the elites of Manhattan,\u201d said Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and a longtime Davos attendee, although he will not go this year. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just personal: His policy positions on trade and immigration are blasphemy in Davos, as are his recent derogatory remarks about Africa.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump ran his populist campaign against the very plutocrats who populate this forum every year. His former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, acknowledged as much during the election when he said that the American working class was \u201ctired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos.\u201d Mr. Dimon, a longtime Davos attendee, once described the event as a place \u201cwhere billionaires tell millionaires what the middle class feels.\u201dThe big question is, how will Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign play here? Will he use the stage as an opportunity to deliver a live version of his Twitter feed and publicly eviscerate \u2014 and possibly humiliate \u2014 the crowd? He has already shown he can be hostile toward traditional alliances by scolding European nations for not paying their fair share toward NATO.Or will Mr. Trump use the gathering as a chance to bring leaders together?Will he talk about protectionism or free trade?Mr. Trump\u2019s presence has been described as a mixed blessing by many of the participants.\u201cTrump\u2019s attendance is exciting for attendees inasmuch as it shows them Davos is still the place to be,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe opposite of love is irrelevance, and Trump gets that as much as everyone else attending.\u201dAnd while Mr. Trump may alienate much of the intellectual set, many of the chief executives in attendance have become huge beneficiaries of the president\u2019s tax overhaul, which has instantly created bigger profits, higher compensation and a soaring stock market.\u201cMost attendees like his tax policy, sure,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said.But Mr. Bremmer said he did not think the president\u2019s tax policy would convert the audience into supporters. \u201cAt Davos, they\u2019ll see him primarily through an international lens,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he has 5 percent approval among the attendees, I think that\u2019s generous.\u201dMr. Trump was never invited to Davos during his career in real estate and entertainment. While he is a businessman and entrepreneur, he never formed part of the circle of the Fortune 500 chief executives who frequent Davos, many of whom considered him something of a carnival barker.\u201cI think it was a very good, perhaps contrarian move,\u201d Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, told me in an email. \u201cLast year, President Xi filled the vacuum left by non-U.S. government attendance, so President Trump has the opportunity to dominate the agenda and the news flow,\u201d he added, referring to the Chinese leader.Perhaps Mr. Trump will follow in the footsteps of one of his heroes, Ronald Reagan. \u201cWhen President Reagan addressed the forum in 1982, by satellite video, his presidency was emerging from a bruising period,\u201d Adrian Monck, a member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s managing board, told me. \u201cHe had run as an outspoken cold warrior. But his administration was able to reshape America\u2019s standing in the world.\u201dMr. Ferguson said that one thing working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was the authority of his office. \u201cThe W.E.F. reveres power and the president of the United States has that in abundance,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has an opportunity to use that power to demonstrate his understanding of how interconnected the global economy is. However, don\u2019t hold your breath.Late last week, his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who will also attend Davos for the first time, sought to play down the idea that somehow they would be rubbing shoulders among the billionaire class.\u201cIf you look at the list, there\u2019s an awful lot of world leaders, there\u2019s an awful lot of finance chairs, there\u2019s an awful lot of business people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important economic agenda.\u201dWith a bit of smile, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was the global elite.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Won\u2019t Visit London to Open Embassy. His U.K. Critics Say He Got the Message.", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s cancellation of a visit to London to open a new United States embassy was welcomed by his many critics in Britain on Friday, even as it deepened the diplomatic problems confronting a British government struggling to forge closer ties to Washington without offending opinion at home.The decision averted the risk of public protests that had threatened to embarrass both Mr. Trump and Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, who has recently squirmed to distance herself from statements made by an American president seen by many Britons as deeply divisive.The announcement, which came in a Twitter post by Mr. Trump that included a false jab at former President Barack Obama, is the latest reverberation from a hasty and ill-judged invitation made around a year ago, when Mr. Trump was offered, and accepted, a state visit to Britain. Such an honor is normally bestowed only much later in a presidency.With Britain to leave the European Union in 2019, Mrs. May hopes to negotiate a new trade agreement with the United States, and the state visit was partly seen as a way of cementing ties with Mr. Trump.But while Britons may pride themselves on their \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States, that does not appear to extend to its president, whose statements on a range of topics have provoked widespread anger in the country. A petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn was signed by more than 1.8 million people, the issue was debated in Parliament and, with large-scale protests threatened, the state visit plan was quietly put on the back burner.No official statement had been made about the visit, and no formal invitation had been issued, although diplomats were known to be trying to organize a meeting, and the embassy opening was an obvious moment at which to do so.Then, late on Thursday night, the president took to his favorite medium, Twitter, and announced that he had scrapped his trip because he was unhappy with the new building, and the decision to quit the old site in central London, which has been taken over by the Qatari royal family\u2019s property company, which plans to convert it into a luxury hotel.His critics in Britain gave that explanation little credence. Ed Miliband, the former Labour Party leader, responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Twitter, saying: \u201cNope. It\u2019s because nobody wanted you to come. And you got the message.\u201dThough Mr. Trump blamed the Obama administration for the move, the first announcement of new embassy site had been made in 2008 during the administration of President George W. Bush.In a statement released on Friday the United States Embassy in London said that, in 2007, a plan was developed \u201cto finance a new embassy project through a property swap for existing U.S. government property in London. This solution allowed construction of a new chancery that meets all security standards, yet used no tax payer dollars to fund the project.\u201d\u201cThe project budget was approximately $1 billion and includes the site purchase, design, and construction costs. The project has been executed within the established budget,\u201d the statement added.In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, accused the opposition Labour Party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of having endangered the trans-Atlantic relationship.But the furor illustrates the extent to which any potential visit by Mr. Trump to Britain has become politically polarizing, even as the country\u2019s establishment grapples with the question of whether to invite the president to the wedding of Prince Harry and the American actress Meghan Markle.Mr. Trump visited several continental European countries last year, including France, where President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s handling of his American counterpart appeared to make the British look fumbling.\u201cMacron treated Trump with respect and warmth on the one hand,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute, \u201cbut on the other hand was principled in defense of French interests, and didn\u2019t give an iota on the substance.\u201dBy contrast, Mrs. May was \u201call over the place,\u201d Mr. Leonard added.\u201cThere was the attempt to rush over to the U.S. to embrace him, then she became implicated in the things he was doing, and then she had to pull back, so she\u2019s been zigzagging,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain then gets the worst of all worlds because it has confused everyone.\u201dWhile Mrs. May is keen to create closer ties with Washington, on many global issues her approach is more closely aligned with the positions of the European Union. She has expressed support both for the Paris climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal, for example.Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal supporter in Britain, Nigel Farage, former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, told the BBC that he regretted that the president would not be opening the embassy.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. He\u2019s been to countries all over the world and yet he\u2019s not been to the one with whom he\u2019s closest. I would say it\u2019s disappointing.\u201cBut maybe, just maybe, Sadiq Khan, Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party planning mass protests, maybe those optics he didn\u2019t like the look of,\u201d Mr. Farage added.Stephen Castle reported from London, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "A Billionaire Keeps Pushing to Impeach Trump. Democrats Are Rattled.", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic leaders have pressed one of their most prolific donors privately, urging him to tone down his campaign calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment. They have prodded him in public, declaring on television that they consider impeachment an impractical idea. And party strategists have pleaded with Democratic candidates for Congress not to join in.But that donor, Tom Steyer, a California billionaire, has only intensified his attacks in recent weeks. Buoyed by tens of millions of dollars in television commercials \u2014 financed out of his own pocket and starring him \u2014 Mr. Steyer has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible antagonists, firing up angry Democrats and unnerving his own party with the ferocity of his efforts.Mr. Steyer is likely to unsettle national Democrats further in the coming weeks, with a new phase of his campaign aimed at pushing lawmakers in solidly liberal seats to endorse impeachment. Having collected more than four million email addresses from people who signed an impeachment petition, Mr. Steyer has begun prodding those voters to call congressional offices and lobby them for support.In an interview, Mr. Steyer was dismissive of party leaders\u2019 reservations about making impeachment an issue in 2018. He described Mr. Trump as lawless and unfit for office; acknowledging the practical obstacles to impeachment, he said raising a popular outcry was a necessary first step.\u201cWe\u2019re just telling the truth to the American people, and it\u2019s an important truth,\u201d Mr. Steyer said of his campaign. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s politically convenient for you, that\u2019s too bad.\u201dBut the Democratic base, enraged by Mr. Trump and frustrated by party leaders counseling restraint, appears enthusiastically open to seeking the president\u2019s removal. A handful of Democratic congressional candidates \u2014 in crucial states like California, Florida, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 have vowed to pursue impeachment if they are elected. That number is likely to grow during the coming season of Democratic primaries, in which throngs of candidates are competing for the affection of liberal voters who loathe the president.\u201cLike a lot of people, I am appalled by the president\u2019s conduct in office,\u201d Ms. Barzee Flores said in an interview, adding: \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s a basis to impeach the president, and I do believe that he\u2019s got to go. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201dBut Ms. Barzee Flores said Democrats should not treat impeachment as a singular issue in 2018, over matters like health care and immigration. \u201cThere are other issues that are pressing,\u201d she said. \u201cMore pressing, even.\u201dFor Mr. Steyer, however, impeachment is a singular cause. And he is no easy character for Democrats to ignore: From his headquarters in a San Francisco office tower, Mr. Steyer, 60, has built a sprawling political operation with more than 200 staff members around the country, mostly employed by his flagship group, NextGen America, which focuses on climate change.Mr. Steyer has amassed a mixed win-loss record over the years, along with a mercurial reputation among Democratic strategists. But he is nearly alone among Democratic donors in his willingness to spend money on a titanic scale. In 2016, Mr. Steyer spent more than $90 million supporting Democrats, and his checkbook may be critical to their efforts to capture Congress.But on impeachment, Democrats in Congress have made no secret of their skepticism. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate, have called it a premature proposal. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a hero of the left, said Democrats should avoid \u201cjumping the gun\u201d on such a drastic action. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has urged candidates to use more measured language, endorsing investigations of Mr. Trump but avoiding an impeachment pledge.Ms. Pelosi, who has a longstanding relationship with Mr. Steyer and hosted him in her private box at the Democrats\u2019 2016 convention, conveyed her concerns to him directly. She told Mr. Steyer in a phone call last fall that impeachment was a profoundly divisive issue and stressed that other matters, like the Republican-backed tax overhaul, were more urgent, according to four people briefed on the conversation.But Mr. Steyer insisted that Mr. Trump had more than met the standard for being removed from office, and said his ads were electrifying the Democratic base. The conversation was cordial, according to associates of both Democrats, but neither gave ground.Mr. Steyer, his friends say, has been more pointed in private, appearing indifferent or even emboldened by the criticism of Democrats in Washington. Two of his friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Steyer has taken to declaring that when Ms. Pelosi or Mr. Schumer is complaining, he knows he is on the right track.Even if the House did vote to impeach Mr. Trump \u2014 perhaps under possible Democratic control in 2019 \u2014 it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove him from office \u2014 a threshold that could only be met with the help of a sizable number of Republicans. That appears an extremely remote possibility.Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania who voted against the impeachment resolution, warned that pressing now could backfire badly. Voicing the exasperation of many of his colleagues, Mr. Boyle called the Steyer campaign a fruitless exercise.\u201cI just don\u2019t see how the ads achieve anything,\u201d Mr. Boyle said. \u201cTo do this now, before Special Counsel Mueller finishes the investigation, only complicates our job if Mueller finds something that warrants impeachment, which I believe is a real possibility.\u201dThe Democratic base appears more receptive: Seventy percent of Democrats favor impeachment hearings, according to an NBC News/The Wall Street Journal poll published last month. Overall, 41 percent of Americans support impeachment hearings \u2014 an unusually high number for a president in his first year, but well short of an electoral majority.If Mr. Steyer\u2019s focus on impeachment is new, his status as one of the most mercurial figures in Democratic politics is not. He has pursued a number of political adventures over the last few years, often hiring expensive consultants and spending heavily on advertising, and then abruptly moving on to an entirely new project.Last year, Mr. Steyer embarked on a kind of political star search, gathering national political strategists, including top advisers to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, to map out a run for governor or Senate. After briefly threatening to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat, Mr. Steyer abandoned plans to run for office in 2018.Former Representative Ellen Tauscher, a Northern California Democrat, said Mr. Steyer had plainly embraced a provocateur\u2019s role instead of putting his name on the ballot this year. But Ms. Tauscher, who leads a \u201csuper PAC\u201d targeting California Republicans, warned that voters might balk at electing a Congress bent on driving Mr. Trump from office.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a conversation about impeachment until you take the House back, and so this is a little bit like somebody who\u2019s jumped ahead,\u201d Ms. Tauscher said, adding of Mr. Steyer: \u201cI think, to a certain extent, Tom knows this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wyatt Tee Walker, Dr. King\u2019s Strategist and a Harlem Leader, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, who was chief of staff to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key strategist behind civil rights protests that turned the tide against racial injustice in the Jim Crow South of the 1960s, died early on Tuesday at an assisted-living facility near his home in Chester, Va. He was 88.His death was announced by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Dr. Walker was the organization\u2019s first board chairman of the National Action Network, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s organization.Dr. Walker preached against intolerance and racial inequality for six decades from pulpits across the South, in New York City and in five of the world\u2019s seven continents. He helped supervise South Africa\u2019s first fully representative elections in 1994, when Nelson Mandela\u2019s rise to power ushered in the end of the apartheid regime.Dr. Walker\u2019s work as a civil rights advocate began in 1953, soon after he finished his graduate studies at the historically black Virginia Union University in Richmond. He had met Dr. King while both were students.The two had been presidents of their classes \u2014 Dr. King at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania \u2014 and they had their first encounter during an inter-seminary meeting.Dr. Walker joined the fledgling Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1961 and served until 1964 as its executive director and, unofficially, as Dr. King\u2019s right-hand man. At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.The C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201dDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.Scholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.A March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201dThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201dWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.When Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.But the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.After graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.An authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.Ordained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.In Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.Dr. Walker worked for the S.C.L.C. in Atlanta for four years before moving to Harlem, in 1965, when he was named pulpit minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church.Dr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.During his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.In 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.In addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.For Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201dDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201dAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations. It was tough to frighten me, because I was so convinced that God would take care of me.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the location of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, where Dr. Walker was the pastor for many years. It is at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue in Harlem \u2014 not at 115th Street between St. Nicholas and Lenox Avenues.William McDonald and Daniel E.

{"Headline": "Czech Republic Faces Political Turmoil After No-Confidence Vote", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Parliament rejected the minority government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis in a no-confidence vote on Tuesday, a move that is likely to prompt weeks, if not months, of further political wrangling.In the meantime, the minority cabinet, made up of members of Mr. Babis\u2019s party and affiliated experts, will continue to lead the country while Mr. Babis attempts to form another cabinet that would be acceptable to Parliament.In Eastern Europe, resentment of Brussels and resistance to immigration have helped propel populist parties to power in several countries, notably Hungary and Poland. But the rise of the right there, in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia has also been driven by a variety of domestic issues.Mr. Babis, a billionaire anti-establishment candidate who vowed during the campaign to fight corruption and introduce economic overhauls, is a polarizing figure. His political positions are hard to pin down, but they are tinged with populist rhetoric.Mr. Zeman himself is currently in a battle for his own job. The first round of presidential elections took place on Friday and Saturday, and even though he finished in first place, he will face the runner-up, Jiri Drahos, in a runoff starting Jan. 26 because he failed to receive more than 50 percent of the vote in the field of nine.Mr. Babis has denied any wrongdoing, but Parliament is considering a measure that would strip him of his immunity as an elected official, allowing for a criminal prosecution.Only lawmakers from the Ano party voted for the government, despite support from Mr. Zeman, the president, who is considered an ally of Mr. Babis. \u201cI believe the program of this government is, in a good sense, like a smorgasbord: Anybody can choose what they like,\u201d Mr. Zeman told Parliament last week.The Czech Republic has previously been run by minority governments lacking the majority support of Parliament. But the controversy surrounding Mr. Babis and the possibility of a future cabinet being forged with the support of an extreme-right party, Freedom and Direct Democracy, or with the Communist Party \u2014 or both \u2014 complicates the current impasse.\u201cThere are many mathematical possibilities to form a majority government, but somebody will have to let go of their requirements, and I am afraid that at least Mr. Babis and President Zeman will not budge,\u201d said Otto Eibl, a political analyst from Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic.Mr. Babis said he had been expecting to lose the vote on Tuesday. \u201cWe want to talk about our program, mainly about pensions,\u201d he said in remarks last week quoted by the Czech News Agency, referring to the direction his government would now take.Mr. Zeman said he would give Mr. Babis another chance to form a government, but he added that at least 101 votes \u2014 a majority \u2014 would be needed in the lower chamber to reappoint Mr. Babis as prime minister.Advertisement"}

The invitation promised gleefully that this would be \u201cthe most un-P.C. event of the year.\u201d Half the tables were taken by men in the real estate industry; others on the guest list were financiers, restaurateurs, celebrities.The fund-raising \u2014 for a children\u2019s hospital \u2014 was just a fig leaf. This was a bonding and networking experience, bringing men together to exult in male dominance and sexual power, barring any women who might question or challenge them, and reducing women to decorative, accommodating, humiliating subservience.The details of the dinner, exposed by the Financial Times, have undermined the organizers\u2019 and guests\u2019 claims not to have understood or noticed what the event was about. The evening began with the servers paraded across the stage, two by two. The brochures on every table had an entire page asking the men not to harass the women. That\u2019s an extraordinary plea to have to make at a supposedly civilized event.The women, given black dresses that only just reached their thighs and ordered to bring black \u201csexy shoes,\u201d were also required to wear black underwear, clearly on the presumption that it would be seen. They were warned that the men would be \u201cannoying,\u201d but that they must \u201cput up with it.\u201d Their phones were locked away and they were made to sign five-page nondisclosure agreements.They soon discovered why. The remorseless groping and contemptuous propositioning that the women had to endure for the next six hours left many of them distressed. Any who retreated to the restrooms for a brief escape were ordered back by male staff.Now the whole event has exploded in the organizers\u2019 faces. The club has closed; a government minister was reprimanded by Prime Minister Theresa May for attending; the known guests are running for cover, conveniently claiming to have left early, or to have seen and heard and done nothing.But why did these men think all of this was just fine? And why did they think they could get away with it?The answer is obvious: because they always had before, and as far as this cohort of British society is concerned, nothing has really changed. Had it not been for The Financial Times sending a female reporter undercover to the event, they would have probably gotten away with it once more. This dinner has reportedly been running for 33 years. Its star guest in 2004 was the left-wing London mayor Ken Livingstone, who professed his fierce commitment to equality but at the time was obviously completely untroubled by an exploitative men\u2019s event.That confidence has suddenly collapsed. The fury that has followed these revelations, with the prime minister, Britain\u2019s most influential business lobbying group, senior politicians and women in the finance industry lining up to condemn everyone responsible, show how dangerous this kind of behavior now is for individuals and companies. Women have had enough of being \u201ctucked into.\u201d Suddenly, public morality is backing them up.But what this event so painfully exposes is that public morality is not synonymous with private conviction. The second is much slower to shift. Men who seek out events like the Presidents Club\u2019s, or who are furiously, resentfully defending them online as just \u201cboys\u2019 nights out,\u201d or \u201cwhat women should expect,\u201d are not going to return to their homes or offices and treat the women there as equal, serious, and dignified. They like their dominance, and won\u2019t easily give it up.The Presidents Club debacle is just one milestone on women\u2019s long, hazardous, often hidden fight to get men to accept that we are people, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Park Avenue South: The Other Park Avenue Comes Into Its Own", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In7 PhotosFor decades, it was Fourth Avenue, a sleepy office district that was even more hushed at night when insurance companies and book publishers turned off the lights. The city tried to perk it up in 1959, rechristening the 15-block stretch from East 17th to East 32nd Streets as Park Avenue South \u2014 an extension of the fancy uptown thoroughfare.The experiment seemed to fall flat. Mail was occasionally delivered to the wrong addresses \u2014 to that other Park Avenue, residents said \u2014 and the street appeared to be trapped in real-estate limbo. It was neither here nor there, brushing by brand-name enclaves like Gramercy Park and Flatiron, but not belonging to them, and never really developing a personality of its own.Today, though, the street is packed with upscale apartments and energetic night life. It seems to have finally come into its own, even if some still scratch their heads.\u201cWhen I\u2019m in a cab, I always just say, \u2018Take me to 19th Street,\u2019\u201d said Sam Greene, 46, who has lived on the street since 2003. \u201cThat\u2019s how I make sure they know where they\u2019re going.\u201dStill, being proximate to many places has benefits, added Mr. Greene, who bought a two-bedroom condo in 2008 for $3.3 million, then a next-door three-bedroom in 2010 for $2.4 million, and combined them.Mr. Greene, who works in finance and shares the home with his wife and three children, noted that from Park Avenue South, one can sample several areas \u2014 their parks, their subway stops and their schools \u2014 in an easy stroll.The neighborhood \u201cmay not have the cachet of TriBeCa,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has just as many, if not more of, those things you look for.\u201dOne nearby amenity is a top restaurant scene. Sparked by the opening of Gramercy Tavern on East 20th Street in 1994, the street has become a fine-dining destination, residents say, adding that the move of the celebrated Union Square Cafe there in 2016 baked in that reputation for good.And food can whet an appetite for real estate, said Jim Miller, a neighborhood resident who was introduced to the area in part by trips to Gramercy Tavern and other establishments after moving to New York from San Francisco in 2000.\u201cWhenever we went out, we ended up there,\u201d said Mr. Miller, 41, who also works in finance. \u201cI kind of knew it very well already.\u201dLast year, he and his wife, Heather, and their two children, moved from a three-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side to a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath condo in a freshly converted office building. The corner unit, which has an open kitchen, oak floors and nearly 11-foot ceilings, cost $5.6 million.\u201cEverything,\u201d he said, \u201cjust kind of meets in the area.\u201dBuilding-wise, the street doesn\u2019t dazzle with variety. Block after block is lined with tall brick prewar buildings, many with Beaux-Arts flourishes, as might be expected in a onetime commercial district.Today, the bank space with tall, arched windows houses a Morton Williams supermarket, while the apartments are tucked into an adjacent high-rise.It wasn\u2019t until the 2000s, though, that redevelopment began in earnest, producing condos like the Bullmoose, at 42 East 20th Street, and 260 Park Avenue South, which married two office towers. But the past remains close. At 295 Park Avenue South, a rental conversion, metal letters on an exterior wall read \u201cFourth Avenue.\u201dContemporary architecture is rarer, but includes 400 and 402 Park Avenue South, a condo-rental hybrid with a glass-shard-like facade, and 240 Park Avenue South, with concrete-and-limestone panels.He may have a point. On Jan. 24, there were 47 co-ops, condos and condops for sale, at an average list price of $3.1 million, excluding new developments, according to StreetEasy. (In contrast, the average sale price for resale units overall in Manhattan is $1.5 million, according to a fourth-quarter report from Douglas Elliman.)And prices are climbing. In 2016, 141 apartments sold for an average of $2.3 million; in 2017, according to data prepared by StreetEasy, 149 sold for an average of $3.9 million.As for rentals, studios average $3,000 a month, according to StreetEasy, while one-bedrooms average $4,100 a month.Banks are also numerous: One Chase branch takes up almost the entire block between East 18th and East 19th Streets.But dry cleaners and bodegas, which once dotted the area, have largely moved thanks to gentrification, forcing some residents to walk to Third Avenue for basic supplies, they said.Also resilient is Curry Hill, a collection of Indian shops and restaurants that has been clustered around Lexington and East 28th Street for decades.Students are zoned for Public School 116, Mary Lindley Murray School, which enrolls about 600 students in prekindergarten to fifth grade outside of the neighborhood.On state English exams in 2017, an average of 58 percent of students there met standards in English, versus 41 percent citywide; in math, 58 percent met standards, versus 38 percent citywide.For junior high school, an option is Simon Baruch Middle School, also outside of the area. It enrolls about 1,150 students in sixth through eighth grades.But there is a local high school, the Baruch College Campus High School, for ninth through 12th grades, on East 25th Street. It has a 100 percent graduation rate. On SAT exams in 2016, the most recent available, students averaged 587 on the math section, 530 on reading and 521 on writing, versus 466, 446 and 440 citywide.With the 6 train directly under Park Avenue South, subway service is never far, although the trains can get jammed. Stops are at East 28th Street and East 23rd Street, and just outside the neighborhood at East 33rd Street and 14th Street-Union Square, where other lines meet.\u201cThe restaurant by day is a luncheon place for local business people,\u201d said a 1967 Times article. \u201cAt night it swings with a \u2018mod\u2019 young crowd and is a lively, bright spot in a deserted business area.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast-Food Workers Claim Victory in a New York Labor Effort", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith labor unions seeing their influence wane, more than 200 organizations have sprouted nationwide to help low-wage workers. But nearly all these groups say they are hampered by a lack of dependable funding because, unlike unions, they cannot rely on a steady flow of dues.To the dismay of many business groups, New York City enacted an innovative law last year that many labor advocates hope will become a model to finance such organizations across the nation.Under the law, fast-food employees who want to contribute to a nonprofit, nonunion workers\u2019 group can insist on having the restaurant they work for deduct money from their pay and forward that money to the group. But before a group can receive these contributions, it must get 500 workers to pledge to contribute.One such group, Fast Food Justice, planned to announce on Wednesday that 1,200 New York fast-food workers have signed pledges to contribute $13.50 a month to the organization.\u201cThis has been a lot of hard work, but we think this is great,\u201d said Shantel Walker, who works at a Papa John\u2019s in Brooklyn and is a member the new group. \u201cWe want to bring change not only in the fast-food industry, but in our communities.\u201dThe new group will not seek to negotiate contracts as unions do, but its leaders say it will most likely push for a higher minimum wage and for many other issues fast-food workers support, including affordable housing, immigration reform, better police-community relations and improvements to New York\u2019s subway system.The Restaurant Law Center \u2014 the legal arm of the National Restaurant Association \u2014 has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn the law. Among the center\u2019s arguments is that requiring the restaurant owners to forward money to workers\u2019 groups is unconstitutional forced speech under the First Amendment.\u201cWe think this law is a way of trying to get restaurants to fund groups\u201d that \u201cwill harass restaurants with money from the restaurants,\u201d said Angelo Amador, the law center\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhen the New York City Council passed the law \u2014 which applies only to the fast-food industry \u2014 there were questions about whether an organization could persuade 500 workers to contribute.But Janice Fine, associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, said: \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve signed up 1,200 is impressive. It\u2019s a kind of initial proof of the concept.\u201d\u201cWhen I speak to people in other cities, they get really interested,\u201d she added. \u201cThey can imagine a law like this one where they are.\u201dThe Fight for $15 campaign and the Service Employees International Union, which has contributed tens of millions to that effort, pushed hard for the New York law. While the Fight for $15 has won major victories \u2014 getting Seattle, California and New York State to enact laws calling for a $15 minimum wage \u2014 the movement has not achieved its goal of unionizing fast-food workers.Fight for $15 leaders are concerned that even if they were to persuade workers at dozens of McDonald\u2019s locations to vote to unionize, it would be extremely difficult to get McDonald\u2019s or its franchise operators to agree to a contract.Without a formal union, the Fight for $15 has been eager for a reliable way to finance a fast-food workers\u2019 group. The New York City law, which was enacted in May and took effect in late November, is the first of its kind.\u201cWhat\u2019s important about this law is it provides for a way for fast-food workers to help sustain a nonprofit organization that\u2019s dedicated to advocating for issues that members say is important to them,\u201d said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, chairwoman of Fast Food Justice\u2019s board and a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. For example, the group\u2019s leaders said many members were interested in pushing for reduced transit fares for low-wage workers.Fast Food Justice\u2019s leaders say they hope to get 5,000 workers to contribute by the end of 2018, and 10,000 by the end of 2020. (New York City has about 65,000 fast-food workers.) Contributions from 5,000 workers would mean revenue of more than $800,000 a year.The Restaurant Law Center\u2019s lawsuit asserts that the New York law and Fast Food Justice are merely mechanisms to help the service employees\u2019 union ultimately unionize fast-food restaurants. Its lawsuit also argues that the law should be overturned on the basis that the National Labor Relations Act already regulates labor organizations.Fast Food Justice asserts that it is not the type of labor organization regulated by federal law. It also argues that the New York law doesn\u2019t violate restaurants\u2019 First Amendment rights because the money being forwarded belongs to the workers and not the restaurants. But the Restaurant Law Center says even having to process the payments violates employers\u2019 free-speech rights.Even though LaShawn Herbert said her employer, Shake Shack, treats her well, she is a strong backer of the Fight for $15 and Fast Food Justice. She noted that when the Fight for $15 started in New York City in late 2012, the minimum wage was $7.25 in the city. Since then, it has jumped to $13.50 for fast-food workers and will rise to $15 at the end of this year.\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole point is help people so they can make enough take care of their family and so they don\u2019t have to be on welfare.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from Fast Food Justice, misstated Shantel Walker\u2019s role with the organization. She is a member of the organization, not a board member.Advertisement"}

Ashraf al-Kholi, coaching several talk-show hosts, as well as a prominent actress, about how to persuade their audiences to accept the American position on Jerusalem.In an interview, one of the hosts, Azmi Megahed, confirmed the authenticity of the recording, and described the intelligence officer as a longtime acquaintance.After the article was published, Egypt\u2019s State Information Service said in a statement that no one named Ashraf al-Kholi worked for the intelligence service and denied the accuracy of the Times report.Mr. Megahed then retracted his original statement, and in an Egyptian television interview said The Times had misquoted him. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this Kholi man,\u201d he said.The same audio recordings provided to The Times were later broadcast by an Istanbul-based television network linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt has banned as a terrorist group. The suggestion of a connection with the Brotherhood added to the outrage from supporters of the Egyptian government.The speaker of Parliament, Ali Abdel Aal, said the article proved that The Times was allied with the Brotherhood and with Qatar, which has supported the Brotherhood, and was stoking controversy in advance of presidential elections, state media reported.\u201cOur story was a deeply reported, consequential piece of journalism, and we stand fully behind it,\u201d said Michael Slackman, The Times\u2019s international editor. \u201cWe disclosed in the original report that the audio recordings were provided to The Times by an intermediary supportive of the Palestinian cause, but we had no agenda other than giving our readers the facts they needed to know.\u201dEgypt, which fought three wars against Israel, has positioned itself for decades as a champion of the Palestinian cause, which remains an emotional cause for most Arabs. But in recent years, critics have often accused Egypt of tacitly aligning itself with Israel, a charge that the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has denied.\u201cI saw that I will not be the ideal person to lead the state during the coming period,\u201d Mr. Shafik said on Twitter.Mr. Shafik\u2019s lawyers said that officials had pressed him to quit the race, threatening him with corruption prosecutions.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries that imposed a boycott against Qatar in June.

Elect!\u201dGloria Allred, the feminist lawyer, seemed exactly in her element on Saturday morning in this ski town as she led hundreds of Sundance Film Festival attendees at a Women\u2019s March rally. It was only 22 degrees, and heavy snow was swirling around her. But Ms. Allred charged forth, determined to keep the heat on Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and other powerful men accused of sexual harassment and assault.The moment neatly summed up an evolving Sundance.This is no longer Mr. Weinstein\u2019s freewheeling festival, the one he blasted into the public consciousness with eye-popping deals to bring male-gaze entries like \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d and \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d to theaters. Sundance is now a prime showcase for women \u2014 films directed, produced and written by women; films with female protagonists; special events focused on female empowerment. And most of the distribution deals involve TV sets.But most longtime attendees will tell you that the festival feels no different because the Weinstein Company, with its theater-focused business model, long ago ceded the Sundance marketplace to Netflix and Amazon. Last year, those two streaming services, both official Sundance sponsors, snapped up at least 14 movies, including spending $12 million for \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and $12.5 million for \u201cMudbound,\u201d accounting for more than a third of total festival acquisitions. The Weinstein Company bought nothing.Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, is now the person who reporters for Hollywood trade publications track through the snow.\u201cHarvey was a moment in time,\u201d Robert Redford, who founded Sundance, said at the festival\u2019s opening-day news conference on Thursday.\u201cNobody on the ground here ever gave him a crown,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cHe was just the loudest and the media followed and built him up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as big of a marketplace for finished films as it was in the \u201990s and early 2000s,\u201d said Mr. Bernard of Sony Pictures Classics. \u201cBut it\u2019s still an enormous marketplace for talent: Casting people looking for actors, producers looking for directors and cinematographers.\u201d (One example from recent years: After gaining attention at Sundance for quirky films like \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople,\u201d Taika Waititi went on to direct \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d for Disney.)This year\u2019s primary festival lineup \u2014 122 feature-length films culled from 3,901 submissions \u2014 includes many movies that examine race. \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d starring Daveed Diggs, best known for winning a Tony for \u201cHamilton,\u201d is a raucous, hip-hop-infused story of racism, stereotypes and gentrification. (Mr. Cooper, Sundance\u2019s director, called it \u201cfun, to the point of being sassy\u201d as he introduced it. Reviews are mixed.)Mr. Cooper drew a connection between filmmakers wrestling with race and the #OscarsSoWhite outcry in 2015 and 2016. \u201cIt usually takes about two years for topics to permeate,\u201d he said.Even so, women are front and center at this year\u2019s festival, noted Trevor Groth, Sundance\u2019s director of programming.The actresses Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Laura Dern, Carey Mulligan, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Kathryn Hahn, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Rose Byrne, Daisy Ridley, Blythe Danner, Hilary Swank and Kelly Macdonald all anchor films.

{"Headline": "Russia and Venezuela\u2019s Plan to Sidestep Sanctions: Virtual Currencies", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions.Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States.The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure.In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government\u2019s oil and natural resources.In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble.Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela\u2019s Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That\u2019s because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies.That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency.All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority.That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules.But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking.\u201cThe prototype works,\u201d he added.These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome.None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control.Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country\u2019s gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves.\u201cTo overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,\u201d he said.Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation.The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government\u2019s natural resources.The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar, has experienced in recent years because of the government\u2019s unbridled expansion of the money supply.\u201cThe country is in a social crisis,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. \u201cHow do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.\u201dMr. \u00c1lvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018.But the link between the currency and the government\u2019s oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros\u2019s government.There is a measure of irony in the government\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bol\u00edvar, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm.The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity.Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities \u2014 more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now.In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country.Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system.\u201cThe irony is in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,\u201d he said in October.The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions.Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well.But, he said at the time, \u201cthese are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.\u201dNathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow, and Ana Vanessa Herrero from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yukon Government Gives In to Liquor Industry on Warning Label Experiment", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe brightly colored labels began appearing on bottles and cans of beer, wine and liquor in a government-owned store in Yukon Territory a month before Christmas.The brainchild of a research project financed by the Canadian government on how to prevent excessive drinking, the labels warned of the health risks of alcohol consumption and were meant to be in place for eight months as an experiment.But within a month, the experiment was halted.The government stopped affixing the labels after several alcohol industry lobbying groups challenged both the research study and the legality of the government\u2019s participation.John Streicker, the member of the Yukon government\u2019s cabinet responsible for the territory\u2019s liquor stores, said he believed that the government faced litigation if it continued to use the researchers\u2019 labels.With a population of 36,000, the territory is not in a financial position to take on the global alcohol industry in court, he added.\u201cThe costs that we could be facing are significant,\u201d Mr. Streicker said. \u201cWe need to do the responsible thing, which is to judge whether that\u2019s the best use of our money for our citizens. The hard choice is whether to pay for lawyers or whether to pay for harm reduction.\u201dLobbying groups representing Canada\u2019s breweries, wineries and distilleries, Mr. Streicker said, suggested that the labels might harm their brands and asked about the territory\u2019s legal right to apply them. The industry also suggested that putting stickers on their bottles and cans infringed trademarks, he said.In interviews on Wednesday, the presidents of Beer Canada, the brewers\u2019 trade group, and of the Association of Canadian Distillers, said they had not threatened legal action. But Jan H. Westcott, the president and chief executive of the distillers\u2019 group, repeatedly criticized the validity of the information on the labels and the work of the researchers themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the way that they\u2019ve approached it is actually going to provide results that are useful or legitimate necessarily,\u201d Mr. Westcott said of the peer-reviewed study.Mr. Streicker said, \u201cIf it was to go to court I think they would use all avenues open to them to try and challenge this study.\u201dThe label experiment was part of a four-year-old project led by Erin Hobin, a scientist at the province of Ontario\u2019s public health agency, in cooperation with the University of Victoria in British Columbia. The research is financed by Health Canada, a federal department.The sale of alcohol is controlled by provincial and territorial governments and, in most of Canada, largely sold through government-owned stores. Tim Stockwell, the director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria, who is also involved in the project, said Yukon\u2019s alcohol retailer was the only one in Canada willing to test the stickers.Yukon has the highest per capita sales of alcohol in the country, adding to the researchers\u2019 interest.Focus groups with drinkers were held over about two years within Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon. Dr. Hobin said they showed strong support for health warnings on liquor bottles.\u201cThere is just very low availability of information about health hazards around alcohol,\u201d said Dr. Hobin, whose research indicated that three-quarters of drinkers in the Yukon were not aware of the link between some cancers and alcohol.The plan was to stick labels on the bottles for eight months and then use sales data and follow-up interviews to assess their effect on drinking. Liquor stores and drinkers in the neighboring Northwest Territories would have been a control group.Yukon has been putting stickers about drinking during pregnancy on alcohol for nearly 30 years.The study\u2019s labels, however, were larger and more brightly colored than the previous ones used in Yukon liquor stores.While the territory\u2019s stickers about drinking during pregnancy never attracted attention from the alcohol industry, Mr. Streicker, the Yukon government official, said he soon heard about the study\u2019s labels.Mr. Westcott, the president of the distillers\u2019 group, said, \u201cWe think these are pretty complex issues and simply putting them on a label is not necessarily the best way to do that,\u201d adding that he did not think that Whitehorse was an appropriate place for the study because of its comparatively small population and remoteness.Luke Harford, the president of the brewers\u2019 lobbying group, said he was concerned that some shoppers might conclude that the label about the drinking guidelines \u2014 which recommends abstinence twice a week \u2014 could be misinterpreted as a safe amount of drinking before driving.As for the other label, Mr. Harford said, \u201cIt\u2019s this very alarming statement that this is going to cause cancer.\u201dAlthough both Mr. Harford and Mr. Westcott said they never suggested that their organizations or their members would sue if the labeling continued, they also acknowledged that they asked, as Mr. Westcott put it, \u201cwhat legal authority they had to put the labels on the products.\u201d The government, he said, has not \u201cprovided that information.\u201dDr. Stockwell of the research project said the federal government, the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia and his university also received complaints from the alcohol industry.Robert Solomon, a professor of law at the University of Western Ontario in London who has specialized in drug and alcohol policy for more than 40 years, said rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada about warnings on cigarette packages clearly gave the Yukon government the right to add its labels. He dismissed the idea of trademark or defamation lawsuits as \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat sad that the industry opposes making consumers aware of the harms related to alcohol,\u201d Professor Soloman said. \u201cThe alcohol industry doesn\u2019t really want the public to look at alcohol as a drug. It\u2019s a drug that imposes health costs.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the capital of Yukon Territory. It is Whitehorse, not Whitehouse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vision, Chutzpah and Some Testosterone\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Donald Trump has succeeded where Barack Obama failed. The economy is up, foreign tyrants are afraid, ISIS has lost most of its territory, our embassy will be moved to Jerusalem and tax reform is accomplished. More than that, Mr. Trump is learning, adapting and getting savvier every day. Entitlement reform is next! Lastly, the entrenched interests in Washington, which have done nothing but glad-hand one another, and both political parties are angry and afraid.Who knew that all it would take to make progress was vision, chutzpah and some testosterone?To the Editor:I voted against Hillary Clinton more than I voted for Donald Trump. That said, President Trump has exceeded my wildest expectations. Yes, he is embarrassing. Yes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated ISIS in Iraq, has named a number of solid conservative judges, has prioritized American citizens over illegal immigrants, has gotten us out of several bad international agreements, has removed a number of wasteful regulations, is putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran, has reined in a number of out-of-control agencies, and so on and so on.I loved George W. Bush, but he failed on policy over and over again. If it takes putting up with Mr. Trump\u2019s brash ways to see things get done, that is a deal I\u2019m willing to accept. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure he would have accomplished what he has so far without being an unrelenting public bully.To the Editor:I voted for Donald Trump and, considering the alternative, I would do so again. Newsflash: Not all Trump voters are Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Many of us are well-informed and highly educated, and we are weary of the Democrats\u2019 tiresome focus on identity politics, class warfare, and disparagement of corporations and the \u201cwealthy.\u201dOpinion polls give Mr. Trump a low rating, and I would, too, for character, personality and temperament. But I would give him high marks for policies and programs that are stimulating the private sector, which, after all, pays the bills for the Democrats\u2019 extravagant welfare programs. And because of Mr. Trump we have an education secretary who actually cares more about educating children than appeasing the teachers\u2019 unions.Even more important, we desperately needed a seismic change in the pusillanimous foreign policy pursued during the Obama years, which emboldened our adversaries, including China, Russia, North Korea and Middle East militants. I also support a more robust approach to border security and illegal immigration, which could still entail legal residency for law-abiding Dreamers but not an undeserved pathway to citizenship.To the Editor:Yes, I was a Trump voter. There, I\u2019ve said it. Though I am subjecting myself to derision, I think that President Trump has performed well policywise. Changes for the good of our country in both foreign and domestic affairs have happened under his watch.Much of the media, as the hotbed of hatred against Mr. Trump, has pushed me more toward him than his social behavior has done the opposite.To the Editor:Not only did I vote for him, but I also made more than 5,000 calls on his behalf (and I\u2019ve been a registered Democrat for 40 years). So far I am thrilled with his performance. Numerous reasons, but here are a few: recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital; letting the generals crush ISIS; stronger plans to prevent North Korea and Iran from using nuclear weapons; getting out of biased United Nations organizations; and respect for the flag and the rule of law.I thank my dear New York Times for asking to hear from Trump voters. It\u2019s been difficult to read the paper this past year. It\u2019s anti-Trump in everything from the front page to fashion. It\u2019s so pervasive that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that there\u2019s not another loyal New York Times reader out there who voted for Mr. Trump and that I\u2019m sending the only submission. New York Times, I will always love you, despite our disagreement.To the Editor:A president like Donald Trump only appears every 100 years or so. He came to office with a solid Electoral College majority and a history of strong leadership of people from all walks of life. His positive agenda can be boiled down to national security and economic growth.By any measure President Trump\u2019s first year has shown prodigious progress. As a child of the \u201960s I admire his iconoclastic nature, optimism and unapologetic humanity. When asked during the campaign about his truthfulness, he replied that maybe he is too truthful. He does ruffle feathers, but seems to end up being right about most important things. I think Mr. Trump is doing a terrific job against all odds, and is getting better. I am proud when I see the First Couple representing us on the world stage. Tens of millions of thoughtful, compassionate Americans agree with me.To the Editor:How\u2019s he doing? He has turned a fragile nation \u201canti-fragile\u201d (the scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb\u2019s term). Before Mr. Trump, we were scared of any volatility. Oh no, ISIS! Oh no, banks! The more chaos there was, the worse we were.The writer is an associate professor of analytics and finance at the University of Bridgeport.To the Editor:I went to the polls with a clothespin on my nose. I had very low expectations for a Trump presidency. A justice like Neil Gorsuch was all I was sure we\u2019d get. I believed that Donald Trump could be a disaster, but the other two branches of government would keep him in check. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was guaranteed to take us down the path that President Obama started.That said, I am shocked at how well President Trump is doing. I give him a B-plus. His performance under extreme pressure and harsh criticism has been admirable. Some of the many positive results of his policies are a booming economy, low unemployment (record low for black Americans), soaring stock market, lower taxes, the repeal of mandatory health insurance coverage, ISIS defeated in Iraq, and much, much more.I do not understand why people still believe anything that the media, or politicians and pundits who have an agenda, say. They have been wrong about practically everything since long before November 2016.To the Editor:I\u2019m thrilled with the progress that President Trump has made in defeating ISIS, cutting taxes for middle-class families and making court appointments. Thanks to the tax cuts, my husband and I stand to keep a much larger portion of our paychecks. I\u2019d like to see more work in securing the border, enforcing immigration laws, improving our infrastructure and combating political corruption in D.C. (in both parties).I\u2019m thrilled at his support for Israel. Nikki Haley is one of his best appointments, and I love seeing strong women stand up for what\u2019s right on a global stage.What I like least about his presidency so far is the tweeting. It\u2019s often immature and lowers the tone of the debate while debasing the office of the presidency. That said, I think the media needs to be a lot more evenhanded in its coverage of him and keep its personal opinions in check.To the Editor:Granted we have the most unpresidential president of our time. Crude, rude, clueless dude \u2014 but I believe, with the help of his friends, he\u2019s stumbling through one of the most effective presidencies in memory.As the Sonny LoSpecchio character wisely concluded in the movie \u201cA Bronx Tale,\u201d it\u2019s better to be feared than loved. My hope is for our enemies to fear Donald Trump and for his domestic opponents to realize he\u2019s on their side.To the Editor:I thought sanctuary cities were unjust to our own citizens, and our attempt to keep intact our reputation as welcoming Uncle Sam was becoming detrimental to our own welfare. Mr. Trump\u2019s language is often inappropriate and juvenile, and I had hoped he would rise to his new position. But although words are indeed important, I thought his tough take-no-prisoners manner and, yes, even his unpredictability might be what was needed at this particular time to cause offending persons and countries to sit up, consider us seriously, and think twice about taking advantage of us financially and otherwise.To the Editor:My hometown, Newton Falls, Ohio, was once a working-class Mayberry. Though not rich, the men and women of the town had pride and worked hard for their families and for their share of the American dream.I am 28, and in the nearly three decades I\u2019ve been alive, I\u2019ve seen Newton Falls and its surrounding environs succumb to a despair reflected by the opioid crisis. I have seen Republicans and Democrats sell out through a false dogma of free trade. I have seen my friends sent abroad to foreign lands with ill-defined military missions, coming back mangled or not at all. I have seen a political class eager to replace a working class with an imported labor class, driving down wages.One candidate sought to address this \u2014 Donald Trump. While admittedly a gamble, he promised to address the trifecta of poor trade deals, an end to needless foreign wars and a crackdown on immigration. On these three goals, he has done an excellent job so far and I support him wholeheartedly.To the Editor:Several of my friends with whom I discuss politics in the San Francisco Bay Area (not many!) have told me that I\u2019m the only person they know who voted for Donald Trump. Truth be told, I think there are others who have not admitted it.Donald Trump was not my first choice. However, even though I\u2019m a \u201cwomen\u2019s libber\u201d from the late \u201960s, and I feel that we should have had a female president by now, Hillary Clinton was not worthy.He has undone many of President Barack Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders. He has been rolling back burdensome regulations. He shepherded through Congress a tax bill that most people think will be a boon to the economy and \u201clift all boats.\u201d Obamacare is mortally wounded.I think Mr. Trump is a true entrepreneur who will adjust his approach and succeed in the end.To the Editor:President Donald Trump still has to deliver bigly for me on fiscal responsibility. The national debt is my biggest concern today. I am very happy with the number of executive orders he\u2019s passed to get around an obstructionist Democratic Party that is out for his blood. His combative attitude with the Democrats and the media on Twitter never gets old with me either.If I wanted a scripted smooth talker for president, I\u2019d have voted for someone else. An unscripted Mr. Trump feels more authentic to me, and I still don\u2019t see him as a politician. If the election were held again today, I would 100 percent vote for him again.To the Editor:Before I respond to your questions, I have a question of my own: Did you run similar surveys for Obama voters? Or, for that matter, Eisenhower voters? Trump voters are not circus freaks to be displayed or singled out.The very fact that we have a tax cut, a roaring economy and stock market, a magnificent new Supreme Court justice and a wonderful attorney general with not only a moral compass but also a determination to actually enforce the laws of the land gives me great hope for this country\u2019s future.I think President Trump is doing just fine, particularly when one considers the sustained assault of the media, Hollywood, talk shows and, dare I say, \u201cthe paper of record,\u201d which has abandoned all pretense of objectivity to join, if not lead, \u201cthe resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for the Subway", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "FeatureIt built the city. Now, no matter the cost \u2014 at least $100 billion \u2014 the city must rebuild it to survive.Supported byBefore the subway, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that New York would become the greatest city on earth. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution were arriving on its doorstep every year, but most of them were effectively marooned, herded into dark, squalid tenements in disease-ridden slums. The five boroughs had recently been joined as one city, but the farms and villages of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens might as well have been on the other side of the planet from Manhattan\u2019s teeming streets. Bound up in the fate of the city were even larger questions: Would America be able to manage the transition from the individualism and insularity that defined its 19th-century frontiers to the creative collaboration and competition of its fast-growing urban centers? Could it adapt and excel in this rapidly changing world? Were cities the past or the future of civilization? And then came the subway: hundreds of miles of track shooting out in every direction, carrying millions of immigrants out of the ghettos and into newly built homes, tying together the modern city and enabling it to become a place where anything was possible.It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fueled the astonishing economic growth that built the city\u2019s iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York\u2019s, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs \u2014 a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people.As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub. When the city is in crisis \u2014 financial or emotional \u2014 the subway is always a crucial part of the solution. The subway led the city\u2019s recovery from the fiscal calamity of the 1970s. The subway was at the center of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. The subway got New York back to work after the most devastating storm in the city\u2019s history just five years ago.The questions we are facing today are not so different from the ones our predecessors faced 100 years ago. Can the gap between rich and poor be closed, or is it destined to continue to widen? Can we put the future needs of a city and a nation above the narrow, present-day interests of a few? Can we use a portion of the monumental sums of wealth that we are generating to invest in an inclusive and competitive future? The answer to all of these questions is still rumbling beneath New York City.For all the changes in transportation technology since the first tunnels were dug \u2014 the rise of the automobile, the proliferation of bike lanes and ferries, our growing addiction to ride-hailing apps and dreams of a future filled with autonomous vehicles \u2014 the subway remains the only way to move large numbers of people around the city. Today, New York\u2019s subway carries close to six million people every day, more than twice the entire population of Chicago. The subway may no longer be a technological marvel, but it continues to perform a daily magic trick: It brings people together, but it also spreads people out. It is this paradox \u2014 these constant expansions and contractions, like a beating heart \u2014 that keep the human capital flowing and the city growing. New York\u2019s subway has no zones and no hours of operation. It connects rich and poor neighborhoods alike. The subway has never been segregated. It is always open, and the fare is always the same no matter how far you need to go. In New York, movement \u2014 anywhere, anytime \u2014 is a right.I. WHO WRECKED THE SUBWAY?The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the government agency that operates the subway, uses the catchall word \u201cincident\u201d to describe all the various events that impede the system\u2019s healthy functioning. Every one of these incidents triggers an investigation resulting in an incident report, a minute-by-minute account of what went wrong and the steps taken to resolve the issue. Thousands of these reports are produced every month. A random sampling of incidents from a single recent day include: \u201cSignal Trouble,\u201d \u201cSwitch Trouble,\u201d \u201cUnruly Person(s),\u201d \u201cTrack Circuit Failure,\u201d \u201cDelayed by Track/Work Gangs,\u201d \u201cWater Condition,\u201d \u201cFire/Smoke Conditions,\u201d \u201cDebris on Roadbed,\u201d \u201cBrakes Fail to Charge\u201d and \u201cSparks Issuing.\u201d Among the most common were \u201cExcess Dwell Time\u201d and \u201cInsufficient Capacity/Crowding.\u201d Translation: too many passengers, not enough trains.All these problems lead to one really big problem: The trains are terminally late, obstructed daily by a cascade of system failures. During the first three months of 2017, three-quarters of the subway\u2019s lines were chronically behind schedule. The worst offender, the 2 train, was late nearly 70 percent of the time.For a delayed rider wondering whom to blame, it\u2019s tempting to begin with the people you can see, the 7,000 or so men and women \u2014 track cleaners, inspectors, flaggers and other orange-vested M.T.A. employees \u2014 charged with preventing these incidents and keeping the trains moving. On a steamy morning in August, I sat among a small group of them in a dingy, defunct public elementary school in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that serves as the M.T.A.\u2019s Transit Learning Center. Taped to the classroom wall were yellowing tabloid clips of a different kind of subway horror story \u2014 \u201cMAN UNDER!, RAIL HORROR: HIT THIRD TRACK AND LIVED!\u201d \u2014 a tableau that lent the one-day safety course, a requirement for all M.T.A. employees and contractors, some of the flavor of those grisly low-budget driver\u2019s-ed videos designed to scare teenagers straight.\u201cIf you should do something silly today, like get hit by a train, you cannot sue New York City Transit,\u201d my instructor, Jim Fortin, said as he distributed release forms to the class. It\u2019s a common occurrence: A passenger is killed on the tracks pretty much every week. The course would end with a walk on a live track. If I survived the day, I would receive a laminated license qualifying me to work in the tunnels of the New York City subway system \u2014 \u201cin the hole,\u201d as it is known.Fortin walked us through the potential hazards that awaited us. He taught us the proper arm motions to use if we ever found ourselves needing to signal to an oncoming train to stop. After a short multiple-choice test and a break for lunch, we were issued orange vests, flashlights, helmets and safety goggles. Our group walked to a nearby N station, rode a few stops, transferred to the R and got off at 53rd Street, where we walked to the end of the platform and climbed down a ladder onto the tracks. Fortin soon directed us to what he called \u201cclear-up spots,\u201d small, shallow openings built into the walls of the narrow tunnels that we had been taught that morning to identify. A train was coming. I stuffed my flashlight into my back pocket and tucked myself into the tiny space, remembering Fortin\u2019s instructions: \u201cGet in. Get centered. Don\u2019t move.\u201d I could hear the train approaching and see its headlight out of the corner of my eye. In about 30 seconds a string of 45-ton steel cars was thundering by, just 18 inches from my frozen body. It was terrifying, but also thrilling, like the entire industrial revolution was speeding past my face.At point-blank range, subway cars seem invincible. In fact, they can be laid low by something as insignificant as a broken bolt or a can of soda \u2014 which, when resting against the third rail, might heat up and ignite a scrap of newspaper, causing a track fire, the source of hundreds of delays every month. Every inch of the system\u2019s rails is supposed to be checked twice a week for imperfections. Much of this work happens overnight, when the frequency of trains on this 24-hour system decreases and workers are able to move more freely on the tracks. \u201cWhile the rest of the city is sleeping, there\u2019s a whole industrial ballet going on underground that most people have no idea about,\u201d John Samuelsen, a track inspector who now runs the Transport Workers Union of America, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like friggin\u2019 Brigadoon down there.\u201d And yet a recent study found that only 3 percent of the tracks in stations meet the M.T.A.\u2019s own standards for cleanliness.Workers face an even more insidious challenge than trash in the form of water. Many parts of the system are below the water table, and its lines course through neighborhoods that were once lush farmland. On a dry day, the M.T.A. pumps 13 million gallons of water from the system. Over time, the water corrodes the system, rusting and rotting its infrastructure \u2014 and yet sealing and grouting these leaks often requires rerouting service on lines, further frustrating riders. Next year, the L train will begin a shutdown that will last at least 15 months for repairs to its East River tunnel, which flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Some 225,000 people will have to find a new way to get in and out of Manhattan every day.No matter how diligent they may be, 7,000-odd orange-vested maintenance workers are simply not enough to keep the deteriorating system \u2014 with its 665 miles of passenger-carrying track, enough to reach all the way to Indianapolis \u2014 on schedule. All the real problems must begin elsewhere, further up the chain of command.Greenblatt, a 31-year veteran of the M.T.A., grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, without a car. \u201cI started riding trains and buses by myself pretty much from the time I was 5 years old,\u201d he told me after we settled into a conference room overlooking the command center. He became a bus driver when he graduated from college, fulfilling a childhood dream, and has been an employee of the M.T.A. ever since, gradually moving up the ladder to his current position. \u201cWe operate the trains,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to run them on time \u2014 5.66 million average daily riders, 1.7 billion annual riders. Right now, there are 585 trains out there. We will run 8,477 one-way trips over the course of a day. We hope to have 8,477 on-time trains. We\u2019re not going to do it today.\u201dGreenblatt\u2019s morning began with a 2:30 a.m. phone call: An operator moving a train out of storage at a yard in East New York, Brooklyn, had driven through a stop signal, damaging the switch beneath him. \u201cThe first question we would ask is whether it is going to have any impact on service,\u201d Greenblatt said. A few hours later, at 5:10 a.m., he received a text message about another incident: A passenger had called from the Park Place station, near City Hall, to report that there was smoke on the tracks. Seven minutes later, the New York City Police Department reported via an internal-communications line known as \u201cthe 6 Wire\u201d that a transformer may have exploded in the station. Greenblatt managed the response. Service on the 2 and 3 lines was rerouted, and several teams were deployed to Park Place to figure out what was going on. They soon discovered that a chunk of metal, about 18 inches long, had fallen onto the tracks, breaking through the third-rail protection board and shorting out the power.\u201cIf you bridge the third rail, which has 600 volts of electricity, to the signal rail, which has 12 volts of electricity,\u201d Greenblatt said, \u201cit\u2019s going to blow things.\u201d The Rail Control Center\u2019s chief officer, Paul McPhee, showed me a picture on his phone of the charred board, which looked as though it could have been pulled from the fire pit at a campsite. It took about two and a half hours for the temporary repairs to be completed and full power to be restored. The trains could now start running again but were required to move at reduced speeds in the vicinity of the station. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in a degraded mode right now,\u201d Greenblatt said.Systemwide, the biggest source of subway delays is simple overcrowding. In the 1990s, after a derailment killed five passengers and a collision killed a train operator, the M.T.A. started actively slowing down its trains. This has reduced \u201cthroughput\u201d \u2014 the number of trains that move through the system at any given time \u2014 which has increased crowding. And when the subway becomes more crowded, it grows slower still, with trains stuck in stations while knots of passengers fight their way in and out of cars. As ridership grew from 2012 to 2016, the end-to-end running time during peak hours on the numbered lines increased by more than six minutes. Average train speeds are now slower than they were in 1950.The subway could be both faster and safer if all of it were controlled by a computer-based signal system, which would automatically ensure that trains are always operating at the maximum safe speed, with the narrowest possible distance between them. Instead, much of the subway uses a signal system that dates to the 1920s and \u201930s. What that means didn\u2019t really hit home for me until I visited the signal-repair shop at the 215th Street rail yard in Manhattan. Technicians were hunched over cast-iron gadgets \u2014 stop motors, compressors, track relays \u2014 that looked as if they belonged in the workshop of an eccentric antique collector. In the machine shop downstairs, I saw workers making mounting brackets and ball bearings; even the system\u2019s most basic parts are so obsolete that they have to be manufactured in-house. \u201cA lot of the equipment we really can\u2019t purchase,\u201d the M.T.A.\u2019s assistant chief of signals, Salvatore Ambrosino, told me as we watched a technician assemble a tiny motor. \u201cOur only option is to rebuild.\u201dIn the meantime, Greenblatt and his staff take it day by day, managing incidents as though they are an inevitable force of nature. When I asked him about the so-called F-train meltdown that became a media sensation in June \u2014 hundreds of passengers were stuck in a tunnel for more than 40 minutes in a 40-year-old train that lost power \u2014 he told me he was surprised the incident received so much attention. When he left work that night, it had not felt any different from any other day on the job. And in a sense, it wasn\u2019t. The F-train meltdown was just one of the 8,122 incidents reported during the month of June. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I like the word \u2018meltdown\u2019 so much,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThings happen.\u201dAfter initially trying to shift the blame to the city\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, Cuomo has of late been trying to recast himself as the subway\u2019s can-do savior. He convened an advisory panel, called FixNYC, to study the idea of implementing a congestion-pricing plan to help subsidize mass transit. He created an open competition called the Genius Challenge: Come up with a viable plan to fix the subway and win $1 million. And on a rainy, wind-swept night in early September, his press office invited a small group of reporters and local camera crews to assemble in a soggy, grime-caked ventilation room beneath the Union Square station to watch him roll out his latest plan. Spotlights hung from rusty columns; a dozen or so chairs were arrayed before a lectern and a video monitor. A little before midnight, Cuomo made his dramatic entrance through a large vented manhole, climbing down a metal ladder in pressed chinos, tasseled boots and a windbreaker bearing the New York State seal, and announced that he was doubling the fine for littering in the subway to $100 and buying some new jumbo-size vacuum cleaners to clean the tracks.The moves were part of Cuomo\u2019s $836 million \u201cNYC Subway Action Plan,\u201d which was unveiled last summer by the newly installed M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, who had also run the authority several years earlier. The matter of who is going to cover that $836 million remains a matter of some controversy. Cuomo offered to pay for half and said the city should cover the rest. De Blasio refused, noting that the city had already given the M.T.A., which it did not control, billions of dollars in taxes. The plan remains only partially funded.This is a familiar quandary for the subway. When the M.T.A. first took control of the system in 1968, the idea was to use toll money from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the subway, but this scheme supplied only a small part of what was needed. For years, the state and federal governments picked up the shortfall, but beginning in the 1990s, Gov. George Pataki and the Republican-controlled Congress refused to cover the M.T.A.\u2019s rising costs. It has been scrambling for new streams of income ever since.Cuomo, for all his homilies about American greatness being the product of \u201cwhat we built,\u201d has also rejected some efforts to add new revenue sources to the subway. In 2015, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Jim Brennan, wrote a bill that would have steered a small but escalating percentage of state personal-income tax to the authority. Cuomo\u2019s staff dismissed the idea. \u201cThey said the M.T.A. wouldn\u2019t be able to spend the money, the construction industry was already at capacity,\u201d Brennan told me. \u201cOf course, when I would talk to Tom Prendergast\u201d \u2014 the chairman of the M.T.A. at the time \u2014 \u201cand his top people, they would go: \u2018Yes, yes, we can spend the money! Give us the money!\u2019\u2009\u201dIn fact, the M.T.A. has often proved all too capable of spending money, with construction costs well beyond what other cities spend on similar projects. It\u2019s fair to blame the whole New York political establishment \u2014 Cuomo, de Blasio and their counterparts stretching back decades \u2014 for presiding over the subway\u2019s decline. But the real political problem is, at root, a structural one. The subway subsists on an ad hoc patchwork of taxes implemented and overseen by a governor who represents millions of voters well beyond the greater metropolitan area. Brennan estimates that New York City is responsible for 55 percent of the state\u2019s revenues, but that doesn\u2019t change a fundamental political reality for its governors: People who don\u2019t ride the subway don\u2019t want to pay for the subway. You might say the subway is a victim of the same rural-urban divide that has come to define American politics today. A more parochial version of this divide exists in the city itself, where representatives of car-centric outer-borough neighborhoods continue to fight congestion-pricing plans that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the M.T.A.How much money does the subway really need? The Regional Plan Association has done some preliminary estimates based on the current cost of M.T.A. projects. They calculated that renovating the 30 stations most desperately in need would run $14 billion. Dealing with those sharp turns to increase speeds and capacity would cost $5 billion. Adding 61 track miles with new stations \u2014 mainly in neighborhoods without subway access and with large and generally low-income populations that are heavily dependent on mass transit \u2014 would run another $62 billion. Replacing the signal system would cost $27 billion. The group didn\u2019t look at replacing or overhauling cars, but a recent M.T.A. contract priced them at about $2 million each, so buying all of the new cars that are needed would cost nearly $3 billion.Just this partial list \u2014 I haven\u2019t included the platform doors, for instance \u2014 brings the total to about $111 billion. It\u2019s a big number. But not when you put it in context. New York City and its environs generated $1.7 trillion in gross metropolitan product in 2016. That\u2019s roughly 9 percent of the nation\u2019s overall G.D.P. How much of that activity is dependent on the subway? About a year before Hurricane Sandy, a state-funded group of scientists and engineers produced a comprehensive (and as it happens, prescient) report on the damage that a hundred-year storm surge could cause to the system. One of the study\u2019s authors, Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University, told me that losing the subway for a month would cost the city about $60 billion in lost economic output.The reality of this apocalyptic scenario hasn\u2019t sunk in. Absent sufficient resources, the subway has been left with diminished ambitions and empty spectacles. Inside the ventilation room at Union Square, Cuomo delivered some remarks about the scourge of garbage in the subway and then led the group out onto the waterlogged tracks. A few industrial-strength vacuum cleaners stood waiting. The governor posed for a picture with a Starbucks cup he had picked up off the rail bed and then took a turn on the hose of the 83-horsepower Vac-Tron, sucking up watery gunk that would no doubt be back with the next heavy rain.II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAYRavitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers\u2019 union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A.Ravitch didn\u2019t need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today.During the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city\u2019s own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system\u2019s outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: \u201cThe transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world.\u201dThe subway\u2019s importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It\u2019s a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of \u201970s and \u201980s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase \u201cthe Warhol economy\u201d to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York\u2019s art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates.Ravitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. \u201cAnd he said yes.\u201d Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to \u201cgive Ravitch what he needs.\u201d The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion \u2014 more than $17 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance.The turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch\u2019s tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s.The rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity \u2014 agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution.As Manhattan\u2019s business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway\u2019s snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. \u201cDevelopers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn\u2019s answer to SoHo. \u201cWe put density where there\u2019s transit.\u201d Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich \u2014 house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing \u2014 beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers.I\u2019ve known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo\u2019s overall trajectory over the last two decades. It\u2019s a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood\u2019s underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn\u2019t just the neighborhood\u2019s excellent subway access \u2014 it\u2019s sandwiched between the F line and the A line \u2014 or the city\u2019s economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city\u2019s losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late \u201990s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists\u2019 studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments.Like most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York\u2019s zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city\u2019s historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. \u201cI rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,\u201d Walentas told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dNew York is facing an affordable-housing crisis. In response, the city is incentivizing developers to build below-market-rate housing with property-tax exemptions, while also adding regulations that require them to incorporate more affordable housing into their higher-end projects. But securing one of these affordable units is not easy. Of the roughly 2,300 apartments in Walentas\u2019s Domino project, about 700 will be reserved for lower-income tenants. The first 105 affordable units were recently made available at monthly rents ranging from $590 to $964; 87,000 people entered the lottery for them.Walentas is a developer. If you want housing to be more affordable, he says, build more houses. \u201cThe way to put downward pressure on rents is not to have fear of making things better,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s to make things so pervasively better that people have more choices.\u201d In his words, it\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d that so little of the wealth that the subway generates flows back into the system. In Hong Kong, the company that runs the subway also controls the property around it, earning huge amounts that it can then reinvest in service enhancements. The M.T.A., by contrast, is largely cut out of the land profiteering that it enables: Of the authority\u2019s roughly $16 billion budget in 2017, about $460 million came from a tax on residential real estate transactions. An additional $520 million came from a tax on commercial sales. To put those numbers in perspective, several years ago, a group of economists calculated that the land in New York City \u2014 just the land, not the buildings on it \u2014 was worth about $2.5 trillion. One thing New York City has plenty of is money, and much of it is bound up in real estate, a kind of blank canvas with unlimited economic promise.Toward the end of our lunch, I asked Walentas a hypothetical question: What if the M.T.A. could offer the real estate community development rights as a kind of bargaining chip? Would it underwrite subway upgrades and expansions into underserved areas in exchange? \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said without hesitating. \u201cIt\u2019s just math. You can make the money come right out of the air with a pencil.\u201dEast New York is predominantly black and Hispanic, with a small South Asian community. Its median household income is about $35,000, and some 35 percent of its 35,000 or so residents live below the federal poverty level. East New York was gradually hollowed out by the same cycle of disinvestment that ate away at a lot of formerly middle-class neighborhoods in New York and other American cities over the course of the 1960s and \u201970s. The city\u2019s manufacturing jobs had disappeared, and the white middle-class flight from the neighborhood was underway, helped along by avaricious real estate brokers who issued alarmist warnings about East New York\u2019s future. In the process, East New York became a victim of what economists call spatial, or geographic, inequality: As its population shrank and its demographics changed, stores closed and city services declined, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.And so for the most part it remained, until recently, when the gentrification that had been pushing east across Brooklyn along the L train began to creep into East New York. A neighborhood that had long been starved of resources was now in danger of being hit by a wave of development that could push out longtime residents. What was to be done?The answer will be a kind of grand experiment in urban planning, made possible, of course, by the subway. East New York was recently rezoned to invite both residential and commercial development to revive the neighborhood, but with a combination of regulations and incentives that will ensure that half of the nearly 6,000 units of new housing would be affordable. This time, as the subway draws new residents to a neighborhood, the city will take a stronger hand in shaping its demographics and trying to ensure that its existing population isn\u2019t priced out. The hope is that the whole neighborhood will become more dense, and the resulting prosperity will be widely shared. All with just the stroke of a pencil and the subway.The concept dates to Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s era, when the Obama administration awarded New York a grant for cities looking to build more affordable housing near mass transit. De Blasio has now turned it into an early cornerstone of his promise to build or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments around the city. In addition to the subsidies it will provide to developers, the city has pledged to contribute $250 million to building schools, parks and a new community center in the neighborhood. \u201cThis sort of targeted investment has never been done before in any community,\u201d the local City Council member, Rafael Espinal, told me as we toured the neighborhood on a recent afternoon. Espinal, the son of Dominican immigrants, grew up in the adjoining neighborhood of Cypress Hills and was an important advocate for the rezoning, over the objections of some who argued that the increased development would only accelerate gentrification in East New York. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t move forward with this plan, the reality is that people here would have been displaced,\u201d he said as we passed the construction site for one of the neighborhood\u2019s first new developments, Chestnut Commons. It\u2019s a mixed-used development built around an apartment complex with 274 units of affordable housing; more than 80 units will be set aside for households earning up to $25,770, some of them specifically reserved for formerly homeless families.The revitalized blocks around Broadway Junction \u2014 desirable to people with more money, affordable to people with less \u2014 would reduce spatial inequality and provide current residents new jobs. And with a faster, more reliable subway, those same residents could also commute more quickly not just to Manhattan but to hospitals, nursing homes, health care clinics and community colleges in the outer boroughs, the source of a lot of the city\u2019s more recent job growth. In New York, transit dictates opportunities.That revelation has sustained us for more than a century, and some among us still see within our broken subway the stubborn glimmers of genius. When Max Diamond was a preschooler in Park Slope in the late 1990s, he turned his wooden train set into an exact replica of his local line, complete with all four tracks and the accurate location of each switch. By the time he was 8, he could identify and describe in detail all the different types of cars in the subway system. By the time he was 11, he knew the track layout of the entire system, not just the different stops on the different lines, but the hundreds of places where the tracks connect and the precise locations of the multitude of switches and signals. In the eighth grade, he started his own YouTube channel, where his subway videos, which he posts under the handle Dj Hammers, made him something of a celebrity among subway buffs.In 2016, Diamond was hired by the M.T.A. as a paid intern, and at 21, he now crunches numbers in its performance-analysis unit while he works toward an economics degree at the City College of New York. We met one fall afternoon at the Fulton Street station in Manhattan, just a short walk from the M.T.A.\u2019s headquarters, and boarded a Brooklyn-bound J train \u2014 an R42, he said, dating to 1969. We got on the first car, moving quickly to the large picture window at the front of the train, as has been Diamond\u2019s custom since he was a toddler, and wended our way through the tunnels beneath Lower Manhattan before emerging into the fading sunlight on the elevated tracks across the Williamsburg Bridge.Like most regular riders, I tend to think of the subway as a necessary evil, the least worst way to get where I\u2019m going, which made it a little disorienting to spend time with someone who rides the subway for fun. But in its early years, hundreds of thousands of people did just that every Sunday. According to the historian Clifton Hood, it was called \u201cdoing the subway.\u201d Diamond calls it \u201crailfanning.\u201dThe subway is a very different sort of marvel today. What\u2019s miraculous at this point is that it still works at all. The fact that it does, that even after decades of neglect it is still somehow managing to carry New York\u2019s economy on its back, may be the best argument for giving it everything it needs, and then a whole lot more.And what is the alternative?Here\u2019s one possible scenario: New York won\u2019t die, but it will become a different place. It will happen slowly, almost imperceptibly, for years, obscured by the prosperity of the segment of the population that can consistently avoid mass transit. But gradually, an unpleasant and unreliable subway will have a cascading effect on New Yorkers\u2019 relationship with their city. Increasingly, we will retreat; the infinite possibilities of New York will shrink as the distances between neighborhoods seem to grow. In time, businesses will choose to move elsewhere, to cities where public transit is better and housing is cheaper. This will depress real estate values, which will make housing more affordable in the short term. But it will also slow growth and development, which will curtail job prospects and deplete New York\u2019s tax base, limiting its ability to provide for citizens who rely on its public institutions for opportunity. The gap between rich and poor will widen. As the city\u2019s density dissipates, so too will its economic energy. Innovation will happen elsewhere. New York City will be just some city.That doesn\u2019t have to happen. The subway still exists, and the people who operate it still bring a kind of subtle genius to their work. As we rode deeper into Brooklyn, Diamond told me about something he had seen the night before. He had been monitoring the Yankees\u2019 playoff game on the internet, not because he cares about baseball but because the heavy crowds during the postseason often spur rare service patterns.His instinct was right. \u201cTrains started at Yankee Stadium and went down the D line to 36th Street, then switched over to the N line to Coney Island, then continued through the Coney Island terminal, before switching to the Q line to Brighton Beach,\u201d Diamond told me. This sort of move wouldn\u2019t be possible in most other cities, where subway lines operate independently, but in New York they overlap and intersect, making a single, cohesive, interchangeable whole. \u201cIt was actually pretty brilliant,\u201d he said in a reverent tone, as the blue sky in front of us began to darken.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an October 2017 service change made after a Yankees game. Trains moved from the N to the Q line, not from the M to the Q.An earlier version of a picture caption misidentified subway tunnels at Times Square Station. They are the tunnels for the 1, 2 and 3 lines, not for the 42nd Street Shuttle.Advertisement"}

In an announcement that seemed designed in part to address questions about the bank\u2019s succession planning, JPMorgan said two of his deputies, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, would be promoted to the joint roles of presidents and chief operating officers.Mr. Pinto, 55, has led JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank for five years. Mr. Smith, 59, runs its consumer banking operations. Both men will remain responsible for those areas in addition to their new roles.Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders to eventually replace Mr. Dimon, especially if he sticks around for five years. But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave.Several younger executives beneath them could be in the running to lead the bank someday. Monday\u2019s announcement identified Mary Erdoes, 50, who runs the bank\u2019s asset and wealth management arm; Doug Petno, 52, who runs the commercial banking division; and Marianne Lake, 48, the bank\u2019s finance chief, as among the up-and-comers.A handful of earlier would-be successors left JPMorgan after it was clear that Mr. Dimon wouldn\u2019t be stepping aside in time for them to take over \u2014 sparking concerns among some industry observers that the bank wasn\u2019t doing a good job of grooming talent to eventually replace him.\u201cThe board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,\u201d the bank said in Monday\u2019s announcement.Advertisement"}

While many of the Republican Party\u2019s traditional elite donors have publicly kept their distance from the groups, the organizations have the blessing of the administration and have projected confidence in their fund-raising.But Republican operatives have grumbled that the amount the groups say they have raised have dwarfed the amount they have spent to support Mr. Trump\u2019s political and policy goals during his first year in office.Brian O. Walsh, the president of America First Policies, said the group had paid for online ads \u201chighlighting President Trump\u2019s leadership on key issues.\u201d Those ads can be harder to track, and Mr. Walsh declined to provide an \u201citem-by-item breakdown at this time.\u201dA person close to the groups told Axios that they had $14 million in the bank headed into this year, which could provide the basis for a major midterm election campaign.But very few of the party\u2019s elite donors were listed among the contributors to America First Action in the report filed on Wednesday with the election commission.Murray Energy\u2019s donation to America First Action came about five months after Mr. Murray\u2019s meeting with Mr. Perry.

She missed payments on her credit card, was threatened with collections, and was spending a lot on rent, college loans and eating out.\u201cWhere would I have learned personal finance?\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you get it from your family, there\u2019s no time where a teacher sits down and explains very basic financial principles,\u201d she said.As a recent college graduate in New York City, Ms. Bell learned that she wasn\u2019t the only one among her peers who struggled to manage her finances.

{"Headline": "How Not to Engage With Pakistan", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile perhaps it is emotionally satisfying to penalize a country that has supported American enemies in Afghanistan for the past 16 years, the administration\u2019s approach is unlikely to work. Pakistan has greater leverage over us than many imagine.The keys to understanding Pakistan\u2019s policy and the limitations of American options lie in geography and history. Pakistan essentially amounts to a relatively indefensible sliver astride the Indus River, with flat plains in the east and mountain redoubts populated by hostile tribes in the west. This fragile geography would not matter if not for Pakistan\u2019s long history of enmity toward its far larger neighbor, India.Since its founding in 1947, Pakistan has defined itself as a national security state in opposition to the Indian behemoth to its east. Pakistanis have long dreaded the prospect of Indian tanks from the adjoining plains of Indian Punjab rolling unimpeded into Lahore and beyond. We may not agree with how Pakistan assesses the threat from India, but in my experience, almost all Pakistanis perceive India as an existential threat.Because of its real and perceived geographic precariousness, Pakistan has naturally gravitated toward asymmetric military solutions \u2014 specifically, the use of proxies. The Pakistani Army and, especially, its spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, have clandestinely supported all manner of anti-India and anti-Afghan groups.The geography that defines Pakistan\u2019s security worries has also been a bane for the United States. For the past 16 years our military efforts in landlocked Afghanistan have been dependent on transit through and especially overflight of Pakistani territory. Absent an implausible similar arrangement with Iran, other options are not good. Supply through the Central Asian states to the north is theoretically possible, but would rely on Russian good will. Enough said. Without Pakistani cooperation, our army in Afghanistan risks becoming a beached whale.Despite an infusion of about $1 billion per year of development assistance during the Obama administration, money never gave the United States the leverage it desired. The Pakistani generals who run Afghanistan policy from their headquarters in Rawalpindi were never convinced that they had to choose between their relationship with the United States and their relationship with the Taliban.I can vouch from bitter personal experience that I hammered away at the need to make that choice for four years, but never got any purchase. The generals knew that as long as the United States maintained an army in Afghanistan, it was more dependent on Pakistan than Pakistan was on it. This disconnect between Washington and Rawalpindi led to the decline in United States-Pakistan relations that was already highly visible in the last year of the Obama administration.Thus, the Trump administration\u2019s attempt at humiliating and penalizing Pakistan is unlikely to work. Pakistan, like most countries, reacts very badly to public attempts to force its hand. It is likely to respond by showing how it can truly undercut our position in Afghanistan.A better approach would be to privately convey, at the highest levels and without equivocation that the only way to preserve any relationship with the United States is to cut all ties with the Taliban, including the Haqqanis. The Trump administration, with its hard-line reputation and willingness to reject all previous United States policy, could credibly deliver this message.But the path of the tweet and highly public aid cuts is not a method that will engender success. The United States can address Afghanistan only with a political initiative. The ultimate answer to the Pakistan conundrum is to start a diplomatic initiative to bring peace to Afghanistan by opening talks with the Taliban. Much of diplomacy is taking away the other side\u2019s talking points, or excuses.The Trump administration has publicly stated that it sees the conflict ending only through a negotiated solution. It is difficult to understand why no such diplomatic initiative had been started.Richard G. Olson was the United States ambassador to Pakistan from 2012 to 2015 and the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2015 to 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaign Donor Pleaded Guilty to Trying to Bribe Mayor de Blasio", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA campaign donor to Mayor Bill de Blasio secretly pleaded guilty in federal court to bribery, admitting that he used his contributions to the mayor to try to win favorable lease terms for a restaurant he owned on city property, newly unsealed court records show.While the court papers included no charges against Mr. de Blasio or other city officials, a federal criminal information in the case makes it clear that the donor, Harendra Singh, got something in return.The court documents said that the mayor took steps to benefit Mr. Singh in exchange for the contributions, and that an unnamed senior aide to Mr. de Blasio arranged a meeting to pressure a city agency to offer more favorable terms to Mr. Singh.Mr. Singh\u2019s plea hearing occurred in a sealed Long Island courtroom before United States District Court Judge Sandra J. Feuerstein on Oct. 17, 2016; Mr. Singh said that his donations were intended as part of a quid pro quo, according to a transcript of the hearing.\u201cI gave these donations to the elected official in exchange for efforts by that official and other city officials to obtain a lease renewal from the city agency for my restaurant on terms that were favorable to me,\u201d he said.Mr. Singh did not name the mayor, and the court documents refer instead to an \u201cOfficial #2\u201d who received the donations; various details in the documents make it clear that the unnamed official is Mr. de Blasio.The relationship between Mr. Singh and Mr. de Blasio had been a focus of investigations by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York; after an 18-month inquiry, those prosecutors decided against charging the mayor, but harshly criticized him and his fund-raising practices.The characterization of the bribery efforts could undermine Mr. de Blasio\u2019s repeated defense of his administration\u2019s ethics.Mr. Singh pleaded guilty in October 2016 to six counts stemming from bribery schemes involving local government officials on Long Island and several businesses he owned there.He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, bribery and honest services wire fraud, in connection with campaign contributions to Mr. de Blasio, according to the records. Those charges were not previously made public.The federal information describes Mr. Singh\u2019s negotiations with an unnamed New York City agency to renew a lease for one of his businesses. The details in the indictment match Mr. Singh\u2019s efforts to renew a lease with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services for his Water\u2019s Edge restaurant, which operated on city property in Queens.Mr. Singh started raising campaign contributions for the unnamed official in 2010, ultimately raising tens of thousands of dollars, according to the records. Mr. Singh was one of the earliest large donors when Mr. de Blasio began his mayoral campaign in 2010, and he, his family members and other associates ultimately raised a total of about $33,000 for the mayor.The information also refers to several actions by Mr. Singh and city officials that contributed to the conspiracy. It refers to an Oct. 12, 2013, fund-raiser that Mr. Singh hosted at his restaurant. On that date, campaign finance filings indicate, the de Blasio campaign held a fund-raising event at Water\u2019s Edge.In December 2014, Mr. Singh sent an email to an aide to \u201cOfficial #2\u201d \u2014 the mayor \u2014 saying that he needed help with the agency involved in his lease renewal, according to the unsealed documents.On July 30, 2015, the court documents show, a senior aide to \u201cOfficial #2\u201d arranged a meeting with Mr. Singh and the head of the city agency \u201cin an effort to pressure the agency to make its proposed settlement terms more favorable\u201d to Mr. Singh. On that date, one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top aides, Emma Wolfe, held a meeting in City Hall with Mr. Singh and the head of the administrative services department, Stacey Cumberbatch, to discuss Mr. Singh\u2019s lease.Neal Kwatra, a lobbyist working with Mr. Singh who had a close relationship with Ms. Wolfe, also attended the meeting.The July 2015 meeting in City Hall was the start of intensive activity by Ms. Wolfe\u2019s office, which resulted in the city tentatively agreeing to settlement terms that were more favorable to Mr. Singh than had previously been offered. The city and Mr. Singh were close to finalizing their settlement when Mr. Singh was arrested as part of the Long Island corruption investigation.Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, characterized the allegations as \u201cnever proven because they are not true.\u201d\u201cThey are old news that\u2019s been widely reported and reviewed extensively by federal prosecutors before they closed their investigation. We make decisions on the merits. Period,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.Spokesmen for the two United States attorneys\u2019 offices declined to comment.Mr. Singh, who owed the city millions of dollars in back rent and charges for the rebuilding of a nearby pier, had been involved in a long-running dispute with the city over his lease. The negotiations in 2015 were to settle those disputes, which he hoped would lead to a renewal of the lease.Mr. de Blasio had intervened on behalf of Mr. Singh on various occasions. He attended a meeting with administrative services department officials and Mr. Singh in 2011, when he was still public advocate; after Mr. de Blasio was elected mayor, he telephoned the head of the agency to ask her to help Mr. Singh and ordered a top city official to monitor the negotiations.The court documents said that Mr. Singh\u2019s contributions were made \u201cin exchange for efforts by Official #2 and other city officials\u201d that benefited Mr. Singh.Mr. de Blasio has said that Mr. Singh got the same treatment that any other constituent would have received and that he was not influenced by the donations.Mr. Singh\u2019s lawyer, Anthony M. La Pinta, declined to comment.The transcript of Mr. Singh\u2019s guilty plea was unsealed on Tuesday in connection with the trial of one of the Long Island officials, Edward P. Mangano. Mr. Singh is expected to be an important witness in that case.Follow William K. Rashbaum and William Neuman on Twitter: @WRashbaum and @willieneumanAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Housing Market Is Like a Casino. Can a Property Tax Tame It?", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the years, in one city or another, it has limited mortgage lending. It has tried to halt purchases of homes by people who already own one. It has plowed billions of dollars into building new homes that regular Chinese people can afford.Now the Chinese government is considering adopting something that, while familiar to homeowners in the United States and elsewhere, could dramatically reshape the world\u2019s second-largest economy: a property tax.Living in a place without property taxes may sound appealing, but a growing number of experts and policymakers in China say the absence of one has helped destabilize a vast and crucial part of the Chinese economy.In October, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, told the nation that \u201chouses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation.\u201dReal estate fervor was on display on a chilly recent morning at an apartment complex in the eastern city of Nanjing. Would-be buyers spent the night in tents and under quilts, lined up for a chance to buy. So many cars arrived, according to people who were there and photos that went viral on social media, that traffic seized up for a mile around the sales office.\u201cThere were a lot of speculators,\u201d said Han Changlong, a Nanjing real estate inspector who attended the event. \u201cSome people believe that if they don\u2019t buy now, homes will become more expensive in the future.\u201dA tax is far from assured, and lawmakers have not indicated that one will be on the table when they hold their annual meeting in March. Still, experts say momentum is building.Xiao Jie, the finance minister, wrote in late December in People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, that leaders at a major party meeting two months earlier had favored instituting such a tax. The slogan, Mr. Xiao said, would be \u201cLegislation first, full authorization, move forward step by step.\u201dA property tax could have a profound impact on a crucial part of the nation\u2019s economy. Real estate makes up nearly three-quarters of the assets of Chinese households, according to the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance, an academic institute in Chengdu, in southwestern China. That compares with a bit more than one-third for United States households. Roughly a fifth to a quarter of China\u2019s annual economic output comes from property and related industries, like furniture making.But housing is also the source of some of the country\u2019s biggest booms and busts. Local investors \u2014 many of whom do not trust the country\u2019s stock markets and are forbidden by Beijing to move most of their wealth abroad \u2014 simply throw money at housing. Real estate broker fees, often as low as 1 percent, are a small fraction of the typical 6 percent in the United States. Mortgage lending has leapt over the past two years, adding to the potential for financial turbulence.Housing in Beijing and Shanghai has soared beyond the reach of even many affluent families and speculators \u2014 at least for now.Other factors spur frantic buying, such as access to local government services, as well as cultural forces that emphasize homeownership.Ma Xiaoguang, a 31-year-old mechanical engineer, and his wife recently bought an apartment for $227,000 in the farthest outskirts of Shanghai so their daughter could get permission to attend a nearby public school. But they do not live there, instead renting a place in a more expensive neighborhood. They found a tenant for their purchased apartment, but for only $180 a month.\u201cI know the yield is too low,\u201d Mr. Ma said, \u201cbut I want to have a home, and an apartment makes my family and me feel safe.\u201dIt is not clear whether a property tax would cover all homes, or just second ones. Much of China would be starting from scratch, as the country does not have decades of real estate records like the United States and other places.\u201cWhat would happen if real estate prices keep stable?\u201d said Li Xunlei, the chief economist at Zhongtai Securities in Jinan, in the east. \u201cWe have many speculators, and they may find it unnecessary to hold real estate that does not increase in value.\u201dJerry Lu, a 24-year-old insurance salesman, said he was determined to buy an apartment so that his girlfriend would feel more secure. He waited in a long line in November in his hometown, Deyang, in the southwest, and bought one of the last apartments available, incurring a mortgage that will claim a third of his income for monthly payments.\u201cI don\u2019t care if there is a real estate tax next year,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what, I need to buy one.\u201dAilin Tang and Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

Indeed, shepherding is how Mr. Morissette sees his job, not so much manufacturing wine as helping the grapes realize their destiny.Sometimes a wine never gets there. A 2009 chardonnay, one of Pearl Morissette\u2019s early vintages, is still resting in the winery, unsold. Mr. Morissette judged the wine to be too tight and unyielding, and did not want to release it.\u201cIt was telling us to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly recently has it become inviting.\u201dMore often, though, the wines are captivating. The lineup includes savory, textured chardonnays; cabernet francs of uncommon depth and purity; fresh, joyous gamays and pinot noirs that can vary from a pretty, floral 2011 that is delicious right now to a spicy, smoky 2012 that manages to be both brawny and elegant. Like the \u201909 chardonnay, it has not yet been released.Many Americans may be surprised by the idea of any vignerons like Mr. Morissette working in Canada. Many think Ontario is simply too cold for making fine wine, though they might associate the region with ice wine, a rare delicacy made from grapes that have frozen on the vine, resulting in minute quantities of lusciously sweet, concentrated nectar.In fact, grapes ripen here beautifully. The Niagara Peninsula is more than hospitable to cool-climate varieties like riesling, chardonnay and pinot noir. Surprisingly, grapes that require a longer growing season, like cabernet franc, also make exceptional wines.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.On the Niagara Peninsula to the south, vineyards can survive the occasional blast of cold Arctic air because Lake Ontario, which is exceptionally deep, retains heat and warms the winds. If the vines are too far south of the lake, however, the effect is lost and vines cannot survive. In the summer, the cool waters temper the heat, creating a long, moderate growing season.The summer heat in Prince Edward County is likewise moderated by the lake. But in the winter the cold winds hit the region directly. Growers are forced to take the costly, labor-intensive step of burying their vines in the warm earth so they can survive.\u201cI knew it would be extra work, but it is worth it because the calcareous limestone soils are so incredible,\u201d said Mr. Hardie, who planted his first vines there in 2003. The payoff, for him, is wines that are both subtle and expressive.Beyond the small group of top producers, a lot of wine is made on the Niagara Peninsula. Much of it, alas, is workmanlike stuff to sell to the many tourists who come in the summer to visit the lake and Niagara Falls.\u201cProducing plonk for Niagara bus tours, that\u2019s the biggest problem, not the cold,\u201d Mr. Bachelder said.Mr. Morissette, whose wines are both idiosyncratic and remarkable, never imagined he would be making wine on the Niagara Peninsula. He grew up south of Montreal, \u201cin one of the worst places in the world, a suburb,\u201d he said. His family did not drink wine, but he was inspired by novels and old French movies in which joyful, witty scenes set around meals always seemed to include wine.\u201cI call these wines my liquid mentors,\u201d he said.Mr. Morissette married, had children and learned about farming, working in the cellar and producing wines that were expressive, uncompromising and long-lived. Soon, without hope of establishing his own estate in Burgundy, he was ready for another challenge.Inspired, Mr. Morissette moved to the Niagara Peninsula in 2007 with marching orders from Mr. Pearl to do as he thought best. First, they bought a vineyard where a layer of loam sits over bedrock of dolomitic limestone. In 2008, they bought another that, unusually for Niagara, sits over a heavy gravel bed, as in Bordeaux.\u201cMy goal was never to do Burgundy,\u201d he said as we tasted in the winery. \u201cIt was to see what Jordan could do.\u201dWhile Mr. Morissette rejects the label of natural winemaker, he embraces the classic, traditional methods of frugal farmers, who for centuries honed an innate, practical wisdom based on keen observation and a horror of waste.\u201cI wanted to learn the old methods before they disappeared,\u201d he said of his time in Europe.Many who embrace current ideas that emphasize vineyard bedrock, and its influence on the aromas and flavors in the wine, may be surprised that Mr. Morissette rejects that framework.\u201cI care a lot more about soil and fungi and bacteria than I do about rocks,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, we have extraordinary soils in terms of the intact life.\u201dEven more important, he said, is the effect of the climate, which can be as cool as Chablis one year and as hot and damp as North Carolina the next.The wines \u2014 which age in various vessels, including small barrels, large casks, cement eggs and ceramic amphorae \u2014 have a vibrant life force that is felt rather than tasted. His chardonnays tend to be rich rather than lean, while the cabernet francs are pure, structured and lovely. His rieslings are bone dry and age-worthy. Pinot noir, he said, remains a code that he has not yet cracked to his satisfaction.Mr. Morissette is deeply aware of the advantages he has with his partner, Mr. Pearl, whom he says has never wavered in his commitment to Mr. Morissette\u2019s vision.\u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to think you could do this without money,\u201d Mr. Morissette said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done in 10 years what would have taken a generation or two because we\u2019re throwing money at it.\u201dThe rewards are an uncommon sort of wines, whether from Ontario or anywhere else.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing natural about what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are committed to classicism. If you don\u2019t tamper with a wine and live with its moods, it will bring you to a place you couldn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Boom Gives the U.S. a New Edge in Energy and Diplomacy", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 A substantial rise in oil prices in recent months has led to a resurgence in American oil production, enabling the country to challenge the dominance of Saudi Arabia and dampen price pressures at the pump.The success has come in the face of efforts by Saudi Arabia and its oil allies to undercut the shale drilling spree in the United States. Those strategies backfired and ultimately ended up benefiting the oil industry.Overcoming three years of slumping prices proved the resiliency of the shale boom. Energy companies and their financial backers were able to weather market turmoil \u2014 and the maneuvers of the global oil cartel \u2014 by adjusting exploration and extraction techniques.After a painful shakeout in the industry that included scores of bankruptcies and a significant loss of jobs, a steadier shale-drilling industry is arising, anchored by better-financed companies.With the price of West Texas intermediate crude above $65 a barrel, a level not seen in almost three years, the United States is becoming a dominant producer. It is able to outflank competitors in supplying growing global markets, particularly China and India, while slashing imports from the Middle East and North Africa.\u201cThis is a 180-degree turn for the United States and the impacts are being felt around the world,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the economic historian and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power.\u201d \u201cThis not only contributes to U.S. energy security but also contributes to world energy security by bringing new supplies to the world.\u201dAt the same time, the United States is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, another outgrowth of the shale revolution, undercutting Russian energy dominance over Eastern Europe.The improving energy picture comes as the Trump administration is attempting to increase offshore drilling and loosen other regulations on fossil fuel development. But just as the surge in oil and gas production in shale fields during the Barack Obama administration had little to do with Washington, the current rise is the result of private companies responding to global markets.Shale fields can be developed relatively quickly and at modest costs relative to the giant projects, whether on land or offshore, that were once favored by big oil companies. That makes it easier to turn investment spigots on or off to adjust to market fluctuations. Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are putting increasing amounts of capital in shale fields, particularly in West Texas and New Mexico.The results go far beyond the economic, offering Washington strategic weapons once unthinkable. The United States and its allies now have a supply cushion at a time when political turmoil in Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria is threatening to interrupt flows to markets.Only a few years ago, such threats \u2014 along with a recent pipeline failure in the North Sea and storms in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 would have sent the price of crude soaring. Instead, the rise has been muted, and gasoline at the pump remains below $2.60 a gallon across most of the United States.The new energy power also relieves pressure on Washington to act militarily if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia break out into war. And it gives Washington the leeway to apply sanctions on other producers \u2014 as it has in Russia, and may in Iran or Venezuela \u2014 with far less risk to the global economy.It is a striking contrast to the 1970s, when Arab oil boycotts forced motorists to line up for blocks to fill their tanks and the economy went into a tailspin. Even more recently, during the presidency of George W. Bush, domestic oil output was declining so rapidly that the country set a course to replace oil with biofuels like ethanol.Many environmentalists argue that by increasing oil and gas supplies and lowering prices for consumers, shale drilling is extending the life of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment and the development of cleaner energy.The shale drilling revolution has remade the global energy market, with imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plunging by 20 percent from late 2016 to late 2017. At the same time, exports rose by hundreds of thousands of barrels a day.Nothing like the current situation was foreseen in late 2014, when rising domestic production began weighing on global oil prices.In response, Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a new direction. Instead of throttling back to support prices as the cartel had done so often, it left the market alone and even increased production for a time.Prices fell below $40 a barrel, as the Saudis and their allies hoped to drive American operations out of business by making shale drilling uneconomical. American exploration quickly dropped, but the price squeeze made companies more innovative in the use of drilling technologies, robotics and sensors to maximize output and reduce costs.While scores of smaller companies went out of business, the survivors lengthened horizontal wells to yield more oil, and used clever hedging and drilling strategies to maximize profits even when prices slumped.The response surprised the global oil community. OPEC, Russia and allied producing countries changed course and began cutting back again in 2016.\u201cOPEC missed the point,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Ortiz, a former OPEC secretary general and former Ecuadorean energy minister. \u201cThey thought they could recover the U.S. market by bringing the prices down. Now the U.S. has gained the leading position in the world oil market regardless of what OPEC does.\u201d\u201cThis displacement of Saudi oil, Nigerian oil, Libyan oil and Venezuelan oil,\u201d Mr. Ortiz concluded, \u201cwas never anticipated.\u201dTechnological advances unlocking oil from tight rocks like shale has led to a drilling frenzy enabling a doubling of output in a decade, transforming unlikely places like North Dakota and New Mexico into world class petroleum hubs. Pipelines are being built across Texas to serve ports where oil can be pumped onto tankers headed for China, India and other markets.Domestic production last year averaged 9.3 million barrels a day, and the Energy Department projects that the figure will climb to 10.3 million barrels a day this year, surpassing the record set in 1970. In the meantime, since a 40-year export ban was lifted in 2015, exports of American oil have risen to roughly two million barrels a day \u2014 more than many OPEC members.Concerns over climate change as well as the growing popularity of electric cars and the eventual aging of the best shale fields will probably curb production and demand over the next few decades. But in the short term, the boom has changed the landscape.The Energy Department projects that the recent surge will hold the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, to $60 a barrel in 2018 and $61 a barrel in 2019 \u2014 a modest increase from $54 last year. (The Brent price rose above $70 a barrel this month, but few analysts see a return to $100-a-barrel oil.)The emerging order in the energy realm is a stable balance of power. Saudi Arabia, which essentially runs OPEC, has put a floor under the oil price \u2014 probably around $50 a barrel \u2014 with its limits on output and exports over the last four years. But now the United States, by the sheer force of its production, the supremacy of its technology, and an unmatched pipeline, refinery and storage structure, has put a ceiling to the price.Experts note that when oil climbs to $60 a barrel and higher, as it has lately, a drilling rush commences \u2014 the national rig count has climbed by over a third in the last year \u2014 promising to refill domestic and even global energy inventories. Only a major war or other disruption is likely to send prices soaring.\u201cWe have all suffered these depressed prices over the last two years and we are excited to see the new prices and we will respond accordingly,\u201d said Harald Jordan, vice president for engineering at Peak Energy, a Colorado-based producer. \u201cYou will see rig activity continue to increase.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At G.E., $6.2 Billion Charge for Finance Unit Hurts C.E.O.\u2019s Turnaround Push", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Electric delivered another disappointing surprise to investors on Tuesday, taking a $6.2 billion charge to pay for lingering problems in its finance unit.The announcement was a setback for a turnaround campaign being led by John Flannery, who took over as G.E.\u2019s chief executive in August and quickly discovered that the woes of the company\u2019s big power-generation business were far worse than had been previously known.In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Flannery emphasized that his main focus was bolstering the strength and performance of G.E.\u2019s three main businesses: power generation, aviation and health care. He has previously said the company would sell at least $20 billion in assets over the next two years, with lighting and railway-locomotive businesses going on the block.Beyond that, Mr. Flannery reiterated his commitment that \u201call options are on the table\u201d and that there were \u201cno sacred cows.\u201d He did not specifically mention the possibility of a wholesale breakup of the company, as some investors and analysts have urged.As for the $6.2 billion fourth-quarter write-off, G.E. said it was making the move after conducting a review of the insurance portfolio that is part of GE Capital, the finance arm.Under Mr. Flannery\u2019s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the industrial giant drastically cut back GE Capital after the financial crisis began in 2008. The unit has now largely been pared back to its original purpose: financing for G.E. customers to buy the company\u2019s jet engines, power turbines, medical-imaging machines and other industrial equipment.Only a few nonindustrial finance businesses remain within GE Capital. The newly disclosed trouble surfaced in one of those, a reinsurance unit, North American Life and Health, mainly because of the higher-than-expected cost of reinsuring long-term care policies sold by other insurers.After examining the trend in claims tied to such policies, G.E., working with the reinsurer\u2019s primary regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department, decided it needed to substantially increase its reserves for future payouts. Many of the policyholders are now 80 and older, an age when claims rise substantially.G.E. has agreed to add $15 billion to reserves for the business over the next seven years.\u201cThis is deeply disappointing,\u201d Mr. Flannery said in the conference call. He added that the anticipated costs were manageable, would be \u201ccontained within GE Capital\u201d and would have no effect on investment in the company\u2019s industrial businesses.Still, G.E. said, GE Capital would suspend dividend payments to the parent company for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d To conserve cash, Mr. Flannery cut G.E.\u2019s dividend last year, only the second time since the Depression that had happened.Mr. Flannery did say on Tuesday that G.E. would explore different potential ownership structures for the remaining units, as it did with its oil-field equipment business last year. In July, the company completed a merger of its oil and gas division with Baker Hughes into a separate company in which G.E. holds a 62.5 percent stake.\u201cOur results, over the past several years, including 2017, and the insurance charge only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape G.E.,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.The scope of the insurance problem, and its seemingly sudden emergence, were reflected in sharp questions from analysts about the performance of G.E.\u2019s outside auditor, KPMG, and possible lapses by G.E. managers.G.E. said it had used two outside auditors to assess the insurance obligations, and Jamie Miller, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that the G.E. board reviewed the selection of the company\u2019s auditor every year.The circumstances surrounding the insurance problem echoed those that cropped up in the company\u2019s power-generation business last year. Problems in long-term-care insurance are not startling, as the population ages and claims pile up. Similarly, a slowdown in demand for gas turbines was to be expected, with energy efficiency improving and utilities steadily switching to renewable sources of electricity.In both cases, it was the magnitude and suddenness of the problems that unsettled investors and, apparently, Mr. Flannery himself. Questioned by analysts, he said, \u201cI share your surprise and disappointment of this coming out of a legacy business.\u201dThe problems at G.E. were brewing well before Mr. Flannery took over, and analysts said he had moved swiftly to take corrective action. But the two announcements of deeper-than-anticipated troubles, they said, added to the uncertainty surrounding the company.\u201cThe good news is that Flannery seems to have cleared the deck,\u201d said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm. \u201cThe bad news is how do you trust anything now?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of the charge that General Electric plans to take in the fourth quarter of 2017. As the article\u2019s headline correctly noted, it is $6.2 billion, not $6.2 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Open Seat in Westchester May Hold Key to Democratic Unity", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt would seem unlikely that a single state legislative seat in Westchester County could hold the key to Democrats scoring a government trifecta in Albany, an alignment in which one party controls the governorship, as well as both houses of the Legislature.But some political experts say the 37th Senate District may be that pivotal.Now, Mr. Latimer\u2019s former Senate seat is up for grabs, and the special election to replace him has once again assumed heightened implications.While the Assembly has an overwhelming Democratic majority, the Senate is controlled by Republicans, thanks to a power-sharing arrangement between Republicans and several Democrats.The Bronx seat should be a slam dunk for Democrats, but political pundits say the Westchester seat \u2014 long held by Democrats \u2014 is less certain: In 2012, Senate Republicans redrew the district map. Doug Colety, chairman of the Westchester Republican County Committee, said: \u201cThe district is much better for Republicans than it was in the past.\u201dDemocrats have a different view. \u201cIt\u2019s a marvel of modern technology how gerrymandered you can make the New York Senate map,\u201d said Evan Stavisky, a partner in the Parkside Group, a political consulting firm that represents the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee.So far, three candidates have stepped forward to run for the Westchester Senate seat, which covers diverse cities like Yonkers to the south, affluent suburbs like Larchmont and more rural towns like Bedford.The county\u2019s Republican Party, meanwhile, has yet to name a candidate. Mr. Colety said that he hoped to nominate someone in early February. Neither of the two declared Republicans \u2014 Daniel Schorr and Sarmad Khojasteh \u2014 have held office, a fact that Ms. Mayer, 64, seized on. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the world of Albany, and I say it in a positive way because I know how to get things done,\u201d she said.A longtime resident of White Plains, Mr. Schorr, 44, said his experience would help him ferret out corruption in Albany. \u201cI think our state is greatly overtaxed and corruption is part of that,\u201d said Mr. Schorr, a graduate of Harvard Law School. \u201cEvery month for the next six months, there is a major corruption trial occurring in New York State.\u201dAmong his ideas are 529-style savings plans for small businesses, and tax breaks for investors who finance start-ups. \u201cIf there is a dishwasher or mechanic or carpenter who wants to be a first-time small business owner,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can promote policies to allow them to become the restaurateur, the body shop owner, the contractor.\u201dWere Ms. Mayer to prevail in a special election, there are a number of potential complications with the plan for Democratic reunification; there is a provision, for example, that allows each side to approve the other\u2019s deputies.And even if the two Democratic factions successfully merged, it would technically still leave the party shy of a 32-seat majority, because of Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat. He is not part of the Independent Democratic Conference, but has nonetheless caucused with Republicans since his election in 2012, saying it favors his constituents.After the deal was announced last fall, Mr. Felder said he could be persuaded to join Democrats, or stay with Republicans, if either side embraces a plan to put armed guards at every New York City school.Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate seem unlikely to cede control without a struggle. Last fall they suggested that they could retain power through 2018, citing rules they say would prevent a change in leadership without a 38-seat majority.Mike Murphy, a spokesman for Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the mainline Democratic coalition, scoffed at the notion. \u201cThe chamber is made up of 63 members and clearly 32 members is a majority,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope that the Republicans would not subvert democracy by denying the fundamental principle of majority rule.\u201dAdvertisement"}
