{"Headline": "Can an Algorithm Tell When Kids Are in Danger?", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "FeatureChild protective agencies are haunted when they fail to save kids. Pittsburgh officials believe a new data analysis program is helping them make better judgment calls.Supported byAccording to the case records, Byrne searched the department\u2019s computer database for the family, finding allegations dating back to 2008: parental substance abuse, inadequate hygiene, domestic violence, inadequate provision of food and physical care, medical neglect and sexual abuse by an uncle involving one of the girl\u2019s two older siblings. But none of those allegations had been substantiated. And while the current claim, of a man dying of an overdose in the child\u2019s home, was shocking, it fell short of the minimal legal requirement for sending out a caseworker to knock on the family\u2019s door and open an investigation.Before closing the file, Byrne had to estimate the risk to the child\u2019s future well-being. Screeners like him hear far more alarming stories of children in peril nearly every day. He keyed into the computer: \u201cLow risk.\u201d In the box where he had to select the likely threat to the children\u2019s immediate safety, he chose \u201cNo safety threat.\u201dHad the decision been left solely to Byrne \u2014 as these decisions are left to screeners and their supervisors in jurisdictions around the world \u2014 that might have been the end of it. He would have, in industry parlance, screened the call out. That\u2019s what happens to around half of the 14,000 or so allegations received each year in Allegheny County \u2014 reports that might involve charges of serious physical harm to the child, but can also include just about anything that a disgruntled landlord, noncustodial parent or nagging neighbor decides to call about. Nationally, 42 percent of the four million allegations received in 2015, involving 7.2 million children, were screened out, often based on sound legal reasoning but also because of judgment calls, opinions, biases and beliefs. And yet more United States children died in 2015 as a result of abuse and neglect \u2014 1,670, according to the federal Administration for Children and Families; or twice that many, according to leaders in the field \u2014 than died of cancer.This time, however, the decision to screen out or in was not Byrne\u2019s alone. In August 2016, Allegheny County became the first jurisdiction in the United States, or anywhere else, to let a predictive-analytics algorithm \u2014 the same kind of sophisticated pattern analysis used in credit reports, the automated buying and selling of stocks and the hiring, firing and fielding of baseball players on World Series-winning teams \u2014 offer up a second opinion on every incoming call, in hopes of doing a better job of identifying the families most in need of intervention. And so Byrne\u2019s final step in assessing the call was to click on the icon of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool.After a few seconds, his screen displayed a vertical color bar, running from a green 1 (lowest risk) at the bottom to a red 20 (highest risk) on top. The assessment was based on a statistical analysis of four years of prior calls, using well over 100 criteria maintained in eight databases for jails, psychiatric services, public-welfare benefits, drug and alcohol treatment centers and more. For the 3-year-old\u2019s family, the score came back as 19 out of a possible 20.Over the course of an 18-month investigation, officials in the county\u2019s Office of Children, Youth and Families (C.Y.F.) offered me extraordinary access to their files and procedures, on the condition that I not identify the families involved. Exactly what in this family\u2019s background led the screening tool to score it in the top 5 percent of risk for future abuse and neglect cannot be known for certain. But a close inspection of the files revealed that the mother was attending a drug-treatment center for addiction to opiates; that she had a history of arrest and jail on drug-possession charges; that the three fathers of the little girl and her two older siblings had significant drug or criminal histories, including allegations of violence; that one of the older siblings had a lifelong physical disability; and that the two younger children had received diagnoses of developmental or mental-health issues.Finding all that information about the mother, her three children and their three fathers in the county\u2019s maze of databases would have taken Byrne hours he did not have; call screeners are expected to render a decision on whether or not to open an investigation within an hour at most, and usually in half that time. Even then, he would have had no way of knowing which factors, or combinations of factors, are most predictive of future bad outcomes. The algorithm, however, searched the files and rendered its score in seconds. And so now, despite Byrne\u2019s initial skepticism, the high score prompted him and his supervisor to screen the case in, marking it for further investigation. Within 24 hours, a C.Y.F. caseworker would have to \u201cput eyes on\u201d the children, meet the mother and see what a score of 19 looks like in flesh and blood.Vaithianathan, who is in her early 50s, emigrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand as a child; Putnam-Hornstein, a decade younger, has lived in California for years. Both share an enthusiasm for the prospect of using public databases for the public good. Three years ago, the two were asked to investigate how predictive analytics could improve Allegheny County\u2019s handling of maltreatment allegations, and they eventually found themselves focused on the call-screening process. They were brought in following a series of tragedies in which children died after their family had been screened out \u2014 the nightmare of every child-welfare agency.One of the worst failures occurred on June 30, 2011, when firefighters were called to a blaze coming from a third-floor apartment on East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. When firefighters broke down the locked door, the body of 7-year-old KiDonn Pollard-Ford was found under a pile of clothes in his bedroom, where he had apparently sought shelter from the smoke. KiDonn\u2019s 4-year-old brother, KrisDon Williams-Pollard, was under a bed, not breathing. He was resuscitated outside, but died two days later in the hospital.The children, it turned out, had been left alone by their mother, Kiaira Pollard, 27, when she went to work that night as an exotic dancer. She was said by neighbors to be an adoring mother of her two kids; the older boy was getting good grades in school. For C.Y.F., the bitterest part of the tragedy was that the department had received numerous calls about the family but had screened them all out as unworthy of a full investigation.Incompetence on the part of the screeners? No, says Vaithianathan, who spent months with Putnam-Hornstein burrowing through the county\u2019s databases to build their algorithm, based on all 76,964 allegations of maltreatment made between April 2010 and April 2014. \u201cWhat the screeners have is a lot of data,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s quite difficult to navigate and know which factors are most important. Within a single call to C.Y.F., you might have two children, an alleged perpetrator, you\u2019ll have Mom, you might have another adult in the household \u2014 all these people will have histories in the system that the person screening the call can go investigate. But the human brain is not that deft at harnessing and making sense of all that data.\u201dShe and Putnam-Hornstein linked many dozens of data points \u2014 just about everything known to the county about each family before an allegation arrived \u2014 to predict how the children would fare afterward. What they found was startling and disturbing: 48 percent of the lowest-risk families were being screened in, while 27 percent of the highest-risk families were being screened out. Of the 18 calls to C.Y.F. between 2010 and 2014 in which a child was later killed or gravely injured as a result of parental maltreatment, eight cases, or 44 percent, had been screened out as not worth investigation.According to Rachel Berger, a pediatrician who directs the child-abuse research center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh and who led research for the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, the problem is not one of finding a needle in a haystack but of finding the right needle in a pile of needles. \u201cAll of these children are living in chaos,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow does C.Y.F. pick out which ones are most in danger when they all have risk factors? You can\u2019t believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into child-protection decisions. That\u2019s why I love predictive analytics. It\u2019s finally bringing some objectivity and science to decisions that can be so unbelievably life-changing.\u201dThe home, Lankes found when she returned, had little furniture and no beds, though the 20-something mother insisted that she was in the process of securing those and that the children slept at relatives\u2019 homes. All the appliances worked. There was food in the refrigerator. The mother\u2019s disposition was hyper and erratic, but she insisted that she was clean of drugs and attending a treatment center. All three children denied having any worries about how their mother cared for them. Lankes would still need to confirm the mother\u2019s story with her treatment center, but for the time being, it looked as though the algorithm had struck out.Charges of faulty forecasts have accompanied the emergence of predictive analytics into public policy. And when it comes to criminal justice, where analytics are now entrenched as a tool for judges and parole boards, even larger complaints have arisen about the secrecy surrounding the workings of the algorithms themselves \u2014 most of which are developed, marketed and closely guarded by private firms. That\u2019s a chief objection lodged against two Florida companies: Eckerd Connects, a nonprofit, and its for-profit partner, MindShare Technology. Their predictive-analytics package, called Rapid Safety Feedback, is now being used, the companies say, by child-welfare agencies in Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Early last month, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services announced that it would stop using the program, for which it had already been billed $366,000 \u2014 in part because Eckerd and MindShare refused to reveal details about what goes into their formula, even after the deaths of children whose cases had not been flagged as high risk.The Allegheny Family Screening Tool developed by Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein is different: It is owned by the county. Its workings are public. Its criteria are described in academic publications and picked apart by local officials. At public meetings held in downtown Pittsburgh before the system\u2019s adoption, lawyers, child advocates, parents and even former foster children asked hard questions not only of the academics but also of the county administrators who invited them.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this the right way, to be transparent about it and talk to the community about these changes,\u201d said Erin Dalton, a deputy director of the county\u2019s department of human services and leader of its data-analysis department. She and others involved with the Allegheny program said they have grave worries about companies selling private algorithms to public agencies. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning,\u201d Dalton told me, \u201cbecause public welfare leaders who are trying to preserve their jobs can easily be sold a bill of goods. They don\u2019t have a lot of sophistication to evaluate these products.\u201dAnother criticism of such algorithms takes aim at the idea of forecasting future behavior. Decisions on which families to investigate, the argument goes, should be based solely on the allegations made, not on predictions for what might happen in the future. During a 2016 White House panel on foster care, Gladys Carri\u00f3n, then the commissioner of New York City\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services, expressed worries about the use of predictive analytics by child-protection agencies. \u201cIt scares the hell out of me,\u201d she said \u2014 especially the potential impact on people\u2019s civil liberties. \u201cI am concerned about widening the net under the guise that we are going to help them.\u201dBut in Pittsburgh, the advocates for parents, children and civil rights whom I spoke with all applauded how carefully C.Y.F. has implemented the program. Even the A.C.L.U. of Pennsylvania offered cautious praise. \u201cI think they\u2019re putting important checks on the process,\u201d said Sara Rose, a Pittsburgh lawyer with the organization. \u201cThey\u2019re using it only for screeners, to decide which calls to investigate, not to remove a child. Having someone come to your home to investigate is intrusive, but it\u2019s not at a level of taking a child away or forcing a family to take services.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum,\u201d Dalton says. \u201cAll of the data on which the algorithm is based is biased. Black children are, relatively speaking, over-surveilled in our systems, and white children are under-surveilled. Who we investigate is not a function of who abuses. It\u2019s a function of who gets reported.\u201dIn 2015, black children accounted for 38 percent of all calls to Allegheny County\u2019s maltreatment hotline, double the rate that would be expected based on their population. Their rate of being placed outside their home because of maltreatment was even more disproportionate: eight out of every 1,000 black children residing in the county were placed outside their home that year, compared with just 1.7 of every 1,000 white children.Studies by Brett Drake, a professor in the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, have attributed the disproportionate number of black families investigated by child-welfare agencies across the United States not to bias, but to their higher rates of poverty. Similarly, a 2013 study by Putnam-Hornstein and others found that black children in California were more than twice as likely as white children there to be the subject of maltreatment allegations and placed in foster care. But after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, she showed that poor black children were actually less likely than their poor white counterparts to be the subject of an abuse allegation or to end up in foster care.Poverty, all close observers of child welfare agree, is the one nearly universal attribute of families caught up in the system. As I rode around with caseworkers on their visits and sat in on family-court hearings, I saw at least as many white parents as black \u2014 but they were all poor, living in the county\u2019s roughest neighborhoods. Poorer people are more likely not only to be involved in the criminal-justice system but also to be on public assistance and to get their mental-health or addiction treatment at publicly funded clinics \u2014 all sources of the data vacuumed up by Vaithianathan\u2019s and Putnam-Hornstein\u2019s predictive-analytics algorithm.\u201cWe know there are racially biased decisions made,\u201d says Walter Smith Jr., a deputy director of C.Y.F., who is black. \u201cThere are all kinds of biases. If I\u2019m a screener and I grew up in an alcoholic family, I might weigh a parent using alcohol more heavily. If I had a parent who was violent, I might care more about that. What predictive analytics provides is an opportunity to more uniformly and evenly look at all those variables.\u201dFinally, on the morning of Feb. 2, Lankes called a seventh time. The mother, she learned, had failed her three latest drug tests, with traces of both cocaine and opiates found in her urine. Lankes and her supervisor, Liz Reiter, then sat down with Reiter\u2019s boss and a team of other supervisors and caseworkers.\u201cIt is never an easy decision to remove kids from home, even when we know it is in their best interest,\u201d Reiter told me. But, she said, \u201cWhen we see that someone is using multiple substances, we need to assure the children\u2019s safety. If we can\u2019t get into the home, that makes us worry that things aren\u2019t as they should be. It\u2019s a red flag.\u201d The team decided to request an Emergency Custody Authorization from a family-court judge. By late afternoon, with authorization in hand, they headed over to the family\u2019s home, where a police officer met them.The oldest child answered their knock. The mother wasn\u2019t home, but all three children were, along with the mother\u2019s elderly grandfather. Lankes called the mother, who answered for the first time in two months and began yelling about what she considered an unwarranted intrusion into her home. But she gave Lankes the names of family members who could take the children for the time being. Clothing was gathered, bags packed and winter jackets put on. Then it was time for the children to get in the car with Lankes, a virtual stranger empowered by the government to take them from their mother\u2019s care.At a hearing the next day, the presiding official ordered the mother to get clean before she could have her children returned. The drug-treatment center she had been attending advised her to enter rehab, but she refused. \u201cWe can\u2019t get in touch with her very often,\u201d Reiter recently told me. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear she\u2019s not in a good place. The two youngest kids are actually with their dads now. Both of them are doing really, really well.\u201d Their older brother, age 13, is living with his great-grandfather.In December, 16 months after the Allegheny Family Screening Tool was first used, Cherna\u2019s team shared preliminary data with me on how the predictive-analytics program was affecting screening decisions. So far, they had found that black and white families were being treated more consistently, based on their risk scores, than they were before the program\u2019s introduction. And the percentage of low-risk cases being recommended for investigation had dropped \u2014 from nearly half, in the years before the program began, to around one-third. That meant caseworkers were spending less time investigating well-functioning families, who in turn were not being hassled by an intrusive government agency. At the same time, high-risk calls were being screened in more often. Not by much \u2014 just a few percentage points. But in the world of child welfare, that represented progress.To be certain that those results would stand up to scrutiny, Cherna brought in a Stanford University health-policy researcher named Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert to independently assess the program. \u201cMy preliminary analysis to date is showing that the tool appears to be having the effects it\u2019s intended to have,\u201d Goldhaber-Fiebert says. In particular, he told me, the kids who were screened in were more likely to be found in need of services, \u201cso they appear to be screening in the kids who are at real risk.\u201dHaving demonstrated in its first year of operation that more high-risk cases are now being flagged for investigation, Allegheny\u2019s Family Screening Tool is drawing interest from child-protection agencies around the country. Douglas County, Colo., midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, is working with Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein to implement a predictive-analytics program there, while the California Department of Social Services has commissioned them to conduct a preliminary analysis for the entire state.\u201cGiven the early results from Pittsburgh, predictive analytics looks like one of the most exciting innovations in child protection in the last 20 years,\u201d says Drake, the Washington University researcher. As an author of a recent study showing that one in three United States children is the subject of a child-welfare investigation by age 18, he believes agencies must do everything possible to sharpen their focus.Even in Illinois, where B.J. Walker, the director of the state\u2019s Department of Children and Family Services, is terminating its contract with the companies that developed Rapid Safety Feedback, predictive analytics is not dead. \u201cI still believe it\u2019s a good tool to make better informed decisions,\u201d Walker told me in December. Walker knows Cherna and Dalton and saw the long process they went through to develop the Family Screening Tool. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a careful job,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir transparency has been laudable. And transparency isn\u2019t often your friend, because you\u2019re going to make some mistakes, you\u2019re going to stumble, you\u2019re going to make changes.\u201dCherna and Dalton are already overseeing a retooling of Allegheny County\u2019s algorithm. So far, they have raised the program\u2019s accuracy at predicting bad outcomes to more than 90 percent from around 78 percent. Moreover, the call screeners and their supervisors will now be given less discretion to override the tool\u2019s recommendations \u2014 to screen in the lowest-risk cases and screen out the highest-risk cases, based on their professional judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change the mind-set of the screeners,\u201d Dalton told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong, dug-in culture. They want to focus on the immediate allegation, not the child\u2019s future risk a year or two down the line. They call it clinical decision-making. I call it someone\u2019s opinion. Getting them to trust that a score on a computer screen is telling them something real is a process.\u201dDan Hurley is a science journalist and longtime contributor to the magazine.

And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Dow 25,000, the Party Has to End. But When?", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIn the midst of a long-running bull market that is now reaching momentous proportions, most investors may well have forgotten that just two years ago, during the first five trading days of 2016, the market dropped 6 percent. It was the worst five-day start to a year ever and supposedly a harbinger of bad times.We know where that ended. Spurred by Donald Trump\u2019s election that November, market indexes surged to record levels and went far higher this year. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 19 percent in 2017, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite leapt 28 percent.There wasn\u2019t a single day last year when the S.&P. 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent, a level of low volatility unseen since the mid-1960s, according to James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research.In a rare convergence, investor euphoria spread across the globe. A measure of market performance, the MSCI All Country World Index, gained 22.7 percent last year, closing at a record high. And so far this year, stocks have continued their advance. On Thursday, the Dow broke the 25,000 barrier for the first time, and technology stocks are soaring to new highs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are adding a whiff of bubblelike mania.And that may not be such good news for investors.\u201cIf there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cA correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt. And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean the end is imminent, according to Mr. Stack and other investment managers and market experts I interviewed this week. All of them successfully navigated markets last year, when the greatest risk was being underinvested.\u201cEverybody thinks the market is overvalued,\u201d said Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and president of Parnassus Investments. \u201cSo do I. I\u2019m expecting a correction, but I was expecting one after Trump was elected. I was wrong. The market can keep going up even when it\u2019s overvalued.\u201dMr. Dodson didn\u2019t move into cash last year, and his Parnassus Endeavor Fund, where he\u2019s the portfolio manager, gained nearly 20 percent last year and is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over three-, five- and 10-year periods.President Trump has routinely celebrated, and taken credit for, the stock market\u2019s record-setting climb during his first year in office.\u201cMost seasoned investors realize this market is overvalued and overbought and it\u2019s been a long time since a normal correction,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cThey\u2019re nervous.\u201d Nonetheless, he said he was 82 percent invested in stocks, with 18 percent in cash, only slightly more than usual. He said he had learned from decades of market experience that \u201covervaluation isn\u2019t what causes bear markets \u2014 it never has and never will.\u201dIn addition, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be tremendous political pressure to keep the party going,\u201d especially since Mr. Trump has so often cited the bull market as evidence of the success of his presidency.So what should investors do?It\u2019s probably no surprise that Burton G. Malkiel, the renowned emeritus professor of economics at Princeton and author of the 1973 classic \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing,\u201d recommends that investors \u201cstay the course.\u201d\u201cIf the sharp rise in the stock market in 2017 has unbalanced your portfolio with a higher proportion of equities than is consistent with your risk tolerance, then you could do some rebalancing by trimming the equities down to the proportion at which you are comfortable,\u201d Mr. Malkiel said. \u201cBut do not try to time the market. Nobody can consistently time the market, and those who try it usually fail.\u201dMr. Dodson is an active manager who focuses on stock selection. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a good record at market timing,\u201d he said. \u201cI look for stocks that are undervalued, but I\u2019m having terrible trouble finding anything that\u2019s reasonably priced.\u201dTechnology stocks in general \u201care way overvalued,\u201d he said. He has cut back on his fund\u2019s large positions in Micron Technologies, Apple and Applied Materials after they notched big gains. With benefit of hindsight, he wouldn\u2019t have sold them, \u201cbut someone once asked Bernard Baruch how he became so rich,\u201d Mr. Dodson said. \u201c\u2018I made my money by selling too soon,\u2019\u201d the famed financier replied.Still, there are \u201ca few\u201d undervalued opportunities, Mr. Dodson said. He cited the health care sector: The biotech concern Gilead Sciences and the generic-drug maker Perrigo are two of his fund\u2019s largest holdings. The toymaker Mattel \u201cis on the bargain table,\u201d he said. And even in technology, his fund has a large position in Qualcomm, currently fighting a takeover bid by the rival chip-maker Broadcom.If so much is indeed overvalued, then this year\u2019s market could well reward discerning active managers. \u201cI worry about the index funds,\u201d Mr. Dodson said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting close to 25 percent in technology, given the high valuations and market caps. If there\u2019s a reversal, it\u2019s going to hit the index funds hard. This may finally be the year that active managers outperform.\u201dMr. Stack agreed. \u201cActive management isn\u2019t about beating the market but about achieving market gains within a defined acceptance of risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are selective opportunities, but you have to dig to find them. None are true bargains anymore.\u201dHe recently bought shares in the diversified industrial manufacturer Ingersoll Rand and is moving his portfolio toward more defensive positions in consumer staples, energy and materials. \u201cI\u2019d rather be early with portfolio defenses and leave some profits on the table than go into a bear market fully exposed,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack said that in examining bull markets over the past 50 years, he had found that both the technology and energy sectors outperformed in the late stages of a bull market. He said investors \u201cshould have some portion of their portfolio in the materials sector, notably energy, which had been so out of favor\u201d until mid-2017.\u201cFrom a total-return perspective, it\u2019s quite compelling to be invested in commodities,\u201d he said \u2014 even though he doesn\u2019t see oil prices rising much above current levels by year\u2019s end. That\u2019s because, thanks to the shale oil revolution, producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can easily ramp up production when prices are $60 to $65. But commodities investors can still make a profit, he said, by betting on stable to rising prices in the futures market.Like Mr. Stack, Mr. Courvalin noted that commodities and energy typically do well in the late stages of an economic expansion. Non-energy commodities may do even better, since they have no equivalent to shale and mining companies can\u2019t increase production quickly in response to rising prices. In the mining sector, \u201cmargins are improving, orders are picking up, and we\u2019re seeing new investment,\u201d he said.It may seem a paradox that investors\u2019 worries about the coming year are mounting even as the economic outlook seems so bright. \u201cInvestors are struggling with this market because the skies are blue,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cIt\u2019s rare when you have an investing climate like this one, where it\u2019s all but impossible to find something to worry about, either domestically or globally.\u201dBut that\u2019s true in the late stages of most bull markets, he said, meaning investors need to be alert. And while virtually no one can foresee the next catalyst for a correction or bear market, even a hint that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more than expected would most likely set off seismic tremors.\u201cMost bull markets die by the sword of the Fed,\u201d Mr. Stack said.Advertisement"}

He crowed about it during a pep rally for anti-abortion marchers in the Rose Garden. He even slipped it into his Thanksgiving Day greeting to American troops serving abroad.No president has taken more delight, or claimed more credit, for the roaring stock market than Donald J. Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average has become for him what the Rasmussen Poll was during the 2016 presidential election: a daily source of validation.\u201cHad the other side gotten in, the market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of women at the White House last week, diplomatically avoiding the name Hillary Clinton. \u201cRemember that.\u201dNow, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation with Wall Street is colliding with one of his most cherished legislative projects \u2014 a more protectionist trade policy \u2014 and it is not clear which one will win.Mr. Trump, for example, has repeatedly threatened to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Korea Free Trade Agreement. But two top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have warned him that withdrawing from those deals would hurt the stock market, several officials said.Tellingly, those threats have receded. On Wednesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, expressed optimism that the United States would be able to renegotiate the deal with Canada and Mexico.The president himself is scheduled to speak in Davos on Friday, and Mr. Cohn promised that his message would reassure the market makers who flock there every January. \u201cAmerica first is not America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we grow, the world grows; when the world grows, we grow. We\u2019re part of it, and we\u2019re part of a world economy.\u201dAnd yet other people briefed by the White House said they expected Mr. Trump to use the occasion to deliver a defiantly nationalist speech. While Mr. Ross was conciliatory about Nafta, he also said that \u201cU.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts\u201d to wage other potential trade wars, including with China. Those remarks briefly rattled markets.Presidents have generally avoided talking about the stock market \u2014 for good reasons. Their words have the power to move markets, and not always in the direction they want. Moreover, if they claim credit for a bull market, they find it harder to evade blame for a bear market.In March 2009, President Barack Obama made a foray into market analysis during an appearance with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. The stock market, he said, is \u201csort of like a tracking poll in politics.\u201d\u201cIt bobs up and down day to day, and if you spend all your time worrying about that, then you\u2019re probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong,\u201d he said.At the same time, he observed, stocks had fallen so far after the financial crisis that their price-to-earnings ratios were nearing their bottom. Given that, and the government\u2019s enormous fiscal stimulus program, Mr. Obama said it might be a good time to get back into the market.\u201cHe got substantial blowback for those comments and was advised \u2014 and took the advice \u2014 not to prognosticate on the market again,\u201d said Jason Furman, who was one of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic advisers.For all the mocking he got, Mr. Furman noted that Mr. Obama was right. The stock market bottomed out six days after his remarks and had bounced back 21 percent a month later. Mr. Obama mentioned the market several other times during his presidency, but Mr. Furman said he stayed away from commenting on day-to-day gyrations.President Bill Clinton also presided over a bubbly stock market but resisted the urge to gloat about it. Former aides said he was repeatedly invited to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to open trading, but they always told him to decline. That reluctance proved wise when the bubble in technology stocks began bursting almost a year before Mr. Clinton left office.\u201cWe had a view that markets could go up, markets could go down, markets could be overvalued, markets could be undervalued,\u201d said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton. \u201cBut it would take your eye off the ball to focus on that rather than on the real economy.\u201dNot that these presidents or their aides are shy about their contributions to the market: Mr. Sperling said Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1993 budget plan, and the ensuing decline in long-term interest rates, helped power the bull market of the 1990s. Even with the bursting of the tech bubble, he said, investors were way ahead at the end of the Clinton years.But all of them, said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, were mindful that what goes up can come down. Mr. Dallek, who recently published a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt, noted that Roosevelt rarely talked about the stock market, which rose steadily during his presidency until 1937, when the Federal Reserve abruptly tightened the money supply \u2014 one of the factors that plunged the United States into recession.\u201cAll these presidents have paid attention to the stock market,\u201d Mr. Dallek said. \u201cBut he finds it irresistible, if finds any sign of strength in his administration, that he is going to seize on that and publicize it.\u201dNo president has tied his fortunes so directly to the market as has Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re setting a record literally all the time,\u201d he said last week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, we have a long way to go.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average closed 104 points higher that day.Advertisement"}

He would give seminars at whiskey festivals and be lucky if a few dozen people showed up.\u201cI was very much a voice in the wilderness,\u201d he said during a recent visit to New York.\u201cAt an event in Ottawa, 169 people bought tickets for one of my talks,\u201d he said.The sudden popularity of all kinds of whiskey on both sides of the Canadian-American border is driving a rapid expansion among Canadian distillers. Mr. de Kergommeaux\u2019s first edition covered just nine distilleries \u2014 eight large, traditional operations, and one craft start-up. The new edition includes 40 more, all of them newly opened, with many more on the way.In both countries, the figures signal a clear tilt in favor of more expensive, and more innovative, brands. \u201cA lot more consumers are taking Canadian whisky seriously,\u201d Mr. de Kergommeaux said. \u201cThey taste it and recognize the care that goes into it.\u201d\u201cCanadian whisky\u201d is both a simple geographic identity \u2014 it\u2019s whiskey, made in Canada \u2014 and a specific, somewhat complicated style. While some new distilleries, like Eau Claire, make Scotch-style single malt as part of their lineups, all the large distilleries, and most of the start-ups, focus on Canadian-style whisky.Like bourbon and most American ryes, Canadian whisky is typically made from a combination of different grains. But while the grains in bourbon and rye are mashed together first, then distilled and aged, in Canada each grain is processed separately, then blended together at the end.A celebration of Canadian cuisine, from its indigenous chefs to its famous butter tarts and Caesars.And while most American whiskey must by law be aged in charred, new oak barrels, no such restrictions exist in Canada. Distillers there can work with any grain (though rye predominates), and they can age it in any kind of barrel \u2014 new, used or one that held another beverage, like rum or wine.The result is a spectrum of flavors for blenders to work with. \u201cPut these variables together, and there are literally thousands of different points we can hit in terms of flavor,\u201d said Rick Murphy, who oversees production for Alberta Distillers, one of Canada\u2019s largest.That freedom, however, presents a problem in the United States, where 69 percent of Canadian whisky is sold, according to Spirits Canada. American law requires that Canadian whisky be labeled \u201cblended\u201d \u2014 which, in the United States, usually means a whiskey that combines a small amount of strong whiskey with mostly neutral grain spirits, creating a cheap, nearly flavorless drink.As a result, many Americans assume that Canadian whisky is boring and poorly made, a misconception that the industry\u2019s leaders are only now pushing back against.\u201cI think we\u2019ve been apologizing for it too long, and haven\u2019t gone out to tell our story,\u201d said Don Livermore, the master blender at the Hiram Walker & Sons distillery in Windsor, Ontario. \u201cCanadians have been doing themselves a disservice for 80 years.\u201dCanadian whisky has done well in America; Crown Royal, made by Diageo at a plant in Manitoba, is the second-best-selling whiskey in the United States, behind Jack Daniel\u2019s.Still, for decades Canadian whisky has been stereotyped the same way Canada has been: as unassuming, a bit bland and averse to change. But these days the country is challenging those preconceptions, celebrating its diversity, its youthful spirit and its embrace of innovation. The same is happening with its whisky.Distilleries are sending their master blenders around the world to promote their product, and inviting tourists into their plants with new visitor centers. And they are creating flavorful and exciting new expressions: peppery whiskys made with 100 percent rye grain, like Lot 40; whiskys finished in port or rum barrels, like Pike Creek; and weird but delicious blends like Alberta Dark Batch, which combines 6- and 12-year-old Canadian rye with bourbon and sherry.\u201cPeople are looking for heavier, bolder styles of whiskey,\u201d Mr. Livermore said. \u201cI grew up on meat and potatoes, my kids are growing up on sushi. What I like about Canadian whisky is that we can adapt easily to changing tastes.\u201dThough he is probably too modest to claim credit, Mr. de Kergommeaux is part of Canadian whisky\u2019s success story. His book quickly became required reading for whiskey fans, and he became both prophet and proselytizer for the spirit\u2019s resurgence at seminars and festivals around the world.The rye grain in Northern Harvest, Mr. Murray wrote, was \u201cnot just turning up to charm and enthrall but to also take us through a routine which reaches new heights of beauty and complexity. To say this is a masterpiece is barely doing it justice.\u201dCanadians celebrated the news as if they had just won the World Cup. Within days, stocks of Northern Harvest in Canada and the United States disappeared.\u201cWhen Murray\u2019s award was announced, I got a call from someone at Canadian Club who said, \u2018We won,\u2019\u201d Mr. de Kergommeaux recalled. \u201cI said, Crown Royal won, not his brand. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018Canada won.\u2019\u201dThe price for the world\u2019s best whiskey? $35. Which is another thing Canadian has going for it. Prices for single-malt Scotch, Japanese whiskey and even bourbon have skyrocketed in the last decade, putting luxury bottles out of most drinkers\u2019 reach. A bottle of 40-year-old single-malt Scotch from the Balvenie costs $4,000. A bottle of 40-year-old Canadian Club, in contrast, costs $200 (though you\u2019ll have to go to Canada to get it; it is not yet available outside the country).\u201cThe way Canadian is blended opens up flavor possibilities, so you can choose specific whiskys for different cocktails,\u201d said Ray Daniel, Char No. 5\u2019s head bartender. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fairly modestly priced, so you don\u2019t have to take a risk.\u201dWhat really excites Mr. Daniel \u2014 and anyone who\u2019s betting on Canadian whisky \u2014 is the type of customer ordering his drinks. When Char No. 5 opened in 2014, business travelers from Europe and the United States would sidle up to the bar, and their eyes would skip right over Char No. 5\u2019s lengthy list of Canadian whiskey, in search of Scotch or bourbon.No longer. \u201cAmerican guests in particular are very open to trying new things,\u201d Mr. Daniel said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for Jack and Coke anymore.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Eau Claire Distillery.

{"Headline": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Team Up to Try to Disrupt Health Care", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Three corporate behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation\u2019s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.It was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees\u2019 existing health coverage \u2014 whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses.But Tuesday\u2019s announcement landed like a thunderclap \u2014 sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market.That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.The companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon\u2019s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans \u2014 from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics.\u201cIt could be big,\u201d Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. \u201cThose are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.\u201dBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies \u2014 which, combined, employ more than one million people \u2014 might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans.\u201cThis is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,\u201d said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. \u201cThe idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.\u201dEven the three companies don\u2019t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company.Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency \u2014 whatever it might turn out to be.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in the statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dOver the past several months, the three had met formally \u2014 along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan\u2019s board \u2014 to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s thinking.The three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set.Mr. Buffett\u2019s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country\u2019s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged \u2014 he is 87 \u2014 the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said.The companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company wouldn\u2019t replace existing health insurers or hospitals.Planning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis\u2019s mergers and acquisitions strategy; Mr. Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.One potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities.\u201cEach of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,\u201d said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn\u2019t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.\u201dThe e-commerce giant\u2019s actions \u2013 some big, like buying Whole Foods Markets; some smaller, like Amazon meal kits \u2013 have led to stock sell-offs for a wide range of businesses.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards.\u201cI think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,\u201d he said.Amazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.Nationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs \u2014 they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments.Suzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, \u201cit\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said.She added, \u201cThere are so many opportunities to do this better.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Katie Thomas from Chicago and Reed Abelson from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "As States Legalize Marijuana, Investors See an Opportunity", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersNew Jersey\u2019s new governor, Phil Murphy, made access to medical marijuana easier in the Garden State this week. A few weeks earlier, California, with its nearly 40 million people, legalized recreational marijuana use, having cleared the way for medical marijuana in 1996.Twenty-nine states now allow marijuana for medical purposes, while eight have legalized its recreational use. As the acceptance of marijuana is growing, so are the opportunities to invest in it.High-net-worth individuals have become a go-to source of investment dollars. This is partly because of the size of many of the companies, which are generally too small for institutional investors. But it\u2019s also because many of the companies require affluent investors who are willing to operate in a moral and legal gray area.Because of questions about the legality of marijuana, many banks will not accept deposits or conduct business relationships with cannabis companies. And for some wealthy individuals, like those with connections to prominent businesses, the double-digit returns may not be worth the potential taint to their reputation.Yet the returns are alluring. Shares are rising for companies in Canada, where marijuana is legal for medicinal purposes and the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is pushing for it to be legalized recreationally. Canopy Growth, a medical marijuana producer, went public in May 2016 at 1.76 Canadian dollars a share and is now trading at 23.60 Canadian dollars. Shares of MedReleaf, another producer, have surged 153 percent since the company\u2019s stock debut in June.What is challenging for one person, of course, can be an investment opportunity for another. The legal cannabis market in the United States was estimated to have grown by a third in 2017, to $9.7 billion, according to the Arcview Group, which follows the industry. Arcview said 2.3 million people in the United States used marijuana for medical purposes last year and that an additional 1.8 million did so recreationally in states where it was legal.But that\u2019s a small fraction of the potential market. Arcview said some 44 million people in the United States consume cannabis products in a given year.Investors put $500 million into private cannabis companies last year, said Troy Dayton, the chief executive and a co-founder of Arcview, which also has an investment arm. Since 2011, his group, which consists of 600 investors, has made $155 million worth of investments in the cannabis industry, from growers and dispensaries to companies that make ancillary products, like vaping devices. Some $50 million of that investment capital, however, was invested just last year.\u201cIt\u2019s moving very fast,\u201d Mr. Dayton said. \u201cIt\u2019s also unlike other markets because there is this federal-state conflict. Every state has different rules. There are so many layers of complexity.\u201dHis group offers tips for new investors. Some apply to any private investment \u2014 like looking at enough deals and properly vetting a promising deal. But others are specific to the industry, like navigating the different state laws, understanding the robust competition from illegal producers and mitigating the risk of federal prosecution.Putting money into growers or dispensaries requires investors to sign documents that are going to be filed with state regulators, putting investors at odds with federal law, Mr. Dayton said. \u201cWith the exception of things that are going through the F.D.A. approval process,\u201d he said, referring to the Food and Drug Administration, \u201cany business that touches cannabis in the United States violates federal law.\u201dBut warnings aside, there are opportunities for investors. The safest investment is in legal businesses like pharmaceutical companies using cannabis in their treatments as well as companies that make devices to consume cannabis, create sales and tracking software, develop or manage the real estate related to cannabis, or even provide human resources to the industry. Companies that grow or distribute marijuana are considered riskier.One of the best known in the medical marijuana field is GW Pharmaceuticals, a multibillion-dollar company developing a cannabis-based drug, known as a cannabinoid, for multiple sclerosis. Others include Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, which makes cannabinoids for neuropsychiatric conditions; Insys Therapeutics, for pain-management in cancer patients; and Therapix Biosciences, for central nervous system disorders.These drugs were created to harness certain components of cannabis that react with receptors in the body. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about cannabinoids is they\u2019re very safe,\u201d said Dr. Ascher Shmulewitz, the interim chief executive of Therapix. \u201cWith most drugs, the question is safety, and the issue is causing harm. With cannabinoids, the issue we have to show is efficacy.\u201dTherapix took an approved drug called Marinol, which is used to treat nausea in cancer and H.I.V. patients, and improved how it is delivered to the body. It is in F.D.A. trials now.\u201cInstead of telling a patient to smoke a joint, we\u2019re telling them to take a pill,\u201d Dr. Shmulewitz said. \u201cMedical marijuana isn\u2019t a drug, so it\u2019s not reimbursed by insurance. We\u2019re trying to create a path that allows the doctors and hospitals to use this as another way of treating a patient.\u201dSteven W. Wasserman, a lawyer and investment adviser at Seaport Investment Management in New York, said he had invested 5 percent of his own money into six cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical companies. What he has not done, he said, is advise clients to do the same.The overall investment market has done so well in the last year that recommending cannabis stocks is not worth the risk, he said. And he shies away from the growers and distributors of cannabis because of the gray area in which they operate.\u201cIf you\u2019re a grower, you can\u2019t go to the big insurance companies and get a policy,\u201d leading to liability issues, he said.But that does not deter some investors. Michael J. Willner, chief executive of Willner Properties, a real estate development and management company outside Philadelphia, said any short-term problems outweighed the long-term potential of cannabis-based treatments. He said he had allocated more than 20 percent of his investable assets to publicly traded companies in cannabinoid pharmaceuticals.Mr. Willner said he was attracted to the medical benefits, which he had heard of firsthand. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cure-all, and it\u2019s no layup, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could benefit society, and it could open up other avenues.\u201dFor those looking for less risk, investing in real estate built specifically for cannabis companies offers high returns but at an arm\u2019s length from the businesses housed within.Tim McGraw, chief executive of Canna-Hub, is developing two cannabis-related properties in California, including one near Sacramento that will have an estimated 1.22 million square feet. He said that the special requirements to be compliant with California law \u2014 like security and ventilation \u2014 increased the cost of development, but that cost was made up in higher rents. He said he expected returns in the high 30 percent to low 40 percent range.\u201cYou have the protection and security of real estate, not the risk of a single operator,\u201d said Mr. McGraw, who has been in real estate development for 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s across the cannabis industry. In the two office parks, we\u2019ll have 125 operators.\u201dThe marijuana market is moving away from the stoner image of the hippie culture, said Tom Adams, the editor in chief of Arcview\u2019s research arm. Smoking is now 50 percent of the legal market in Colorado, down from 70 percent just last year, he said. And vaping makes up nearly a quarter of the market, followed by tinctures, pills and creams.\u201cThe two fastest-growing categories were tinctures and pills, showing how far away that market is getting from the party-oriented Cheech and Chong movies,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cTinctures and pills are about an older demographic easing the aches and pains of age. It\u2019s more part of their wellness regimen than their party regimen.\u201dIt\u2019s certainly a different image, but it may be a more stable one for investors.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of a cannabis-related property being developed near Sacramento by Canna-Hub. It will be 1.22 million square feet, not 122 million square feet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the Economy Keep Calm and Carry On?", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn election night 2016, I gave in temporarily to a temptation I warn others about: I let my political feelings distort my economic judgment. A very bad man had just won the Electoral College; and my first thought was that this would translate quickly into a bad economy. I quickly retracted the claim, and issued a mea culpa. (Being an old-fashioned guy, I try to admit and learn from my mistakes.)What I should have clung to, despite my dismay, was the well-known proposition that in normal times the president has very little influence on macroeconomic developments \u2014 far less influence than the chair of the Federal Reserve.This only stops being true when the economy is so depressed that monetary policy loses traction, as was the case in 2009-10; at that point it mattered a lot that Obama was willing to engage in fiscal stimulus, and it also mattered a lot, unfortunately, that Republican opposition plus Obama\u2019s own caution meant that the stimulus was much smaller than it should have been. By 2016, however, the aftershocks of the financial crisis had faded away to the point that the usual rules once again applied.Indeed, if we could find an economist who didn\u2019t know that there was an election in 2016, and showed her the economic data for the past couple of years, she would have no clue that something drastic happened:For that matter, economic developments in the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first year were remarkably similar to developments in other advanced countries. Europe, in particular, has at least for now emerged from the shadow of the euro crisis, and is steadily growing \u2014 if you take its lower population growth into account, it\u2019s doing a bit better than the US:So we\u2019re living in an era of political turmoil and economic calm. Can it last?My answer is that it probably can\u2019t, because the return to normalcy is fragile. Sooner or later, something will go wrong, and we\u2019re very poorly placed to respond when it does. But I can\u2019t tell you what that something will be, or when it will happen.The key point is that while the major advanced economies are currently doing more or less OK, they\u2019re doing so thanks to very low interest rates by historical standards. That\u2019s not a critique of central bankers. All indications are that for whatever reason \u2014 probably low population growth and weak productivity performance \u2014 our economies need those low, low rates to achieve anything like full employment. And this in turn means that it would be a terrible, recession-creating mistake to \u201cnormalize\u201d rates by raising them to historical levels.But given that rates are already so low when things are pretty good, it will be hard for central bankers to mount an effective response if and when something not so good happens. What if something goes wrong in China, or a second Iranian revolution disrupts oil supplies, or it turns out that tech stocks really are in a 1999ish bubble? Or what if Bitcoin actually starts to have some systemic importance before everyone realizes it\u2019s nonsense?I\u2019m not predicting any of these things, and when the next big shock comes it will probably come from some direction I haven\u2019t thought of. But when it does come, we\u2019ll need an effective, coherent response from officials beyond the world of central banking.So imagine such an event happening soon. How confident would you feel in the team of Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin? How much leadership could a weakened Angela Merkel exert in a fragmented Europe?You might have thought that such concerns would weigh on markets even now. But for whatever reason, investors are currently in what-me-worry mode. And let\u2019s hope that they\u2019re right \u2014 that by the time stuff happens, we\u2019ll actually have non-delusional people in charge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cutting Carbon Emissions While Earning Cash", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBonds may seem an unlikely instrument for saving the world. But managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds who invest in so-called green bonds say the securities can help address climate change and other environmental woes.\u201cThe more green bonds that are issued, the more green projects that are being funded,\u201d said Christopher J. Wigley, senior fixed-income portfolio manager with the Mirova Global Green Bond Fund. \u201cGreen bonds are reducing emissions\u201d of greenhouse gases, he said.Green bonds finance environmental projects like wind and solar power, mass transit and upgrades in energy efficiency. They can be issued by corporations, governments, international organizations like the World Bank and universities. Apple and Starbucks have gone green with some of their bond issues in the last several years.While the term green bonds is often used, there is no universally accepted definition of what such a bond is. Ms. Palm said she seeks two features, besides the promise of an environmental investment: \u201can independent audit to demonstrate that the proceeds were used as expected and a report back on the financial and environmental returns.\u201d She said she wants quantitative data about gains like greenhouse gas emissions offset or energy usage avoided.In 2017, about $150 billion in green bonds were issued, about double the volume of 2016, according the Climate Bonds Initiative, a London nonprofit group. Still, the market remains minuscule, compared with, say, the roughly $1.5 trillion in United States corporate debt issued annually.Among its recent top holdings were bonds of both the French government and Southern Power, a wholesale electricity generator that is a subsidiary of the Southern Company in Atlanta.Southern Power generates much of its electricity using natural gas, and its parent company operates nuclear power plants. Its bonds are barred from some funds that apply environmental screens to their holdings, including Ms. Palm\u2019s Parnassus Fixed Income Fund.\u201cWe exclude any company that generates significant revenue from nuclear,\u201d she said.Mr. Wigley said Southern Power is shifting toward renewable energy and wind power in particular with its green bonds helping that transition.\u201cWe see the climate transition as a critical phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that don\u2019t adapt could become default risks. So we see those that issue green bonds as better financial risks and want to support that.\u201dThe Calvert fund began in 2013. Its manager, Vishal O. Khanduja, said he buys bonds that are labeled green and unlabeled ones with clear environmental aims. Calvert, which factors environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decisions, has a team of analysts who investigate the green bona fides of bonds, he said. All the Calvert bond funds \u2014 there are 10 \u2014 must clear environmental thresholds, but the green fund \u201cfocuses even more on the environmental pillar,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat my investors want is for us to use our expertise to get as close as possible to an end project with an environmental benefit,\u201d Mr. Liberatore said.A claim often made by proponents of green bonds is that investing in them addresses climate change and other environmental problems more directly than buying green stocks does. Bond proceeds, this argument goes, finance specific projects with the potential for measurable gains. With an equity investment, in contrast, you just own shares in a company with a reputation for environmental stewardship. The company\u2019s management still has discretion over its investments.Jon F. Hale, director of sustainability research for Morningstar, said he regarded that argument as credible. \u201cWhen you think about impact, dollar for dollar, you probably are having a bigger impact\u201d with a green bond fund than an environmentally minded stock fund, he said.\u201cThere are estimates out there of the trillions of dollars in investments needed in renewables and energy efficiency over the next 30 years, and that\u2019s what these kinds of bonds are financing,\u201d he said.Mr. Hale cautioned, however, that investors shouldn\u2019t abandon prudence for the sake of environmental purity. They should still stick to such investing tenets as keeping costs low, diversifying and allocating their money based on their goals and tolerance for risk.\u201cAs an investor, you should be allocated across asset classes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can activate your desire for sustainability with your bond investments, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Buy Bitcoin? Ask a Different Question First", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyI received these two messages within three minutes of each other recently:Several years back I used to mine Bitcoin, and then I sold most of them off for a down payment for our house. I had 400 BTC at one point, which would be worth $6.8 million today. Needless to say, I am really depressed now. I only kept one Bitcoin. I should have kept more.And this one:My husband has invested in Bitcoin, and my son has invested in Etherium! I am debating about switching my 401(k) to Bitcoin.So may I humbly suggest that asking if we should all buy Bitcoin is the wrong question, and that we should ask a different one instead. The question we should be asking ourselves is this: Does buying Bitcoin fit into my investment plan?That is a much more important question and one that we can all answer much more easily. It places the attention on the process of investing correctly and not on the outcome of events that we have no control over.In order to answer the investing plan question, it might help to clarify a few things.Investing is different from speculating or gambling. Investing is a means to an end, and that end is our collective financial goals. Beating the stock market, buying what\u2019s hot, outperforming a brother-in-law \u2014 those are not financial goals. Financial goals are things like having money to send kids to college, buying a house, taking a trip or retiring someday. This is why we invest.Investors do not put all their eggs in one basket. That\u2019s something speculators do. Our financial goals are important, and the consequences of failure are high. So we spread our risk out by diversifying across lots of different types of investments, like stocks and bonds and real estate, both in the countries where we live and far away. We choose each one carefully based on how it interacts with the others in our portfolio.So this isn\u2019t really about Bitcoin at all. Just like it wasn\u2019t about real estate in 2007, or internet stocks in 1999. This is about investing versus something else we typically call gambling or speculating. It\u2019s not about where Bitcoin is going, or what we might have missed out on over the last year. All of that is out of our control.What is in our control is the process of identifying goals, building a portfolio that matches those goals and then maintaining it for a very long time (even when it\u2019s scary, or hard) so we can achieve those goals.So no, I cannot tell you if you should be buying Bitcoin. But I can urge you to ask a very different question.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year.

The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives.

Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling.

{"Headline": "Calestous Juma, 64, Dies; Sought Innovation in African Agriculture", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalestous Juma, a prominent global advocate for sustainable development in struggling countries, particularly in his native Africa, could trace his passion for technological innovation to his arduous childhood in colonial Kenya.One of 14 children, most of whom died of malaria, he grew up on the shore of Lake Victoria in a remote village of mud huts without electricity or running water. The nearest post office was 20 miles away. Flooding was common.\u201cThe family kept getting pushed out of their home and then trying to go back,\u201d his wife, Alison Field-Juma, said. \u201cSo there was this sort of constant change in his environment. It was also incredibly challenging. They were forced to innovate. Both his parents were real innovators. I think that\u2019s where that spirit comes from.\u201dHis father, a carpenter, introduced cassava, a starchy root native to South America, to give villagers a more reliable food supply. His mother became an entrepreneur, selling goods at marketplaces so that she could help pay for her son\u2019s schooling.That schooling led him ultimately to Harvard, where he became a professor of international development at the Kennedy School and directed the Agricultural Innovation in Africa project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.He also became the first director of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the founder of the African Center for Technology Studies in Nairobi, Kenya, a pioneering group that married government policy with science and technology to spur sustainable development and foster distinctly African perspectives on science.Professor Juma died on Dec. 15 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 64. His wife said the cause was cancer. At his death he was widely credited as having been an important force in ensuring that biotechnology would play a critical role in improving economic life in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201cCalestous understood that people often resist the changes that come with innovation, and that overcoming this resistance can be very important in enabling societies to move ahead,\u201d said Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School. \u201cSo he tried to understand why people resist innovation, and what can be done to make them feel comfortable with change.\u201dProfessor Juma\u2019s latest book, \u201cInnovation and Its Enemies\u201d (2016), described how technological change is often greeted with public skepticism. Beneath such opposition, he argued, is the belief that only a small segment of society will benefit from potential progress, while the much broader society bears the greatest risk.Successful policymaking must take into account people\u2019s feelings, he believed. When Professor Juma helped design a stove for use in developing countries, its metallic cylinder was replaced with a clay lining to improve efficiency. But the prototype caused less smoke \u2014 attracting more mosquitoes \u2014 and villagers worried that metal workers could lose their jobs. A later model used metal and clay.\u201cUltimately, all development is experimental; no one knows what they are doing,\u201d Professor Juma said with a laugh in 2014. \u201cAfricans need the chance to experiment as well. They will make mistakes, but they can learn from them, too.\u201d\u201cCalestous was very serious about getting his work right, but he was not serious about himself,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said. \u201cHe shared his enjoyment of the research and teaching, though he was working on life-or-death issues for many people. He was incredibly optimistic.\u201dProfessor Juma was born to John Kwada Juma and Clementina Nabwire Juma in the village of Busia, in western Kenya, on June 9, 1953. He grew up nearby in Port Victoria.\u201cPort Victoria was as remote as it gets \u2014 a small fishing village on Lake Victoria at Kenya\u2019s westernmost point,\u201d said Ken Kobe, who taught Professor Juma while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer there in 1969-70.After graduating from Egoji Teachers\u2019 Training College in central Kenya in 1974, Professor Juma became a science teacher in Mombasa, a port city on the Indian Ocean. He went on to write so many letters to the editor of the Nairobi-based newspaper The Daily Nation that it hired him in 1978 to be its first full-time science and environment correspondent.He met his wife, who also works in sustainable development, at a conference in Montreal. They married in 1987 and moved to Kenya.Professor Juma experienced two major ecological disruptions in his childhood, Ms. Field-Juma said. One was the introduction of Nile perch to Lake Victoria to help the fishing industry. Though it did benefit the area economically for a time, it also contributed to the depletion, to near-extinction, of stocks of many other types of fish in the lake.The second change was the British colonial government\u2019s deforestation of much of the Port Victoria region, which dried out what had been a wet and fertile area. \u201cThe microclimate of that region was irreversibly changed,\u201d Ms. Field-Juma said.On his return to Kenya with his wife, he sought a scientific solution to the agricultural crisis.The book helped pave the way for the Convention on Biological Diversity, a United Nations treaty signed by more than 150 governments in 1992 to protect the survival of diverse species and ecosystems.Besides his wife, he is survived by his son, Eric, and his sister, Roselyda Nanjala.Until he was hospitalized, Professor Juma had planned to host about 20 international students for Thanksgiving in Cambridge. Instead, he joined them from the hospital by Skype, sharing stories and discussing development with them.\u201cIt was just what he wanted,\u201d Ms. Field-Juma said, \u201cand he wasn\u2019t even there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Flu Season Is the Worst in Nearly a Decade", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year\u2019s flu season is now more intense than any since the 2009 swine flu pandemic and still getting worse, federal health officials said on Friday.Nationally, the number of people falling ill with flu is increasing. More worrying, the hospitalization rate \u2014 a predictor of the death rate \u2014 has just jumped.It is now on track to equal or surpass that of the 2014-2015 flu season. In that year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 34 million Americans got the flu, 710,000 were hospitalized and about 56,000 died.\u201cWe\u2019ll expect something around those numbers,\u201d Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, director of the C.D.C.\u2019s influenza division, said during a telephone news conference Friday.This week, the deaths of seven children were reported to the C.D.C., bringing this season\u2019s total to 37. In 2014-2015, there were 148 pediatric deaths \u2014 which the agency tracks individually, not by estimates as it does with death totals.It is too early to estimate how many children will die this season, Dr. Jernigan said, because it still has weeks to run, and because the agency often does not learn of deaths \u2014 especially of children who die at home \u2014 until weeks after they take place.Some areas also have shortages of antivirals like Tamiflu, he said, and the C.D.C. is trying to help the supply chain move medicines to where they are needed most.More people fell ill during the 2009 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic, but that was a new virus. This year\u2019s dominant virus, H3N2, has been circulating for 50 years \u2014 it emerged as the \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d in 1968 \u2014 but it is usually the most lethal of the seasonal strains.H3N2 also was responsible for bad seasonal flu years in 1997-1998 and 2003-2004, Dr. Jernigan said.As is typical, people over 65 are the most likely to be hospitalized. But in an unusual twist, those aged 50 to 64 \u2014 rather than infants \u2014 are the age cohort right behind the elderly.\u201cBaby boomers have higher hospitalization rates than their grandchildren right now,\u201d Dr. Jernigan said.Hospitalizations and deaths among people in that age group can hurt the economy more than deaths of the elderly, he noted, since they are in their peak earning years and often in supervisory positions.They are also less likely to be protected. Recently, about 41 percent of that age group has gotten flu shots, while 57 percent of those over age 65 have; and the elderly usually get shots that are four times as powerful because their immune systems are weaker.Despite the efforts of public health officials, the number of people getting shots each year has begun falling slightly.The intense 2009 swine flu pandemic, which sent demand for vaccines soaring, was followed by several mild flu years. Then the \u201cmoderately severe\u201d season of 2014-2015 was all but ignored by health reporters because they were focused on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.In this year\u2019s outbreak, \u201cflu intensity\u201d \u2014 a measure of how many catch the disease \u2014 is now widespread, but hospitalization rates have varied widely by region.California and the West Coast have been hit hard, with four times as many people hospitalized as in 2014-2015, Dr. Jernigan said. Minnesota had twice as many. New York and the Northeast \u201care beginning to catch up,\u201d he added.Intensity is high by two different measures the C.D.C. uses. For three weeks straight, the health departments of 49 states \u2014 all except Hawaii \u2014 have reported \u201cwidespread\u201d flu activity.Also, sentinel sites in 39 states, New York City and Puerto Rico are reporting \u201chigh\u201d flu levels. (The sites include more than 2,000 emergency rooms, clinics and doctor\u2019s offices that report each week what percentage of their patients have flu symptoms.)According to the C.D.C.\u2019s weekly FluView, 6.6 percent of all patients visiting doctors now have flu symptoms. The 2014-2015 season peaked at 6 percent, while the 2009 \u201cswine flu\u201d season peaked at 7.7 percent.Until recently, the severity indexes had languished behind the measures of intensity.The agency\u2019s national \u201cPneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance Index\u201d ripples like a sine wave, rising in winter and falling in summer. Until recently, the red line indicating deaths had remained firmly below the \u201cepidemic threshold\u201d even as the red line on a different index tracking doctor\u2019s visits was following the pattern set by the 2014-2015 season with eerie exactness.Then, two weeks ago, the intensity line plodded steadily beyond the 2014-2015 Christmas week peak, but the mortality line initially did not budge. But it is now shooting upward at the high trajectory angle of a North Korean rocket, has passed the peaks of the last two seasons and is on track to match or surpass 2014-2015.Advertisement"}

Are there any special tax consequences?Receiving wages from an employer in a virtual currency is like being paid in dollars: It is taxable to the employee, must be reported by the employer on a Form W-2 and is subject to federal income tax withholding, according to Wolters Kluwer.Independent contractors paid in digital currency must also treat that as gross income and pay self-employment taxes.What if I paid someone else in Bitcoin for their services?Can I reduce my tax bill by donating my cryptocoins?Will I receive any tax forms from my exchange? Do I have to track my own transactions?Generally speaking, brokers and exchanges are not yet required to report cryptocurrency transactions to the I.R.S., as they do when you sell a stock at a profit or loss (and you receive a 1099-B or a 1099-DIV for a mutual fund).Does the new tax bill change any of this?The I.R.S. didn\u2019t say this strategy could be used with virtual currencies, but some tax experts argued that it was a reasonable \u2014 albeit debatable \u2014 interpretation since the coins were considered property. Now that the tax legislation limits the use of 1031 exchanges to real estate, they no longer apply, accountants said.So \u2026 should I finally buy Bitcoin?Whatever you decide, never gamble more than what you can afford to lose \u2014 and you\u2019ll need to report it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sneaker Heads, Astrology and New Year\u2019s Resolutions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationThis week we enjoyed reading diverse opinions on whether astrology is real, if the extreme cold weather is enjoyable or miserable, how to go about reinventing oneself and what 2018 will bring._________I am a sneaker head in the Bay Area. The sneaker community in San Francisco is the same throughout other places. As the new Jordan\u2019s come to release, a lot of people will be wearing it and if it\u2019s an \u201cOG Colorway\u201d pair, it is very anticipated. It will be the same as for collaboration pairs, such as Yeezy\u2019s. Talking about myself, I\u2019ve owned 10 pairs or more sneakers. I don\u2019t really stay with one brand, I wear from Vans to the hyped Jordan\u2019s. The most I spent for a pair of kicks is around $300. And those sneakers were the Jordan 3lab5s. But now, I have layed low in buying sneakers. I\u2019ve been buying strictly only Jordan 1 pairs, because they\u2019re lightweight and comfortable. I will still buy Jordan pairs but only if they look good to me, not following the hype.I do consider myself as a sneaker head because I have been collecting sneakers since my 8th grade and have collected a little over 60 pairs. I would say that my favorite sneaker would be the Jordan 1. I think the most I\u2019ve paid for a pair of shoe was $600. I personally don\u2019t consider myself a hypebeast because I don\u2019t buy items for the hype or resale value. I buy the things I personally like, but I do constantly buy shoes every two weeks. What I found helpful is that you should really examine the shoe or clothing piece by the sticking or by the coloring. The sneakers that I mostly look into are the Jordan 1s and the yeezy boost 350.Before reading this article I knew about the rapidly growing hype around the sneaker community or even just shoes in general. I share the same hobby that Benjamin Kapelushnik has and I also share the same dream. Ever since getting involved with sneakers I have always wanted to start collecting or even start up a small resell business with my friends. Seeing the community grow over the past couple of years is amazing, and being a sneakerhead is fun, it\u2019s just like being passionate towards your favorite sports team. I currently have 6 shoes in my collection and I am looking to obtain more. Some people may find 6 shoes an absurd amount for one person, but to me it\u2019s the same as collecting pokemon, baseball, or football cards. Being a part of such a new and expanding community of sneaker fanatics and collectors is great, and I only see the hype around sneakers increasing.Was I a sneakerhead? I remember coming home from school and looking at all the sneaker websites like Kicks On Fire, Sneaker News, Kixify, ane Sole Collector. Sneakers was what I Loved, shoes simply amused me. Kicks fit in perfectly with my lifestyle at the time. I was playing basketball twenty four seven. It seems like my life was a repeating cycle of school, basketball, and sneakers. I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead walking on the court without some fly sneakers on my feet. I loved nikes, especially the lebrons. I was always looking at social media and ebay to see if I could get my hands on the Lebron Ten Lava Edition. At the time lebron tens were selling for about two-hundred dollars and that did not phase me one bit, they were the most beautiful thing I had even seen. The summer of 2016 I was able to go to a House of Hoops, a special edition footlocker store for exclusive shoes and I walked out with those beloved lebrons. I have them to this day with the box and receipt they came with. The craziest thing is how I totally outgrew the sneakerhead phase and I quit basketball. Now I love to shop at goodwill and find that killer garment and put on that pair of vans that feel just right.I have lost my interest in shoes so I am not a sneaker head. I used to be one of the people who would wait in line ready for them to take my money just so I can attend school on Monday with my new Jordans. I have around 15-20 pairs of shoes yet only use around 12 of them. I see the hype in wanting the most recent shoes to come out to be fly because they are expensive and there are a limited pair the put in stock. I have a pair of low top Concord 11\u2019s that I bought for $150 and can now sale them for more than that, and the better the condition they are in the more expensive they can be sold for. If you can pay all your bills and buy expensive shoes you want go ahead, but people like myself have realized that at the end of the day they\u2019re just shoes and at the end of the day it is the value you give them.Then, there were those who didn\u2019t get the sneaker mania at all.Never before reading and engaging in this article have I heard the shoe frenzy term, sneaker head. Maybe it\u2019s because I have never really been involved in the world of shoes, but I did learn that sneaker heads are extremely passionate about their shoes. It amazed me how some of these collectors have a mass total of four thousand and five hundred pair of shoes. That is incredible! Through all of this amazement however, I just don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind this hobby. Personally, I have three different pairs of shoes. Basic tennis shoes for school, black shoes for work and sandals for the beach. Yeah, shoes are great and all, but more than three or even five pairs is just excessive. Heck, there are some folks who can barely afford one pair of old boots, and here we come with our large storage facility filled with unused, overly expensive and wasteful rubber! I may share the passion with these sneaker heads that some shoes are just simply awesome, but I have absolutely no desire to be passionate about a hobby that is based off the wasting of valuable resources.I love shoes but I do not consider myself a sneaker head. I have about 15 pairs of shoes but none cost me over 80$. Shoes are beautiful and help us express who we are. But I don\u2019t agree with people who spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a single pair. In my opinion that money could be used to help non profits or others in need. There is no need to spend all your check on something you will keep boxed up in a storage room. Why wait in line for a pair of shoes our generation labeled as \u201cdope\u201d instead of looking for what\u2019s you really like and at a more affordable price? You can express your identity in many ways without having to overboard._________I\u2019ve never experienced cold like this before. Until I moved up north this past summer \u2014 I\u2019d never been in temperatures below 20 degrees fahrenheit and hadn\u2019t planned on it \u2014 but this? Experiencing negative temperatures has been a huge blow. I know how to deal with the heat \u2014 I grew up in Texas and spent time in New Mexico and Louisiana and other sweltering southern states. I can handle heat exhaustion. Vomiting from the heat, worrying about dehydration, getting lectured for melting my shoes on the pavement \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with it. But now? My first blizzard? I\u2019m completely out of my element. I\u2019d never shoveled snow before. I\u2019d never actually seen a snowblower. I\u2019d never even owned a down coat. It\u2019s overwhelming and has impacted my day to day life more than I could have even imagined. I try to be grateful for these new experiences, but honestly? I\u2019m just too cold to appreciate them.The cold weather is way too much even for me. As a kid I used to love when it snowed and going outside to build a snowman and sled. As of today I am officially over winter and am in desperate need of summer. I honestly think the weather has affected everyone negatively in one way or another. Whether it be having to shovel 14 inches off their driveway, or having to wake up an extra 30 mins earlier because they have to drive slower to work / school due to how bad the roads are. I also think this weather affects students a lot. With summer being very far away and the cold freezing us every morning on the way to school, we\u2019re losing any and all effort of trying to work hard. We are cold and all we want to do is go and warm up with a heavy comfy blanket, not sit down and work on the ice cold kitchen table finishing our math homework.Personally, I\u2019ve loved the recent cold weather we\u2019ve been having. I\u2019ve always loved to walk outside and feel a cool refreshing breeze against my face. I am so grateful to have missed a few days of school and have an extended break. I really needed more time off for obvious reasons. This recent weather has surprised me because normally we have mild weather here in Wilmington. I have not been through any extreme weather to this point luckily, the worst I\u2019ve experienced has been a category 2 hurricane.Since Christmas it seems like all of America has been trapped in a harsh cold front especially in places like New England where cities and towns were bombarded with two feet of snow and countless days near or below zero degrees not to mention the windchill that sends cold wintery air deep into your core making it almost unbearable to do anything outside your home. However, we have seen worse so I guess in some way it\u2019s better to be really cold and snowy across America rather than to have to fight hurricane after hurricane such as this summer when it seemed as though there was never a time without a major hurricane ravaging some area of the country or during the fall when California saw one of the most massive, destructive, and deadly wildfires in history. So we can all at least be thankful that all we have to deal with is frigid temperatures and snow instead of walls of flames that march their way across cities and towns or hurricanes strong enough to rip homes from their foundations._________I do not believe in Astrology. In fact, I think the whole concept of Astrology is nonsense. In my opinion, to think that the current location of Saturn or any other star dictating whether if I pass or fail a test is mindboggling for me. I understand that Astrology has recently become a \u201ctrendy\u201d thing to have fun with, but to fully buy into the concept is a betrayal to the scientists and astronomers that have dedicated time, resources, and effort to explain our universe logically. First off, Astrology is not a science. Astrology is not based on evidence, the conclusions aren\u2019t testable, and can\u2019t be proven wrong. These qualities are the main foundations of what science is and Astrology fails to meet any of these qualities. Secondly, scientists have put Astrology to the test multiple times in the past and have found Astrology to be inconsistent. A French study in the 60s which aimed to find if people\u2019s careers correlated with the placement of celestial bodies resulted in no correlation. However, despite the debunking of Astrology as a significant amount of Americans believe that Astrology is a type of science. It is concerning that Americans believe in an ancient practice that has no ground or base in science in terms of evidence and testability. To conclude, I think that Astrology can be practiced as a fun activity for family and friend gatherings but not applied to science that is based in realityIt\u2019s appalling to see a concept as ridiculous as astrology actually making its mark on today\u2019s society. In a world where our scientific capabilities are vastly expanding, the last thing that we should be doing is resorting to untestable and unreliable methods for explanation and prediction. I fully understand that astrology might be a fun activity to mess around with, but attempting to apply it in the real world is just plain stupid. As a species, we have evolved past looking at relations between stars for answers to completely unrelated problems. Astrology has proven to be inconsistent in various scientific tests, and it seems that the best defense people have for it is a coincidence here and there. If people want answers they should be looking to a science \u2014 a real science \u2014 that can give them real answers. My hope is that astrology only continues to gain popularity as an activity for fooling around, and people won\u2019t truly put faith in a completely defenseless practice.Not only do I believe in astrology, I do find it to be the tool through which we can understand ourselves and the universe in which we live. In fact, you might as well could have asked me if I believed in gravity or in earth being round. For me it\u2019s a hard fact.I started by questioning Astrology many years ago, and had a very skeptic approach. But I would then find things that were not coincidence, that were very specific about me. And is fine when is one or maybe two things. But astrology has taught me that I am more than a combination of circumstances, that the future is not written in stars but is written in you, but within the choices taken in the present and that the reaction, not the event, to what happens in one\u2019s life, is what matter the most. Is not about finding out when you will get a boyfriend or a new car. Is more about if and why you are ready for it.It is not so much a religion as it is a system. Unfortunately, most people exposure to astrology is a section in a newspaper that is referring to a whole group of the population and they believe this is all there is to it. To say that someone is from one sign or the other is obviously simplistic. Is like saying someone is from a country or another. There are dozens of other factors astrology considers. If you haven\u2019t gotten your Birth Chart done by a credited astrologer, I doubt you ever know what the big deal is about it, and why it has not gone anywhere in the over 10,000 years of history on its back.While growing up, I remember looking at the newspaper and seeing a section for horoscopes. It always interested me and I wanted to learn more. I\u2019ve always been into learning more about my personality, taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and looking at my natal chart. The natal chart uses when you were born, what time you were born, and where you were born to show you each house or planet you fall into. It\u2019s more in depth than just finding the zodiac sign of the month your birthday is.I believe in astrology. It helps us better learn about ourselves and the universe we live in. Through analyzing my chart, I was able to understand myself and how I am. The astrology chart was pretty close to what I got on the Myers-Briggs personality test too. Most people base their belief of astrology on the horoscopes people put into their blogs, but that isn\u2019t individualized for them. That\u2019s more of a general belief and that\u2019s not what you should go by. If you take the time to do a natal chart and read your results, you will find that it\u2019s pretty accurate and you may discover some things you didn\u2019t really know about yourself, but it\u2019s true.I will say, astrology and the future it tells you is not set in stone. You can change the future. The choices you make shape who you are and what will happen in your lifetime.Yes, I do believe in astrology. The horoscopes that tell you you\u2019re going to win a million dollars may not be right and sometimes the placement of the planets won\u2019t determine whether or not you find your soul mate, however I do believe that astrology has actual meaning. The universe is a vast and unpredictable place, humans have barely scraped the surface of what is the universe is made of, what it looks like, what it\u2019s function is, etc. There is no literal knowledge of what the universe is fully capable of because we have not witnessed or tested it all. So, astrology, the study of the planets, the dependence on their patterns, makes sense to me. The planets are a wonderful and almost magical force. The giants in the sky are centers of their own universes of life. They are important and I think incorporating them into your life is valuable to being humble and being knowledgeable about your spiritual and mindful self. The idea that these beasts can tell us why we are sad and why the day is going bad is so nice for humans to hear that we cling to it. It is in our nature to look for why things happen or what causes things. So, if someone believes that the position of mercury explains why they can\u2019t communicate properly then that\u2019s that. The human race, with all its complexity and differences, is the same at the core with needing to find something comforting to understand. So, astrology works perfectly to explain the inexplicable universe.Astrology helps us pinpoint our personality traits and characteristics, but reading your horoscope can provide you with attracting information when life seems to be at a stand-still. By explaining why certain things happen, horoscopes can help you cope with the most subjective affairs that are going on in your life. Whether you are experiencing great times and fortune, or you are going through dark, and tough times, your horoscope can provide solace when you don\u2019t know where to turn. Life is about decisions, and keeping up with your astrological identity and horoscope can help you fix your mind to what you should do when you make decisions. Some say that just having a short read every once in awhile can help you benefit from the energy the cosmos are pushing towards you, but I believe that horoscopes can be a waste of money and time. In fact, nobody can totally rely on horoscopes to solve his or her problems. Rather, consider them as fortune cookies which give momentary pleasure but cannot sustain you forever._________The picture illustrates the role social media has in one\u2019s life. Below each person is the set number of followers that they have which defines each as more \u201cpopular\u201d than the other. The image provides the audience with information on how social media is used and how impactful it can be when being used to appeal to an audience. As depicted, social media is a place that is welcoming of all ethnicities, genders, etc. Everyone has the right to equal use and popularity of social media \u2014 which represents that the use of social media and being a part of sites demonstrates unity for all those a part of the program. Social media relates to society because it shows how each person has the ability to break away from everyday life and be anyone they want to be on social media. Social media can be beneficial in communicating with long distant family and friends, or even sharing a fascinating picture! The image comments on current day society by revealing that people utilize social media to potentially make insecurities more hidden (due to the lack of background knowledge given to a \u201cfollower\u201d on social media), or release any stress. Having this interpretation of the image allows for the conclusion that social media can be used positively in society, or its power can be over used resulting in an over obsession with the site.To me this picture says that social media is everywhere. It controls us. We are always worried about what is new on it, who has texted us, snap chatted us. We look up to people who we do not even know, to people who we want to look like, to act like, to people who we aspire to be. We are glued to our phones, constantly seeing the people we wish we could be like, but that is not healthy. The almost impossible standards that we are exposed to almost every time we open our phone. Worrying about how many followers or friends we have. We are addicted to our phones and social media. The real question is though, why are we addicted?In my opinion, this picture represents the huge impact that social media has on our daily lives. Each of these social media stars has millions of followers, many looking up to them. However, what this picture does not show, many celebrities who attained their fame in a different way, have massive followings as well. One of these celebrities is none other than our president, Donald Trump. As said by Kashana Cauley, Trump has used Twitter to \u201cpromote a tax bill that would disembowel the middle class and to attack prominent black people.\u201d She says, however, that these tweets have made her feel more patriotic, by voicing what she believes is right for our country. Even though many argue that this is unpatriotic because it goes against our president, but in reality, this is patriotism. Patriotism is believing in one\u2019s country and being proud of the nation. Kashana Cauley is proud of the people in America standing up for their rights, such as the football playing kneeling for the national anthem. If Americans supported everything Trump says, all of his bigotry and ignorance, simply because he is our president, this would be nationalism. Nationalism is the toxic idea that one\u2019s nation is better than other countries, and blindly supporting one\u2019s country, even if their nation is wrong. I believe Kashana Cauley is patriotic, because she is striving to improve our country instead of conforming to the misogynistic and racist views ingrained in the American political system.This picture illustrates the standard at which people need to stand at to be famous or well known is receiving many likes and followers. Every social media user is different and is able to stand out in their own way, but this picture only makes well known users stand out. Not everyone has thousands of likes and followers, and for those that do have special attention. This shows that for the people that have the largest amount of likes and followers having a higher ranking. This is redundant because everyone was born equal and it is not fair to be placed in a position where you are lower than someone.This image sums up a perfect explanation on how social media is changing people\u2019s lives. One\u2019s popularity is determined by the amount of followers we have or the number of likes we get on our recent picture. Everyone of us have been impacted by social media and for some, it has changed our lives. We are addicted to our smartphones, laptops and tablet screens. However, it is up to us to determine whether we use social media in a negative way or if we positively affect the social media world._________Gifs are the perfect way to express how you feel when you can\u2019t find the words to do so. People do say \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d for a reason. If you want to passive-agressively show someone you are upset with them, send a gif. If you want to show your appreciation for someone but are too awkward to put it into words, send a gif. Gifs are used all over the world because they can express universal feelings in ways that words can\u2019t always do. Happiness, love, sadness, and anger are all emotions popularly represented by gifs in many different countries. This is because despite being universal feelings, they are much easier to express through facial expressions or actions. But, it\u2019s 2018, hardly any communication is face-to-face anymore, gifs bring the element of expression that cannot be expressed through text.I use emoji when I am shocked, excited, or sad about something. By using emojis, it helps the person who is reading it understand how you feel about the situation. By using emoji it expresses if I am kind, mean, or judgmental. It expresses this because it shows what I feel about the topic being talked about.Gifs are a new culture to the social media world. They are the perfect way to express how you feel, what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re doing. By using gifs and emojis we can show exactly how we feel without misleading the other through words. Our words often get interpreted or altered in ways we didn\u2019t even mean them to sound. Therefore, gifs are a great way to show how we feel!_________I have reinvented myself multiple times, but my biggest was just a few months ago. When hanging out with my friends I used to be shy and always afraid to voice my opinion. One day I asked myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, why are you so reserved.\u201d I had no answer so after that day I have been outgoing and im never afraid to say what\u2019s on my mind. I have had so much more fun with my friends than I ever have before. Even though I might be a little hesitant to talk in front of the class, I imagine one day that will change. But, until then i will make the most of it. I think that someone can control if they change or not out of high school. It is all about where you end up.Knowledge is used to move forward. As people learn more, life is made easier. Tasks such as washing laundry and cooking food continue to change with the creation of new inventions and developments. Not only does the way tasks change, but people do too. People never stop reinventing themselves. From the day someone is born, the process of reinvention never ceases to reoccur. Moving up to a high school, with different expectations than past schooling meant that I especially had to change to meet higher expectations. Reinventing myself included, trying harder in specific subject areas in order to fulfill class requirements that were more difficult than before. Energy in certain subject areas needed to be re-focused and adjusted. To overcome obstacles, I had to reinvent my approach to school, which meant that I had to reinvent myself.Change is inevitable. For some, this realization is unfortunate and rather scary; while for others it is exciting and makes them eager to experience these changes in their lives. Personally, I do not believe that we can control how much we will change over time. Most personal change is a result of experience, most of which is unexpected or uncontrollable. For instance, experiencing a tragic event like a death in your family is completely out of your control, but it will in fact change who you are as a person. It may make you more angry, bitter, or it may even reshape the way you look at life and express yourself to others. On the other hand, there are change-causing things that we can control, like who we decide to be friends with, where you work, what you choose to do in your free time. But change will always remain inevitable, something that will not always be completely in our control.Part one: I believe that I was given an opportunity to reinvent myself, but I did not take it. When I was going into my 8th grade year, I was leaving my school of about 40 people in the whole grade, a school that I had been at since Kindergarten, for a school with about 40 people in just one class. Although I knew a handful of people, there were many that I was yet to be acquainted with. I felt that this was a chance to reinvent myself, being that hardly anyone would know me. I thought this for a little while, and then decided that I would rather be who I felt I had always been. Looking back, I do not believe that there has really been a time when I have \u201creinvented\u201d myself, per se, but I have gradually changed over time. I believe that change within people is inevitable, either it being a sudden change, or a gradual one. I have seen some of my friends reinvent themselves though, and sometimes I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. Much like Navlakha in the article, I don\u2019t want to lose them. I am a sophomore in high school right now, and I feel like I will definitely change when I leave for college and continue that change throughout my freshman year. I think this because leaving home and going to college is one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. As Navlakha did, I hope to also change in the way I feel about certain subjects in academics in college.In her article on reinventing oneself in college, Meera Navlakah argues that change is inevitable in our lives when we place ourselves in new environments. I agree with Meera that new experiences alter our personalities. For example, many of my friends in middle school who attended private school instead of Danvers High have grown differently in the past couple years than the rest of us have. While our attitudes have remained the same, many of them have a more privileged life than public school students. At private schools, they are required to dress much more formally, often enduring more rigorous principles at their respective schools. In turn, they have developed a first class attitude compared to us. While the difference in wealth may affect students attitudes, I have remained good friends with these preparatory students. The core of their personality remains beneath the surface. People do not really change that much. Deep down, people are who they have always been. New environments seem to change people on the surface. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks however. While I expect my friends and I will change over the course of our lives, the core of our personalities will remain the same._________I do make New Year\u2019s resolutions each year, but it\u2019s actually hard for me to keep.Many people perceive New Years resolutions to be ways to make other people like you, but I think they are about making you like yourself. To me, New Years resolutions are about making yourself the best you can be, whether it be in health, or in mindset. In the past I have not stuck to my resolutions, but this year I made a goal that I can achieve. My resolution is to drink more water. It will help me be a stronger athlete, which is something I myself strive to be. Hydrating is not all about sports, however. Hydrating also helps your body function better and keeps you healthy. I downloaded an app that keeps track of your fluid intake so I don\u2019t have an excuse to fall short. It is important to hold yourself accountable to your New Years resolutions, and not just tell your peers how well you\u2019re doing. Remember, the reason why you\u2019re doing this should be for you, not for them.In years past I had always made some sort of resolution. I would do something like I want to lose weight or I want to be kinder to others. But this year I found that I\u2019ve bettered myself, I\u2019m happy with myself and I\u2019ve done all the important things I needed to do. Sure, I realize it\u2019s important to keep going, to keep working out, to keep being kind; but I don\u2019t think that requires a new resolution.I tend to make New Year\u2019s resolutions. Most of the time I don\u2019t keep them. This year I have a lot of good and healthy ones that I want to keep. For example i want to eat healthier, and spend less time on my phone and video games. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be.Personally I try to make \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d but I typically forget about them and move on. I do however, make sure that I try to improve myself in one way or another throughout the new year. Whether it\u2019s improving my grades, volunteering more, or simply just making sure I stay healthy and take care of myself. In general I believe that new year\u2019s resolutions are a bit clich\u00e9. Most people make them after they have had a rough previous year, and hope that the next year improves, but, usually it doesn\u2019t. Usually we create a mindset that we are going to improve ourselves and our lives by making these resolutions but the average person doesn\u2019t actually try to keep up with them. We simply state what we want to do to improve ourselves for the next year and made mediocre steps to complete that goal. I do believe that some people really can and will complete their new year\u2019s goal, and I applaud those people because usually I, myself, cannot complete the many goals that I have set for myself at the beginning of the year. I only have one goal this year and it\u2019s to take care of myself, to make sure that I am healthy mentally as well as physically. The steps that I am willing to take in order to complete this goal is to, eat healthier, drink more water, (try to) procrastinate less and to make time to hangout with loved ones such as friends and family. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be._________I think 2018 will be a year full of disagreement and conflict in our government and country. I feel like Trump will continue to lead our country in a direction that won\u2019t benefit us. I also believe that we will go into further debt.2017 was a year to remember. There were a lot of events that have raised questions and caused tensions to rise. With trump being elected there has become a great division within the country. He has also started rising conflicts with other nations most notably North Korea. Now that it is 2018, I believe things can get better. Now that we went through an entire year with the way things have ran, people will wake up and begin to take a stand in what they believe. Both parties of congress will start to work together to some extent because the president is somewhat against his own party. I think we will start to see a lot more states that are usually red will start to tip blue or at least not be as red. The House will become split after the midterms. I believe many of the social issues such as taking a knee and the me too movement will only continue. I do believe however if the movement continues we will have more and more people become against it because it is starting to take the form of a witch hunt. Countries will try to find better ways to crackdown on terrorist. As for the Korea missile crises, I believe that it is very likely that Russia will try to step in and force the situation. That is if Putin wins his next election which I think he could lose. If he does win it will be a close one. In the world of sports, I believe the Saints will win the Super Bowl, Arkansas the college mens baseball championship, and the Boston Celtics the 2018 NBA Finals.Our world in general will not change in 2018. The idea of 2018 being a new year is just a label. Even though the new year seems like the epitome of all things change, nothing ever does. I predict there will be just as much if not more conflict. As for U.S. politics, I believe Donald Trump will further his border wall agenda and attacks against other countries. I believe the economy will continue to improve as it has, and stocks will continue to rise. Fashion will continue to be increasingly edgy and our culture will continue to be rivaled by racism, bigotry, and societal conformity. As for my family and loved ones I hope they have a happy, safe year and I wish for academic and athletic success for myself.I predict that 2018 will be no better than 2017. There have been so many countless global, national, and local disasters in 2017, that they cannot be recovered by 2018 or possibly even 2019. In fact, such disasters will continue to pile on to the existing ones and eventually there will be more than we can bare and shortly after, there will be nuclear war and an extinction the human race. I am only predicting extreme circumstance because after what 2017 left us with, going to extreme measures is the only way we can prepare for what 2018 holds for us. I mean think about it. We put a racist businessman who has no logical knowledge on how to be a leader in charge of our nation. How can I not predict that there will be a nuclear war? But that is only my political predictions for 2018. As for economic predictions, I can honestly say I don\u2019t know. Finally, the future for the realms of culture, arts, fashion, and style is looking bright. Despite all of the political and economic dilemmas that will go on, I feel like culture, arts, etc. will truly flourish because I\u2019ve noticed in 2017, that people began to embrace their love for different cultures and arts and I think it will continue like that in 2018. But, in the end, the bad overshadows the good and despite such improvements in the arts and culture, the political issues will rise higher. But, these are only my predictions. Maybe, that won\u2019t happen. Maybe everything will lighten up in 2018. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.2017 was a year overcome by an overwhelming blanket of controversy and violence. However, it is possible that some of this could be resolved in 2018, especially with the formation of improved policies around the world to hinder gun violence, drug abuse, and terrorism. Furthermore, the people of the United States have been hiding under their desks in fear of a nuclear attack or getting hacked. I predict that in 2018, the Russia investigation on the hacking in the 2016 election that had plagued the nation for the past year will be progressed upon, and the United States will become a more secure nation as a whole. Along with the booming economy, this development could bring America to a state of enhanced greatness and prosperity. Although there is still a lingering issue with \u201cRocket Man\u201d in North Korea, hopefully there will be a continuation of the six-party talks or some form of bilateral treaty with the aggressive nation that will leave countless countries feeling much more secure. Outside of politics, there will most likely be major changes in the world of entertainment. With widespread debate over national anthem protests in leagues such as the NFL, there will most likely be a shift in viewership of this sport, to other leagues such as the NBA or the NHL. This was mildly evident during this football season, but more viewers will most likely return to watch the upcoming playoffs, and the New England Patriots winning another championship.2017 has been a very eventful year. Our country has experienced many catastrophes that range from political to economic. Politically, our country has elected a man who is hated by most. There has been a large variety of national disasters along with global and local ones. I predict that 2018 will not be much different than 2017 regarding these issues. For example, I believe that since the minimum wage increase, small businesses are going to be greatly effected. In order pay their employees, small businesses will have to increase their prices so that they will still be bringing the same amount of money into their business. Additionally, social media shows how people nowadays especially children will believe anything they see. This will negatively affect the minds of our youth as it has already done in some situations in 2017. 2017 was a year of unpredictability. We could not predict the various terrorist attacks, along with the hurricanes and the forest fires. I believe the 2018 will also be a year of unpredictability. There is no way of knowing what will come next. Positively, fashion and trends will continue to increase and change. Maybe there will be a fashion breakthrough. We will just have to wait and see. The world is constantly changing around us and there is no way of knowing what will follow next, like a story book. I guess we\u2019ll just have to keep turning those story book pages in order to see what will happen next, positive or negative._________You are what you wear. We can express a lot about our personality through our sense of style. Imagine a world where everyone wore the same thing, bought the same items and wore the same accessories. Fortunately, you can create and express your style in any way you wish through your feelings, thoughts and interest. Clothes say a lot about a person. Have fun with it!Personally, I think the way you dress has a huge impact on who you are and who you strive to be. But, your outfit does not always accurately define who you are. Some days I dress a little more edgy, some days I dress a little more preppy, but overall I dress how I am feeling that day.It\u2019s easy to forgot who are (and who you want to be) when you\u2019re going through school and ushered through life, but personal style helps me feel grounded. Sorting through vintage and thrift shops for hours on free weekends can almost seem tedious, but finding the right piece \u2014 an old military coat or patterned silk blouse \u2014 or even the very, VERY wrong piece \u2014 a pair of leather pants with cowhide patches or tasmanian devil underwear \u2014 helps me rediscover a little part of myself I sometimes feel is lost. Lots of color and accessories, jewelry and patterns \u2014 they all help remind me that I\u2019m me and I\u2019m alive and there\u2019s nothing greater than that. Cutting my hair in a split-second decision makes me feel in control and makes any other quick choice a lot easier to handle. Leather jackets and bright pink combat boots help me feel whole and are a celebration of life and of love and are, more than anything, a reminder that I am stronger than I may seem, and certainly stronger than I feel.Each day when I come into class, at least one classmate says \u201cooh she\u2019s got a different look today!\u201d I love changing up the clothes I wear and keeping my peers on their toes guessing what I\u2019ll wear next. There\u2019s really no way to describe my style. I take inspiration from all types of styles, grungy, preppy, chic, couture and more. I usually shy away from regular clothes you find at a mall and always find my key unique pieces at thrift stores. To get the real feel of vintage clothing, I even shop around in my grandmas closet! I would say my style reveals my personality, it shows I\u2019m always open to new things and I\u2019m unpredictable. I really only started to dress the way I do now about two years ago. What stopped me from really expressing myself in my outfits before was my fear for what others may think of me. I\u2019m glad I learned to let that go and just be me.If someone who is my moms age were to look at my overall style of clothing, they would probably say \u201cthat\u2019s something I would have worn when I was a kid\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say I dress in parachute pants and backwards caps, but I would say I dress differently from the modern t-shirts and jeans trends. I think my clothing choices say that I\u2019m unpredictable, I tend to wear things that are completely different from what I\u2019ve worn the day before. Although I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m the most original person on the planet, I know it\u2019s not true. The clothes I wear may be different, I might not wear any makeup at all and my hair may be shorter than the normal girl\u2019s hair, but I still take inspiration from those I\u2019d love to be one day. The types of girls who can wear absolutely anything on the market and constantly look amazing are the girls I\u2019d love to become. It takes time to fully understand who you are, personal style is a huge part of that. I would say I\u2019m experimenting with my style any way I can, even though I could completely change my mind tomorrow. It\u2019s a journey I\u2019m glad to take._________The most interesting city in the United States, in my opinion, is Detroit, Michigan. In my lifetime, I have never witnessed a more disappointing city, with less impressive attractions. First off, the sports teams in Detroit are an overall disaster. The Detroit Tigers, Detroit\u2019s astounding MLB franchise, finished last in their division, behind even the 67-95 Chicago White Sox. Additionally, the Tigers have won only four championship titles in the history of the MLB, and the last time they won was in 1984. Furthermore, the Detroit Lions, Detroit\u2019s incredible NFL team, has not appeared in the playoffs for 26 years. Along with this outstanding drought, the Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl Championship game. For some odd reason, I am amused by Detroit\u2019s lack of success in sports. This is not an insult, but I am waiting for the day where I look up at the television and see the sports teams of Detroit dominating everything. Other than its sports teams, Detroit is also plagued by abandoned houses and failing properties. Mobile homes and trailer parks are widely popular in this city, and this reflects some famous people from this city, such as Eminem, who often speaks of the poor conditions in this city. Despite its many downsides, Detroit does have rich history in music, and it has many museums and such that are fascinating and fun to explore. I find Detroit interesting because it is so abstract and different from every other city in this country.When I was about 8 years old, I moved from Maine to Pennsylvania. This was a HUGE change. Although, my all-time favorite place to go is Puerto Rico. I absolutely love Puerto Rico. When my dad asked me to go on this trip with me, I was hesitant at first. I am so glad that I went, though. I associate my favorite place, Puerto Rico, with the beach and sunshine because at that point in my life, I was very sad and I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone or do anything. When I dream about going somewhere, I dream of going to Australia because it is so different than the United States. It is on the opposite side of the world! I believe that everyone should be able to go to the place that makes them smile.I have grown up in a relatively small city in the south and lived there my entire life so far. I traveled to Washington D.C. when I was 12 years old, and ever since I knew that I wanted to live out my adult life there. Unlike Ms. Gerwig, I don\u2019t associate a person/people with the city, in fact, I\u2019ve always seen it as a symbol of my independence and freedom from the people in my small town. The reason I love D.C. is the rich culture in the city. Coming from a family of Italian immigrants, I have always been curious about other countries. My dream is to live in a nice apartment in D.C. and work at one of the foreign embassies. There isn\u2019t much diversity in my hometown as D.C., which is why I hope to move there eventually.Much like Ms. Gerwig, I have grown up in a small, suburban town. I too love New York, with its constant energy and amazing collection of people. However, not just New York is enticing to me. Of all of the places I\u2019ve been lucky enough to travel to, cities have always been my favorite part. I\u2019ve always loved going into Boston, even though it\u2019s just a short distance from my hometown. Philadelphia, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Prague, Dublin, and Barcelona have been where some of my favorite memories were made. Wherever I go, cities all seem to have an electricity from being filled with all different kinds of people. In a city, it seems that there is always something to do, always something happening, always new and interesting people who are different from each other. No matter where I end up in life, I want to be in the heart of this energy and life. I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s one city in particular that I know I\u2019ll be drawn to, but as long as I\u2019m in the midst of this excitement I think I will be very happy.The city that most captures my imagination is Boston, my home state\u2019s capital. I might want to live there one day when I am in my 20s. Boston has a special place in my heart for its millennial spirit and innovation. Boston is not too crowded, but when there are small concerts or protest rallies, the people of Boston come together to enjoy life. Friends stroll along the city sidewalks, laughing, while strangers politely greet each other. I love the tall buildings that soar above the city, surrounded by beautiful bodies of water like the Charles River. People can walk and bike in the welcoming atmosphere of Boston. What I love most about Boston is its culture and diversity. There are so many museums to explore and admire. My favorite painting is \u201cthe Dos Mujeres\u201d by Frida Kahlo in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. At night time, the city hums with jazz music by the park and chattering by the movie theater. I like visiting Boston, but one day, I would love to be a part of the city._________What caused the sudden outbreak of popularity for this simple game? Having the application myself, I have an inside opinion on why and how it has risen in popularity. Competition. The simple game brings upon a rather Americanized view on competition and the connotations that go along with winning and losing. Just the word \u2018loser\u2019 has extreme negative connotations as it implies that someone is less than others when a majority of people would rather be in the position of power that goes along with winning. Although this game is based off of facts that many people just simply would not know, it brings out the competitive and rather neanderthal ways of many people. Playing just one game of HQ, you would be able to discover many things about the human psyche and how detrimental a lose or a simple wrong answer can be to someone.Just yesterday morning, I got in my cousin\u2019s car at school and he told us about this addicting game, HQ. I had heard of it before, but I was nervous to download it. When my brother and I got home, we both downloaded the game and were waiting for the new game to start at 9. The prize for this game was $2000. As soon as the clock hit 9, we both joined.I think the appeal of the games lies in the fact that it is challenging and there is a chance for a cash prize. Trivia has always been popular, I remember when everyone was hyped over Trivia Crack. HQ is challenging, engaging, and just a fun experience overall. The hosts make (cringey) jokes which creates a bond with the players. Everyone loves Scott, the questions vary, and as it mentions in the article, the \u201cDarwinian aspect\u201d of the game, watching thousands of people get eliminated, boosts your ego for the time being and makes you feel superior. It\u2019s a very highly addicting game and I understand why after playing it.Advertisement"}

Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts, delivered his party\u2019s official response on Tuesday to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. For more coverage and analysis, read on \u00bb______Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to join you tonight.We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts \u2014 a proud American city, built by immigrants.From textiles to robots, this is a place that knows how to make great things.The students with us this evening in the autoshop at Diman Regional Technical School carry on that rich legacy.Like many American hometowns, Fall River has faced its share of storms. But people here are tough. They fight for each other. They pull for their city.It is a fitting place to gather as our nation reflects on the state of our union.This is a difficult task. Many have spent the past year anxious, angry, afraid. We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country. We hear the voices of Americans who feel forgotten and forsaken.We see an economy that makes stocks soar, investor portfolios bulge and corporate profits climb but fails to give workers their fair share of the reward.A government that struggles to keep itself open.Russia knee-deep in our democracy.An all-out war on environmental protection.A Justice Department rolling back civil rights by the day.Hatred and supremacy proudly marching in our streets.Bullets tearing through our classrooms, concerts, and congregations. Targeting our safest, sacred places.And that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs: this is not right. This is not who we are.It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics.But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.For them, dignity isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with but something you measure.By your net worth, your celebrity, your headlines, your crowd size.Not to mention, the gender of your spouse. The country of your birth. The color of your skin. The God of your prayers.Their record is a rebuke of our highest American ideal: the belief that we are all worthy, we are all equal and we all count. In the eyes of our law and our leaders, our God and our government.That is the American promise.But today that promise is being broken. By an administration that callously appraises our worthiness and decides who makes the cut and who can be bargained away.They are turning American life into a zero-sum game.Where, in order for one to win, another must lose.Where we can guarantee America\u2019s safety if we slash our safety net.We can extend health care to Mississippi if we gut it in Massachusetts.We can cut taxes for corporations today if we raise them for families tomorrow.We can take care of sick kids if we sacrifice Dreamers.We are bombarded with one false choice after another:Coal miners or single moms. Rural communities or inner cities. The coast or the heartland.As if the mechanic in Pittsburgh and the teacher in Tulsa and the day care worker in Birmingham are somehow bitter rivals, rather than mutual casualties of a system forcefully rigged for those at the top.As if the parent who lies awake terrified that their transgender son will be beaten and bullied at school is any more or less legitimate than the parent whose heart is shattered by a daughter in the grips of opioid addiction.So here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both. We fight for both. Because the strongest, richest, greatest nation in the world shouldn\u2019t leave any one behind.We choose a better deal for all who call this country home.We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive.We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford.We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction.We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top C.E.O.s making 300 times the average worker is not right.We choose Fall River.We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads aren\u2019t paved with power or privilege, but with honest effort, good faith, and the resolve to build something better for their kids.That is our story. It began the day our Founding Fathers and Mothers set sail for a New World, fleeing oppression and intolerance.It continued with every word of our Independence \u2014 the audacity to declare that all men are created equal. An imperfect promise for a nation struggling to become a more perfect union.It grew with every suffragette\u2019s step, every Freedom Riders voice, every weary soul we welcomed to our shores.And to all the \u201cDreamers\u201d watching tonight, let me be clear: Ustedes son parte de nuestra historia. Vamos a luchar por ustedes y no nos vamos alejar.You are a part of our story. We will fight for you. We will not walk away.America, we carry that story on our shoulders.You swarmed Washington last year to ensure no parent has to worry if they can afford to save their child\u2019s life.You proudly marched together last weekend \u2014 thousands deep \u2014 in the streets of Las Vegas and Philadelphia and Nashville.You sat high atop your mom\u2019s shoulders and held a sign that read: \u201cBuild a wall and my generation will tear it down.\u201dYou bravely say, me too. You steadfastly say, black lives matter.You wade through floodwaters, battle hurricanes, and brave wildfires and mudslides to save a stranger.You fight your own, quiet battles every single day.You drag your weary bodies to that extra shift so your families won\u2019t feel the sting of scarcity.You leave loved ones at home to defend our country overseas, or patrol our neighborhoods overnight.You serve. You rescue. You help. You heal.That \u2014 more than any law or leader, any debate or disagreement \u2014 that is what drives us toward progress.Bullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.Politicians can be cheered for the promises they make. Our country will be judged by the promises we keep.That is the measure of our character. That\u2019s who we are.Out of many. One.Ladies and gentlemen, have faith: The state of our union is hopeful, resilient, enduring.Thank you, God bless you and your families, and God bless the United States of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, C.D.C. Director, Resigns Over Tobacco and Other Investments", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlex Azar, the newly appointed secretary of Health and Human Services, announced the resignation of the director, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald. An agency statement cited her \u201ccomplex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all her duties as the C.D.C. director.\u201dThe statement continued: \u201cDue to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period. After advising Secretary Azar of both the status of the financial interests and the scope of her recusal, Dr. Fitzgerald tendered, and the secretary accepted, her resignation. \u201dMr. Azar, a former executive with Eli Lilly, made the decision on his third day running the sprawling H.H.S. agency. Dr. Anne Schuchat, a veteran official with the C.D.C., was named acting director \u2014 the position she had filled before Dr. Fitzgerald took office. She has had prominent roles in many of the agency\u2019s emergency responses to disease outbreaks and vaccine programs around the world.Before assuming the post, she also had investments in major tobacco companies, including Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International, and Altria Group. Those were also sold in October, along with many of her other holdings.A former Georgia health commissioner, Dr. Fitzgerald was appointed to the federal agency last July by Tom Price, a fellow Georgian who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s first H.H.S. secretary \u2014 until he too was forced to resign under fire, for traveling extensively on private jets and expensing more than $400,000 for those trips to the government. Mr. Price\u2019s investments in health-related companies had also come under scrutiny while he was in government.In a September ethics agreement, Dr. Fitzgerald said she would divest from many stocks that might pose a conflict of interest. The other investments included CVS Health, Quest Diagnostics, AbbVie, and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, among others. But she also said that she and her husband, Dr. Thomas Fitzgerald, were unable to divest from some holdings because of legal or contractual restrictions. Those were GW Ventures and Greenway Messenger, which are limited liability companies formed to invest in Greenway Health LLC, an electronic health information company, and Isommune, a biotech company focusing on early cancer detection.Dr. Fitzgerald pledged to avoid any C.D.C. work that would affect those holdings, drawing criticism from Democrats who said such recusals would limit her effectiveness. In December, Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel that oversees the agency, expressed concerns that Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s recusals on issues involving cancer and opioids prohibited her from dealing with two of the biggest health problems in the country.And even as she divested from many holdings in health-related companies, some members of Congress continued to express concern that those investments could compromise her positions on a variety of agency matters.\u201cIt is unacceptable that the person responsible for leading our nation\u2019s public health efforts has, for months, been unable to fully engage in the critical work she was appointed to do,\u201d Senator Murray said Wednesday. \u201cDr. Fitzgerald\u2019s tenure was unfortunately the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s dysfunction and lax ethical standards.\u201dBut Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s predecessor at the C.D.C., Dr. Tom Frieden, issued a statement that suggested the latest investments causing concern were made by a portfolio manager without Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s knowledge. In August, financial disclosures show she purchased stocks in several companies that might conflict with her activities at the agency, including Japan Tobacco, the drugmaker Merck, and Humana, the health insurer. The records show she then sold those and other health stocks in October.\u201cI have spoken with Dr. Fitzgerald and believe her when she says that she was unaware that a tobacco company investment had been made,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201cShe understands that any affiliation between the tobacco industry and public health is unacceptable, and that when she learned of it, she directed that it be sold.\u201dBut Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group, said not knowing about the investments a manager is making on your behalf is not an excuse. \u201cYou cannot just say the manager can do whatever he or she wants to do as long as I don\u2019t know about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the conflict of interest code.\u201dThe tobacco-related investments alarmed others. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that the director of the Centers for Disease Control, which plays a major role in reducing tobacco use, would purchase stock in a tobacco company,\u201d said William B. Schultz, a former general counsel for H.H.S.The agency has been tackling several tough issues this year, including potential budget cutbacks and a flu epidemic that claimed more lives this week and closed some schools across the country. About 80 percent of the cases this season are of the H3N2 strain, and officials said last week the rate of hospitalization among flu sufferers was particularly high this year. The agency plays a critical role in tracking the number of illnesses and deaths and helping coordinate the public health response.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the committee that oversees the C.D.C., said he looked forward to working with Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s successor to tackle a host of critical health issues. \u201cHow to turn the tide in the opioid crisis, how to prevent more flu deaths, how to be ready for the next outbreak of infectious disease or food-borne illness,\u201d he said.A two-time congressional candidate, Dr. Fitzgerald, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was active in Republican politics and had close ties to other prominent Georgians \u2014 among them, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, and an early adviser to President Trump.Pam Belluck, Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Katie Thomas contributed to this article.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Guns \u2014 When Trump Can\u2019t Even Tweet", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI don\u2019t know if you heard, but this week a boy with a handgun killed two of his fellow students at a high school in Kentucky.\u201cIt is unbelievable that this would happen in a small, close-knit community like Marshall County,\u201d said the governor, Matt Bevin.Actually, that part is completely believable. Given that another school shooting this week was in Italy, Tex., population under 2,000. And that two months ago, 25 people were shot to death while attending church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., population 362.It\u2019s about guns, not population density. And it is a huge story. But I know, people, you have been beating your heads against the wall about this issue forever, and a certain numbness creeps in. \u201cYou had the worst mass shooting in the country in Las Vegas, followed by a really horrific event in a church. People just get worn out,\u201d said Mark Kelly, who co-founded a gun-safety organization with his wife, then-Representative Gabby Giffords, after she was shot in the head while meeting with her constituents.The unusual thing about that terrible Manhattan tragedy is that it was not committed with a gun. Depending on how you count them, we\u2019ve had around 30 acts of terrorism since 9/11 that involved multiple deaths. More than half were committed by right-wing extremists (think Charleston church shooting). And virtually all of them were gun violence.So, this is the time when we talk about gun regulation. Come on. Energize.We are resigned to the fact that there is nothing, no matter how horrific, that will convince any politician in the thrall of the National Rifle Association to consider even the most modest gun-safety legislation. After the Las Vegas massacre, in which the murderer had purchased at least 55 weapons in the year leading up to the shooting, Kentucky\u2019s Governor Bevin seemed to feel the most unbelievable part was the call by \u201cpolitical opportunists \u2026 for more gun regs.\u201d He tweeted: \u201cYou can\u2019t regulate evil\u2026\u201dMaybe not, but you can definitely try to disarm evil. A super-modest bill banning bump stocks \u2014 the device the Las Vegas killer used to turn the semiautomatic rifles he could buy legally into functional machine guns \u2014 was introduced in Congress and then shuffled away. Las Vegas can\u2019t ban bump stocks since there\u2019s a state law prohibiting municipalities from doing that kind of thing on their own. Nevada is very strict about this, although not nearly as strict as Kentucky, which makes elected officials criminally liable for passing gun-safety laws.Another super-modest bipartisan bill aimed at beefing up the background check system was introduced after the church shooting in Texas, in which the mass murderer never should have been cleared to buy a gun, even under the stupendously lenient American system. And nothing has happened.\u201cIt\u2019s a little stuck,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the co-sponsors.Trump\u2019s call for action after the Sutherland Springs church shooting was limited to one tweet. (\u201cMay God be w/ the people \u2026 The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene.\u201d) Nine days later, when a man with a history of mental illness and a semiautomatic rifle crashed through the gates of the tiny four-classroom elementary school in Rancho Tehama, Calif., spraying bullets, there was no mention at all. Some people suspect Trump would not express any concern about California if the entire state cracked off and fell into the sea.The good news \u2014 you needed some, right? \u2014 is that the gun-safety advocates are not worn out. \u201cEvery great social change movement had moments where you had to convince yourself not to give up,\u201d said Senator Murphy.If they keep at it, someday we\u2019ll get a new president who doesn\u2019t believe the only answer to mass shootings in public schools is an occasional tweet about thoughts and prayers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, Low Expectations in a Low-Yield World", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prospect of a strong economy in the United States and a strengthening one in much of the rest of the world is good news for workers and for many companies. But for bond investors, it is a headache.Yet in 2017, many investors turned to bonds anyway. Nearly $380 billion found its way into bond funds, nearly double the flow into stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.That makes a certain amount of sense in Year 9 of a bull market that has lifted the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index more than 370 percent since the 2009 low. When stocks seem risky, core bonds are safer havens.What\u2019s worse, if the economy remains strong, there is a good chance that yields will move higher. That is a problem for fixed-income investors because rising bond yields mean falling bond prices. For people holding bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, total return is a combination of yield and price. It all makes it less likely that core bond funds \u2014 those that focus on high-quality securities \u2014 will be able to match the 3.7 percent average gain for 2017, which was 1.5 percentage points ahead of the inflation rate.\u201cWe are in a transition market,\u201d Mr. Bhatia said.Why has this happened? Shorter rates are being pulled upward by the Federal Reserve from the near-zero level that the Fed instituted during the financial crisis.Longer term rates, on the other hand, are constrained by the expectation that inflation will remain very low in 2018.A 2 percent inflation rate would most likely just nudge long-term rates higher, he said, adding that he expects a \u201cslow and low trajectory\u201d for long-term rates. His base case is that the 10-year Treasury rate, now at about 2.5 percent, won\u2019t rise much beyond 2.7 percent.Shifting economic and market dynamics in 2018 may raise the value of small tweaks to basic bond portfolios.The high-quality United States bonds in the aggregate bond index will deliver on their main purpose in your 401(k): When stocks falter, these bonds will hold their ground, and they may even rally. But the aggregate index will also be very sensitive to Federal Reserve interest rate increases, as 37 percent of the index is invested in Treasuries and another 27 percent in government agency bonds.The recently enacted tax package could also be a moderate benefit for corporate bonds. With a lower corporate tax rate, businesses are expected to bring more foreign earnings home, increasing the cash available to pay for dividends and share repurchases. That could mean the supply of new corporate bonds will shrink a bit, as companies lose some appetite for issuing debt to bolster shareholder returns.Investors who enjoyed the strong 6 percent return for multisector bond funds in 2017 should take note that on average, more than one-third of the assets of these go-anywhere bond funds is invested in junk bonds, according to Morningstar.Emerging market bonds may be the best relative value for bond investors these days, considering that in many countries, economies are growing, inflation is low and central bank policy is reasonably strong.\u201cIn the past, it was emerging markets that held all the debt, but now all the debt is in Japan, Europe and the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock. In 2018, the best opportunities for positive returns after accounting for inflation could be in emerging markets.Even if the returns in money market funds are low, you are paid something to park your money on the sidelines while waiting for sell-offs in bonds and stocks to present better prices to reinvest.\u201cSuddenly, it\u2019s an asset class to consider,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These 3 Mutual Funds Reaped Big Gains From Small Companies", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an era that rewards outsize personalities and grandiose dreams \u2014 \u201cGo big or go home,\u201d as the saying goes \u2014 staying small seldom brings kudos.But for the managers of three of the top-performing mutual funds of the fourth quarter, investing in the market\u2019s mice \u2014 small-capitalization stocks \u2014 gave enormous gains. The trio define their mandates differently, but all often favor smaller fare.Mr. Barbee wants to buy stocks at steep discounts to his estimates of their worth. In particular, he assesses how a company\u2019s book value \u2014 the net accounting value of its assets \u2014 compares to market values. The assets can serve as a floor for a stock price, because, in theory, a company shouldn\u2019t be worth less than the net value of its assets.Several years ago, Mr. Barbee\u2019s digging led him to gold. \u201cThe gold miners, from 2011 and 2015, they were down something like 90 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about the broader market, in the Great Depression, it fell something like 90 percent. So you had this extraordinary collapse in valuation as the price of gold dropped.\u201d When the metal price rebounded over the last couple of years, so did the stocks.A willingness to wager on the unloved also prompted his investment in Resolute Forest Products, a lumber, paper and pulp company based in Montreal. \u201cThere\u2019d been a tremendous investor focus on declining newsprint sales,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advent of the internet and digital delivery has changed the news business, and this was causing huge declines in newsprint demand.\u201dResolute is the world\u2019s biggest producer of newsprint. But, having emerged several years ago from a bankruptcy, it had restructured, emphasizing tissue making and lumber production. As a result, Mr. Barbee said, \u201cPeople are now seeing this as a lumber company instead of a declining newsprint business.\u201d That translated into a fourth-quarter surge, when the stock rose more than 100 percent.That jump contributed to an overall fourth-quarter gain for Aegis Value of 21.66 percent, compared to 6.64 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. The fund, whose retail shares have a net expense ratio of 1.75 percent, will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year. Over its life, it has returned an annualized average of more than 10 percent.Resolute, for example, \u201cwas really cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThe book value was about $20 a share, and I bought at about $4. Even if you took the value of the newsprint away, it was still worth more than $4.\u201dMr. Chou\u2019s United States funds are relatively new \u2014 Opportunity began in 2010, as did his United States bond fund \u2014 but he has managed money in Canada for more than 30 years. His biography is unusual. He didn\u2019t attend business school or toil at another investment company. Rather, he was a telephone-company technician, enamored of the stock market, and persuaded several friends to start an investment club. The club evolved into his first Canadian mutual fund.He likens his investing style to bargain hunting at the store. \u201cWhen you go shopping, you try to buy at a discount,\u201d he said. \u201cI do the same thing.

Its valuation seemed as if it was totally dependent on newsprint.\u201dMorningstar, the investment information company, classifies Mr. Chou\u2019s fund as a small-cap value offering, based on its holdings. But the fund can invest more broadly. Lately, for example, it has held large quantities of bonds and cash \u2014 the cash accounted for about one-fifth of its assets at September\u2019s end.\u201cIf you\u2019re really picky, you may not be able to buy anything for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t find anything I like, I\u2019ll stay in cash.\u201dMr. Chou\u2019s fund returned 16.94 percent in the fourth quarter. It has a net expense ratio of 1.2 percent. For the last several years, Mr. Chou has not taken a management fee because he said he has been unsatisfied with the fund\u2019s performance \u2014 the fund lost money in 2015 and 2016. He said he plans to begin taking the fee again.To find potential investments, he first identifies big economic themes \u2014 two recent favorites are \u201cmoney in motion\u201d and \u201chigh-quality construction\u201d \u2014 and then buys stocks that stand to benefit.\u201cMoney in motion\u201d means online banking, especially enabled by smartphones. While banks have offered online services for several years, Mr. Ely said consumer acceptance has advanced as the services have become easier to use. \u201cI don\u2019t think my son has ever been to a bank,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd soon we\u2019re all going to do our banking online.\u201d That\u2019s why his fund holds both Epam Systems, a tech company whose offerings include financial-services software and LendingTree, an online lender and financial marketplace.\u201cHigh-quality construction\u201d is Mr. Ely\u2019s shorthand for where he sees growth in home building. Residential construction has been sluggish since the financial crisis, but the market is providing pockets of promise, he said. People continue migrating to places with \u201clower taxes and better weather,\u201d like Tampa, Fla., Charleston, S.C., and Austin, Texas. So home building there is picking up, as are the stocks of builders that operate in the region, like LGI Homes, a recent top holding of the fund. Even in parts of the country where new construction remains slow, like the Northeast, people are increasingly renovating homes, he said.By investing in American Woodmark, a cabinet manufacturer, Mr. Ely said, he aims to exploit both trends. New houses need cabinetry, and cabinet-heavy kitchens and bathrooms are \u201cthe leading areas people look to for improvements to their homes,\u201d he said.The Delaware fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.21 percent, returned 18 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}

That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year.

But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices.

But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn all-night Rick Owens rave, Kendall Jenner hits Milan \u2014 and more highlights (on and off the runways) in London, Milan and Paris.The young designer was crowned Emerging Men\u2019s Wear Designer of the Year at last month\u2019s 2017 British Fashion Awards \u2014 and with his fall/winter 2018 men\u2019s show, he proved that he certainly earned the distinction. Never one to shy away from the theatrical, Jeffrey\u2019s very personal runway show began with ghoulish performers moving about the show venue in a screaming-and-howling rage, which he said was intended to highlight the challenges of a queer upbringing. The performance \u2014 which was choreographed by Jeffrey\u2019s friend and longtime collaborator Theo Adams \u2014 featured dancers throwing themselves onto the crowd. The collection, his strongest yet, revealed remnants of Jeffrey\u2019s Scottish background (tartan and heavy knits) mixed with his peculiar yet masterful approach to tailoring. But it was the performance\u2019s scare tactic that left a considerable impression on the attendees even two cities later. Anyone who has seen Luca Guadagnino\u2019s 2009 film \u201cI Am Love\u201d will know Villa Necchi Campiglio, an iconic modernist home in the center of Milan. The structure, which was built between 1932 and 1935, has proved to be an ideal backdrop for Tod\u2019s men\u2019s wear collections, which have been presented there for the past few seasons. But this January, things felt a little different: To celebrate the new faces of its spring 2018 campaign, Tod\u2019s hosted a cocktail party for Roberto Bolle, an Italian principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater, and Kendall Jenner. Swarms of fans congregated outside the doors of the historic house; only those lucky enough to get through the congested front door were able to enjoy the reception and meet Bolle and Jenner inside one of the greatest houses in Europe. Balmain shows are typically over-the-top productions to complement Olivier Rousteing\u2019s equally over-the-top designs. And this season was no different, but amid the bright lights, thumping music and beaded and chain mail clothing, there was a softer, more unexpected moment that occurred in the front row. Every season it\u2019s a tossup as to how the designer Martine Rose will showcase her latest collection. For the past two seasons, she has held fully-fledged runway shows on the outskirts of London, but in seasons past she has staged quieter presentations \u2014 in spring 2015, for example, she showed just one look. And sometimes she doesn\u2019t show at all, which was the case this season. Instead, Rose went to Paris for a buying appointment and quietly released her fall/winter 2018 look book, which featured oversized teddy coats, colorful jean jackets and silk shirts and snakeskin trousers. But it was a dinner that Rose hosted to celebrate her continued collaboration with Slam Jam (a streetwear distributor) and Napapijri (an activewear brand) that kept her squarely in the center of men\u2019s fashion month. The dinner was held at L\u2019Epi D\u2019or, a small classic Parisian bistro that she closed down for the evening. Rose said she wanted the event to be an insight into her life, a peek inside an authentic \u201cMartine Rose\u201d atmosphere. She filled her guest list with friends and family (her parents and baby son were there), and just a few members of the press \u2014 and distributed Polaroid cameras for people to use. All in all, the night felt like a welcome respite from fashion week. Ever determined to go against the fashion grain and follow his own rules, Demna Gvasalia decided to present his fall/winter Vetements collection off-calendar and way outside the Paris center, which disrupted the schedule for most fashion editors trying to stay on track with the evening\u2019s lineup of shows. But those who trekked to the Paul Bert Serpette March\u00e9 were able to walk through the corridors of one of Paris\u2019s famed flea markets after-hours. Editors sat (without assigned seating) on an assortment of vintage chairs and stools from the many booths that lined the market\u2019s alleys \u2014 and shop owners stood proudly in front of their stores watching the passing parade. It wasn\u2019t the first show this season that was held at a furniture-shopping site: In Milan, the young brand Sunnei invited guests to the Nilufar Depot, a three-story warehouse that stocks the gallery dealer Nina Yashar\u2019s design finds. It was a surprise, even to our own editors in attendance, to find The New York Times branding appear on not one but two runways this season. At Sacai, everyone\u2019s favorite model, Jonas Gl\u00f6er, walked down the parking garage ramp in a T-shirt printed with The New York Times\u2019s \u201cTruth \u2026\u201d campaign. Another model wore a hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with the words \u201cTruth. It\u2019s more important now than ever.\u201d It was a strong statement from the designer Chitose Abe, who also wore the T-shirt while giving her final bow. Advertisement"}

The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm.

{"Headline": "Tucked Into the Tax Bill, a Plan to Help Distressed America", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A little-noticed section in the $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last month is drawing attention from venture capitalists, state government officials and mayors across America.The law creates \u201cOpportunity Zones,\u201d which will use tax incentives to draw long-term investment to parts of America that continue to struggle with high poverty and sluggish job and business growth. The provision is the first new substantial federal attempt to aid those communities in more than a decade. And it comes as a disproportionate share of economic growth has been concentrated in so-called superstar metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and New York.If the zones succeed, they could help revitalize neighborhoods and towns that are starved for investment.They could also deliver a windfall, in the form of avoided capital gains taxes, for corporations and financiers who invest in the Opportunity Zones.Yet risks remain, including whether investors will steer dollars toward areas that really need investment.\u201cI had to explain it several times to folks,\u201d said Mr. Scott, whose co-sponsors on a previous iteration of an opportunity zone bill included Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and House lawmakers from both parties. \u201cI came out of one of these communities, so I believe that there\u2019s untapped potential in every state in the nation.\u201dMr. Scott said that he had discussed the plan with Mr. Trump and that the president had later spoken approvingly of it. But in the rush to pass the bill over the course of a few frenzied weeks, the idea was never debated on the floor of the House or Senate. It was never promoted by Republican leaders or the White House.\u201cThis is a little billion-and-a-half dollar part\u201d of the law, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cBut if it\u2019s successful, we\u2019ll look back 10 years from now and say this was one of the most important parts of the tax bill, and one we didn\u2019t talk nearly enough about.\u201dMr. Hassett has a longtime interest in providing tax incentives for economic development in distressed areas. He said he first began discussing opportunity zones with Mr. Parker several years ago at a meeting in Mr. Parker\u2019s Greenwich Village home. Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Hassett wrote several white papers to help elevate the idea as part of an extensive, multiyear effort by the Economic Innovation Group to win support.The national economy grew and added jobs during that period, but that growth was disproportionately in large cities. Metropolitan areas with at least one million residents provided just under half of America\u2019s jobs in 2010. But from 2010 through 2016, those metropolitan areas accounted for nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s net job creation, according to new research by the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Rural areas accounted for just 3 percent of the job growth in that time. From 2010 to 2014, according to the innovation group\u2019s research, rural areas saw more businesses close than open.The new tax law provision plays to that sweet spot. It instructs governors in each state and territory, along with the mayor of the District of Columbia, to designate Opportunity Zones from a pool of low-income, high-poverty census tracts, subject to certification by the Treasury secretary. States cannot nominate all their qualifying tracts for that status \u2014 they are limited to only a quarter of eligible tracts. Investors, like banks or hedge funds, then create Opportunity Funds to seed either new businesses in those areas, expansions of existing ones or real estate development.The people who invest in Opportunity Funds are able to minimize their tax burden through preferential treatment of capital gains.More than $2 trillion in unrealized capital gains are sitting on individual and corporate balance sheets across America, according to the Economic Innovation Group, the result of profitable investments in stocks and mutual funds. Normally, the proceeds from the sale of those assets would be taxed as a capital gain, at a maximum federal rate of 20 percent plus a 3.8 percent surtax. The new law offers investors an alternative: to roll those unrealized gains into an Opportunity Fund, and defer federal taxes on the profit, at least temporarily.That deferral grows into capital gains tax relief the longer the investment is held. An investor who retains an investment for seven years will pay only 85 percent of the capital gains taxes that would have been due on the original investment. If the investment is held beyond 10 years, the investor permanently avoids capital gains taxes on any proceeds from the Opportunity Fund investment.\u201cThis becomes its own asset class, and it could be a very large asset class,\u201d Mr. Parker said in an interview, referring to Opportunity Funds.Investors are already starting to take notice. A two-hour session on Opportunity Funds drew a standing-room-only crowd last week at the Winter Innovation Summit in Salt Lake City, said Patrick McKenna, founding partner of the venture capital firm High Ridge Global. Mr. McKenna has invested in distressed communities such as Baltimore and over the last year has tried to steer Silicon Valley dollars to struggling areas such as Youngstown, Ohio, out of a belief those areas contain untapped potential for growth and prosperity.Civic leaders are beginning to pitch state economic development officials on designating tracts of their communities as Opportunity Zones. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif., which the Economic Innovation Group ranks as the eighth-most distressed large city in America. \u201cIt makes communities like Stockton more attractive for investment.\u201dTurning distressed communities into attractive investments, however, is not a guarantee. One critique of the plan is that it might not leverage much investment in areas that really need it \u2014 be they Stockton, or Youngstown, or any other distressed community. Research suggests many previous federal attempts to increase investment in particular regions, such as Clinton-era Enterprise Zones, were largely ineffective. A more successful effort was the New Markets Tax Credit, a program that still exists and similarly gives incentives to invest in distressed areas but that is relatively limited in scope.State economic development officials worry that if they designate the wrong areas as Opportunity Zones, they could end up subsidizing investments that were in the pipeline anyway.\u201cJob one is getting the areas correct and really levering this, in the intent of the program,\u201d said Stephanie Copeland, executive director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. \u201cNot just making venture capitalists more money.\u201dMr. Parker said he planned to educate fund managers on how to best capitalize on the possibilities in distressed areas.\u201cEventually,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important that I put my money where my mouth is by investing in Opportunity Funds myself.\u201d He said that he expected it would take a year or two for the funds to catch on, but that the results would exceed expectations once they did.Advertisement"}

Inside was Mayor Bill de Blasio, at an interfaith prayer breakfast that went on for quite a while.By divine right of mayoralty, or someone, 13 vehicles waited at the curb in a no-standing zone, among them four black S.U.V.s (three Chevy Suburbans and one Yukon XL) an ambulance, a huge E.M.S. vehicle and a police school safety van. The engines on those big boys were running while the mayor was inside, for about two hours.At least one of the S.U.V.s had Taxi and Limousine Commission plates.

Bloomberg, are the very embodiment of a possible line of defense by the oil companies. Namely, that it wasn\u2019t the oil companies that created the greenhouse gases, but society in general \u2014 companies and individuals who used oil to generate electricity, or for transportation.The reason for the trip? Mr. Bloomberg was speaking at a conference on climate change.When was the last time?December 11, Mr. Phillips said.In the afternoon, WBUR aired an interview with the mayor by Meghna Chakrabarti about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s climate actions, which, besides the lawsuit, include a proposal to divest the city\u2019s pension investments in fossil fuel companies. These weren\u2019t political stunts, the mayor said, arguing that the lawsuit was akin to suits against tobacco companies.Wouldn\u2019t it be better to keep stocks in those companies and have a voice in changing them, the host asked.\u201cI think you have to vote with your feet sometimes,\u201d Mr. de Blasio replied.No kidding.Advertisement"}

What predictions can you make for global, national or local events? For your own personal life? Why?To borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts \u2014 global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers \u2014 the experts got the year wrong.They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher.Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade.\u2014 What predictions do you have about our world in 2018 in general?\u2014 What do you think will happen in global or U.S. politics?

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First State of the Union Address: A Call for Unity That Wasn\u2019t Always Heard That Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The centerpiece of the State of the Union address was what Mr. Trump called a \u201cdown the middle\u201d compromise on immigration, but Democrats booed some of his proposals.\u2022 The president called for bipartisan unity, citing infrastructure, but he gave no details and offered no road map for how to enact such an ambitious plan.\u2022 Also notable was what he left out. He made no mention of the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, nor did he acknowledge the #MeToo moment, even as female lawmakers wore black to mark the cultural moment.\u2022 Mr. Kennedy\u2019s use of Spanish in the middle of his speech signaled a different attitude toward immigrants than Mr. Trump\u2019s.The president promised an optimistic, bipartisan speech, and he largely avoided some of the negative imagery of past speeches. Gone was the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201dBut aside from a few offerings to the Democrats, mainly he appealed to enthusiastic Republicans. He did propose paid family leave and backed vocational schools and job training, winning grudging applause from Democrats.But his policy proposals were conservative: Keep open the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, burn coal, and above all, take on an immigration system that favors family reunification over skills-based migration.When he took office, President Trump painted a bleak picture of a country ravaged by economic turmoil, a landscape of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as he so memorably put it. A year later, he presented the nation on Tuesday night with a different narrative, one of a booming economy and a \u201cnew American moment.\u201dThe stock market has \u201csmashed one record after another.\u201d Retirement accounts have \u201cgone through the roof.\u201d Companies are \u201croaring back\u201d to the United States. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a long time,\u201d he exulted from the rostrum of the House chamber as he delivered his first formal State of the Union address. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming back.\u201dNever mind that in some fundamental ways the economy is growing no faster than it did at points during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Mr. Trump is at heart a salesman, and he rarely lets details get in the way of a good story. And by some measures, he has managed to convince many Americans, especially corporate leaders, that the economy really is surging in a way it has not for years.Read more of Peter Baker\u2019s analysis here \u00bbRepresentative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, emerged on the national stage to give the Democratic response \u2014 from \u201ca proud American city, built by immigrants.\u201dHere are some excerpts:\u201cIt would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.\u201d\u201cWe choose A Better Deal for all who call this country home. We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive. We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford. We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction. We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a full transcript \u00bbHe wasn\u2019t chosen as the official Democratic responder. But Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, spoke to his faithful with his own response to the State of the Union address.\u201cThe simple truth is that, according to virtually every poll, Donald Trump is the least popular president after one year in office of any president in modern American history. And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201dPresident Trump called for an infrastructure that would leverage federal dollars, state and local government contributions and private sector funds to total $1.5 trillion.But Democrats, who have pressed for infrastructure spending since Barack Obama was president, were not satisfied.\u201cPresident Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years. He expects states, localities, and the private sector to come up with $1.3 trillion on their own,\u201d said the office of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.Tonight\u2019s speech became the most Tweeted #SOTU or #Joint session address ever, passing last year\u2019s record of 3 million Tweets, according to Twitter.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump returned to a phrase he has used many times before: \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201dBut it has never been entirely clear what he means by it.Democrats were generally stone-faced for the president\u2019s address. But when Mr. Trump denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d some of them spoke out \u2014 with boos.For decades, immigrants who become American citizens have been able to sponsor their family members to join them from abroad. The \u201cfamily-based migration system\u201d has been relabeled \u201cchain migration\u201d by opponents, a new nomenclature not appreciated by many Democrats.\u201cI just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\u201d he said.Specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s order revokes an ill-fated January 2009 order signed by former President Barack Obama directing the government to close the prison within a year \u2014 a goal Mr. Obama failed to achieve. He did, however, winnow down the number of detainees, from the 242 he inherited from President Bush, to the 41 remaining there when Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Obama also refused to bring any new detainees to the prison. Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign that he intended to fill it back up \u201cwith some bad dudes,\u201d but to date his administration has not added any newly captured terrorism suspects to the inmate population, instead following the Obama approach of using law enforcement procedures and civilian courts to handle them.In August, Mr. Trump was on the cusp of signing it when he appointed the John Kelly, a retired marines general who formerly oversaw the prison operation as the leader of Southern Command, as his chief.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.In October, Mr. Trump declared that the crisis had become a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Overdoses killed about 64,000 Americans in 2016, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50.Mr. Trump mentioned the opioid crises again in his speech on Tuesday.\u201cWe must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting the number of overdose deaths in 2016. \u201cMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind having Congress enact legislation to update the 16-year-old statute that provides the legal basis for most counterterrorism operations around the world, making it explicitly cover the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS.\u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201dCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., in September 2001. It authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored or aided them \u2014 that is, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But in 2014, the Obama administration stretched it to justify combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without new Congressional sanction.That step was legally contentious because even though Islamic State grew out of an Al Qaeda affiliate, the two organizations had split and gone to war with each other. One of the reasons the Trump administration has not brought any Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo is warnings by legal specialists that doing so would risk giving a judge an opportunity to rule that the A.U.M.F. does not cover the group, jeopardizing the broader war.The Obama administration had fruitlessly asked Congress to enact a specific military force authorization for the Islamic State as well, while also saying it was legally unnecessary. But disputes over what it should say \u2014 including whether it should contain limits on duration, geographical scope, or the use of ground forces \u2014 prevented any consensus.President Trump praised Apple for a promise made earlier this month to invest $350 billion in the United States and create 20,000 domestic jobs over five years.But his speech was devoid of any mention of the role of technology in his vision for the economy. He called for legislation for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments for \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d He mentioned roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways. But he did not mention any of those funds going to the expansion and improvement of broadband internet networks.Trump talked about investing in work force development and job training. But instead of training for science, technology, engineering or math \u2014 or STEM \u2014 training, he talked about opening vocational schools.His words stood in contrast to State of the Union speeches by President Obama, who called for universal broadband for all Americans and the importance of spreading faster networks to close the digital divide.Yeah, there\u2019s the first lady\u2019s clothes or which big wig will fall asleep this year. But the State of the Union proceedings also have this bit of intrigue: Which cabinet official will earn the distinction of designated survivor?The mystery this time was solved two hours before Mr. Trump was due to give his address on Tuesday, when the White House said that the honor would go to Mr. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia and the president\u2019s agriculture secretary.Glamorous in title but, thankfully, not so far in practice, the designated survivor does not attend the president\u2019s address, and is poised to take over the commander-in-chief\u2019s responsibilities in the event that catastrophe strikes the Capitol and wipes out most of the government. If tradition holds, Mr. Perdue will be watching from a distant and secure location while Mr. Trump speaks.\u2014 Katie RogersHours before his first State of the Union address, President Trump told a group of news anchors at a lunch in the White House that his first year in office has taught him that the biggest difference between excelling in business and performing his current job is that governing takes compassion.\u201cI\u2019ve really learned a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump told the reporters, according to a partial transcript of an off-the-record lunch released publicly by the White House. \u201cIn doing what I\u2019m doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money \u2014 such as immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, who is expected to use Tuesday night\u2019s speech to call for a bipartisan compromise that pairs legal status for a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children with funding for a border wall, tougher enforcement and new restrictions on legal immigration, recently said he was hoping to sign a \u201cbill of love.\u201dThat tone is sharply at odds with the president\u2019s approach on immigration thus far, which has included a travel ban against visitors from six countries, slashing refugee resettlement and revoking temporary protected status for people from El Salvador and Haiti. He has been more publicly conflicted about his decision last fall to rescind DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has given legal status to certain people brought illegally to the United States as children.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned maybe more than anything else: You have to \u2014 you govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before.\u201dHere\u2019s a peek at the transcript:\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisDemocratic lawmakers have decided to put a face on the difficult negotiations happening in Congress over the fate of young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. They are bringing scores of such \u201cDreamers\u201d to the Capitol for Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address.Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s guest, Melody Klingenfuss, is just one of them. Born in Guatemala, she was brought to Los Angeles when she was 9, earned a degree in communications and political science from California State University, Los Angeles, a master\u2019s degree from the University of Southern California, then won protection under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2015.\u201cTonight, when President Trump looks into the gallery during his State of the Union, he will see the dignity, courage and patriotism of dozens of Dreamers,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.But there is a flip side. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, has called the cops.So much for the warm welcome.Mr. Gosar\u2019s fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake, didn\u2019t take kindly to his colleague\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri who faces a difficult re-election campaign this year, set the tone with a blast on Twitter.That concern is bipartisan, at least in some quarters of the Republican Party. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was flummoxed by the administration\u2019s decision:\u201cThat bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate. It was not partisan in the least,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cThe one thing we know for sure already is the Russians did attempt to meddle in our elections, and not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year, because we know that the Russians have not given up on their disinformation campaign and their attempt to sow discord in this country and also to undermine faith in democratic institutions.\u201dTestifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department had followed instructions under the sanctions law and drawn up a list of Russian targets for sanctions. An imposition of sanctions could still follow.President Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and one of the authors of the sanctions legislation, declined to criticize the administration\u2019s actions. He did say, \u201cI look forward\u201d to the implementation of the sanctions.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin spent part of the morning before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech tamping down expectations about a secretive Republican memo that some House members have claimed contains evidence that could undercut the Russia investigation.That was not enough to quiet the most ardent proponents of the notion that federal law enforcement agents have conspired to bring down the Trump White House. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, called on the president to release the memo during the State of the Union.\u2014 Nicholas FandosPresident Trump loves to brag about the stock market setting record highs, but on the day of his first State of the Union speech, the market isn\u2019t loving him back \u2014 for reasons that probably have nothing to do with him or his policies.As of midafternoon, Mr. Trump had not tweeted about the market news.\u2014 James TankersleyOne constant refrain from White House officials when it comes to State of the Union speeches is this: the president was personally involved in drafting the speech.It was no different on Tuesday as officials in President Trump\u2019s White House described a \u201crobust,\u201d monthslong process in which Mr. Trump actively reviewed drafts of the speech and repeatedly made suggestions of phrases or anecdotes or words that he wanted to be used when he delivers the address.The speech was assembled over weeks, with agency heads and cabinet secretaries offering suggestions on accomplishments that the president should highlight or priorities he could push for. Speech-writing meetings at the White House with Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top speechwriter, John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and others were coordinated by Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary.Aides said that in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump received printed drafts of the speech \u2014 with ample margins \u2014 and used a black felt marker to make additions, deletions and changes. They said he often edited the drafts in the Oval Office, but sometimes would come down from the residence in the morning with a new draft that he had marked up overnight.\u2014 Michael D. ShearAs the president prepares to speak, his campaign is preparing to cash in.\u2014 Rachel ShoreyChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has called the State of the Union address \u201ca political pep rally.\u201d But he is expected to attend tonight, along with three colleagues: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch, whom President Trump appointed to the court last year.Among the missing will be Justice Clarence Thomas, who has said that he cannot tolerate \u201cthe catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments.\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who has called the addresses \u201cvery political events\u201d and \u201cvery awkward,\u201d is also not expected to attend.Justice Alito famously mouthed \u201cnot true\u201d at the address in 2010 after President Obama\u2019s loose characterization of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case.Three members of the court will be out of town tonight: Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.The justices who do attend usually make coordinated choices about what statements from the president are uncontroversial enough to warrant applause.That is hard, Justice Alito said in 2010, because presidents \u201cwill fake you out.\u201d They may start with something bland, he said, like, \u201c \u2018Isn\u2019t this the greatest country in the world?\u2019 \u201c\u201cSo you get up and you start to clap,\u201d he said, \u201cand the president will say, \u2018Because we are conducting a surge in Iraq\u2019 or \u2018Because we are going to enact health care reform,\u2019 and then you immediately have to stop.\u201d\u2014 Adam LiptakAn eclectic cohort will join the first lady: emergency medical workers, service members and faces of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and immigration overhaul narratives. Here are a few of the people you\u2019ll see:For the full list, read on \u00bb\u2014 Emily BaumgaertnerAfter the women of Hollywood, the women of Congress.So far, a number of House members have complied, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.It is not, as it happens, the first time women have used clothing to send a message: at Mr. Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress last year, many of them wore suffragist white. In both cases, they let their clothes do the talking for them.\u2014 Vanessa FriedmanJonathan Horn, speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, has these thoughts:\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem for Donald Trump going into the State of the Union. He could come out with a very traditional State of the Union and for a normal president, that would help set the agenda for at least, you know, maybe a few weeks. In Washington, you\u2019d plan other policy speeches to follow up on certain aspects of the State of the Union and there would be an entire rollout around the State of the Union.I think with this president, you would expect it would be much shorter. Even if there is a surprise \u2014 Oh, look, Donald Trump sounded presidential \u2014 but then the next day there could be a tweet, and then, you know, work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by a 280 characters.That\u2019s my one prediction. In some sense, whatever he ultimately says is overshadowed by a 280-character tweet.\u201d\u201cThe power of that podium is not just the audience watching. It\u2019s the sense that the president is somebody who speaks for the whole country. And the way he has governed over the past year has been so filled with denunciations and racial division and flat-out falsehoods that he doesn\u2019t have a lot in the tank when it comes to credibility for anybody who isn\u2019t already an avid supporter.Often, these State of the Union addresses can be a time when the panoply of the presidency can give whoever the president is, sort of, a second chance with a lot of people. I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the case here.\u201dCody Keenan, chief speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, also had concerns:\u201cPresident Obama always wanted to close his State of the Union addresses with an argument about the state of our politics. You know, what can we do to make them better? What can we do to be better citizens? I always remember reading criticisms the next day, certainly from the left, saying why is he wasting real estate in the speech on that? It\u2019s never going to happen.\u201cWell, that\u2019s part of leadership. You know, there\u2019s a vision of what we should be, even if the odds of us getting there in one year or eight years is pretty slim.\u201d\u2014 Interviews by Michael D. ShearAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Wall Street Giant Makes a $75 Million Bet on Academic Philosophy", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe quants and their algorithms may have taken over Wall Street. But one investment legend is making a big bet on a more old-fashioned mode of analysis: philosophy.The gift, formally announced on Tuesday, appears to be the largest by far to a philosophy department anywhere in the world, the university said. It will allow the department, which will be renamed for Mr. Miller, to nearly double in size, to 22 full-time faculty members, while also supporting graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and new courses aimed at attracting undergraduates.\u201cI wanted the gift to go to something where it would have a significant impact, and change the trajectory,\u201d Mr. Miller, whose firm, Miller Value Partners, is based in Baltimore, said in a telephone interview.Philosophy, he added, \u201chas made a huge difference both to my life outside business, in terms of adding a great degree of richness and knowledge, and to the actual decisions I\u2019ve made in investing.\u201dBut Ronald Daniels, the president of Johns Hopkins, said Mr. Miller\u2019s gift would give a much-needed boost to the beleaguered humanities, at a moment when many universities, and the governments that support them, are heavily focused on the so-called STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.\u201cThis gift is so wonderfully contrarian,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cTo have someone of Bill\u2019s stature who is willing to lend an imprimatur to philosophy, this most ancient of disciplines, and to the idea of its continuing relevance as an end in itself, is simply spectacular.\u201dMr. Miller, whose father worked as a terminal manager for a trucking company, said he had essentially talked his way into the Ph.D. program at Hopkins, despite having taken only one six-week course in philosophy at the very end of his senior year.\u201cThey wanted to see three examples of your philosophical work,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any, so I took 30 days off the Army and wrote three papers.\u201dMr. Miller, who worked part-time in accounting during graduate school, completed the coursework and qualifying exams. But when it came time to start a dissertation, he looked at the difficult prospects of getting a teaching job, and left for (much) greener pastures.On Wall Street, Mr. Miller, an old-fashioned stock picker who focused on identifying undervalued companies, is famous for his 15-year streak beating the S.&.P 500, from 1991 to 2006, while at Legg Mason, where he spent most of his career. He was an early believer in Amazon, investing heavily at a time when most analysts were highly skeptical.\u201cThere was a huge amount of confirmation bias going on with Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an inability to do what Wittgenstein talked about in his \u2018Philosophical Investigations\u2019: crisscrossing the landscape from many angles, investigating in many different ways.\u201dThe scene, based on a real exchange, \u201cmade the person seem quite a bit more pompous than I think of myself as being,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\u201cIt is particularly insightful when trying to understand new social facts and structures such as crypto assets,\u201d Mr. Miller said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that Michael Bloomberg has given to Johns Hopkins over his lifetime.

Some lawmakers have suggested that the government should buy out ivory traders\u2019 stock and display it in a museum, or that traders should be compensated in some other way.\u201cTo expect ivory artisans in their 60s to change industries is impractical,\u201d one lawmaker, Peter Shiu, said Wednesday. \u201cDo you expect them to take online courses?\u201dBut other lawmakers pointed out that Hong Kong\u2019s traders have had almost 30 years to get out of the business since the global ban went into effect, and noted that they would have until the end of 2021 to do so under the new law. And they opposed the idea of compensation.\u201cProviding any form of compensation will signal that Hong Kong is buying ivory, which will likely cause a surge in poaching,\u201d said another lawmaker, Ted Hui.Wildlife advocacy groups say tens of thousands of African elephants are killed for their tusks each year.The efficacy of China\u2019s ban depends on cutting off access to ivory in Hong Kong as well, lawmakers and activists said. \u201cHong Kong is one of the last havens for smugglers to conduct their activities with impunity,\u201d Mr. Hui said.An earlier version of this article misquoted Peter Shiu, a Hong Kong lawmaker.

{"Headline": "Bargain Hunters Turn to Emerging Market Stocks", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBargain hunters have begun to pay close attention to emerging market stocks.They are a little late to the game. After all, momentum-driven investors have already noticed that shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like China and India came roaring back to life over the last year. Led by hot tech names such as Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group, many of them doubled in value in 2017.But now value-minded mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are rummaging in the parts of the emerging markets that many have ignored \u2014 staid sectors like manufacturing, mining and finance. Even these parts of the emerging markets posted sizable returns over the last year as global economic growth started to reaccelerate.But while the fast-growing segments of the emerging markets returned around 40 percent in 2017, the so-called value stocks rose about half as much.The more muted returns, coupled with the five-year bear market in emerging market equities before this surge, mean emerging market value stocks are still trading at relatively attractive prices. Some bargain hunters say emerging market value stocks are the only truly undervalued part of the global equity market.While the price-to-earnings ratio for the fastest-growing segments of the developing markets stands around 16, emerging market value stocks are trading at a P/E of just below 10.\u201cIf you can buy a well-diversified equity portfolio with a P/E of 10, you\u2019re getting an awful lot of earnings for each dollar of price you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Research Affiliates.There are risks, though, to the strategy of emphasizing value stocks in emerging markets. \u201cWhen most people think about the demographic trends driving the emerging markets and the high growth rates of India and parts of China, these things are all favorable to growth\u201d stocks, Mr. Jayaraman said \u2014 but not necessarily to value-oriented shares.But, he says, \u201cThe rubber band can only stretch so far\u201d when it comes to the rising prices of growth stocks.Ernest C. Yeung, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund, notes that in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate that much of the emerging markets have been mired in recently \u2014 where investors worry that growth will be hard to come by \u2014 \u201cpeople are willing to pay up for future growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why in this environment, high-quality growth stocks \u2014 names like Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 have done so well,\u201d he said. But that should start to shift, he said. \u201cWhen the macroeconomy recovers, value stocks normally begin to work.\u201dIn particular, value stocks in the financial industry stand to benefit.\u201cFinancials are a driven by the health of the macroeconomy and the direction of interest rates,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. And they\u2019re cheap.As a result, the stock now trades at just 0.7 times the bank\u2019s book value, which represents the net asset value of the company, compared with a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.5 to 2 before the global financial crisis. \u201cSo we are nowhere back to historical norms,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.The steel industry is another place that should thrive as the economy improves.\u201cThe common perception is that China keeps dumping cheap steel into the global markets,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. That may have been true several years ago, but the Chinese government recently carried out supply-side reforms that have reduced China\u2019s steel supply more than 20 percent, he said.As a result, Chinese exports have fallen more than 40 percent, creating breathing room \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for other emerging market steel producers.Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, notes that investors need not limit themselves to staid industries to gain exposure to attractively priced emerging market stocks.\u201cThink information tech based in Taiwan instead of China,\u201d she said.Why? A number of Taiwanese tech companies are regarded as old tech because they are involved in the manufacturing and supply chain that propels new economy tech products and services.Partly because Hon Hai is not regarded as a new economy name, the stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, compared with around 60 for Tencent Holdings, one of China\u2019s largest internet and social media companies.But Mr. Jayaram says that \u201cif we see better sales for iPhones in the first quarter, that could be a big catalyst\u201d to move Hon Hai\u2019s stock, too. And that creates a buying opportunity for bargain hunters right now.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.So what gives? The tax law.Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201dExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.Two points of note:Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that.

{"Headline": "The Trump Effect: Business, Anticipating Less Regulation, Loosens Purse Strings", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A wave of optimism has swept over American business leaders, and it is beginning to translate into the sort of investment in new plants, equipment and factory upgrades that bolsters economic growth, spurs job creation \u2014 and may finally raise wages significantly.While business leaders are eager for the tax cuts that take effect this year, the newfound confidence was initially inspired by the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory pullback, not so much because deregulation is saving companies money but because the administration has instilled a faith in business executives that new regulations are not coming.\u201cIt\u2019s an overall sense that you\u2019re not going to face any new regulatory fights,\u201d said Granger MacDonald, a home builder in Kerrville, Tex. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending more, which is the main thing. We\u2019re not seeing any savings, but we\u2019re not seeing any increases.\u201dThere is little historical evidence tying regulation levels to growth. Regulatory proponents say, in fact, that those rules can have positive economic effects in the long run, saving companies from violations that could cost them both financially and reputationally. Cost-benefit analyses generally do not look just at the impact of a regulation on a particular business\u2019s bottom line in the coming months, but at the broader impact on consumers, the environment, public health and other factors that can show up over years or decades.But in the administration and across the business community, there is a perception that years of increased environmental, financial and other regulatory oversight by the Obama administration dampened investment and job creation \u2014 and that Mr. Trump\u2019s more hands-off approach has unleashed the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of companies that had hoarded cash after the recession of 2008.Some businesses will essentially be able to get away with shortcuts that they could not have under a continuation of Obama-era policies. The coal industry, for instance, will not have to worry about a regulation, overturned by Congress and Mr. Trump, that would have protected streams from mining runoff.Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Trump administration might avoid big-splash regulatory rollbacks this year and instead would make it harder for federal agencies to block business expansion.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be sexy things like \u2018We\u2019re killing the Clean Power Plan,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hartl said, referring to the Obama-era rule aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. \u201cBut you can make it systematically harder for an agency to do the right thing.\u201dThat intention and its rhetorical and regulatory follow-ons have executives at large and small companies celebrating. And with tax cuts coming and a generally improving economic outlook, both domestically and internationally, economists are revising growth forecasts upward for last year and this year.Even before it became clear that Republicans would pass a major tax cut, capital spending had risen significantly, climbing at an annualized rate of 6.2 percent during the first three quarters of last year. Surveys of planned spending also show increases.Administration officials said last month that, since January 2017, federal agencies have delayed, withdrawn or made inactive nearly 1,600 planned regulatory actions. Further rollbacks will affect financial services as well as energy and labor rules, among others.And Mr. Trump has appointed outspoken critics of regulation to lead several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The evidence is weak that regulation actually reduces economic activity or that deregulation stimulates it. But business executives are largely convinced that the cost of complying with rules diverts money that could be invested elsewhere. And economists see a plausible connection between Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to prune the federal rule book and the willingness of businesses to crank open their vaults. Measures of business confidence have climbed to record heights during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year.\u201cThe notion that deregulation unleashes growth is virtually impossible to find in the data,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cWhat does matter is this idea that confidence matters. If their expectations about the future are positive, then it does make a difference.\u201dBusinesses acknowledge that the most important reason for their increased optimism is the simple fact that the domestic economy continues to expand, with few clouds on the horizon.In Japan, now in the middle of its longest period of growth since the early 1990s, the central bank said corporate investment was exceeding its expectations, and it raised its forecast.\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pa. \u201cThe entire global economy is on one page for the first time in over a decade. We\u2019re all moving in sync and that has everyone feeling good, not just here but across the globe.\u201dIn some industries, the administration\u2019s actions will allow companies to engage in activities they might not have been able to otherwise; electric utilities, for example, might be able to invest in upgrading power plants that run on fossil fuels, thanks to a promised rollback of Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to fight climate change.Mr. Trump has also installed individuals who have publicly questioned the need for many of the postcrisis rules in major policy roles, including at the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank stocks have been on a winning streak and ended 2017 up more than 15 percent, according to the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.\u201cThere has been some regulatory fixes for a lot of industries, and they would tell you that matters a lot,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who also leads the Business Roundtable. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to do a direct correlation. It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real.\u201dThe confidence is translating to industries that have not, as of yet, seen any obvious benefit or policy changes.\u201cWe have spent the past dozen years or longer operating in environments that have had an increasing regulatory burden,\u201d said Michael S. Burke, the chairman and chief executive of Aecom, a Los Angeles-based multinational consulting firm that specializes in infrastructure projects. \u201cThat burden has slowed down economic growth, it\u2019s slowed down investment in infrastructure. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is a big deregulatory environment.\u201dMr. Burke said he expected the actions to speed future projects for his company, though he declined to offer details, citing competitive risks.The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the administration\u2019s freeze on new regulations, in particular, appeared to have buoyed confidence. Though he cautioned that it could take years of research to pin down the magnitude of the effects, he said deregulation was \u201cthe most plausible story\u201d to explain why economic growth in 2017 had outstripped most forecasts.\u201cOur view is, the \u2018no new regulations\u2019 piece has to be more powerful than we thought,\u201d he said.Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s $27 Billion to Wall Street? An Alarming Drop in Revenue", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-seven billion dollars has gone missing on Wall Street.For more than a decade, the world\u2019s top investment banks practically minted money from the buying and selling of bonds, currencies and other complex securities. For many banks, the business became their lifeblood.Now, a combination of tough regulations, new technologies, calm markets and changing customer behavior has left that type of trading a shadow of its former self \u2014 and much of Wall Street trying to redefine itself.Five years ago, fixed-income trading \u2014 so called because its keystone product, bonds, typically provides a fixed payout \u2014 generated nearly $103 billion in income for the top 12 investment banks, according to Coalition, a London research firm.By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.The accelerating losses are likely to be on display over the next week as the biggest United States banks report their annual results, starting with JPMorgan Chase on Friday. Some analysts predict that fixed-income revenue could fall another 20 percent this year. Some large banks, including Deutsche Bank, have already warned that the bond-trading blood bath will get worse.The trend is not only depriving giant investment banks of a staple income source. It is also altering the pecking order and business practices of Wall Street in profound ways.Nowhere is the shift more pronounced, or more painful, than at Goldman Sachs Group, not long ago regarded as the unrivaled king of Wall Street. These days, the bank is fighting to maintain an edge that has been blunted by the diminution of its core trading business.At its peak, Goldman\u2019s fixed-income division churned out nearly a billion dollars every two weeks. Last year, it took the bank an average of more than two months to earn that sum.The shift has left its once cocksure traders at times reeling. One day last spring, for example, they were caught by surprise when energy prices began to move sharply. After a few inquiries, the traders learned that Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, the Mexican state energy company, known as Pemex, was buying instruments designed to protect against the possibility of falling oil prices.Not only was Pemex not using Goldman to execute the trades, but Goldman hadn\u2019t even been aware that the trades were happening. It was a rude awakening for Goldman, which previously had done tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of work for the Mexican government, helping it protect itself against swings in the oil market, current and former employees with knowledge of the trades said.Until a few years ago, traders at big banks spent much of their time wagering on the future direction of markets. Sometimes those trades were executed on behalf of clients; often, they were done using the banks\u2019 own cash. Successful traders pocketed a percentage of their winnings, earning Hollywood-style glory in the financial media.New government rules require banks to hold thicker capital cushions to guard against losses, which makes trading less profitable by tying up more of a firm\u2019s capital. Other regulations outlaw bank employees from trading with their companies\u2019 cash.That leaves traders spending much of their time looking for efficient ways to connect buyers with sellers.\u201cThese banks are basically utilities now,\u201d said Harley Bassman, who retired last year as a portfolio manager at the giant bond fund manager Pimco.Even when it comes to serving clients, traditional investment banks are finding themselves at a disadvantage to upstarts that move faster at a lower price.Michael Bumkeun Cho, a portfolio manager at Samsung Asset Management in Seoul, South Korea, which manages $200 billion, specializes in the trading of exchange-traded funds, baskets of stocks or bonds that are easily traded. He said he had stopped relying exclusively on banks for his trading when he learned that Jane Street responded more quickly to his trading orders and charged lower fees.\u201cWe understand the advantage of the independent market makers over the big investment banks,\u201d Mr. Cho said.Citadel Securities, part of the Chicago-based hedge fund conglomerate run by Kenneth C. Griffin, is also muscling in on the banks\u2019 traditional turf, using technology to undercut the banks on speed and price. One particular area that Citadel has targeted are interest rate swaps, an instrument that companies traditionally used to protect themselves against swings in interest rates.\u201cFor many years \u2014 decades, actually \u2014 the big Wall Street firms had a stranglehold on those clients,\u201d said Paul Hamill, global head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities at Citadel Securities. But two years ago, he said, it became clear that \u201csome banks were going to pull away from being all things to all clients.\u201d Citadel saw an opportunity.Compounding the pressure on banks, market conditions for the past year have been, well, boring.Traders \u2014 and by extension their employers \u2014 thrive in volatile markets. Rapid fluctuations in prices tend to generate lots of buying and selling among clients.But markets have been remarkably steady for more than a year. Nothing seems to shake them much anymore \u2014 not hostility with Russia, not President Trump\u2019s tweets, not saber-rattling on the Korean Peninsula.Traders and sales representatives in banks\u2019 fixed-income businesses are struggling to find ways to drum up business from clients. A rates salesman at a big American bank who was not authorized to speak publicly said it had become hard to even engage clients in a substantive conversation about their expectations for future market prices. He described having to hunt for conversation topics during phone calls with them \u2014 low volatility, it seems, can make for awkward silences.Amrit Shahani, the research director for Coalition, said he didn\u2019t see anything coming that would improve conditions for the biggest banks.\u201cI think you can expect another slow year in 2018,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The View From the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI have continued writing about Bitcoin throughout its remarkable rise, but I could have never anticipated the way the technology has broken out over the past year, with everyone from Vladimir Putin to mom-and-pop investors in South Korea looking at how to use and profit from the technology.These developments have been enough to turn me, over the last year, into essentially a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. It\u2019s safe to say that\u2019s a first for The Times.Before this all began, I was covering financial markets and banks from New York. That gave me a grounding to begin understanding this, but Bitcoin has turned into a very different kind of financial market. At the banks, I kept hearing about how they were taking this technology seriously as something that might change their business in the long run. That is because beneath the digital tokens, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of crowdsourced financial infrastructure, known as the blockchain, that allows for the creation of money and financial records that aren\u2019t maintained by any central authority like a bank or a government.Claims about Bitcoin\u2019s longevity differ dramatically. If you listen only to virtual currency aficionados, you would think that digital money is certain to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and kill Wall Street, to boot. I get dozens of emails every day from entrepreneurs who tell me how they are going to use the technology introduced by Bitcoin to revolutionize the music industry, or shipping business, or even democracy itself. Meanwhile, very smart people like Warren Buffett and Joseph Stiglitz have continued to say that the whole thing is just a bubble waiting to burst.How is a single journalist supposed to work through it all? It can feel a bit like being there at the invention of the stock market, but with no certainty that stocks would actually work as promised \u2014 and with everything hinging on software that few people understand.But from that first article about the Winklevoss twins, I have tried to focus, whenever possible, on the real people who are buying and using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and what is motivating them. That has taken me to Argentina, where I saw how people are using virtual currencies to escape the inflation their local currency is experiencing. It has also led me to the online black markets, where virtual currencies have made it easier for addicts to buy deadly drugs from China and for criminals to collect ransom payments.It is also the real-world usage that tests whether Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are able to live up to the big promises that they are making. With most virtual currency projects, I\u2019ve found that there are relatively few real-world transactions to back up the big, speculative bets that investors are making.Perhaps most fascinating is how these new currencies draw communities around them. It\u2019s a potent reminder that all money is a social construct: The more people who believe a Bitcoin or dollar will retain its value in a week, the greater the value the currency will have.But these are still early days. The death of Bitcoin has been wrongfully proclaimed many times already. For my part, The Times\u2019s rules against investing in what we write about has allowed me to be equally open to this going up or down.Beyond that, these virtual currencies are all living economics experiments, testing how different sorts of incentives create different behaviors. Bitcoin has an elaborate system of carrots and sticks designed to attract followers and to increase the cybersecurity of the Bitcoin network. But these incentives don\u2019t always work as expected. That uncertainty is what makes it so interesting to watch \u2014 and to report on.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Bomb Cyclone\u2019: Rare Snow in South as North Braces for Bitter Cold", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA powerful winter storm dealt a chilly blow to the Southeastern United States on Wednesday as Floridians marveled at the rare sight of snow and officials warned of icy roads and dangerously low temperatures. All the while, residents of the Northeast prepared for windy, whiteout conditions and potential power losses.The National Weather Service said blizzard warnings would take effect along the Virginia coast Wednesday, with travel \u201cvery dangerous to impossible\u201d in the highly populated Hampton Roads region, which they said could receive up to 12 inches of snow in places. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia declared a state of emergency. Blizzard conditions were expected to begin on Thursday in parts of Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, according to forecasters.\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of bags of rock salt,\u201d said Vic Kintanar, the manager of Waterman\u2019s Surfside Grille, a restaurant by Virginia Beach\u2019s boardwalk, hours before the storm hit. Workers had already closed off patio sections and were preparing for a smaller-than-usual crowd on Thursday.Though much of the South is accustomed to occasional winter snowfalls, Wednesday\u2019s storm was setting records, and setting teeth on edge, in a region where even a couple of inches of snow has the potential to hobble an entire metropolis \u2014 as was the infamous case in Atlanta in 2014, when a mess of snow and ice stranded thousands of cars on major roads for hours.In Georgia, where Gov. Nathan Deal declared an emergency for 28 southern counties, snow fell across rural areas and in Savannah, a city that normally swelters. On Wednesday, Savannah\u2019s temperature hovered in the 20s as the city recorded about an inch of snow.In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency, and his office said the National Guard was on standby. The Raleigh-Durham area tied a record low of 9 degrees that had been set in 1887.Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said the storm would move beyond his state overnight, but he warned that temperatures would remain frigid through the weekend.Mr. McMaster urged residents to ensure people and pets were safe. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get into heat, they\u2019ll freeze to death, and they\u2019ll be gone,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the same thing will happen to people who are outside.\u201dAt a grocery store in Charleston, S.C., Chris Brown, a father of two daughters, stocked up on food to prepare to be snowed in. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how heavy it is,\u201d he said of the snow. \u201cI\u2019m heading home to play with the kids.\u201dThe new round of shivering prolonged what has already been a difficult period in the country\u2019s emergency rooms. In the Atlanta area, where temperatures were hovering around freezing on Wednesday but were expected to plunge into the teens after nightfall, doctors said they had been seeing an unusual number of patients with weather-related emergencies.\u201cThis is the most challenging winter, in terms of exposure, that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Dr. Brooks Moore, the assistant medical director of the emergency department at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta\u2019s public hospital.Dr. Moore said about 20 people were arriving at the emergency room each day with minor complaints related to the weather, and that about the same number were appearing with conditions like asthma or emphysema that were exacerbated by the cold.He added that doctors were seeing more about one or two patients a day whose core body temperatures had fallen into the low 80s \u2014 normal is about 98.6 degrees \u2014 and required \u201caggressive re-warming\u201d techniques.When discussing the storm, some weather forecasters have referred to a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d Calling it a bomb sounds dire, but such storms are not exceedingly rare \u2014 there was one in New England recently.What makes a storm a bomb is how fast the atmospheric pressure falls; falling atmospheric pressure is a characteristic of all storms. By definition, the barometric pressure must drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours for a storm to be called a bomb cyclone.That\u2019s what happened at the end of October, when warm air from the remnants of a tropical cyclone over the Atlantic collided with a cold front coming from the Midwest. Among other impacts then, more than 80,000 electric customers in Maine lost power as high winds toppled trees.A similar effect was occurring Wednesday, as warm air over the ocean met extremely cold polar air that had descended over the East. Pressure was expected to fall quickly from Florida northward.The Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with heavy snowfall and wind chills of up to -25 degrees expected.Kathryn Garcia, the commissioner of the Department of Sanitation in New York City, encouraged New Yorkers to avoid driving and use mass transit instead.Chilly gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. are likely to whip eastern Long Island and southeastern Connecticut starting late Thursday morning, with the potential for downed tree limbs and scattered power failures, the National Weather Service said.For Bostonians, Wednesday\u2019s forecast high of 28 degrees was almost a welcome relief after days of temperatures that had hovered in or near the single digits. But it was quite literally cold comfort, with Thursday\u2019s storm expected to drop 10 to 14 inches of snow or more on the city and potentially create blizzard conditions along the New England coast.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have at least four major meals ahead of you,\u201d said Forrest McFarland, a retiree from Cambridge, Mass., as he made the rounds at Market Basket, a busy grocery store in nearby Somerville. \u201cSince \u201978,\u201d he said, referring to the legendary blizzard that ground the Northeast to a halt, \u201ceverybody stocks up.\u201dWashington, too, remained firmly in the grip of a winter that has already proved treacherous. The District of Columbia government activated its cold emergency plan on Dec. 27, and on Wednesday, it extended it further. Around an inch of snow is expected in the morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect until 11 a.m. Thursday.While visiting, Hamlet Diaz, 38, said the temperatures were exactly what he was hoping for as his family drove home from an Ontario vacation to Pembroke Pines, Fla.\u201cWe wanted to be cold,\u201d he said of his wife, Rachel, and two daughters. \u201cRight now, 8 degrees is what we want.\u201dSnow even fell on Tallahassee, Florida\u2019s capital. More than 50 miles of Interstate 10 were closed in the Tallahassee area, as well as parts of Highway 90. Mark Wool, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that flurries seemed to come along every few years there. But the snow accumulation Wednesday \u2014 about a tenth to two-tenths of an inch \u2014 had not been seen since 1989.\u201cWarblers, thrushes, tanagers, they\u2019re down in Central and South America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe birds that winter in the Southern U.S. are better able to withstand the temperatures and have more flexibility in terms of the food they can eat.\u201dMr. LeBaron said that waterfowl and marsh birds might be affected if there was significant snow cover or if water sources were frozen over. And he warned that the increasing number of hummingbirds that spend the winter in the South might be affected, and said that people who maintain the birds\u2019 feeders should keep the feeders warm and well supplied.But he said that the short amount of time the cold was expected to last would allow others to scrounge through.\u201cThe birds that are wintering down there are going to have to hunker down and deal with the conditions,\u201d he said.Just like the humans.Richard Fausset and Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Patricia Mazzei from New York.

{"Headline": "A.I. Has Arrived in Investing. Humans Are Still Dominating.", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachines are starting to take the place of the people who flip burgers, drive across town and, lately, manage stock portfolios.Artificial intelligence is taking on a bigger role in making investment decisions.A.I., including an ability to analyze data and actually learn from it, is considered useful in executing certain investing models, such as high-frequency trading, and in helping fund managers with tasks that rely on gathering and interpreting reams of information. Going a step further, an exchange-traded fund introduced in October uses A.I. algorithms to choose long-term stock holdings.It is to early to say whether the E.T.F., A.I. Powered Equity, will be a trendsetter or merely a curiosity. Artificial intelligence continues to become more sophisticated and complex, but so do the markets. That leaves technology and investment authorities debating the role of A.I. in managing portfolios. Some say it will only ever be a tool, valuable but subordinate to its flesh-and-blood masters, while others envision it taking control and making decisions for many funds.\u201cWe are just beginning to see a rise of the machines in investment management,\u201d said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University. Although, he said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to define what the markets will look like\u201d if human judgment is usurped, he predicted that \u201cin the end, it will be a good thing for investors.\u201dArtificial intelligence is a term that may be spoken more than understood. Many investment firms use software to sift through data and perform rudimentary analysis by following fairly simple rules. The programs can create portfolios by screening universes of stocks to select ones that meet criteria related to corporate results, valuation metrics or trading patterns, or by tweaking the proportions of the constituent companies in an index based on certain factors.Those programs may be useful, but they are not A.I. because they are static; they do the same thing over and over until someone changes them. A.I. involves machine learning, in which a program updates itself as new information comes in. Whatever goal the program was created to achieve remains the same, but the problem-solving tools it uses keep changing and reflect the sum of the information it has to work with.Large fund management companies like Fidelity and Vanguard say they use A.I. for a range of purposes, but they decline to be specific.BlackRock says it relies on it for heavy cognitive lifting, often by scouring data to tease out patterns that might remain obscure to human eyes and brains. Examples offered by Jessica Greaney, a company spokeswoman, include identifying and trying to exploit nonintuitive relationships between securities or market indicators, perusing social media \u201cto gain insights on employee attitudes, sentiment and preferences,\u201d and monitoring search engines for words being entered on particular topics, say cars or luxury goods.These algorithms play a supporting role in BlackRock\u2019s investing, Ms. Greaney said. Decisions on what to buy and sell are made by living, breathing managers.The A.I. Powered Equity E.T.F. is different. It uses algorithms to go the last mile and select its holdings, usually 30 to 70 stocks, said Art Amador, one of the founders of EquBot, the company that created the fund. He had the assistance of an I.B.M. program that fosters technology start-ups, and the E.T.F. runs most of its calculations on I.B.M.\u2019s Watson supercomputer.\u201cEquBot\u2019s A.I. tech mimics the investment process of an army of equity research analysts working around the clock,\u201d Mr. Amador said. \u201cIt has data on 6,000 companies, one million articles and filings a day, and data on market sentiment.\u201d Beyond sorting through that information and using its programming to ensure it has what it considers the optimal portfolio \u2014 the fund typically makes at least one trade every day \u2014 it constantly fine-tunes its stock-picking methods.Mr. Amador says that artificial intelligence has an edge over the natural kind because of the inherent emotional and psychological weaknesses that encumber human reasoning.\u201cWhen it comes to traditional portfolio management, managers are going to talk to analysts and sector specialists, but these people have biases and incentives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe algorithm doesn\u2019t have them.\u201dWhat it also doesn\u2019t have is a superior track record. Between Oct. 18, when it began trading, and the end of the year, the E.T.F. rose 3.1 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Amador attributed the underperformance to a normal variability in returns. The fund\u2019s programming beat the market when tested against historical data, he said, and he expects the same in real life as time passes.Others aren\u2019t so sure how effective A.I. will be when put in charge of otherwise ordinary funds. Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment firm Research Affiliates, noted that A.I. can process immense amounts of data; the flip side is that it needs immense amounts of data for the algorithms to learn.Certain activities, like high-frequency trading, process market information tick by tick and seek to profit from making numerous trades and holding positions for matters of hours or minutes. Compared with conventional investing, this sort of trading gives A.I. programs more data, Mr. Arnott said, but it is limited in scope to patterns related to stock price movements, not the broader economic and commercial landscape.When it comes to managing long-term portfolios, however, there are too many moving parts in financial markets for A.I. to get its mechanical head around, in his view, and too many humans with flaws, motivations and unpredictable behavior doing the moving. He says the markets are far more complex than the games like chess and backgammon that A.I. algorithms have mastered.Tim Clift, chief investment strategist at Envestnet PMC, a firm that helps build portfolios, said that while artificial intelligence can give managers an edge, it is \u201ca little gimmicky at this point.\u201d\u201cWe know the markets are irrational, especially in the short term,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the machines aren\u2019t going to know how to behave in that kind of environment.\u201dGregg Fisher, a portfolio manager at the Gerstein Fisher Funds, cautioned that A.I. programs could be stumped by off-the-wall and out-of-the-blue developments that have no obvious analogues in their databases.They learn \u201cby studying past patterns that they expect to continue,\u201d he said. Referring to the events that precipitated the global financial crisis, he wondered: \u201cHow would A.I. have observed and planned for that? The quantity of different things that can happen is seemingly unlimited.\u201dBut for advocates of A.I., like Mr. Harvey at Duke, the ability to gather data and put it to good use also seems to be unlimited. He expects great strides in machine learning in the decades to come, allowing A.I. to assume a major role in how funds are managed and by whom.\u201cLarger firms will be providing information to managers that other firms have no chance of getting\u201d because they can\u2019t afford the necessary data management systems, he said. The result will be \u201c15 to 25 investment management superpowers that can harvest all that data.\u201dMaybe so, but some investment professionals prefer to give the final say to portfolio managers who were born, not made.\u201cI\u2019m a fan of automating everything possible, but having a human being push the last button is still a good thing,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cHopefully, we all get better and better and smarter and smarter, but there\u2019s something comforting about having an informed human being with sound judgment at the end of the process.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Personal Finance for Those Who Don\u2019t Have a Clue", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfChelsea Fagan sets herself a high bar in writing \u201cThe Financial Diet\u201d (Henry Holt, $19): She wants to prove to people who know little about personal finance that investing is both vital and not all that difficult.Does she deliver?Yes, and surprisingly well. If you had to give her a grade, it would be a solid \u201cB\u201d because of both her supportive tone and her ability to reduce what can be fairly complicated concepts \u2014 such as how you put together a comprehensive investment plan \u2014 to easily understood bite-size pieces.For example, in explaining why not enough of her generation understands money, she writes: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that the information available about personal finance oscillates between a less fun version of your dad yelling at you about stocks and tone-deaf articles about how millennials are not buying homes. (It\u2019s because we have billions in dollars of student debt.)\u201d There is actually another word after the word \u201cdebt,\u201d but it is a noun that this paper won\u2019t publish unless it is spoken by a prominent politician.The design by Lauren Ver Hage, who gets billing on the cover, also helps make the book appealing by making important ideas and intriguing thoughts jump out. For example, this sentence gets its own page: \u201cThe scariest thing about buying a home, in a lot of ways, is that it requires you do a not-insignificant amount of math.\u201dSo many finance books are relentlessly masculine in tone and focus that it\u2019s worth mentioning that this one skews female: Most of the experts quoted are women, and many references, to television shows like \u201cSex and the City,\u201d appear to be oriented toward women, too. But her advice is universal.For example, she suggests saving a combined 20 percent of your income for both short and long-term goals. And, she notes, \u201cSaving, living below your means, and diversifying your income often make the difference between being stuck in a job you can\u2019t stand and having the freedom to move on to something better.\u201d These ideas apply to just about everyone.So why does she not get a higher grade? For two interrelated reasons that boil down to this: She seems to advocate putting too much money into investments that are too conservative for younger investors.The good news is Ms. Fagan is terrific about emphasizing the need to save. Early on, she creates \u201cA Bank Account Pyramid,\u201d explaining where to put the money and when, and she also makes saving money a significant part of a five-point plan that she describes as \u201cThe Total Idiot\u2019s Guide to Investing.\u201dBut if you look at both, it is easy to see the two problems.The pyramid starts out with a strong base: Have a basic savings account to house your emergency fund.But it gets shakier from there. In the next layer up, she calls for putting money in certificates of deposit, which are \u201cgood for things like saving to buy a house in the next few years and other medium-term savings.\u201dCertainly, you don\u2019t want your down payment to disappear in a market crash the day before the money is due. But having all your money tied up in low-yielding C.D.s for more than three years before you buy a home will make it hard for your money to grow. As I write this, a three-year C.D. yields about just 2.2 percent and a five-year one isn\u2019t much better, 2.6 percent. (Three to five years would seem to fit within Ms. Fagan\u2019s definition of medium-term savings.)So her argument about where to put money for medium-term objectives is debatable \u2014 my position would be to hold some stock, shifting the money to more conservative investments as your goal draws nigh. For example, have 100 percent of the money in equities when the goal is five years out; 60 percent in equities and 40 percent in short-term bond funds and C.D.s if you will need the money in 36 months, and only move all the money into short-term C.D.s a year before you have to write the check.Ms. Fagan goes on to say that after putting cash into an emergency fund and buying C.D.s for short and intermediate goals, the rest of your savings should be in \u201clonger term investments.\u201d Like what? She doesn\u2019t say. A 30-year bond would qualify, but it\u2019s an awfully conservative place for a millennial investor saving for the long-term.The same flaw exists in her investment guide. Her first two points are great. Again, it starts with the emergency fund, followed by working hard to pay off nondeductible debt. That is sound advice. But after that, things get squishy.Her third point about opening a retirement account is fine as far as it goes, but where do you put that money? Ms. Fagan doesn\u2019t tell us.And her last point is confusing. After taking the first three steps, she writes, \u201cExplore other low-risk options such as mutual funds and index funds.\u201d Now on the surface that\u2019s just wrong. Mutual funds and index funds that invest in equities, and bonds for that matter, have risk. As the prospectus of each always points out, you can lose money.Giving Ms. Fagan the benefit of the doubt, I think she was trying to say that index funds and other mutual funds carry less risk to your portfolio than investing in individual stocks.However, there are fixed- income mutual funds that offer low yields. Simply saying invest in mutual funds is not helpful.But to be fair, Ms. Fagan did not set out to write the definitive investment book, and she emphasizes throughout that if you are confused, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to pay professionals\u201d to help you with things \u201cyou don\u2019t know how to do and will put off until it\u2019s too late.\u201d These quibbles aside, for the most part her advice and conclusions are solid.\u201cWe live in a world that encourages us to spend wastefully, accumulate more than we need, and put off things like retirement saving until \u2026 we are basically retired,\u201d she says. \u201dAnything that can help improve matters is a good thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockchain or Blockheads? Bitcoin Mania Mints Believers and Skeptics", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssaySometimes life shows you what absurd really is. This is one of those times. I\u2019m talking about the phenomenon known as Bitcoin, a monetary system based on computation, complex algorithms and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 communal delusion.So what\u2019s the problem?Let me answer that question with a question: What do you know about tulips? Yes, I am referring to the Dutch tulip craze back in the 17th century, and the speculative bubble that preceded the stock market crash of 1929, and the dot-com boom and crash that started in the late 1990s. Remember that last one, when learned analysts told us that advancing technology had eliminated the business cycle?Good times. No bubble is too big to burst.But hey, no regrets! Carpe Bitcoin! (But not literally.)I called Christian Day, a professor at Syracuse University law school who has written about bubbles and panics. He said that comparing Bitcoin to the tulip craze was unfair to tulips: \u201cThe Dutch were not as crazy as they\u2019ve been portrayed.\u201dFor one thing, the tulip bulbs were real, he said, and the hybrids that were the subject of speculation could be extremely valuable. What\u2019s more, much of the trading was done by people who knew their horticulture. With the modern techno-tulips, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything there.\u201dSome of the most skeptical folks are experts in cryptography and computer security. Steven Bellovin, an adept in computer security and a professor at Columbia University, told me that the technology is still too buggy, \u201ca lab experiment that escaped into the wild.\u201d It\u2019s hard to trust a currency, he said, that\u2019s \u201cbacked by the full faith and credit of software that has to be updated monthly.\u201dOuch, currency guys. Well, you can afford some very expensive salves for those burns. For now.For another point of view \u2014 because I\u2019m all about even-handedness, people! \u2014 I checked with Jim Harper, executive vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and says the promise of Bitcoin is to create a payment system people can use anywhere in the world with privacy and security. He says its true value will be in commerce, not speculation.Well, that hasn\u2019t happened yet; the price is too unstable. He said the currency will move beyond some of the early notorious uses in illegal commerce. As for the tulip comparisons, he joked, \u201cLaugh all you want: My initial coin offering for cryptotulips will be worth billions!\u201dI have discovered that the cryptocurrency revolution has reached my own family. My 22-year-old son told me that he had tried to buy a bit of a Bitcoin a few weeks ago and actually lost the money. It was his cash to spend, so there was no lecturing him about it. But I did ask why he had tried to invest in Bitcoin when he\u2019s shown little interest in, say, mutual funds.He said that he had been unaware of the speculation in Bitcoin. Instead, he said, he was trying to use it for precisely what Mr. Harper says it will be best for: currency transactions with vendors who do not accept, for example, debit cards or PayPal.\u201cWhat I was actually trying to do was buy porn,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cFrom Japan.\u201dAs I said, he\u2019s a millennial, full of that generation\u2019s bracing honesty. I\u2019m glad he told me, but I sure don\u2019t need to know more about the particular transaction, except for the clarifying fact that this vendor would take Bitcoin.He said he followed the instructions and created a \u201cwallet\u201d and went to an exchange and, after entering a great deal of personal information, bought a small fraction of a bitcoin \u2014 in fact, 0.005 of one, \u201cthe lowest quantity you could purchase\u201d on the site. Then he found that he couldn\u2019t figure out how to get to his money, grew frustrated and gave up. Well, I told him, losing 70 bucks is hardly ruinous; it\u2019s more like the cost of an education.As we discussed the aborted transaction, he grabbed his laptop and took another look at the exchange site.\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI got in.\u201d A calmer state of mind had led to success.The result? \u201cI\u2019ve got 0.00545679 Bitcoin,\u201d he said, reading off the screen, \u201cwhich is now worth \u2026 $96.\u201d In the time the money had been locked up, it had jumped in value by about a third. \u201cThis has been a profitable evening!\u201dTell me about it. In sheer percentage terms, his little investment outperformed my 401(k)\u2019s return for an entire year.Now I am trying to figure out how to cash in on all of this, though without buying Bitcoin myself.

{"Headline": "A New Report on the Las Vegas Gunman Was Released. Here Are Some Takeaways.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Las Vegas police took the unusual step on Friday of releasing key details about the continuing investigation into the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others.Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news conference that while he was confident that Stephen Paddock was the only gunman, there was another person under investigation who is likely to be charged in the next two months. No charges will be filed against Mr. Paddock\u2019s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, Sheriff Lombardo said. He also said there was still no motive known for the attack.Investigators have uncovered extensive details about the internet search history on Mr. Paddock\u2019s computer, including child pornography, guidance on ballistics and information about SWAT team practices. Law enforcement officials believe Mr. Paddock had recently lost a \u201csignificant amount of wealth,\u201d and that may have led him to open fire from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.It was the first time Sheriff Lombardo had spoken publicly about the case in more than two months. He said investigators had reviewed more than 2,000 leads and 21,000 hours of video.\u201cI am going against normal protocols,\u201d Sheriff Lombardo said, adding that he hoped the preliminary report would \u201cquell the zest for information.\u201dThe report offers extensive details about Mr. Paddock\u2019s actions and planning in the time leading up to the attack. Here are some of the key takeaways:\u2022 Mr. Paddock \u201clived a seemingly normal life,\u201d the investigators wrote, based on numerous interviews with relatives and acquaintances. He began traveling internationally \u2014 usually alone \u2014 in 2012, going to Europe, Asia and South America, and he took cruises to the Bahamas, Mexico and Alaska.The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on Friday released its preliminary report into the killing of 58 people by a gunman opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October.\u2022 Mr. Paddock complained often to friends and family members about pain and fatigue. But the doctor who had been his primary care physician since 2009 said that the only major ailment he had was from a slip and fall at a casino in 2013, when he tore a muscle. The doctor told investigators that Mr. Paddock was \u201codd\u201d and showed \u201clittle emotion.\u201d While he believed Mr. Paddock may have had bipolar disorder, Mr. Paddock refused to discuss it or take antidepressants, though he did accept anti-anxiety medication. Mr. Paddock often refused to take medication, he said.\u2022 Over more than three decades \u2014 from 1982 through the fall of 2016 \u2014 Mr. Paddock bought 29 firearms, including handguns, shotguns and one rifle. Such purchases accelerated beginning in October 2016: He bought more than 55 firearms in less than a year, mostly rifles. He also bought more than 100 firearm-related items such as scopes, ammunition and bump stocks in the year before the attack.\u2022 Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock\u2019s demeanor changed during the last year \u2014 he became \u201cdistant\u201d and \u201ctheir relationship was no longer intimate.\u201d He became \u201cgermaphobic\u201d and had strong reactions to smells. During a stay at the Mandalay Bay in early September, Ms. Danley said he had behaved strangely, and constantly looked out the windows of the room and at the concert venue below from different angles.\u2022 Mr. Paddock appeared to begin thinking about a mass shooting last May, searching on Google for \u201csummer concerts 2017\u201d and \u201cbiggest open air concert venues in USA.\u201d In early September he searched for \u201cLas Vegas high rise condos rent\u201d and \u201clife is beautiful expected attendance,\u201d a reference to another large outdoor concert in Las Vegas that month. Two weeks later, he looked for \u201cswat weapons,\u201d \u201cballistics chart 308,\u201d \u201cSWAT Las Vegas,\u201d and \u201cdo police use explosives.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Paddock stayed in a room at the Ogden condominium complex on Sept. 17, during the Life is Beautiful music festival, requesting rooms that overlooked the downtown outdoor venue there. In video surveillance, Mr. Paddock could be seen taking several suitcases from his vehicle to his rooms. He was always alone and investigators so far \u201chave been unable to determine if Paddock intended an attack during this festival or if he used it as a means to plan a future attack,\u201d the report said.\u2022 On Sept. 25, Mr. Paddock checked into room 32-135 at the Mandalay Bay and checked into the room next door four days later, under Ms. Danley\u2019s name.\u2022 On his first night at the hotel, Mr. Paddock had dinner at a sushi restaurant inside the hotel and returned to the front desk with five suitcases. The next day, he took seven more suitcases up to his room with the bellman.\u2022 On Sept. 27, Mr. Paddock spent the entire night gambling, not stopping until 7 the next morning. The next day, he went to Mesquite and purchased a .308 bolt-action rifle, deposited $14,000 into a Wells Fargo account and transferred $50,000 to an account in the Philippines. He stopped at a gun range before going back to the hotel. He gambled through the night again. On Sept. 30, he brought four more suitcases to his room just before 6 a.m. and two additional one at 3:20 p.m.\u2022 On Oct 1., at about 10 p.m., a hotel security guard named Jesus Campos arrived on the 32nd floor to respond to an alarm set off by an open door to another room. He was shot a few minutes later, just after Mr. Paddock opened fire on the crowd below.videoAdvertisement"}

Delays in issuing federal checks, permits and licenses slow the rest of the economy\u2019s workings, affecting export and import permits, mortgages and small-business loans. A government funding crisis also casts a pall on the economy, damaging consumer sentiment and business optimism.Economic activity typically snaps back soon after a shutdown ends, but not before the partial stoppage damages growth.As a whole, shutdowns cost the economy at least 0.1 percentage point of growth per week, and probably much more, the Congressional Research Service surmised in a report in 2014. A separate report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of a larger analysis by the Congressional Research Service, found that lost hours worked by federal employees over the two weeks of the shutdown in 2013 accounted for a 0.3 percentage point drop in quarterly growth \u2014 by themselves.President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers estimates that every week of furloughing federal workers would reduce annual economic growth by 0.2 percentage point.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, affecting a wide range of government programs.Another shutdown would trim at least $6.5 billion a week from the nation\u2019s economic output, economists at Standard & Poor\u2019s suggested. \u201cA shutdown affects not only Washington and its employees, but also has ripple effects across sectors throughout the country \u2014 from shopping malls to national parks, from contractors to hotels,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at S.&P.Job recruiters worried that a shutdown could also slow hiring. \u201cWe face a very real risk of a national hiring hesitation, with recruiters putting plans on hold, and job movers opting to sit tight for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Doug Monro, a founder of the global job search engine Adzuna.And then there are the consequences for Wall Street.

Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said.

{"Headline": "With Davos Approaching, the Global Economy Is Surging, but Growth Could Stall", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld Economic ForumAlmost a decade after the financial crisis, economies in just about every corner of the world \u2014 the United States, Europe, even perennially sluggish Japan \u2014 are growing in unison.But can the expansion last?Many economists predict it will \u2014 at least into this year. But they also fret that unresolved problems embedded in the global economy, including income inequality and stagnant productivity, could hamper further gains and stall growth once again. As the world\u2019s business leaders gather this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confronting these issues will be high on the agenda.The World Bank forecasts that global growth this year will reach 3.1 percent, a slight improvement from its estimated 3 percent rate for 2017. That would be the fastest pace since the post-economic-crisis bump in 2011. While the world\u2019s advanced nations are expected to slow marginally, the World Bank projects emerging economies will gain speed, with 4.5 percent growth this year compared with an estimated 4.3 percent in 2017.The robust rebound has been a long time coming. Year after painful year after the Great Recession, policymakers and economists anticipated a stronger recovery that never came. Some economists speculated that the global economy had sunk into long-term stagnation. Bouts of turmoil, including debt woes that threatened the eurozone and financial panics in some emerging markets, added to the gloom.Last year, though, the world enjoyed what economists call a synchronized\u201d recovery among major economies. Joblessness has fallen, trade is strong, stock markets are soaring and, perhaps most important, companies have started to invest again, a key factor behind the improved global performance.Yet there is also some concern that the global growth rate may reach its peak next year. The World Bank foresees that growth of world gross domestic product will taper off in 2019, to 3 percent, and 2.9 percent in 2020.\u201cWe ended 2017 with a lot more momentum in the economy than we had expected,\u201c said Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC. \u201cMomentum is likely to slow through 2018.\u201dSome key regions of the world are already expected to slow this year, including the eurozone and Japan. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could lose steam, too. The government announced this month that growth reached 6.9 percent in 2017, but economists generally don\u2019t expect the economy to maintain that pace. The World Bank predicts a 6.4 percent expansion this year.Policymakers in China are facing the difficult task of overhauling the economy\u2019s growth model to rely more on household spending, which remains low compared with levels in other large economies. Traditionally, China has been propelled by high investment, but that has saddled the economy with too many factories in industries such as steel and a mounting burden of debt, now at about 260 percent of national output.Most economists do not expect China to tumble into a financial crisis, like other debt-heavy emerging economies have in the past. But Beijing\u2019s efforts to control the problem by curtailing the expansion of credit could dampen overall economic growth.That\u2019s not the only danger lurking on economists\u2019 radar. The recovery has been greased by the extremely supportive policies of the Federal Reserve in the United States and the central banks of the eurozone and Japan. But now, with improved growth, central bankers are expected to reduce these stimulus efforts, a move that could lead to higher interest rates.Unwinding these programs, which included the buying of bonds on a massive scale, will also be tricky, as any surprises could spook investors and depress prices of stocks and other assets. Economists generally say they do not anticipate that central banks will tighten enough to significantly drag on growth in the near term. But an unexpected jump in inflation, beyond current expectations, could prod them to constrain money more rapidly, possibly posing a bigger threat to growth.Concerns remain as well about a disruption to international trade, which would be especially damaging at the moment, because strong exports have boosted the current rebound. The worries center mainly on the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to renegotiate pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement and possibly take a tougher line on trade with China.What worries economists more, however, are long-term problems that continue to plague the world economy. Through global growth has improved, it still lags behind the pace before the financial crisis, when it increased at around 4 percent or more each year.Meager gains in productivity are probably the biggest headache for economists. Without stronger improvements, sustaining economic growth becomes far more difficult. Economists recommend greater investment in infrastructure, especially in the developing world, which can lower business costs and enhance efficiency, and education and job training, to increase the skills of workers.Another issue is widening income inequality within national economies. Not all segments of society are benefiting as they probably should from improved global economic performance.Even with unemployment rates plunging \u2014 in Japan, for instance, to a remarkable 2.7 percent \u2014 wage growth has still been tepid compared with past periods of economic expansion. Because poor families tend to spend additional income more readily than rich ones, the concentration of wealth at the top could be depriving economies of consumer spending.Ms. Henry of HSBC said she worried that the income amassed by the world\u2019s wealthiest might be getting invested in bonds, property or other assets rather than investments that could enhance productivity. \u201cAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t look like the savings of higher earners are going into productive investment,\u201d she said. Income inequality \u201cmay already be starting to have a negative impact on growth.\u201dDistorted labor markets, too, need fixing. Some countries, including India and parts of the Middle East, have labor laws that are so rigid that they discourage employers from increasing staff, condemning many workers to informal and often poorly paid jobs. Making it easier and less costly for managers to hire and fire would probably increase incomes and improve the productivity of labor.Mr. Devarajan of the World Bank worries that the robust economy may lead to complacency and delay such critical economic reforms. \u201cThe time to act may be now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the costs of not doing it could be very high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Gridlock Deepens in Congress, Only Gloom Is Bipartisan", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As lawmakers recover from a dispiriting government shutdown and prepare for President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday, Capitol Hill is absorbed with concern that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has pushed an already dysfunctional Congress into a near-permanent state of gridlock that threatens to diminish American democracy itself.The sense of gloom is bipartisan. A group of Republicans in the House and the Senate are warning of a secret plot in the F.B.I. to overthrow the Trump government. Democrats speak of corruption and creeping authoritarianism, unchecked by a Congress that has turned into an adjunct of the executive.And few lawmakers can muster a word of pride in their institution.\u201cThe Senate has literally forgotten how to function,\u201d said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine. \u201cWe\u2019re like a high school football team that hasn\u2019t won a game in five years. We\u2019ve forgotten how to win.\u201dSenator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, is no more sanguine. \u201cCongress is weaker than it has been in decades, the Senate isn\u2019t tackling our great national problems, and this has little to do with who sits in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth parties \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 are obsessed with political survival and incumbency.\u201dThe dysfunction has played out in ugly and puzzling ways. The three-day shutdown this month over immigration came and went so fast that even many Democrats saw no point in it. Last year\u2019s futile efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act soured many conservatives. Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping budget proposal to reorder government was simply ignored. And issues that both parties say they agree on \u2014 from raising military spending to banning \u201cbump stocks,\u201d which allow a semiautomatic weapon to fire like a machine gun \u2014 remain undone.To some Democrats, midterm elections this November that were once seen as a test for lunch-pail issues that could woo back white working-class voters are now seen as about nothing short of the future of pluralism and constitutional democracy.A Democratic victory would \u201cerect a barricade against Trump, against a dangerous, reckless president and what else he might do,\u201d said Representative David E. Price, Democrat of North Carolina, who taught political science at Duke University before coming to Congress in 1987. Democracy, he said, depends on checks and balances. \u201cThis is an absolutely critical test of whether we can do that.\u201dRepresentative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional law professor turned House member, echoed the sentiment.\u201cWe have a chaos presidency and a chaos Congress, and to oppose it, we need a politics that restores people\u2019s faith in public things, including Congress itself,\u201d Mr. Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said.Republicans have their own high stakes in November. Losing control of Congress, they say, could mean a highly politicized impeachment of their president. Worse still, a rising tide for Democrats in 2018 and 2020 could put the party in control of the redrawing of House district lines after the next census.Congress has long been polarized. Republicans complained bitterly of being frozen out of the big legislative pushes of the early Obama administration, not only the Affordable Care Act, but also the Dodd-Frank financial services law and other measures. It was Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader at the time, who first used the so-called nuclear option to end filibusters for administration nominees and most judicial ones.But Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, sees something new in the level of vitriol and hyperbole.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I think has only become more intense, more conspicuous, because of the outsize personality and idiosyncrasies of President Trump,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cIt has made Democrats feel that they are under a very heavy obligation to defend the norms and the institution. Republicans feel that Congress was elected with a mandate to bring about change, so what had been a kind of pre-existing edgy relationship has simply gone viral.\u201dFor most of the Obama presidency, Republican leaders were vexed by a dwindling center and an expanding group of hard-right lawmakers who would accept no negotiations with the Democratic president. That impediment to compromise has now been joined by a similar dynamic in the Democratic Party, where a visceral hatred of Mr. Trump on the left has empowered Democratic lawmakers to refuse to deal with the Republican president. The divide has been deepened as a half-dozen Democratic senators consider a White House run in 2020.If temperatures are to cool, the next few weeks could prove pivotal. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has promised a \u201cfair and open\u201d debate on immigration, while a new bipartisan coalition has emerged in the Senate to try to break a logjam. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, saw something hopeful in that development, a new willingness to go around the parties\u2019 feuding leaders.\u201cIf anything positive happened out of this past week, it\u2019s the fact that people are talking right now,\u201d he said.But if the effort fails, Congress might careen toward another fiscal showdown in February \u2014 and possibly another shutdown. Even if the Senate can agree to a bipartisan way to bolster border security and protect young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, the House would have to follow suit.One of the year\u2019s most crucial questions is shaping up to be whether Republican control of Congress can withstand all this dysfunction, or whether it will lead to a sweeping realignment of power in the midterm elections in November. The outcome will undoubtedly shape the second half of Mr. Trump\u2019s term.\u201cWhat we find in every state in the country is that people want Congress to hold the Trump administration accountable,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, who leads the committee charged with electing Democrats to the Senate. He added, \u201cCongress has been totally AWOL.\u201dFor Democrats, the dysfunction has made the quest to regain power more urgent. They argue that outside of a few moments of independence \u2014 the passage last summer of a Russia sanctions bill opposed by Mr. Trump, for example, and statements by a few Republican senators like Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2014 Republicans have shown themselves unwilling to challenge Mr. Trump and his administration.\u201cAmong the gravest disappointments of this year was not finding out how awful a president Donald Trump has turned out to be, but rather how docile the Congress has been,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. \u201cThe most important thing people can do right now who are concerned about the direction of the Congress is change the majority in Congress. That\u2019s the single most important thing we can do right now for the health of the democracy.\u201dRepublicans fiercely contest Democrats\u2019 assessment. They take pride in having passed a tax overhaul written by lawmakers \u2014 as opposed to the White House \u2014 and say they have continued to investigate the election meddling despite Mr. Trump\u2019s clear opposition. There is nothing wrong, they argue, with Republicans\u2019 advancing an agenda they share with the White House and have long waited to enact.\u201cIf we were really in the tank for Trump, we wouldn\u2019t even be doing this investigation,\u201d said Representative Tom Rooney, Republican of Florida, who is helping to lead the Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia-related work. \u201cIt would have been much easier not to.\u201dFor the moment, Congress simply needs to show it can perform its most basic function: controlling the government\u2019s purse. The fiscal year began on Oct. 1, but for four months, the government has been functioning on short-term stopgap spending bills that provide no reordering or new direction to government programs.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more basic than the power of the purse, and there\u2019s no more systemic failure than what we\u2019ve had for years: not to exercise that power in an orderly and prescribed way,\u201d Mr. Price, the North Carolina Democrat, said.The latest round of continuing resolutions, or C.R.s, as the stopgap spending laws are known on Capitol Hill, has infuriated Democrats and Republicans alike. The one adopted on Monday \u2014 which will fund the government until Feb. 8 \u2014 was the fourth since September.\u201cWe keep trying to claim victories on both sides and talk about who is going to be blamed,\u201d Mr. Rooney said. \u201cIn the meantime, we are just living in C.R. hell. I don\u2019t think people out there care that this side or another side was able to jam the other side. This is all just posturing for 2018. In the meantime, we don\u2019t govern.\u201dNeither chamber of Congress works as it was intended. Representative Rick Nolan, a Minnesota Democrat who was first elected to Congress in 1974, left for 30 years, and then won election again in 2012, noted that bills once went to the floor, were open for amendment, then passed after input from both parties. Now, leaders bring fully formed legislation to the floor with little or no opportunity to change it.\u201cThe complaint I am registering is not just voiced by Democrats. Republicans feel the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not get elected to Congress for photo ops. They have almost relegated members of Congress to become middle-level telemarketers dialing for dollars.\u201dIn the Senate, business is so rushed that Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, complained that many of the newer senators are unaware of the chamber\u2019s most basic rules.\u201cWe don\u2019t do enough legislation on the floor to give them experience with how to pass a bill,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.Tom Daschle, a former Democratic Senate majority leader, lamented that the dysfunction might be permanent.\u201cI worry about whether or not it\u2019s reversible, the loss of norms and the loss of institutional process and the lack of institutional memory,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt that there are more than a handful of senators today who have really experienced what regular order feels like.\u201dThe shutdown last week produced a nascent effort at pushback: a bipartisan group calling itself the Common Sense Coalition has been meeting in the office of Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of the last centrists in the Senate. While passing around a Masai talking stick to discourage talking over one another, the senators provided their leaders a blueprint for reopening the government. Now they are working to come up with a bipartisan immigration bill.\u201cThat\u2019s indicative of how bad it\u2019s gotten \u2014 that you need rump groups in the Senate to do anything, and often they fail,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cIt so happens they succeeded this time, but the bar was kind of low, which was to open the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Worst and the Dumbest", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike millions of people around the world, I was reassured to learn that Donald Trump is a \u201cVery Stable Genius.\u201d You see, if he weren\u2019t \u2014 if he were instead an erratic, vindictive, uninformed, lazy, would-be tyrant \u2014 we might be in real trouble.Let\u2019s be honest: This great nation has often been led by mediocre men, some of whom had unpleasant personalities. But they generally haven\u2019t done too much damage, for two reasons.Second, our system of checks and balances has restrained presidents who might otherwise have been tempted to ignore the rule of law or abuse their position. While we\u2019ve probably had chief executives who longed to jail their critics or enrich themselves while in office, none of them dared act on those desires.But that was then. Under the Very Stable Genius in Chief, the old rules no longer apply.In other words, just one year of Trump has moved us a long way toward a government of the worst and dumbest. It\u2019s a good thing the man at the top is, like, smart.Meanwhile, what about constraints on presidential misbehavior? Hey, checks and balances are just so 1970s, you know? Republicans may have cared about unlawful actions by the president during Watergate, but these days they clearly see their job as being one of protecting the V.S.G.\u2019s privileges, of letting him do whatever he wants.Count me among those who found the revelations from the new Michael Wolff book not all that shocking, because they just confirm what many reports have told us about this White House. The really important news from last week, as I see it, involved indications that leading Republicans in Congress are increasingly determined to participate in obstruction of justice.In other words, even as much of the world is questioning Trump\u2019s fitness for office, the only people who could constrain him are doing their best to place him above the rule of law.So far, the implosion of our political norms has had remarkably little effect on daily life (unless you\u2019re living in hurricane-battered Puerto Rico and still waiting for electricity thanks to an inadequate federal response). The president spends his mornings watching TV and rage-tweeting; he has wreaked havoc with the government\u2019s competence and his party doesn\u2019t want you to know if he\u2019s a foreign agent. Yet stocks are up, the economy is growing and we haven\u2019t gotten into any new wars.But it\u2019s early days. We spent more than two centuries building a great nation, and even a very stable genius probably needs a couple of years to complete its ruin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Stock Market Too Quiet for Its Own Good?", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rare calm has settled over the stock market. Whether it turns out to be the one before the storm is a compelling question after a year of conditions so placid that investing has begun to look deceptively simple.The peaceful trading backdrop helped the S.&.P 500 rise 19.4 percent on the year and 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Factoring in dividend payments and additional appreciation from the reinvestment of those dividends in the constituent companies\u2019 stocks, the index returned 6.6 percent in the quarter and 21.7 percent throughout 2017. And, despite some rumblings in the bond market, stocks moved even higher in the early days of 2018.But the drastically reduced trading volatility, a condition sometimes called metastability, worries some Wall Street strategists.It\u2019s not just that persistent buying has sent stocks to valuations exceeded only on a few occasions that preceded spectacular plunges. Billions of dollars have been committed to vehicles that seek to profit from the extraordinary degree of stability and depend on it persisting. If and when things change, the storm after the calm could be sudden and violent.\u201cIncreasingly, people of a certain age who have seen enough cycles say, \u2018We\u2019ve been here before. We know the party\u2019s going to end,\u2019\u201d said Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cIt won\u2019t end well.\u201dThe year ended well for domestic stock funds, with the average one in Morningstar\u2019s database gaining 5 percent in the fourth quarter and 18.3 percent on the year. Portfolios that focus on technology, natural resources and economically sensitive consumer issues were especially strong in the quarter. Health care and real estate funds were noticeably weaker.A stock market that never goes down except by a negligible amount \u2014 at least lately \u2014 has been widely perceived as less risky. Vehicles known as risk-parity funds seek to capitalize on the lack of price swings by allocating more money to stocks as volatility diminishes. Mutual funds that employ risk-parity strategies held about $8.6 billion at the end of 2017, according to Morningstar.But nothing lasts forever. When the metastability ends and volatility returns to more normal levels, risk-parity funds will view stocks as riskier and begin to take their bets off the table. The more sudden the return of volatility, the faster the funds will sell. If it happens quickly enough, the market could go from metastable to not at all stable, turning a virtuous circle vicious.\u201cThe whole thing could unravel very quickly,\u201d Ms. Patterson said, although she is merely concerned, not alarmed.\u201cWe don\u2019t see enough red flashing lights to get out,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we see yellow caution lights.\u201dFor Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, the hue is more crimson.\u201cI see risk preference shifting significantly to risk taking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe low-volatility trade is characteristic of a euphoric market.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cThere are uncertainties present in global markets, and investors are also ignoring how highly valued equities are. They don\u2019t seem to care. In terms of what the equity market is telling you, they have no concern that a problem or a massive correction lies ahead. They think central banks will save them.\u201dThe bond market is sending a more unsettling message, Mr. Sri-Kumar warned. Despite steady and stronger economic growth in recent quarters and low unemployment, yields on long-term Treasury securities haven\u2019t risen very much, even as short-term rates continue higher. That combination has led the yield curve, or the difference between short and long rates, to flatten.The yield on two-year Treasury issues at the end of December was 0.51 percentage points below 10-year Treasury yields, close to the narrowest spread in 10 years. The spread has widened slightly but if the yield curve should invert, pushing short-term rates above long-term ones, it would be an ominous sign, because an inverted curve often heralds a recession.\u201cIt\u2019s very instructive that the bond market is giving a completely opposite story,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt has gone from being somewhat cautious to excessively cautious. I think it will invert over the next few months.\u201dThe average bond fund rose 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.8 percent on the year.\u201cThe fixed-income rally still has a way to run,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted. \u201cIf we do have a massive stock market correction, we will see the 10-year Treasury and investment-grade bonds going down in yield.\u201dHe would reduce holdings of stocks and focus on defensive sectors and foreign markets, and he would allocate as much as 20 percent of a portfolio to cash.The low volatility and overvaluation in the stock market have lasted a long time and might do so until a catalyst arises. That could be the continuing shift in Federal Reserve policy that kept short-term interest rates close to zero percent for nine years and led the central bank to buy trillions of dollars of bonds in its quantitative easing program.The Fed has already raised rates five times in the last two years, including in December, and it announced in September that it would begin selling the bonds in its enormous inventory. The impact of such changes on the markets could depend on what investors focus on: how much support the Fed continues to provide, or how quickly it is removing support.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, cautioned in a note to clients that while economic conditions may seem close to ideal, small changes could threaten that benign outlook.\u201cPerhaps we are in the early stages of a melt-up similar to the late stages of past bull markets,\u201d Mr. Paulsen wrote. \u201cHowever, several economic and financial market indicators are on the cusp of eye-catching levels, which could shatter the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 scenario.\u201d Long-term Treasury yields in early December were 0.25 percentage points below three-and-a-half-year highs, for instance; wage and consumer price inflation were near multiyear highs; and unemployment was a couple of tenths of a percentage point from 50-year lows.One recent development that caught the eyes of investors was the most sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code since the 1980s, including a drastic reduction in corporate income tax rates. But there are other matters of policy and politics that could send stocks lower if a more aggressive Fed does not.Mr. Sri-Kumar advised investors to \u201cwatch for a possible cancellation of Nafta in the first quarter.\u201d If the North American Free Trade Agreement is torn up, American multinationals may face retaliation abroad.\u201cThe rising risk of a trade war will be a more important factor to consider for 2018 than any positive impact of the corporate tax cut,\u201d he said.Concern that American stocks may be expensive and accident-prone is sending some investors packing. Foreign stocks comfortably outpaced their American counterparts during 2017 when returns are expressed in dollars.The SPDR S.&P. 500 exchange-traded fund rose 19.4 percent last year, while iShares MSCI EAFE, which tracks foreign developed markets, rose 23.8 percent, and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets gained 35.2 percent.The average international stock mutual fund was up 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 25.9 percent for the year. Specialists in China and India rose more than 40 percent on average for 2017.The comparative strength overseas \u201chas probably got to do with the starting points in terms of valuations and interest rates,\u201d said Benjamin Beneche, one of the managers of the AMG Managers Pictet International fund. American stocks are so expensive that, even with the recent underperformance, they remain considerably more expensive than foreign shares.At the end of the year, the S.&P. 500 E.T.F. traded at 22.7 times the earnings of the constituent companies over the preceding 12 months, according to Morningstar. Valuations were 17.5 times earnings for the EAFE fund and 14.4 times for the emerging markets E.T.F.Jeremy Richardson, a portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management, attributed the strength abroad to evidence that President Xi Jinping was consolidating power in China; recent increases in commodity prices, which help the many emerging economies that export them; and \u201ca firming of economic growth, in Europe in particular, amid some signs of central bank and fiscal policy taking hold.\u201dHis advice for investors scouting around for foreign assets is \u201cto emphasize equities because they\u2019re better in the long run\u201d and \u201cto pay close attention to the quality of companies you\u2019re buying.\u201dMr. Richardson finds particularly good opportunities in cloud computing, where \u201cthe size of the market is underappreciated by most investors,\u201d and businesses related to electric transportation, such as battery and motor manufacturers.Mr. Beneche likes the auto industry, too, but the old-fashioned one.\u201cThere\u2019s a myopic focus on electric vehicles and ride sharing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe electric transition might take longer than people are expecting.\u201d He especially likes companies that make parts for cars already on the road, such as Hyundai Mobis.Other niches he favors include Asian consumer technology companies like SoftBank, Alibaba and JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce business, and businesses with a large controlling shareholder, such as Vivendi and Richemont.Ms. Patterson is less sanguine about foreign stocks. She said much of the outperformance has been caused by a weak dollar, which raises the value of foreign assets. She expects the dollar to recover and prefers American stocks, particularly technology issues. Nevertheless, the risks that have lain dormant have persuaded her to remain well diversified in bonds, foreign stocks and gold, which has \u201ckind of been left for dead.\u201dThe stock market has had plenty of life in it, even if trading has not been lively. For Ms. Patterson, \u201cthe base case is that Goldilocks continues,\u201d she said, meaning conditions will be just right, with low inflation and benign central bank policies. But with that outlook ubiquitous on Wall Street, as implied in the eerie calm in the stock market, she is reluctant to state her case too strongly.\u201cThe idea that the party will continue for quite a long time is creating more risk-taking, and that\u2019s what worries me more than anything else right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWill this year be more of the same, or will a big bear come out and ruin us?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Market Isn\u2019t Bullish for Everyone", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHardly a day goes by without President Trump tweet-bragging about the relentless rise of the stock market to fresh record highs \u2014 Exhibit A in his mind about how he is, indeed, making America great again.But, while strong equity markets are certainly a Good Thing, let\u2019s not forget that, like so many effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, those higher share prices are propelled upward in considerable measure by the new president\u2019s pro-business policies and benefit the wealthy far more than the average American.The unsurprising reality is that the rich are far more likely to hold stocks, and when they do, they own them in much larger chunks than their less-well-off brethren.The percentage of Americans who hold any stocks at all has declined to just over half of all Americans, while only 28 percent of families with below-median incomes hold any shares (including in retirement accounts). Moreover, while middle-class Americans typically own just $15,000 in equities, the top 10 percent have amassed median holdings of $365,000.To be sure, rising stock markets help many Americans in other ways. Perhaps most importantly, they secure pension benefits for those fortunate enough to participate in corporate or municipal plans.However, the percentage of workers covered by these programs has been declining, from 62 percent in 1983 to 17 percent in 2016. Only about 22 percent of Americans below the median even have an individual retirement account.While we can speculate about the future, for the moment, anyway, job growth has been slower under the new president than it was under President Obama. In 2017, the economy added a total of 2,055,000 jobs, the lowest number since 2010.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump omitted to mention any effect that the rising stock market has had on incomes \u2014 perhaps because there hasn\u2019t been a discernible one.From when he took office through the end of November, average hourly wages rose by just 0.6 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Even before taking account of higher prices, earnings were up by only 2.3 percent last year post-inauguration, a fraction of the 17.3 percent gain in share prices during the same time period.Similarly, last year\u2019s 4 percent increase in house prices \u2014 while satisfying \u2014 is only a fraction of the jump in stocks.While Mr. Trump would be hard-pressed to show much benefit for his base from soaring equities, I\u2019m prepared to give him at least partial credit for higher stock prices.That\u2019s because his administration is engaged in a giveaway to corporate America. Yes, we needed to reform our business tax code to compete with countries like Britain, which lowered its corporate tax rate to 19 percent in 2017 from 30 percent in 2007. But the estimated benefit of $600 billion will go straight to the bottom line of corporate America, and anticipation of this has clearly fueled share prices.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has declared open season on regulations that the business community says are impediments to growth (meaning profitability).So, for example, the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 fresh with two new Trump appointees \u2014 has begun reversing major Obama-era rules that favored workers and organized labor, while the Interior Department just rescinded an Obama rule limiting hydraulic fracking in oil and gas fields.I\u2019m appalled that so much of the good work of the Obama administration is being unwound. Investors see it differently: Every regulation that is emasculated or eliminated produces more profit potential for the companies that were subject to the regulation.Nonetheless, even with that tail wind, the jump in our market only roughly parallels global market indexes and pales in comparison with last year\u2019s results in Japan and emerging markets like China.Remarkably, in 2017, the world achieved its highest growth rate \u2014 3 percent \u2014 since 2011, and economists believe the world is on track for another strong year in 2018.It\u2019s hard to imagine that even Mr. Trump would claim credit for Europe\u2019s tantalizing break out of its decade of malaise or for the renewed optimism that China, India and other major developing countries will continue their rapid growth.Yet, Mr. Trump\u2019s braggadocio is so unabashed that one shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a tweet contending that China should thank him for its roaring economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Says It\u2019s a New Era. Wall Street Isn\u2019t Buying It.", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight months after taking over as chief executive of Ford Motor, Jim Hackett is still trying to accomplish one of his most important tasks: convincing Wall Street that he has a compelling plan to reinvigorate the automaker.Mr. Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of the office-furniture supplier Steelcase, has taken several shots at it. In October, he and the new team of top executives he selected appeared before financial analysts in New York to outline a plan to cut costs \u2014 improve Ford\u2019s \u201cfitness,\u201d in Mr. Hackett\u2019s words \u2014 and to accelerate development of trucks, electric cars and self-driving vehicles.He pressed his case further this month before large audiences at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and the Detroit auto show.But so far investors and analysts remain uninspired. The company\u2019s stock is virtually unchanged since late September, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained 13 percent.\u201cFord is basically saying, \u2018We have a lot of inefficiencies, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time to fix,\u2019\u201d said David Whiston, a financial analyst at Morningstar. \u201cI thought a lot of these inefficiencies were taken care of a long time ago. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201dThe latest disappointment arrived on Wednesday, when Ford reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share. That was an improvement over a loss in the comparable period a year ago, but its adjusted earnings were 39 cents a share, about 4 cents less than analysts expected.Profit fell in North America as sales slowed in the United States, and the company lost about $200 million in the rest of the world. Sales in China fell 6 percent.The company forecast a decline in earnings this year, mainly as a result of rising commodity costs and unfavorable exchange rates. Ford also said it would have higher costs related to the introduction of new models \u2014 23 are coming this year globally, compared with 11 in 2017.\u201cWe need to be fitter,\u201d said Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks.Mr. Shanks told reporters that he didn\u2019t think analysts were unconvinced about Ford\u2019s turnaround plan. \u201cWith the exception of Tesla, the market is skeptical about the sector\u2019s ability to be successful in the world that\u2019s ahead of us\u201d he said.In a conference call, analysts pressed Mr. Hackett to talk about initiatives to improve profitability, but he declined to discuss them in detail, except to say they are \u201cup and running.\u201dJust a few years ago, Ford was considered the healthiest of the three Detroit automakers, having escaped the government-engineered bankruptcies that engulfed General Motors and Chrysler. With Alan Mulally as chief executive, Ford slimmed down, focused on its Ford and Lincoln brands, and roared to record profits.After Mr. Mulally retired in 2014 and passed the baton to Mark Fields, however, Ford began to drift as new technologies started reshaping the industry; as new challengers emerged in Tesla, Google and Uber; and as a revived G.M. and a merged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles provided increased competition in the high-margin business of trucks and roomy sport-utility vehicles. Its stock slumped, and Ford directors began wondering if Mr. Fields had the right strategy.Mr. Hackett took three months to dive into Ford\u2019s troubles and found that Ford was spending too much time and money developing new vehicles, and that costs for steel, other materials and components were rising. His prescription called for Ford to refocus investments on growing markets like China and highly profitable vehicles like trucks and S.U.V.s, while cutting back on initiatives in less promising areas like Europe and passenger cars.\u201cWe are intensely focusing on fixing the fundamental health of our company,\u201d Mr. Hackett said on Wednesday.To ensure that Ford will be a player down the road, the company is also ramping up plans to introduce 40 electrified vehicles by 2022 and a driverless car for taxi fleets, ride-hailing services and delivery companies by 2021.At the Detroit show, Ford said it planned to spend $11 billion on electric vehicles by 2022.\u201cIt was very philosophical,\u201d said Mr. Whiston, who was in the audience. \u201cHe might be appealing to a nonautomotive audience, but financial analysts want more.\u201dMore troubling to Wall Street is that Ford\u2019s new strategy is likely to have little immediate impact on its bottom line.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients issued before Ford reported its fourth-quarter results that \u201cthe path ahead in shifting Ford\u2019s strategy will be rather long.\u201dG.M. has been ahead of Ford in adding trucks and S.U.V.s to its lineup. At the Detroit show, Ford unveiled a midsize pickup truck, the Ranger. G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands have had midsize trucks for nearly three years.\u201cThere was a really stark contrast between Ford and G.M. presentations\u201d given to financial analysts at the show, Mr. Whiston said. \u201cG.M. was all about optimism, and Ford talked about fitness and efficiency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Janet Yellen\u2019s Fitting Finale: Fed Plans to Stand Still", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman, will preside over her final policymaking meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday where, in a fitting finale, the Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged as the economy continues to gain strength.Ms. Yellen\u2019s four-year tenure has been defined by her campaign to stimulate job and wage growth by holding interest rates at low levels for much longer than markets had expected.Her patience was rewarded: Unemployment steadily declined while inflation remained low.\u201cYellen had the uncharted territory of getting an economy going with low inflation,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, a former Fed economist who is now chief United States economist at UBS. Mr. Powell, he said, \u201cis going to be in a very different world: Fiscal stimulus when you\u2019re already at full employment.\u201dAnalysts and investors are unruffled by the impending departure of Ms. Yellen and installation of Mr. Powell. They have accepted Mr. Powell\u2019s assertions during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the Fed\u2019s current approach to monetary policy.\u201cThe way I think about it is, Jay Powell will be a reassuring force of continuity,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management.The Fed has made clear that the January meeting will be a place holder, not least because of the transition in leadership, and markets have taken the message. The headline on Morgan Stanley\u2019s preview of the January meeting: \u201cWhere\u2019s the Snooze Button?\u201dBut markets are equally convinced that the Fed will tighten policy for the sixth straight quarter at its next policy meeting in March, which will be Mr. Powell\u2019s first meeting as the chairman.Ms. Yellen\u2019s priority was ensuring that the Fed did not raise rates too quickly; Mr. Powell could face the challenge of making sure that the Fed does not move too slowly.Fed officials said as they embarked on the tightening process that they wanted to avoid the mechanical predictability of the previous tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006. Like the proverbial frog in the stovetop pot, investors found it easy to ignore the slow and steady increases.But the Fed, wary of surprising markets, has once again fallen into a pattern of carefully signaling each rate hike \u2014 and markets, once again, are largely unconcerned. The ease of borrowing has increased over the last year, according to measures of financial conditions.\u201cThey said that policy was too gradual and predictable\u201d during the last tightening cycle, said Mr. Reinhart, who played a key role in the last round of rate increases when he was head of the Fed\u2019s division of monetary affairs. \u201cAnd now it is predictable and gradual and even slower.\u201dUnder Ms. Yellen, the unemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent from 6.7 percent in February 2014, while inflation has remained below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. During the first three years of her tenure, in particular, Ms. Yellen repeatedly found reasons to argue that the Fed should delay raising interest rates, extending the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.There were plenty of critics along the way. A coalition of labor and community groups, the Fed Up campaign, pressed Ms. Yellen throughout her term to increase the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign. Republicans and conservative economists fretted that the Fed was doing too much.Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, said that the persistence of low interest rates had been painful for banks and other financial firms, many of which also resented Ms. Yellen\u2019s focus on strengthening financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye, good luck from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s don\u2019t let the door hit you on the backside on your way out.\u201dEleanor Herlands, a 92-year-old retiree in Stamford, Conn., said that she and other savers had suffered during the long years of low interest rates.\u201cThey pushed people to buy stocks, people that knew nothing about the stock market,\u201d said Mrs. Herlands, who opted instead to keep her money in savings accounts. \u201cI made my own choices, but I never dreamed that it would go on this long. Now I\u2019m pleased that I\u2019m finally getting at least a little relief.\u201dShe said she was now earning an average of 1.6 percent on her accounts.Ms. Yellen, 71, is the first person in modern history to serve a four-year term as Fed chairman without being appointed to a second term. She has not said what she plans to do next.She leaves behind some challenges for her successor.Fed officials in recent months have begun to debate whether the central bank should adjust its approach to monetary policy before the next downturn. The Fed\u2019s traditional approach is to stimulate growth by reducing interest rates. But rates, which reflect real borrowing costs and inflation, are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future.The current economic expansion also is approaching the end of its ninth year, one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth in American history.Some forecasters say they can see clouds on the horizon, though a little squinting is required.Oliver Jones, markets economist at Capital Economics, predicted the Fed\u2019s march toward higher interest rates may finally begin to pinch financial markets by the second half of the year \u2014 just as the stimulus provided by the tax cuts is beginning to fade.\u201cAs growth in the U.S. economy starts to slow, we think that the long-running rally in the U.S. stock market will go into reverse,\u201d Mr. Jones wrote in his predictions for 2018. He added, \u201cHistory suggests that a correction in the U.S. stock market would be contagious, even if growth in the rest of the world generally remains healthy as we expect.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
